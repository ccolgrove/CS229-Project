'''Stanley Kubrick''' (July 26, 1928&amp;nbsp;â March 7, 1999) was an American film director, writer, producer, and photographer who lived in England during most of the last four decades of his career. Kubrick was noted for the scrupulous care with which he chose his subjects, his slow method of working, the variety of genres he worked in, his technical perfectionism, his reluctance to talk about his films, and his reclusiveness. He maintained almost complete artistic control, making movies according to his own whims and time constraints, but with the rare advantage of big-[[Movie studio|studio]] [[financial support]] for all his endeavors.

Kubrick's films are characterized by a formal visual style and meticulous attention to detail. His later films often have elements of surrealism&lt;ref name=&quot;HallKubrick&quot;&gt;[[#HallKubrick|Hall (no date).]] Online at: [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/459560/index.html Kubrick, Stanley (1928â1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; and expressionism and often lack structured linear narrative. His films are frequently described as slow and methodical, and are often perceived as a reflection of his obsessive and perfectionist nature. He worked in a wide variety of genres: science-fiction, horror, period piece and war film. However, there are recurring themes in all his works, notably man's inhumanity to man. While often viewed as expressing an [[irony|ironic]] [[pessimism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycBrittan&quot;&gt;[[#EncycBrittan|EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica.]] Online at: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324290/Stanley-Kubrick Stanley Kubrick (American director)]&lt;/ref&gt; some critics feel his films contain a cautious optimism when viewed more carefully.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice2008&quot;&gt;[[#Rice2008|Rice 2008.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film that first brought him attention from many critics was ''[[Paths of Glory]]'', the first of three films of his about the dehumanizing effects of war. Many of Kubrick's movies initially met with lukewarm reception, only to be acclaimed years later as masterpieces that had a seminal influence on later generations of filmmakers. Considered groundbreaking was ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', noted for being one of the most scientifically realistic and visually innovative science-fiction films ever made while also maintaining an enigmatic non-linear storyline. He voluntarily withdrew his film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' from Great Britain, after it was accused of inspiring copycat crimes which in turn resulted in threats against Kubrick's family. Authors Anthony Burgess (eventually) and Stephen King (immediately) were unhappy with Kubrick's adaptations of their novels ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' respectively; both authors became involved with subsequent stage or TV adaptations. His films were largely successful at the box office, although ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' performed poorly in the United States. All of Kubrick's films from the mid-1950s onward, except ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTAs. Although he was nominated for an Academy Award as a screenwriter and director on several occasions, his only personal win was for the special effects in ''2001: A Space Odyssey''.

Even though all his films, apart from the first two, were adapted from novels or short stories, his works have been described by Jason Ankeny and others as &quot;original and visionary&quot;. Although some critics, notably Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael, frequently disparaged Kubrick's work,&lt;ref&gt;Kael was fond of Kubrick's early work up to and including ''Lolita'' but consistently disparaged all his subsequent films.&lt;/ref&gt; Ankeny describes Kubrick as one of the most &quot;universally acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era&quot; with a &quot;standing unique among the filmmakers of his day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ankeny&quot;&gt;[[#Ankeny|Ankeny (no date).]] Online at: [http://www.allmovie.com/artist/stanley-kubrick-98221/bio Stanley Kubrick: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Background===
Stanley Kubrick was born on July 26, 1928, at the Lying-In Hospital in [[Manhattan]], New York, the first of two children born to Jewish parents, Jacques (Jacob) Leonard Kubrick (1901â85) and his wife Sadie Gertrude (''nÃ©e'' Perveler; 1903â85). His sister, Barbara Mary Kubrick, was born in 1934. Jacques Kubrick, whose parents and paternal grandparents were Jewish of Austrian, [[Romania]]n and Polish origin,&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 6.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Stanley-Kubrick-s-photographs-brought-to-life-by-Jane-and-Louise-Wilson/16943 |author=[[Louisa Buck]]|title=Stanley Kubrick's photographs brought to life by Jane and Louise Wilson|publisher=''The Art Newspaper''|date=February 11, 2009|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a doctor. At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in [[The Bronx]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SKBVL&quot;&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 524.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick biographer Geoffrey Cocks writes that although Kubrick descended from Eastern European Jews, and was raised in a Jewish neighborhood in New York City, his family was not religious, although his parents had been married in a Jewish ceremony.&lt;ref name=Cocks&gt;Cocks, Geoffrey. ''The wolf at the door: Stanley Kubrick, history, &amp; the Holocaust'', Peter Lang Publishing (2004) pp. 22â25, 30&lt;/ref&gt; When critic [[Michel Ciment]] asked him in 1980 whether he had a religious upbringing, Kubrick replied &quot;No, not at all.&quot; He had no [[bar mitzvah]] and apparently did not attend synagogue, although after his death, both his daughter and wife stated that &quot;He did not deny his Jewishness, not at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cocks/&gt; His daughter noted that he wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, to have been called [[Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects#Aryan Papers|''Aryan Papers'']], and spent years researching the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/features/unmade-stanley-kubrick/6.asp &quot;Unmade Stanley Kubrick: Aryan Papers&quot;], Empire Online&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his friends and early photography and film collaborators were Jewish, and his first two marriages were to daughters of recent Jewish immigrants from Europe.&lt;ref name=Cocks/&gt; British screenwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], who worked closely with him in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick's films was partly because he &quot;had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars,&quot;&lt;ref name=Cocks/&gt; noting that it was &quot;absurd to try to understand Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cocks/&gt; He points out, nonetheless, that when Kubrick died, &quot;few of the obituaries mentioned that he was a Jew.&quot;&lt;ref name=Raphael&gt;Raphael, Frederic. ''Eyes Wide Open: A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick'', Ballantine, 1999 pp. 107â108&lt;/ref&gt;

A friend of Kubrick's family notes that although his father was a prominent doctor, &quot;Stanley and his mom were such regular people. They had no airs about them. . . . His mother was so down-to-earth, she was lovely.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 24.]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he was considered &quot;bookish&quot; and generally uninterested in activities in his Bronx neighborhood. According to a friend, &quot;When we were teenagers hanging around the Bronx, he was just another bright, neurotic, talented guyâjust another guy trying to get into a game with my softball club and mess around with girls . . .&quot;&lt;ref name=Cocks/&gt; Many of his friends from his &quot;close-knit neighborhood&quot; would become involved with his early films, including writing music scores and scripts.&lt;ref name=Cocks/&gt;

===Adolescence===
Kubrick's father taught him [[chess]] at age twelve, and the game remained a lifelong obsession.&lt;ref name=&quot;SKBVL&quot;/&gt; Kubrick later recalled the significance of his chess hobby to his career: &quot;I used to play chess twelve hours a day. You sit at the board and suddenly your heart leaps. Your hand trembles to pick up the piece and move it. But what chess teaches you is that you must sit there calmly and think about whether it's really a good idea and whether there are other, better ideas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 19.]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also bought his son a [[Graflex]] camera when he was thirteen, triggering a fascination with [[photography|still photography]]. As a teenager, Kubrick was interested in [[jazz]], and briefly attempted a career as a drummer.&lt;ref name=&quot;SKBVL&quot;/&gt; His father was disappointed in his failure to achieve excellence in school, which he felt Stanley was capable of. His father encouraged him to read from his large library at home while at the same time permitting him to take up photography as a serious hobby.  These additional interests outside of school may have contributed to his poor performance as a student.&lt;ref name=Cocks/&gt;

Kubrick attended [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|William Howard Taft High School]] from 1941 to 45. He was a poor student, with a meager 67 [[Grade Point Average|grade average]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwam2000&quot;&gt;[[#Schwam2000|Schwam 2000, p. 70.]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to his English teacher, Kubrick was not a great student, and school didn't interest him. However, &quot;the idea of literature and the reading of literature, from a non-academic, from a more human point of view, clearly was what interested him. He was a literary guy even as a young man . . . &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 23.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick also had a poor attendance record, and often skipped school to take in double-feature films.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated any hopes of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of education in general, maintaining that nothing about school interested him.&lt;ref name=&quot;SKBVL&quot;/&gt; His parents sent him to live with relatives for a year in Los Angeles in the hopes that it would help his academic growth.

[[File:KubrickForLook.jpg|thumb|Kubrick as a ''Look'' magazine photographer in 1949]]
While still in high school, he was chosen as an official school photographer for a year. In 1946, since he was not able to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) and then left.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 33.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he sought jobs as a freelance photographer, and by graduation, he had sold a photographic series to ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine. Kubrick supplemented his income by playing chess &quot;for quarters&quot; in [[Washington Square Park]] and various [[Manhattan]] chess clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1999|Baxter 1999, p. 32.]]&lt;/ref&gt; He became an apprentice photographer for ''Look'' in 1946, and later a full-time staff photographer. (Many early [1945â50] photographs by Kubrick have been published in the book ''Drama and Shadows'' [2005, Phaidon Press] and also appear as a special feature on the 2007 Special Edition DVD of ''2001: A Space Odyssey''.)

During his ''Look'' magazine years, Kubrick married [[Toba Metz]] (b. January 24, 1930) on May 29, 1948. They lived together in [[Greenwich Village]]. During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the cinemas of New York City. He was inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of director [[Max OphÃ¼ls]], whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style, and by director [[Elia Kazan]], who he described as America's &quot;best director&quot; at that time, with his ability of &quot;performing miracles&quot; with his actors.&lt;ref name=Ciment2&gt;Ciment, Michel. ''Kubrick: The Definitive Edition'', Faber and Faber, Inc. (1980; 1999)p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
====Early work====
In 1951, Kubrick's friend Alex Singer persuaded him to start making short documentaries for ''The March of Time'', a provider of newsreels to movie theatres. Kubrick agreed, and shot the independently financed ''[[Day of the Fight]]'' in 1951. The film notably employed a reverse [[tracking shot]], which would become one of Kubrick's signature camera movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul2003_&quot;&gt;[[#Paul2003|Paul 2003, pp. 25, 46, 62.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=XBQi4cCEYNIC&amp;pg=PA25 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick is said to have sold ''Day of the Fight'' to [[RKO Radio Pictures]] for a profit of $100,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn2006_&quot;&gt;[[#Dunn2006|Dunn 2006, p. 84.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QLc5oWuTIMcC&amp;pg=PA84 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; although Kubrick himself claimed he lost $100.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bernstein, Interview With Stanley Kubrick, 1966. Take 27, about 16&amp;nbsp;minutes into Tape 27 side A&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at ''Look'' magazine and began working on his second short documentary, ''[[Flying Padre]]'' (1951), funded by RKO. A third short film, ''[[The Seafarers]]'' (1953) was filmed just after his first feature ''Fear and Desire'' to recoup costs. It was a 30-minute promotional film for the Seafarers' International Union and was Kubrick's first color film. These three films constitute Kubrick's only surviving work in the documentary genre, although it is believed that he was involved in other shorts which have been lostâmost notably ''[[World Assembly of Youth (film)|World Assembly of Youth]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thuss2002_&quot;&gt;[[#Thuss2002|Thuss 2002, p. 110.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=FLNEwpF4s3EC&amp;pg=PA110 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as second unit director on an episode of the ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' television program about the life of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. None of these shorts have been officially released, though they have been widely bootlegged and clips are used in the documentary ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]''.

====''Fear and Desire''====
Kubrick moved to narrative feature films with ''[[Fear and Desire]]'' (1953), the story of a team of soldiers caught behind enemy lines in a fictional war. Kubrick and his then-wife, Toba Metz, were the only crew on the film, which was written by Kubrick's friend [[Howard Sackler]]. ''Fear and Desire'' garnered respectable reviews but was a commercial failure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Later in life, Kubrick was embarrassed by the film, which he dismissed as an amateur effort. He refused to allow ''Fear and Desire'' to be shown at retrospectives and public screenings and did everything possible to keep it out of circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1997|Baxter 1997, p. 56.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=PKMZ4_i60LYC&amp;pg=PA56 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; At least one copy remained in the archives of the film printing company, and the film subsequently surfaced in bootleg copies.

====''Killer's Kiss''====
Kubrick's marriage to Toba Metz ended during the making of ''Fear and Desire''. He met his second wife, Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer [[Ruth Sobotka]], in 1952. They lived together in New York's East Village from 1952 until their marriage on January 15, 1955. They moved to Hollywood that summer. Sobotka, who made a cameo appearance in Kubrick's next film, ''[[Killer's Kiss]]'' (1955), also served as art director on ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' (1956). Like ''Fear and Desire'', ''Killer's Kiss'' is a short feature film, with a running time of slightly more than an hour. A [[film noir]] about a young heavyweight boxer at the end of his career, it met with limited commercial and critical success.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Both ''Fear and Desire'' and ''Killer's Kiss'' were privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philips2001&quot;&gt;[[#Philips2001|Philips 2001, p. 190.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=iOU9bIlnPHIC&amp;pg=PA190 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Philips1999&quot;&gt;[[#Philips1999|Philips 1999, p. 127.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=cVFly8avlXIC&amp;pg=PA127 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Killing''====
Alex Singer introduced Kubrick to a young producer named [[James B. Harris]], and the two became close friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1999|Baxter 1999, p. 70.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their business partnership, Harris-Kubrick Productions, would finance three out of the next four Kubrick pictures. The two bought the rights to the [[Lionel White]] novel ''Clean Break'', which Kubrick and co-screenwriter [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] turned into ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'', which tells the story of a meticulously planned racetrack robbery gone wrong. Starring [[Sterling Hayden]], ''The Killing'' was Kubrick's first full-length feature film shot with a professional cast and crew. The story is told using a non-linear narrative, an unusual device for 1950s American cinema, and was imitated nearly 40 years later in the film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] acknowledged Kubrick's film as a major influence, even referring to ''Reservoir Dogs'' as &quot;my ''Killing''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarantino_Lucas&quot;&gt;[[#Tarantino Lucas|Lucas (no date).]] Online at: [http://classicfilm.about.com/od/movieslistsbydirector/tp/Classics_Influenced_Tarantino.htm 7 Classic Movies that Influenced Quentin Tarantino: Horror, Suspense, Film Noir â and Plenty of Laughs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2006 186&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Howard|title=Crime Wave: The Filmgoers' Guide to the Great Crime Movies| publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2006|location=London|page=186|isbn=1845112199, 9781845112196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SleeperTarantino&quot;&gt;[[#SleeperTarantino|Sleeper 1997.]] Online at: [http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue03/features/tarantino1.htm la Fiction du Pulp: Tarantino's trail of bread crumbs leads to the French New Wave]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Killing'' followed many of the conventions of film noir, in both its plotting and cinematography style. The genre peaked in the 1940s, but many critics regard this film as one of its best.&lt;ref&gt;Online: [http://www.stanleykubrick.de/eng.php?img=img-l-6&amp;kubrick=newsletter09-eng Stanley Kubrick Exhibition. Newsletter no. 9, October 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;
While it was not a financial success, it received good reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roud1980_562&quot;&gt;[[#Roud1980|Roud 1980 p. 562.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=xehkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22apparently+unassuming+%27B%27+feature+that+critics+love%22&amp;dq=%22apparently+unassuming+%27B%27+feature+that+critics+love%22&amp;ei=6zLHSI7gLpCkjgHKten2Cw&amp;pgis=1 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pathsofglory3.jpg|thumb|Long before it became widely practiced in films, Kubrick portrayed war as brutal, using stark black-and-white images in ''Paths of Glory''. This became far more common after the Vietnam era, although prior war films such as ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' had similar imagery.]]
The widespread admiration for ''The Killing'' brought Harris-Kubrick Productions to the attention of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].&lt;ref name=&quot; Scribner2001&quot;&gt;[[#Scribner2001|Jackson et al 2001.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=7QsOn9_NviAC&amp;pg=PA322 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; The studio offered them its massive collection of copyrighted stories from which to choose their next project. During this time, Kubrick also collaborated with [[Calder Willingham]] on an adaptation of the Austrian novel ''The Burning Secret''. Although Kubrick was enthusiastic about the project, it was eventually shelved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson2000&quot;&gt;[[#Nelson2000|Nelson 2000, p. 260.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=wabgZNgT9OgC&amp;pg=PA260 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Paths of Glory''====
Kubrick's next film ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' was set during [[World War I]] and based on [[Humphrey Cobb]]'s 1935 antiwar novel of the same name. It follows a French army unit ordered on an impossible mission by their superiors. As a result of the mission's failure, three innocent soldiers are unduly charged with cowardice and sentenced to death. [[Kirk Douglas]] starred, and was instrumental in securing financing for the production. The film was not a significant commercial success, but it was critically acclaimed and widely admired within the industry, establishing Kubrick as a major up-and-coming young filmmaker. Critics have praised the film's unsentimental, spare, and unvarnished combat scenes and its raw, black-and-white cinematography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denby2008&quot;&gt;See for example: [[#Denby2008|Denby 2008.]] Online at: [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/notebook/2008/03/31/080331gonb_GOAT_notebook_denby The First Casualty]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] has named this one of his favorite Kubrick films.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpielbergInterviews2001_82&quot;&gt;[[#SpielbergInterviews2001|Friedman, Lester, and Brent Notbohm, p. 82.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=5E80Tv7F3zIC&amp;pg=PA82 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the production of ''Paths of Glory'' in [[Munich]], Kubrick met and romanced young German actress [[Christiane Harlan]], who played a small role in the film. Kubrick divorced Sobotka in 1957, and married Harlan in 1958. They remained together until his death in 1999.

===1960s===
Upon his return to the United States, Kubrick worked for six months on the [[Marlon Brando]] vehicle ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961). The two clashed over a number of casting decisions, and Brando eventually fired him and decided to direct the picture himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1999|LoBrutto 1999, p. 164.]]&lt;!-- I have not checked page 164, but other biographies back this up --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick worked on a number of unproduced screenplays, including ''Lunatic at Large'', which Kubrick intended to develop into a movie,&lt;ref name=&quot;Haut2002&quot;&gt;[[#Haut2002|Haut 2002, p. 125.]]&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Kirk Douglas]] asked him to take over Douglas' epic production ''[[Spartacus (1960 film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) from [[Anthony Mann]], who had been fired by the studio two weeks into shooting.

====''Spartacus''====
Based upon the true story of a doomed uprising of Roman slaves, ''Spartacus'' was a difficult production. Creative differences arose between Kubrick and Douglas, and the two reportedly had a stormy working relationship.

It won four Oscars including an award for [[Peter Ustinov]] for his turn as the slave dealer Batiatus, the only actor to win one under Kubrick's direction. But the film's embattled production convinced Kubrick to find ways of working with Hollywood financing while remaining independent of its production system, which he called &quot;film by fiat, film by frenzy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern2002&quot;&gt;[[#Southern|Southern, Terry 2002, p. 74.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=Nu8GefPL46QC&amp;pg=PA74 Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Lolita''====
[[File:KubrickLolita2.jpg|thumb|Kubrick was forced for censorship reasons to tone down the film's overt sexuality, which he hinted at both verbally and visually through gestures and double entendres. Here (in a scene not in the novel), Humbert plays chess with Lolita's mother, Charlotte, who says &quot;You're going to take my Queen&quot;, followed by Humbert's reply &quot;That was my intention&quot; while Lolita kisses stepfather Humbert goodnight. Chess was a favorite motif of both novelist Vladimir Nabokov and Stanley Kubrick. Critic Tom Nelson argues the whole film is metaphorically a &quot;cinematic chess game&quot;, embodying themes of &quot;deception and enchantment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kubrick, inside a film artist's maze (revised edition) |last=Nelson |first=Thomas Allen |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253213908, 9780253213907 |page=79 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1962, Kubrick moved to England to film ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'', and would live there for the rest of his life. His original motivation was to film ''Lolita'' in a country with laxer censorship laws. Kubrick had to remain in England to film ''Dr. Strangelove'' since divorce proceedings prevented Peter Sellers from leaving the country, and the filming of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' required the [[Shepperton Studios]] sound stages for their large capacity, the likes of which was unavailable in America. It was after filming the first two of these films in England and in the early planning stages of ''2001'' that Kubrick decided to settle there permanently.

''Lolita'' was Kubrick's first film to generate major controversy,&lt;ref name=&quot;BogdanTimes&quot;&gt;[[#BogdanTimes|Bogdanovich 1999.]] Online: [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E6DD113AF937A35754C0A96F958260&amp;scp=17&amp;sq=stanley%20kubrick%20lolita&amp;st=cse What They Say About Stanley Kubrick]&lt;/ref&gt; as it adapted a highly controversial [[Lolita|book]], by Russian-American novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] (already notorious as an &quot;obscene&quot; novel and a ''[[cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre]]'', given its theme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/10/lolita.html | title=Lolita â From Nabokov's Novel (1955) to Kubrick's Film (1962) to Lyne's (1997) |author=Constantine Santas |date=September 2000 |publisher=Senses of Cinema |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) about an affair between a middle-aged professor named Humbert Humbert ([[James Mason]]) and his twelve-year-old stepdaughter. The difficult subject matter was referenced in the film's famous [[tagline]], &quot;How did they ever make a film of ''Lolita''?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LolitaTaglines&quot;&gt;[[#LolitaTaglines|IMDb.]] Online: [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056193/taglines Lolita (1962) â Taglines]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its release, Kubrick realized that to get a [[Production Code]] seal, the screenplay would have to downplay the book's provocativeness by treading lightly with its theme. Kubrick tried to make some elements more acceptable by omitting all material referring to Humbert's lifelong infatuation with &quot;nymphets&quot; and possibly ensuring Lolita looked like a teenager. James Harris, Kubrick's co-producer and uncredited co-screenwriter of ''Lolita'' decided with Kubrick to raise Lolita's age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lolita_HarrisInterview&quot;&gt;[[#Lolita HarrisInterview|Harris 2002.]] Online: [http://www.hollywoodfiveo.com/archive/issue2/exclusive/harris/harris.htm Lolita at 40: Producer James B. Harris. The Five-0 Interview].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kagan|Kagan pp. 82, 83.]] &quot;He couldn't dramatize Humbert's erotic relationship with the nymphet.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Kubrick had liaised with the censors during production and it was only &quot;slightly edited&quot;, in particular removing the eroticism between Lolita and Humbert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul2003_79&quot;&gt;[[#Paul2003|Paul 2003, pp. 79â80.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=XBQi4cCEYNIC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the novel's more sensual aspects were toned down in the final cut, leaving much to the viewer's imagination. Kubrick would later say that had he known the severity of the censorship he would face, he probably would not have made the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1997|LoBrutto 1997 p. 225.]] &quot;he told ''Newsweek'' in 1972 in referring to the censorship restrictions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick originally engaged Nabokov to adapt his own novel for the screen. The writer first produced a screenplay 400 pages long, which he then reduced to 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aragay&quot;&gt;[[#Aragay|Aragay 2006, p 113.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=HqvBDYpaqsYC&amp;hl=en Google Books link].&lt;/ref&gt; Nabokov estimated that only 20% of his work made it into the final screenplay written by Kubrick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coyle1980&quot;&gt;[[#Coyle1980|Coyle 1980, p. 46.]] Online: [http://books.google.com/books?id=omlZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pgis=1 Google Books link].&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kubrick's most notable changes from the book was to expand the character of Clare Quilty, played by [[Peter Sellers]]. Kubrick had the character of Quilty masquerade as various people, enabling Sellers to employ multiple accents, a talent Kubrick would employ again in ''Dr Strangelove'' in which Sellers played three separate roles.

Critical reception of the film was mixed; many praised it for its daring subject matter, while others were surprised by the lack of intimacy between Lolita and Humbert. Andrew Sarris panned it in ''The Village Voice'' for being miscast and too restrained;&lt;ref&gt;Village Voice July 5, 1962 p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; it was also poorly reviewed in London's ''The Observer'' and by Eric Rhode on BBC Television News.&lt;ref&gt;The Listener and BBC television review, Volume 68 (1962) p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was highly praised by Pauline Kael in ''The New Yorker'', though she later became one of Kubrick's harshest critics. Recent reviews of the film in conjunction with its DVD release have been overwhelmingly positive. The film received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Sue Lyon]], who played the title role, won a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Newcomer. Film critic [[Gene Youngblood]] holds that stylistically, ''Lolita'' is a transitional film for Kubrick, &quot;marking the turning point from a naturalistic cinema...to the surrealism of the later films.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Youngblood&quot;&gt;[[#Youngblood|Youngblood 2008.]] Online: [http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/836 Lolita]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick's next project, ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), became a [[cult film]], especially famous for its anti-war message, and is now considered a classic. It is a satire on the hawkish American advocates of use of the atomic bomb, as embodied in the character of renegade General Jack D. Ripper, who leads an unauthorized nuclear attack on Russia. The film prefigured the antiwar sentiments which would become explosive only a few years after its release. [[Roger Ebert]] called it the best [[satirical film]] ever made.&lt;ref name=&quot;EbertStrangelove &quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990711/REVIEWS08/907110301/1023 |title=Dr. Strangelove (1964)|author=Roger Ebert|date=July 11, 1999|work=rogerebert.com |accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplayâbased upon the novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'', by ex-RAF flight lieutenant [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]] (writing as Peter Bryant)âwas co-written by Kubrick and George, with contributions by American satirist [[Terry Southern]]. ''Red Alert'' is a serious, cautionary tale of accidental atomic war. However, Kubrick found the conditions leading to nuclear conflict so absurd that the story became a sinister, macabre comedy.&lt;ref name=&quot; InternationalDictonary1984&quot;&gt;[[#InternationalDictonary1984|Lyon and Doll 1984, p. 126.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once re-conceived, Kubrick recruited Terry Southern to polish the final screenplay.

[[Peter Sellers]], who had played a pivotal part in ''Lolita'' and had appeared in several previous films in multiple roles, was hired to play four roles in ''Dr. Strangelove''. He eventually played three, due to an injured leg and his difficulty in mastering bomber pilot Major &quot;King&quot; Kong's Texas accent. Due to Sellers' relative obscurity in the US at the time, most American viewers did not initially realize he was playing three roles, all with very different accents and appearances. Kubrick later called Sellers &quot;amazing&quot;, but lamented the fact that the actor's manic energy rarely lasted beyond two or three takes. Kubrick ran two cameras simultaneously and allowed Sellers to improvise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LoBrutto1997|LoBrutto 1997 pp. 206, 239, 242]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Strangelove'' earned four Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director) and the New York Film Critics' Best Director award.

====''2001: A Space Odyssey''====
[[File:Star Gate.JPG|thumb|left|The &quot;StarGate&quot; sequence, one of many ground-breaking visual effects in ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. It was primarily for these that Stanley Kubrick won his only personal [[Oscar award]].]]
Kubrick spent five years developing his next film, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). The film was conceived as a [[Cinerama]] spectacle and was photographed in [[Super Panavision 70]]. The $10,000,000 (U.S.) film was a massive production for its time. It is famous for its groundbreaking visual effects, minimal use of dialogue and its use of classical music instead of an original score. It was also noted for its scientific realism in depicting space flight as well as its slightly surreal and enigmatic narrative. The former was achieved through extensive consultation with NASA personnel who also helped design the look and feel of the spacecraft. Kubrick also used music by contemporary avant-garde Hungarian composer GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti; it was the first wide commercial exposure of Ligeti's work. Although not initially a critical and commercial success, the film became quickly popular with the counter-culture youth movement of the 1960s, who were especially enchanted by the &quot;psychedelic&quot; and mysterious nature of the film's closing sequence of astronaut David Bowman's journey through the &quot;Stargate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'' wrote an article about the film's popularity with the Woodstock counter-culture in late 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The film's ambiguous ending continues to fascinate contemporary audiences and critics. After this film, Kubrick would never experiment so radically with special effects or narrative form; however, his subsequent films would still maintain some level of ambiguity.

Kubrick co-wrote the screenplay with science fiction writer Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]], expanding on Clarke's short story &quot;[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]&quot;. The visual effects were overseen by Kubrick and engineered by a team that included a young [[Douglas Trumbull]], who would become famous in his own right as an effects technician. Kubrick extensively used traveling [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] photography to film space flight, a technique also used nine years later by [[George Lucas]] in making ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', although that film also used motion-control effects unavailable to Kubrick at the time. Kubrick made innovative use of [[slit-scan photography]] to film the Stargate sequence. The film also featured the most extensive use of [[Front projection effect|front-screen projection]] to date in the ''Dawn of Man'' sequence, for which Kubrick designed a special high-resolution front-screen projector.

The film opened in widescreen [[Cinerama]] and initially toured as a &quot;roadshow&quot; picture, with program booklets sold in the lobbies of the theatre. Although it eventually became an enormous success, the film was not an immediate hit. Initial criticism attacked the film's lack of dialogue, slow pacing, and seemingly impenetrable storyline.&lt;ref&gt;Renata Adler of the ''New York Times'' called it &quot;[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04E6DA1530EE3BBC4C53DFB2668383679EDE somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring]&quot; and Pauline Kael in ''The New Yorker'' called it &quot;monumentally unimaginative&quot;and &quot;a disaster because it is much too abstract to make its abstract points&quot;. Her review is anthologized in her collection ''For Keeps''. John Simon called in &quot;a shaggy god story&quot; in ''New Leader''&lt;/ref&gt; One of the film's few defenders was [[Penelope Gilliatt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliatt_2001&quot;&gt;[[#Gilliatt 2001|Gilliatt 1968.]] Online: [http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q22.html After Man [review of ''2001: A Space Odyssey''&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; who called it (in ''[[The New Yorker]]'') &quot;some kind of a great film&quot;. However, word-of-mouth among young audiences (especially the 1960s [[counterculture]] audience) made the film an eventual hit. Despite nominations in the directing, writing, and producing categories, the only [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Academy Award]] Kubrick received was for supervising the film's special effects.

In spite of initial negative critical reaction, many today consider it among the greatest [[science fiction film]]s ever made,&lt;ref name=&quot;AFITop10&quot;&gt;[[#AFITop10|American Film Institute.]] Online: [http://www.afi.com/10top10/scifi.html AFI's 10 Top 10]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of the most influential. &lt;ref&gt;For example this essay at the [http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Social/2001/SH8.htm US Centennial of Flight Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Spielberg called it his generation's &quot;big bang&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2002&quot;&gt;[[#Carr2002|Carr 2002, p. 1.]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a staple on All Time Top 10 lists.&lt;ref name=&quot;BFITop10&quot;&gt;[[#BFITop10|British Film Institute.]] Online at: [http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics.html BFI Critic's Top Ten Poll].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===

====''A Clockwork Orange''====
After ''2001'', Kubrick initially attempted to make a film about the life of [[Napoleon]]. When financing fell through, Kubrick searched for a project that he could film quickly on a small budget. He settled on ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971). His adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' [[A Clockwork Orange|novel of the same name]] is an exploration of violence in human society. It takes place in a futuristic Great Britain that is both authoritarian and chaotic, and stars [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Alex De Large, a [[hooligan]] who gleefully beats, robs, and rapes without remorse. After landing in prison, Alex undergoes an experimental medical aversion treatment, known as the [[Ludovico technique]], that inhibits his violent tendencies, though he has no real free moral choice. The movie hints that the promotion of the treatment is politically motivated, and Alex becomes a pawn in a political game. Kubrick's vision makes comparisons between the left and right ends of the political spectrum, with characters drawn from each extreme, ultimately suggesting that there is little difference between the two. He stated, &quot;They differ only in their dogma. Their means and ends are hardly distinguishable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ciment1982Clockwork &quot;&gt;[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick photographed ''A Clockwork Orange'' quickly and almost entirely on location in and around London. Despite the low-tech nature of the film as compared to ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', Kubrick showed his talent for innovation; at one point, he threw &quot;an old Newman Sinclair clockwork mechanism camera&quot; off a rooftop in order to achieve the effect he wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;StrickHouston1972&quot;&gt;[[#StrickHouston1972|Strick and Houston 1972.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0070.html Interview with Stanley Kubrick regarding A Clockwork Orange]&lt;/ref&gt; For the score, Kubrick enlisted electronic music composer [[Wendy Carlos]] to adapt famous classical works (such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] Ninth Symphony) for the [[Moog synthesizer]]. It is pivotal to the plot that the lead character, Alex, is fond of classical music, and that the brainwashing Ludovico treatment accidentally conditions him against it. As such, it was natural for Kubrick to continue the tradition begun in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' of using classical music in the score. In ''A Clockwork Orange'', classical music accompanies scenes of violent mayhem and coercive sexuality. Both [[Pauline Kael]] (who generally disliked Kubrick's work after ''Lolita'') and Roger Ebert (who often praises Kubrick) found Kubrick's use of juxtaposing classical music and violence in this film unpleasant, Ebert calling it a &quot;cute, cheap, dead-end dimension,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EbertClockwork&quot;&gt;[[#EbertClockwork|Ebert 1972.]] Online at: [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720211/REVIEWS/202110301/1023 A Clockwork Orange]&lt;/ref&gt;
and Kael, &quot;self-important.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kael1972&quot;&gt;[[#Kael1972|Kael 1972.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0051.html Stanley Strangelove]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was extremely controversial because of its explicit depiction of teenage gang rape and violence, and was issued with an [[motion picture rating systems|X rating]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/event-59108-a-clockwork-orange-40th-anniversary-screening-with-malcolm-mcdowell.html |title=A Clockwork Orange 40th Anniversary Screening With Malcolm McDowell|work=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]] |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in the same year as ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' and  ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', and the three films sparked a debate in the media about the social effects of cinematic violence.{{cn|date=November 2011}} The controversy was exacerbated when copycat crimes were committed in England by criminals wearing the same costumes as characters in ''A Clockwork Orange.'' British readers of the novel noted that Kubrick had omitted the final chapter (also omitted from American editions of the book) in which Alex finds redemption and sanity. After receiving death threats to himself and his family as a result of the controversy, Kubrick took the unusual step of removing the film from circulation in Britain. It was unavailable in the United Kingdom until its re-release in 2000, a year after Kubrick's death, although it could be seen in continental Europe. The Scala cinema in London's Kings Cross showed the film in the early 1990s, and at Kubrick's insistence, the cinema was sued and put out of business.&lt;ref name=&quot;AspectScala&quot;&gt;[[#AspectScala|Aspect Press Release.]] Online at: [http://www.ziogiorgio.com/viewnews.php?id=16006 Aspect delivers passion to Scala]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1973, Kubrick re-released ''A Clockwork Orange'' to cinemas in the United States with footage modified so that it could get its rating reduced to an R. This enabled many more newspapers to advertise it, since in 1972 many newspapers had stopped carrying any advertising for X-rated films due to the new association of that rating with pornography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constock2007&quot;&gt;[[#Comstock2007|Comstock 2007.]] Online: [http://www.theintenttoarouse.com/?p=70 How âX-ratedâ became synonymous with âporn,â and the death of movie making for grown-ups.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, a documentary entitled ''Forbidden Fruit'', about the censorship controversy, was released in Britain. Kubrick was unable to prevent the documentary makers from including footage from ''A Clockwork Orange'' in their film.

====''Barry Lyndon''====
[[File:Barry12.jpg|thumb|left|Special lenses were developed for ''Barry Lyndon'' to allow filming using only natural light.]]
Kubrick's next film, released in 1975, was ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'', an adaptation of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (also known as ''Barry Lyndon''), a [[picaresque novel]] about the adventures and misadventures of an 18th-century Irish gambler and social climber. The cinematography and lighting techniques Kubrick used in ''Barry Lyndon'' were highly innovative. Most famously, interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] camera lens originally developed for [[NASA]]. This allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm |title=Two Special Lenses for &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; |author=Ed DiGiulio |publisher=American Cinematographer  |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its two predecessors the film does not have an original score. Irish traditional songs (performed by [[The Chieftains]]) are combined with classical works from the period by Bach and others.

Reviewers such as Pauline Kael, who had been critical of Kubrick's previous work,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kael1972&quot;/&gt; found ''Barry Lyndon'' a cold, slow-moving, and lifeless film. Its measured pace and lengthâmore than three hoursâput off many American critics and audiences, although it received positive reviews from [[Rex Reed]] and [[Richard Schickel]]. ''TIME'' magazine published a cover story about the film, and Kubrick was nominated for three Academy Awards. The film as a whole was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, more than any other Kubrick film. Despite this, ''Barry Lyndon'' was not a box office success in the U.S., although the film found a great audience in Europe, particularly in France. The French journal of film criticism, ''[[Cahiers du cinÃ©ma]]'', included ''Barry Lyndon'' at 67 on its top 100 list of all-time films.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cahiersducinema.com/imprime.php3?id_article=1337 {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most of Kubrick's films, ''Barry Lyndon'''s reputation has grown through the years, particularly among filmmakers. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] has cited it as his favorite Kubrick film. Steven Spielberg has praised its &quot;impeccable technique&quot;, though, when younger, he famously described it &quot;like going through the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]] without lunch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SpielbergInterviews2001_36&quot;&gt;[[#SpielbergInterviews2001|Friedman, Lester, and Brent Notbohm 2000, p. 36.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, production designer [[Ken Adam]], who had worked with Kubrick on ''Dr. Strangelove'' and ''Barry Lyndon'', asked Kubrick to visit the recently completed 007 Stage at [[Pinewood Studios]] to provide advice on how to light the enormous soundstage, which had been built and prepared for the James Bond movie ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''. Kubrick agreed to consult when it was promised that nobody would ever know of his involvement. The agreement was honored until after Kubrick's death in 1999, when in 2000 it was revealed by Adam in a documentary on the making of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.

===1980s===

====''The Shining''====

[[File:SteadicamDanny.jpg|thumb|right|Kubrick's film was the second to make notably innovative use of the [[Steadicam]], which can track motion smoothly without a dolly track.]]

The pace of Kubrick's work slowed considerably after ''Barry Lyndon'', and he did not make another film for five years. ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', released in 1980, was adapted from the [[The Shining (novel)|novel]] of the same name by bestselling horror writer [[Stephen King]]. The film stars [[Jack Nicholson]] as Jack Torrance, a failed writer who takes a job as a winter caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel. He lives there with his wife, Wendy (played by [[Shelley Duvall]]) and their young son, Danny (played by [[Danny Lloyd]]), who is gifted with a form of [[telepathy]]. As winter takes hold, the family's isolation deepens, and the demons and ghosts of the Overlook Hotel's dark past begin to awaken, driving Jack into a homicidal [[psychosis]].

In order to convey the claustrophobic oppression of the haunted hotel, Kubrick made extensive use of the newly invented [[Steadicam]], a weight-balanced camera support, which allowed for smooth hand-held camera movement in scenes where a conventional camera track was impractical. Although used for some scenes in a few previous motion pictures, Garrett Brown, Steadicam's inventor, was closely involved with this production and regarded it as the first picture to fully employ the new system's potential.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, G. (1980) The Steadicam and The Shining. American Cinematographer, August, 61 (8), pp. 786â9, 826â7, 850â4. Reproduced at [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm ''The Kubrick Site''] without issue date or pages given&lt;/ref&gt; More than any of his other films, ''The Shining'' gave rise to the legend of Kubrick as a [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]]. Reportedly, he demanded hundreds of takes of certain scenes (approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;million feet of film were shot).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Love and Death in Kubrick: A Critical Study of the Films |last= Webster |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2010 |publisher= McFarland |location= |isbn=0786459166, 9780786459162 |page=221 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was particularly difficult for actress [[Shelley Duvall]], who was used to the faster, improvisational style of director [[Robert Altman]].

The film opened to mixed reviews, but proved a commercial success. Stephen King disliked the movie, calling Kubrick &quot;a man who thinks too much and feels too little.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianculli1997&quot;&gt;[[#Bianculli1997|Bianculli 1997.]] Online at: [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1997/04/27/1997-04-27__the_shining___by_the_book.html 'The Shining,' By the Book]&lt;/ref&gt; As with most Kubrick films, subsequent critical reaction has treated the film more favorably. Among horror movie fans, ''The Shining'' is a cult classic, often appearing at the top of best horror film lists alongside [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]âs ''[[Psycho (film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[William Friedkin]]âs ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), and other horror classics. Much of its imagery, such as the elevator shaft disgorging blood and the ghost girls in the hallway are among the most recognizable and widely known images from any Stanley Kubrick film, as are the lines &quot;Redrum&quot; and &quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot; as well as &quot;Here's Johnny!&quot;. The financial success of ''The Shining'' renewed [[Warner Brothers]]' faith in Kubrick's ability to make artistically satisfying and profitable films after the commercial failure of ''Barry Lyndon'' in the United States.

====''Full Metal Jacket''====
Seven years later, Kubrick made his next film, ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), an adaptation of [[Gustav Hasford]]'s [[Vietnam War]] novel ''[[The Short-Timers]]''. Kubrick said to film critic Steven Hall that his attraction to Gustav Hasford's book was because it was &quot;neither antiwar or prowar&quot;, held &quot;no moral or political position&quot;, and was primarily concerned with &quot;the way things are.&quot;

Filming a Vietnam War film in England was a considerable challenge for Kubrick and his production team. Much of the filming was done in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area of London, with the ruined-city set created by production designer [[Anton Furst]]. As a result, the film is visually very different from other Vietnam War films such as ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' and ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'', most of which were shot in the Far East. Instead of a tropical, Southeast-Asian jungle, the second half of the story unfolds in a city, illuminating the urban warfare aspect of a war generally portrayed (and thus perceived) as jungle warfare, notwithstanding significant urban skirmishes like the [[Tet offensive]]. As actor Adam Baldwin put it &quot;When you think of Vietnam, it's natural to imagine jungles. But this story is about urban warfare&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoBrutto&quot;&gt;quoted in Lobrutto, p. 469-470&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers and commentators thought this contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0030.html |title=Regarding Full Metal Jacket |author=various |publisher=The Kubrick Site |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. Lee Ermey]] served as the film's technical adviser in addition to his acting duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;FMJKubrickSite&quot;&gt;[[#FMJKubrickSite|The Kubrick Site.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0030.html Regarding Full Metal Jacket: A Discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ericson2004&quot;&gt;[[#Ericson2004|Ericson 2004.]] Online at: [http://blogcritics.org/video/article/the-measure-of-a-man-stanley/ The measure of a man: Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Full Metal Jacket'' received mixed critical reviews upon its release, but nonetheless found a reasonably large audience, despite being overshadowed by [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' and [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]''. As with Kubrick's other films, its critical status has increased immensely since its initial release.

===1990s===
====''Eyes Wide Shut''====
[[File:Eyes-wide-shut 2.jpg||thumb|300px|A central conflict in the film is between Dr. Harford's adventures in the sexual underworld of New York and his family life. Here he finds that his wife has discovered the Venetian mask he wore at the masked ball with bizarre sex rituals the previous evening.]]
Kubrick's final film was ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999), starring [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Nicole Kidman]] as a wealthy Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey. The story is based on [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s Freudian novella ''Traumnovelle'' (''[[Dream Story]]'' in English), which Kubrick moved from 1920s [[Vienna]] to New York City in the 1990s. The film's theme has been described by actor [[Jack Nicholson]] as delving into questions on the &quot;dangers of married life,&quot; and the &quot;silent desperations of keeping an ongoing relationship alive&quot;.&lt;ref name=Filmbio&gt;Harlan, Jan (producer/director), ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures'', documentary film (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick's wife noted his long-standing interest in the project, saying &quot;over the years he would see friends getting divorced and remarried, and the topic [of the film] would come up.&quot; She knew that this was a subject he wanted to make into a film.&lt;ref name=Filmbio/&gt; Co-star [[Nicole Kidman]] observed that &quot;Stanley's expectations of people were not really high,&quot; although she also saw that his wife, to whom he had been married for over 41 years, &quot;was the love of his life. He would talk about her, he adored her, something that people didn't know. His daughters adored them . . . I would see that, and he would talk about them very proudly.&quot;&lt;ref name=Filmbio/&gt; Nicholson agrees that &quot;Stanley was very much a family man.&quot;&lt;ref name=Filmbio/&gt;

Although Kubrick was almost seventy years of age, he worked relentlessly for 15 months in order to get the film out by its planned release date of July 16, 1999. He worked 18 hours a day, all the while maintaining complete confidentiality about the film. Press releases were sent to the media, stating briefly that &quot;Stanley Kubrick's next film will be ''Eyes Wide Shut'', a story of jealousy and sexual obsession . . . &quot;&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;Webster, Patrick. ''Love and Death in Kubrick: A Critical Study of the Films from Lolita Through Eyes Wide Shut'', McFarland (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}''Eyes Wide Shut'', like ''Lolita'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'' before it, faced censorship before release. Kubrick sent an unfinished preview copy to the stars and producers a few months before release, but his sudden death on March 7, 1999 came a few days after he finished editing, and he never saw the final version when it was released to the public.&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|311}}

Biographer [[Michel Ciment]] believes that &quot;he literally worked himself to death,&quot; trying to complete the film to his liking. Ciment explains that Kubrick's desire to keep this, and many of his earlier films, private and unpublicized during its production, was an expression of Kubrick's &quot;will to power,&quot; and not a penchant for secrecy: &quot;Kubrick felt, quite rightly, that the public generally knows far too much about a film before it opens and that the surrounding media frenzy made the joy of surprise and pleasure of discovery impossible.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|311}}

[[Nicole Kidman]] explains that while some critics describe the film's theme as &quot;dark,&quot; in essence &quot;it is a very hopeful film.&quot; During one interview in the documentary, ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]'', she states that Kubrick was indirectly stressing the moral values of &quot;commitment and loyalty,&quot; adding that &quot;ultimately, ''Eyes Wide Shut'' is about that commitment.&quot;&lt;ref name=Filmbio&gt;Harlan, Jan (producer/director), ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures'', documentary film (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidney Pollack]], who acted in the film, adds that &quot;the heart of [the film] was illustrating a truth about relationships and sexuality. But it was not illustrated in a literal way, but in a theatrical way.&quot;&lt;ref name=Filmbio/&gt; Michel Ciment agrees with Kidman, and likewise notes the positive meaning underlying the film, pointing out how some of it is voiced through the dialog, and suggests that the words &quot;resonate like an epitaph&quot; to Kubrick:
{{quote|Kubrick, shortly before his death, for the first time in his career, offers us a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel, the dawn at the end of the nocturnal journey . . . Alice [Kidman] learns the lesson of her and Bill's emotional odyssey: &quot;Maybe, I think, we should be grateful . . . grateful that we've managed to survive through all of our adventures, whether they were real or only a dream.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;}}

===Death===
On March 7, 1999âfour days after screening a final cut of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' for his family, [[Tom Cruise]], [[Nicole Kidman]], and Warner Bros. executives, Kubrick passed away in his sleep from a heart attack at the age of 70. He was buried next to his favorite tree in [[Childwickbury Manor]], [[Hertfordshire]], England, U.K.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoldenNYTimes&quot;&gt;[[#HoldenNYTimes|Holden 1999.]] Online at: [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EFDF103FF93BA35750C0A96F958260 Stanley Kubrick, Film Director With a Bleak Vision, Dies at 70]&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, several directors and actors discussed their experiences with Kubrick. [[Steven Spielberg]] said in a 1999 interview that ''Dr. Strangelove'' made him forget about being drafted into the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=7557147265662968891#&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=7557147265662968891# | title=Remembering Stanley Kubrick: Steven Spielberg | accessdate=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unrealized projects==
{{Main|Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects}}
Kubrick both developed and was offered several film ideas which never saw completion. The most notable of these were an epic biopic of ''Napoleon'' and a Holocaust-themed film entitled ''Aryan Papers''. When the film rights to Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' were sold to United Artists, [[The Beatles]] approached Kubrick to direct them in a film based on the books, but Kubrick told John Lennon he felt the story was unfilmable.&lt;ref&gt;See interview in &quot;Show&quot; magazine vol. 1, Number 1 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- very vague ref that i lifted from the main page --&gt;

===Projects completed by others===

In 1956, Kubrick was announced as director of ''Gun's Up'', the working title for the production of Charles Neider's novel ''The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones'' to be produced by [[Marlon Brando]]. Shortly after this announcement, the name of the film was changed to ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]''. On November 20, 1958, Kubrick quit as director of ''One-Eyed Jacks'' so that he could begin production on ''Lolita''. In 1960 he expanded on his reasoning, telling an interviewer: &quot;When I left Brando's picture, it still didn't have a finished script. It had just become obvious to me that Brando wanted to direct the movie. I was just sort of playing wingman for Brando, to see that nobody shot him down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ginna|first=Robert Emmett|title=The Odyssey Begins|accessdate=February 17, 2011|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was completed with directorial credit given to Marlon Brando and released in 1961.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Kubrick collaborated with [[Brian Aldiss]] on an expansion of his short story &quot;[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]&quot; into a three-act film. It was a futuristic fairy-tale about a robot that resembles and behaves as a child, and his efforts to become a 'real boy' in a manner similar to ''Pinocchio''. Kubrick reportedly held long telephone discussions with [[Steven Spielberg]] regarding the film, and, according to Spielberg, at one point stated that the subject matter was closer to Spielberg's sensibilities than his.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIReview &quot;&gt;[[#AIReview|Myers (no date).]] Online at: [http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=67 A.I.(review)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, following Kubrick's death, Spielberg took the various drafts and notes left by Kubrick and his writers and composed a new screenplay and, in association with what remained of Kubrick's production unit, made the movie ''[[A.I.

It contains a posthumous producing credit for Stanley Kubrick at the beginning and the brief dedication &quot;For Stanley Kubrick&quot; at the end. The film contains many recurrent Kubrick motifs, such as an omniscient narrator, an extreme form of the [[three-act structure]], the themes of humanity and inhumanity, and a sardonic view of psychiatry.{{cn|date=October 2011}} In addition, [[John Williams]]' score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/2001/Aug01/Artificial_Intelligence.html |title=John WILLIAMS: A.I.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
Alexander Walker, in his book ''Stanley Kubrick Directs'', notes that Kubrick often mentioned Max OphÃ¼ls as an influence on his moving camera, especially the tracking shots in ''Paths of Glory''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;[[#Nelson|Walker 2000, p. 14]]&lt;/ref&gt; His &quot;fascination with the fluid camera&quot; of Ophuls, writes critic [[Gene D. Phillips]], was also used effectively in [[2001: A Space Odyssey]].&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;Kubrick, Stanley, and Phillips Gene D. ''Stanley Kubrick: Interviews'', Univ. Press of Mississippi (2001) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick described this effect in discussing Ophuls' films ''le Plaisir'' and ''The Earrings of Madam De'': &quot;the camera went through every wall and every floor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kagan2000_69&quot;&gt;[[#Kagan|Kagan 2000, p. 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; He once named OphÃ¼ls' ''Le Plaisir'' his favorite film. However, OphÃ¼ls himself derived this technique from his early work as assistant with director [[Anatole Litvak]] in the 1930s, whose own cinematography style is described as &quot;replete with the camera trackings, pans and swoops which later became the trademark of Max Ophuls.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman&gt;Wakeman, John (ed.) ''World Film Directors: 1890 â 1945'', H. W. Wilson Co. (1987) pp. 677â683&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Cocks sees the influence of OphÃ¼ls as going beyond this to include a sensibility drawn to stories of thwarted love and a preoccupation with predatory men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocks&quot;&gt;[[cocks|Cocks, pp. 62 following]]&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Robert Kolker sees evident influence of [[Orson Welles|Welles]] on the same moving camera shots, while biographer Vincent LeBrutto states that Kubrick consciously identified with Welles.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoBrutto&quot;&gt;[[#LeBrutto|LeBrutto 1999]]. p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; LeBrutto sees much influence of Welles' style on Kubrick's ''The Killing'', &quot;the multiple points of view, extreme angles, and deep focus&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LoBrutto&quot;&gt;[[#LeBrutto|LeBrutto 1999]]. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; and on the style of the closing credits of ''Paths of Glory'', and Quentin Curtis in ''The Daily Telegraph'' describes Welles as &quot;[Kubrick's] great influence, in composition and camera movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0048.html |title=An enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an anorak... |author=Quentin Curtis |year=1996  |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One particular film of John Huston, ''The Asphalt Jungle'', sufficiently impressed Kubrick as to persuade him he wanted to cast Sterling Hayden in his first major feature ''The Killing''.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoBrutto&quot;&gt;[[#LeBrutto|LeBrutto 1999]]. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker states that Kubrick never acknowledged [[Fritz Lang]] as an influence on him, but holds that Lang's interests are analogous to Kubrick's with regard to an interest in myth and &quot;the Teutonic unconscious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt; Michael Herr's memoir ''Kubrick'' states that Kubrick was deeply inspired by [[G. W. Pabst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kubrick  |last=Herr |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001  |publisher=Grove Press |location= |isbn=0802138187, 9780802138187 |page=27|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular Pabst had for several decades also considered adapting Schnitzler's ''Traumnovelle'', the basis of ''Eyes Wide Shut'', although Pabst had been unable to come up with a suitable approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Processes of transposition: German literature and film  |last=Rasche |first=Hermann  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007  |publisher=Rodopi |location= |isbn=9042022841, 9789042022843 |page=75 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, Kubrick also was fascinated by the films of Russian filmmakers such as Eisenstein and Pudovkin.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoBrutto&quot;&gt;[[#LeBrutto|LeBrutto 1999]]. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick also as a young man read Pudovkinâs seminal theoretical work, ''Film Technique'' which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, which needs to be effectively employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for years to come. Thomas Nelson describes this book as &quot;the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [Kubrick's] private aesthetics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson2000&quot;&gt;[[#Nelson2000|Nelson 2000, p. 5]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian documentary film maker [[Pavel Klushantsev]] made a groundbreaking film in the 1950s entitled ''Road to the Stars'', which is believed to have significantly influenced Kubrick's technique in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', particularly with regard to its accurate depiction of weightlessness and rotating space station. Indeed ''Encyclopedia Astronautica'' describes some scenes from ''2001'' as a &quot;shot-for-shot duplication of ''Road to the Stars''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/roastars.htm |title=Road to the Stars |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific comparisons of shots from the two films have been analyzed by filmmaker Alessandro Cima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candlelightstories.com/2011/01/19/road-to-the-stars-1957-soviet-space-vision-with-stunning-special-effects/ |title=Road to the Stars â 1957 Soviet Space Vision with Stunning Special Effects |publisher=Candlelight Stories |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1994 issue of ''American Cinematographer'' states &quot;When Stanley Kubrick made 2001: a Space Odyssey in 1968, he claimed to have been first to fly actor/astronauts on wires with the camera on the ground, shooting vertically while the actor's body covered the wires&quot; but observes that Klushantsev had actually preceded him in this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1994  |title=Klushantsev: Russia's Wizard of Fantastika|journal=American cinematographer |volume=75 |issue=|pages= |publisher=ASC Holding Corp |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick was also a great admirer of the films of [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Jean Renoir]], and [[Federico Fellini]], but the degree of their influence on his own style has not been assessed. In an early interview with Horizon magazine in the late 1950s, Kubrick stated, &quot;I believe Ingmar Bergman, Vittorio De Sica and Federico Fellini are the only three filmmakers in the world who are not just artistic opportunists. By this I mean they don't just sit and wait for a good story to come along and then make it. They have a point of view which is expressed over and over and over again in their films, and they themselves write or have original material written for them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;excerpted in ''Entertainment Weekly'' {{cite web| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,272999~7~~,00.html | title=Stanley Kubrick speaks for himself | author=Robert Emmett Ginna | date=Apr 9, 1999 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in life, Kubrick became enamored with the works of [[David Lynch]], being particularly fascinated by Lynch's first major film ''[[Eraserhead]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lynch on Lynch, a book of interviews with Lynch, conducted, edited, and introduced by filmmaker Chris Rodley (Faber &amp; Faber Ltd., 1997, ISBN 978-0-571-19548-0; revised edition published by Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, 2005, ISBN 978-0-571-22018-2). p.77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciment, Michel. Kubrick: The Definitive Edition. (Faber &amp; Faber, 2003. ISBN 978-0-571-21108-1) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; which he asked cast members of ''The Shining'' to watch to establish the mood he wanted to convey.

===Technique===

For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element to be put in balance with [[mise en scÃ¨ne]] (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Pudovkin]]'s treatise on film acting,&lt;ref name=&quot;Philips2001_199&quot;&gt;[[#Philips2001|Philips 2001, p. 199.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often &quot;re-direct&quot; a film.

As he explained to a journalist,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everything else [in film] comes from something else. Writing, of course, is writing; acting comes from the theatre; and cinematography comes from photography. Editing is unique to film. You can see something from different points of view almost simultaneously, and it creates a new experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baxter 1999 p. 40&quot;&gt;[[#Baxter1999|Baxter 1999, p. 40.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kubrick's method of operating thus became a quest for an emergent vision in the editing room, when all the elements of a film could be assembled. The price of this method, beginning as early as ''Spartacus'' (when he first had an ample budget for film stock), was endless exploratory re-shooting of scenes that was an exhaustive investigation of all possible variations of a scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoBrutto1997_Multiple&quot;&gt;For discussion of Kubrick's method of multiple takes see [[#LoBrutto1997|Lobrutto 1997, pp. 398, 423â31, 440â446.]] Page 398: &quot;Kubrick continued to work in a directorial style that included running up a lot of takes on a single setupâ a philosophy that embraced the theory that film stock is the cheapest part of making a film.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, there really are two different authors both who have written a book with the title &quot;Stanley Kubrick, A Biography&quot;. It's not a mistake--~~~~ --&gt;This enabled him to walk into the editing room with copious options. John Baxter has written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months... he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baxter 1999 p. 40&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Writing style===
Kubrick wrote or co-authored the screenplays to all of his films except for ''Fear and Desire'' (his first film) and ''Spartacus'', but always adapted his screenplays from previously existing novels (except for ''Killer's Kiss''). However, Kubrick was noted for often making moderate changes in characterization or plot structure which greatly altered the tone of the story. Notable changes from the source material in Kubrick's films include:

1. In ''Lolita'', Kubrick omits all mention of Professor Humbert's previous infatuation with underage girls, makes the character of Lolita much older, and greatly expands the role of Clare Quilty, a much more perverse child molester than Humbert. This has the effect of making Humbert far more sympathetic. As a result of all three of these changes, Greg Jenkins writes &quot;A story originally told from the edge of a moral abyss is fast moving toward safer ground&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick and the art of adaptation: three novels, three films |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0786402814, 9780786402816 |page=40 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Kubrick converted Peter George's straight Cold War thriller ''Red Alert'' into his macabre black comedy ''Dr. Strangelove'' and gave it an entirely different conclusion. He began to see comedy inherent in the idea of [[mutual assured destruction]] as he wrote the first draft, saying:{{quote|My idea of doing it as a nightmare comedy came in the early weeks of working on the screenplay. I found that in trying to put meat on the bones and to imagine the scenes fully, one had to keep leaving out of it things which were either absurd or paradoxical, in order to keep it from being funny; and these things seemed to be close to the heart of the scenes in question.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers'', vol. 1, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

3. In ''A Clockwork Orange'' Kubrick made the writer victimized by Alex, F. Alexander, an elderly man speaking standard English, while in the book he is a very young political activist, who speaks the same odd slang as Alex and his droogs. In Burgess' novel, Mr. F. Alexander is a contemporary of Alex, while in Kubrick's film he is a contemporary of the Minister of the Interior whose legislation initiates the use of the brainwashing [[Ludovico technique]].

4. The most discussed change in ''The Shining'' (and certainly the one most objected to by author [[Stephen King]]) is Kubrick's omission of Jack Torrance's return to sanity at the end of the novel, and relatively sympathetic character at the opening of the story. Kubrick also cut all hints that the hotel is itself sentient, while adding the element that the hotel was built on a Native American burial ground. The most famous scenes in the film, such as the revelation of the contents of Jack's book, the apparition of the twins in the hallway, Jack's encounter with the ghost of the dead woman in Room 237, and the chase through the hedge-maze have no counterpart in King's novel. Critic Mark Browning concludes that the King novel is about a haunted house, but Kubrick's film is about a haunted man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stephen King on the big screen |last=Browning |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Intellect Books |location= |isbn=1841502456, 9781841502458 |page=199 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5. In adapting ''The Short-Timers'' into ''Full Metal Jacket'', Kubrick expanded the material set in boot camp, which is about 20% of the novel, into fully half of the film. Many viewers find this early material the most memorable in the film. Richard Jenkins believes this is consistent with Kubrick's general desire to explode the standard narrative conventions of film, as this results in the film appearing to be two short stories with the same characters told back-to-back.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

6. In adapting ''Traumnovelle'' into ''Eyes Wide Shut'', Kubrick shifted the story from Vienna in the 1900s to New York City in the 1990s. In the novel, the husband and wife are Jews in a very conservative and anti-Semitic city, while in the film the husband is a fairly conventional WASP upper-middle-class professional in contemporary New York City. In the novel, the secret society upon which the husband stumbles is quite small, whereas in the film it encompasses a large section of the city's social elite. Kubrick has also significantly altered both the events at the mansion party and in the wife's dream as to notably change the tenor and mood of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/Greenwich%20conference.html |title=Rainer J. Kaus, 'Notes on Eyes Wide Shut' |publisher=Clas.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Randy Rasmussen suggests that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naÃ¯ve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Rasmussen | first=Randy | title=Stanley Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed | publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] | year=2005 | page= 331 | isbn = 0-7864-2152-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book-length study of how Kubrick adapts novels to the screen, writer Greg Jenkins derives the following generalizations about Kubrick's screenplays:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. Regardless of how a novel may begin, Kubrick launches his adaptation of it with a heavily visual sequence that immediately and purposefully seizes our attention.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Where it suits his purpose, Kubrick expunges parts of the original, including some characters, episodes, and swatches of dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Addressing himself to the portion of the narrative that remains, Kubrick distorts, reorders, and conflates many of its components.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Although skilled with words, Kubrick is equally skilled with and devoted to images, and he tells his stories as visually as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
5. In general, Kubrick lowers the amount and intensity of violence found in the original.&lt;br /&gt;
6. As Kubrick remakes the original narrative, he tends, with some exceptions, to simplify it.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Kubrick makes his heroes more virtuous than the novels' and his villains more wicked.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Predominately, Kubrick imbues his films with a morality that is more conventional than the novels'.&lt;br /&gt;
9. Kubrick's films are more obviously laced with moments of moderate-to-high drama than are the source materials.&lt;br /&gt;
10. From time to time, though it countervails his mainly reductive thrust, Kubrick expands one or more aspects of the original narrative.&lt;br /&gt;
11. Now and then, Kubrick invents his own material outright, and imposes it on the new narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co. |isbn=978-0-7864-0281-6 |pages=150â161 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Trademark characteristics===

Stanley Kubrick's films have several trademark characteristics. All but his first two full-length films and ''2001'' were adapted from existing novels (''2001'' being based on ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' as well as having its own planned novelization), and he occasionally wrote screenplays in collaboration with writers (usually novelists, but a journalist in the case of ''Full Metal Jacket'') who had limited screenwriting experience.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Southern for ''Doctor Strangelove'', Arthur C. Clarke for ''2001'', and Diane Johnson for ''The Shining''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his films had voice-over narration, sometimes taken verbatim from the novel. With or without narration, all of his films contain extensive character's-point-of-view footage. The closing of films with &quot;The End&quot; went out of style in the wake of the advent of long closing credits in the 1970s. (Disney films, for example, stopped using &quot;The End&quot; in 1984). However, Kubrick continued to put it at the end of the credits in every one of his films, long after the rest of the film industry stopped using it. On the other hand, Kubrick occasionally dispensed with opening credits (in ''A Space Odyssey'' and ''A Clockwork Orange''), long before it became commonplaceâas had [[Orson Welles|Welles]] in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and [[Walt Disney|Disney]] in ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'' before him and [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] would later do, most notably in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. Kubrick's credits are always a slide show. His only rolling credits are the opening credits to ''The Shining''.

Kubrick paid close attention to the releases of his films in other countries. Not only did he have complete control of the dubbing cast, but sometimes alternative material was shot for international releasesâin ''The Shining'', the text on the typewriter pages was re-shot for the countries in which the film was released;&lt;ref&gt;Film review: Special, Issues 25â35, Visual Imagination Ltd., 1999 page 42&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Eyes Wide Shut'', the newspaper headlines and paper notes were re-shot for different languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bright&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/29/dubbing1.php |title=Do You Speak Christian? |author=Michael Watt |date=July 2000 |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal, Issue 29 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick always personally supervised the foreign voice-dubbing and the actual script translation into foreign languages for all of his films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bright&quot;/&gt; Since Kubrick's death, no new voice translations have been produced for any of the films he had control of; in countries where no authorized dubs exist, only subtitles are used for translation.

Beginning with ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', all of his films except ''Full Metal Jacket'' used mostly pre-recorded classical music, in two cases electronically altered by [[Wendy Carlos]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Clockwork Orange'' and ''The Shining''. CO's Walter Carlos and Shining's Wendy Carlos are one and the same.&lt;/ref&gt; He also often used merry-sounding pop music in an ironic way during scenes depicting devastation and destruction, especially in the closing credits or end sequences of a film.&lt;ref&gt;The closing scenes or credits of ''Dr. Strangelove'', ''A Clockwork Orange'', ''The Shining'', and ''Full Metal Jacket'' all employ jolly music in an ironic way in their closing credits or final scenes. However, although the closing scenes of ''Full Metal Jacket'' have the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse song, the closing credits use The Rolling Stones' song ''Paint It Black''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of ''Full Metal Jacket'', Roger Ebert&lt;ref name=&quot;EbertFullMetal&quot;&gt;[[#EbertFullMetal|Ebert 1987.]] Online at: [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870626/REVIEWS/706260302/1023 Full Metal Jacket (review)]&lt;/ref&gt; noted that many Kubrick films have a facial closeup of an unraveling character in which the character's head is tilted down and his eyes are tilted up, although Ebert does not think there is any deep meaning to these shots. Lobrutto's biography of Kubrick notes that his director of photography, Doug Milsome, coined the phrase the &quot;Kubrick crazy stare&quot;. The connection of this stare with psychoanalysis is often made through the concept of &quot;The [[Gaze]]&quot; and its implications in visual culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/index.php/f-p/thesis/view/12|title=The Theory Of The Gaze in Stanley Kubrick - MA thesis|accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick also extensively employed wide angle shots, character tracking shots, zoom shots, and shots down tall parallel walls.

Critic and Kubrick biographer Alexander Walker has noted Kubrick's repeated &quot;corridor&quot; compositions,&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;Walker, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; of which two particularly well-known ones are the StarGate sequence in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and the extensive use of the hotel corridors in ''The Shining''.

Almost all Stanley Kubrick movies have a scene in or just outside a bathroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan2002&quot;&gt;[[#Morgan2002|Morgan 2002.]] Online at: [http://www.columbuswired.net/Columns/Morgan/Kubrick_093002.htm Stanley Kubrick: An Indoor-Plumbing Luddite]; same article at [http://kubrickfilms.tripod.com/id35.html ''The Kubrick Corner'']&lt;/ref&gt; (The more frequently cited example of this in ''2001'' is Dr. Floyd's becoming stymied by the Zero-Gravity Toilet en route to the moon, rather than David Bowman's exploration [while still wearing his spacesuit] of the bathroom adjacent to his celestial bedroom after his journey through the StarGate.)&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Morgan's above-cited article on Kubrick's recurring bathroom references states Floyd's encounter is the ''only'' bathroom reference in ''2001''. On the other hand Patrick Webster's book ''Love and Death in Kubrick'' notes both occurrences on p. 49, as does Jerome Agel's book ''The Making of 2001''&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley Kubrick was a passionate chess player, often playing on the set of his films. Chess appears as a motif or a plot device in three of his films, ''The Killing'', ''Lolita'', and ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. Mario Falsetto believes that the marble floor in the room of the prisoner's trial in ''Paths of Glory'' is deliberately chosen to represent a chess board,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick: a narrative and stylistic analysis  |last=Falsetto |first=Mario |year=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0275969746, 9780275969745 |page=40 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with prisoners as &quot;pawns in the game&quot;.

Many of Kubrick's films have back-references to previous Kubrick films. The best-known examples of this are the appearance of the soundtrack album for ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' appearing in the record store in ''A Clockwork Orange'' and Quilty's joke about Spartacus in ''Lolita''. Less obvious is the reference to a painter named Ludovico in ''Barry Lyndon'', Ludovico being the name of the conditioning treatment in ''A Clockwork Orange''.&lt;ref&gt;Se Question 18 of the Kubrick FAQ at [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html ''The Kubrick Site'']. Also noted in scholarly paper ''Stanley Kubrick: The Odysseys'' by Fabrice Jaumont given at a UniversitÃ© Charles de Gaulle Conference in 1995. [http://angellier.biblio.univ-lille3.fr/etudes_recherches/memoire_jaumont.htm English translation online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick often employed the use of music as a &quot;black joke&quot; to achieve a chilling, ironic effect (one now often employed by Quentin Tarantino) by incongruously combining mismatched moods and styles. [[Igor Stravinsky]] was arguably the innovator of this musical technique during his Neo-Classic period (1920s to the 1950s),&lt;ref&gt;Leanard Bernstein's 1973 Norton Lectures on Poetry [Harvard Univ. Press: 1976], pp. 384â9.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was Kubrick who extended this idea to the big screen. This gives the intended emotional impact of a scene even more power. Brief examples of this include [[Vera Lynn]] singing [[We'll Meet Again]] in the final scene of ''Dr. Strangelove'' (during a nuclear holocaust), using some older classical music for the futuristic ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', and using [[Gene Kelly]]'s ''[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singinâ in the Rain]]'' for the end credits in the dystopian world of ''A Clockwork Orange'', and light pop music in ''Full Metal Jacket''.

The use of long takes, while not an unknown technique before Kubrick, became known in the film community as a &quot;Kubrickian&quot; trademarkâfor instance the extended tricycle-riding sequence in ''The Shining'' or the long pullback from Alex's face at the beginning of ''A Clockwork Orange''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Stanley Kubrick: A Narrative and Stylistic Analysis'' by Mario Falsetto and [http://www.arts.ac.uk/kubrick.htm University of the Arts London â The Stanley Kubrick Archive arrives at University of the Arts London]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
Through his films, Kubrick often addressed concern with the over-mechanization of society which, in its attempt to create a safe environment, creates an artificial sterility that breeds the very evils it tries to exclude.&lt;ref&gt;This is discussed in Rasmussen ''Stanley Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed'', Ciment's ''Kubrick'' Altman's ''A Cinema of Loneliness'' and Nelson's ''Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze''&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple critics have noted that Kubrick's earlier films have more straightforward linear narrative while the later films are moderately and subtly surreal reflecting a sense of social dislocation and confusion.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Nelson again and Jason Sperb ''The Kubrick Facade''&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional distance Kubrick maintains from many of his characters have caused critics to see Kubrick as a cold and detached rationalist, while the recurrence of strongly psychopathic characters from Alex DeLarge to Jack Torrance in his films have caused many to view Kubrick's outlook as deeply pessimistic.&lt;ref&gt;See for example neurologist Gordon Bank's 1990 article &quot;Kubrick's Psychopaths&quot; reprinted at [http://www.gordonbanks.com/gordon/pubs/kubricks.html Kubrick's Psychopaths]&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Nihilism in Film and Television'', Kevin L. Stoehr writes &quot;If there is one film director whose movies express consistently, in terms of both form and content, the pervasive dangers and creative opportunities of nihilism in contemporary culture, that filmmaker is the late Stanley Kubrick&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nihilism in film and television: a critical overview, Citizen Kane to The Sopranos |last=Stoehr |first=Kevin |year=2006 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co. |isbn=0786425474, 9780786425471 |page=137 |page=216  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently recurring observation on the Kubrick film that Spielberg completed ''A.I'' is that it uneasily meshes Spielberg's rosy optimistic outlook with Kubrick's pessimistic one, although one reviewer wrote â[Spielberg] has done a remarkable job in balancing Kubrick's pessimism with his optimism without having one overcrowd the otherâ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicomh.com/films/ai.htm A.I.: Artificial Intelligence | film reviews]. musicOMH (August 27, 2009). Retrieved on August 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper obituaries of Kubrick, the ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' and Vincent LoBrutto's biography&lt;ref&gt;pp. 199 &amp; 490&lt;/ref&gt; of the director (which was spoken of approvingly by Kubrick's wife) all characterize Kubrick broadly as pessimistic. Stephen Holden of ''The New York Times'' wrote: âif Mr. Kubrick's misanthropy prompted some critics to accuse him of coldness and inhumanity, others saw his pessimism as an uncompromisingly Swiftian vision of human absurdity.â So also did Kubrick's most severe critic, Pauline Kael.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in ''The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick'' by Norman Kagan&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was repeated in reviews of the multi-film DVD boxed set of his films in 2007, a New Jersey film critic writing âAnd yet preserved too â like an ugly insect trapped in amber â are some of the artist's most problematic qualities, including a bitter pessimism, a cruel humor and an almost godlike superiority that often viewed other people â and particularly women â as little more than impediments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2007/11/a_life_spent_chafing_moguls_an.html A life spent chafing moguls and movie stars]. NJ.com (November 3, 2007). Retrieved on August 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A pessimistic streak was found in essays collected in ''The Philosophy of Stanley Kubrick'', one of which characterizes ''Eyes Wide Shut'' as âa kind of Sartrean pessimism about our inevitable dissatisfaction with romantic love.â&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Thomas Doherty's review of same in ''The Chronicle of Higher Eductation'' August 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

Not all critics agree with this assessment. Other essays in the same anthology find ''Eyes Wide Shut'' to be largely optimistic. James Naremore in ''On Kubrick'' characterizes Kubrick as a modernist in the tradition of [[James Joyce|Joyce]] and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] with their distrust of mass society. As such, Naremore notes that Kubrick's detachment from his subjects does not make him a dour pessimist, although Kubrick does often dwell on âthe failure of scientific reasoning, and the fascistic impulses in masculine sexualityâ.&lt;ref&gt;James Naremore [http://books.google.com/books?id=cRplAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=James+Naremore+Kubrick&amp;dq=James+Naremore+Kubrick&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IqMfTLvdNs3pnQeSsuiKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA On Kubrick], British Film Institute, 2007 ISBN 978-1-84457-142-0&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Kramer's study of ''2001'' argues it is meant to counterweight the pessimism of Kubrick's previous ''Dr. Strangelove''. 

Some view Kubrick's pessimism as either at least overstated by others or even more apparent than real, an impression created by Kubrick's refusal of any bland or cheap optimism, refusal to make films that conform to conventional ideas of a spectacle, and a desire to employ films as a wake-up call to humanity to understand its capacity for evil. The editors of ''The Kubrick Site'' note that Kubrick avoids cinematically conventional ways of structuring stories. This does indeed create for many viewers a sense of emotionless detachment from the human subjects as noted above. For example, Kubrick often prefers lengthy dialogue scenes shot from one camera angle with no cutting. But the editors of TKS believe this is done in order to establish a life of characters beyond dialogue which &quot;helps to reveal, in the spaces and silences, some of the emotional nature permeating the film's world&quot; as well as a realistic sense of the characters' situatedness in time and society. Kubrick's focus is not just on individual characters but on the larger society around them and how it affects their motivation, often in negative ways. The authors also stress that however bleak Kubrick's outlook (intermittently) is, he is not a misanthrope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html |title=See question 37 |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=February 22, 2002 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent outspoken dissenter from pessimistic readings of Kubrick is author Julian Rice, a scholar of Native American literature. His book ''Kubrick's Hope'' argues that although there is a powerful vision of evil in Kubrick, there is vision of redemption and goodness in Kubrick's films stronger than often initially recognized, a vision focused both on family feeling and access to the sublime depths of the subconscious beyond superficial socialization. However, Rice has been alleged to misrepresent the work of prior Kubrick film scholars, particularly with reference to just how pessimistic or misanthropic they actually think Kubrick's films are.&lt;ref&gt;notably by film scholar Jason Sperb in a review on his online blog subsequently deleted. Sperb's book ''The Kubrick Facade'' is briefly discussed in Rice's book in a manner which Sperb regards as a total misinterpretation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]], himself a noted cinematic optimist and close personal friend of Kubrick, expressed a similar view of Kubrick. Going against the grain of the view that Kubrick's films are misanthropic and pessimistic, Spielberg in a tribute to Kubrick at the 71st Academy awards said: &quot;He dared us to have the courage of his convictions, and when we take that dare, we're transported directly to his world, and we're inside his vision. And in the whole history of movies, there has been nothing like that vision ever. It was a vision of hope and wonder, of grace and of mystery. It was a gift to us, and now it's a legacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifistation.com/kubrick/kub_index.html |title=Stanley Kubrick |publisher=Scifistation.com |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick himself denied that he was a pessimist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html The Kubrick Site: Kubrick's comments regarding 'A Clockwork Orange']. Visual-memory.co.uk. Retrieved on August 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and summarized his views in a 1968 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'': &quot;The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent, but if we can come to terms with the indifference, then our existence as a species can have genuine meaning. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.&quot;

===Frequent and memorable collaborators===
Kubrick did not generally reuse actors on film after film in the manner of [[John Ford]], [[Martin Scorsese]], or [[Akira Kurosawa]]. However, Kubrick did on several occasions work with the same actor more than once. In lead roles, Sterling Hayden appeared in both ''The Killing'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'', Peter Sellers in ''Lolita'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'', and Kirk Douglas in ''Paths of Glory'' and ''Spartacus''. In supporting roles, [[Joe Turkel]] appears in ''The Killing'', ''Paths of Glory'', and ''The Shining'', [[Philip Stone]] appears in ''A Clockwork Orange'', ''Barry Lyndon'', and ''The Shining'', [[Leonard Rossiter]] is featured in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''Barry Lyndon'', while [[Timothy Carey]] is in both ''The Killing'' and ''Paths of Glory''. ''A Clockwork Orange'' and ''Barry Lyndon'' saw the largest crossover, with six actors (including [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]]) having roles of various lengths in each film.

Although Kubrick had a reputation as a non-collaborative and controlling director, he atypically allowed actors Peter Sellers (in both ''Lolita'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'') and R. Lee Ermey (in ''Full Metal Jacket'') to freely improvise most of their own dialogue.

[[File:Best-shot-stanley-kubrick-006.jpg|thumb|upright|Photographer Dmitri Kasterine considered this to be the best of his many on-set photographs of Stanley Kubrick taken over the course of three of his films.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Kasterine was commissioned to take portraits of Kubrick for publications including the ''Daily Telegraph Magazine, Harpers &amp; Queen'' and a variety of his work was published in ''The Times, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Interview,'' and ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref name=Kasterine/&gt;  Though Kubrick was noted for keeping his production sets extremely private by banning uninvited visitors, Kasterine was allowed onto the sets of numerous Kubrick films to shoot both candid and posed photos. In 2010 and 2011, many of his Kubrick photos were on display for the first time in the United Kingdom at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].&lt;ref name=Kasterine&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/about/press/photographs-by-dmitri-kasterine.php &quot;Twentiety Century Portraits: Photographs by Dmitri Kasterine&quot;], National Portrait Gallery, London, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four writers who co-authored screenplays with Kubrick subsequently wrote memoirs of their experience working with him. [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'' traces all the intermediate versions of the story from first draft to final project. [[Diane Johnson]] published an essay about her experience collaborating with Kubrick and has discussed it frequently in both lectures and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Cocks|author2=James Diedrick|author3=Glenn Wesley Perusek|title=Depth of field: Stanley Kubrick, film, and the uses of history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E1PrIkji88EC|page=55|chapter=Writing The Shining|accessdate=August 21, 2011|year=2006|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-21614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonKubrick&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/dianejohnson/ |title=The Terror Trap |author=Mark Steensland |work=The Shining Adapted |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Terrance Gelenter, Diane Johnson |date=Feb 21, 2009 |title=Novelist Diane Johnson hosted by Terrance |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_ZxCMts70c |publisher= Youtube|accessdate=August 22, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Herr]], Kubrick's co-screenwriter on ''Full Metal Jacket'' wrote a book simply titled ''Kubrick'' which covers not only his collaboration on the film, but also his friendship with the director over the last 20 years of his life.

Two authors of studies of Kubrick's films, Alexander Walker and Michel Ciment, worked closely with Kubrick on their books, with Kubrick personally providing the authors with many production photos and film stills and crucial information about the production of his films. Walker's book ''Stanley Kubrick, Director'' saw both a 1972 (entitled ''Stanley Kubrick Directs'') and a 2000 edition, and Michel Ciment's book ''Stanley Kubrick'' saw both a 1980 and 2003 edition (the latter called ''Stanley Kubrick- The Definitive Edition'')

One of Kubrick's longest collaborations was with [[Leon Vitali]], who, after playing the older Lord Bullingdon in ''Barry Lyndon'', became Kubrick's personal assistant, working as the casting director on his following films, and supervising film-to-video transfers for Kubrick.&lt;ref name=&quot;VitaliInterview2007&quot;&gt;[[#VitaliInterview2007|Stuart 2007.]] Online at: [http://www.thereeler.com/features/a_hell_of_an_experience.php A Hell of an Experience] {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in ''Eyes Wide Shut'', playing the ominous Red Cloak, who confronts Tom Cruise during the infamous orgy scene. Since Kubrick's death, Vitali has overseen the restoration of both picture and sound elements for most of Kubrick's films. He has also collaborated frequently with ''Eyes Wide Shut'' co-star [[Todd Field]] on his pictures.

====Family cameos====
Stanley Kubrick's daughter Vivian has cameos in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (as Heywood Floyd's daughter), ''Barry Lyndon'' (as a girl at the birthday party for young Bryan Lyndon), ''The Shining'' (as a party ghost), and ''Full Metal Jacket'' (as a TV reporter). His stepdaughter Katharina has cameos in ''A Clockwork Orange'' and ''Eyes Wide Shut'', and her character's son in the latter is played by her real son. Kubrick's wife [[Christiane Kubrick]] appeared prior to her marriage to Kubrick in ''Paths of Glory'', billed as Susanne Christian (her birth name is Christiane Susanne Harlan), and as a cafe guest in ''Eyes Wide Shut''.

==Personal life and beliefs==

==Legacy==
Kubrick made only thirteen feature films in his life, comparatively low in number compared to contemporaries, due to his meticulous dedication to every aspect of film production. A number of his films are recognized as seminal classics within their genre.

===Cinematography techniques===
Among Kubrick's notable innovations in filmmaking technique are his use of special effects in cinematography. For ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', he made innovative uses of both [[slit-scan photography]] and [[front projection effect|front-screen projection]]. Previously used to create image distortions or blurriness, slit-scan was used by Kubrick to create sophisticated animation for the StarGate sequence. This earned Kubrick his only personal Oscar, awarded for special effects. Although front projection had been used earlier, ''Space Odyssey'' was its first use on a large scale, and Kubrick employed a specially built 8x10 projector for the ''Dawn of Man'' sequence, as he did not believe that matting or rear-projection would create a sufficiently realistic effect.&lt;ref&gt;The technique is discussed in detail in [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/2001a/page2.html an article in ''American Cinematographer''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick also made innovative use of Zeiss camera lenses for photographing scenes lit only by actual candlelight in ''Barry Lyndon''.  In an interview with Michel Ciment,&lt;ref&gt;Ciment ''Kubrick''&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick relates how he felt that most films containing candle-lit scenes look phony, due to the artificial light flickering off-camera. Kubrick wanted the more authentic look of 19th-century paintings.

Kubrick was also among the first to use the then-revolutionary [[Steadicam]] in ''The Shining'' to allow smooth stabilized tracking with the camera in motion, without the use of a dolly limiting the camera's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Ferrara, Steadicam: Techniques and Aesthetics (Oxford: Focal Press, 2000), 26â31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, G. (1980) The Steadicam and The Shining. American Cinematographer, August, 61 (8), pp. 786â9, 826â7, 850â4. Reproduced at [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/page2.htm ''The Kubrick Site''] without issue date or pages given&lt;/ref&gt; The inventor of the Steadicam, [[Garrett Brown]], became heavily involved with the production, as he believed ''The Shining'' was the first film to fully realize the Steadicam's full potential, going well beyond &quot;stunt shots and staircases&quot;.

After Kubrick, the use of slit-scan to create animation effects was employed in the credits sequence to ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A907544 |title=Doctor Who: Evolution of a Title Sequence |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=August 20, 1963 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front-screen projection has been used in James Bond and Superman films, and the Steadicam has been employed in ''Star Wars'' films.

===Industry response===
Leading directors, including [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[James Cameron]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Terry Gilliam]], the [[Coen brothers]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[George A. Romero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Romero, George A. (post-Land of the Dead) | url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/interviews/romero-george-a-post-land-dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;KubrickLife2001&quot;&gt;See [[#KubrickLife2001|Harlan 2001]] for interviews with Scorsese and Spielberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald2007&quot;&gt;See [[#Greenwald2007|Greenwald 2007]] for an interview with Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; On the DVD of ''Eyes Wide Shut'', Steven Spielberg, in an interview, comments on Kubrick that &quot;nobody could shoot a picture better in history&quot; but the way that Kubrick &quot;tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories&quot;. Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's ''Kubrick'', film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood and under-appreciated when first released. Then came a dawning recognition that they were masterful works unlike any other films. Perhaps most notably, [[Orson Welles]], one of Kubrickâs greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, famously said that: âAmong those whom I would call âyounger generationâ Kubrick appears to me to be a giant.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fU78LdDClHUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vincent+LoBrutto&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7C-iTrqrI8W4tgeVhvyeBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Welles&amp;f=false |title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |date=May 7, 1999 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many directors have mentioned Kubrick as having made one of their favorite films: [[Richard Linklater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002 | How the directors and critics voted| url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Richard&amp;surname=Linklater}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Mendes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002 | How the directors and critics voted | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Sam&amp;surname=Mendes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel Schumacher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002 | How the directors and critics voted | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Joel&amp;surname=Schumacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taylor Hackford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002 | How the directors and critics voted | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Taylor&amp;surname=Hackford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Darren Aronofsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flickeringmyth.blogspot.com/2010/12/visual-linguist-darren-aronofsky.html |title=Visual Linguist: A Darren Aronofsky Profile (Part 1)  |author=Trevor Hogg |publisher=flickeringmyth.com |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick continues to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including [[Christopher Nolan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|634240|Christopher Nolan|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Fincher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|399|David Fincher|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillermo del Toro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|868219|Guillermo del Toro|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lynch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|186|David Lynch|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars Von Trier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Films that inspired directors| url = http://kottke.org/09/12/films-that-inspired-directors}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Mann's Man World Page 2 â News â Los Angeles â LA Weekly| url = http://www.laweekly.com/2006-07-27/news/a-mann-s-man-s-world/2/}} {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gaspar NoÃ©]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Gaspar NoÃ© Talks Digital Filmmaking, Stanley Kubrick, Wanting To Work With Kristen Stewart &amp; The &quot;Sentimental, Erotic&quot; Film He Wants To Make Next| url = http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/09/gaspar-noe-talks-digital-filmmaking.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick's inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing.

Although [[Michael Moore]] specializes in documentary filmmaking, at the beginning of shooting his only non-documentary feature film ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'', he sat his cast and crew down to watch Stanley Kubrick's ''Dr. Strangelove''. He told them &quot;What this movie was in the '60s, is what we should aspire to with this film.&quot; Moore had previously written Kubrick a letter telling him how much ''Bacon'' was inspired by ''Strangelove''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dogeatdog.michaelmoore.com/threat.html |title=Moore the Merrier |author=Dominic Griffin |date=Dec. 1995 |publisher=Film Threat magazine |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film director [[Frank Darabont]] has been inspired by Kubrick's use of music. In an interview with ''The Telegraph'', he states that ''2001'' took &quot;the use of music in film&quot; to absolute perfection, and one shot employing classical music in ''The Shawshank Redemption'' follows Kubrick's lead.  On the other hand, while Darabont has followed Kubrick in directing two Stephen King adaptations, Darabont shares Stephen King's negative view of Kubrick's adaption of ''The Shining''. In the same interview, Darabont said {{quote|It completely misses the human element. Kubrick's work on screen tends to be the eye of a scientist examining humanity as if it were a paramecium under a microscope. Sometimes that worked brilliantly, and sometimes it took a really good book like The Shining and totally fucked it up. It's an utter failure as an adaptation of great material. However, it doesn't take away from his extraordinary achievements in his other films. And I think that ''2001'' is his crown jewel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3578079/Filmmakers-on-film-Frank-Darabont.html |title=Filmmakers on film: Frank Darabont |author=Mark Monahan |date=25 May 2002 |work= |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=28 August 2011 |location=London}}; Darabont also [http://raisingkane.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/03/archive-interviews-frank-darabont.html echoes these criticisms]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics occasionally detect a Kubrickian influence when the actual filmmaker acknowledges none. Critics have noticed the influence of Stanley Kubrick on Danish independent director [[Nicolas Winding Refn]]. Jim Pappas suggests this comes from his employment of Kubrick's cinematographer for ''The Shining'' and ''Barry Lyndon'' in his film ''Fear X'', suggesting &quot;it is the Kubrick influence that leaves us asking ourselves what we believe we should know is true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=2945 |title=Movie Review: Fear X |author=Jim Pappas  |date=January 20, 2005  |work= |publisher=The Trades |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent influence of Kubrick on his film ''Bronson'' was noted by the ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/11/entertainment/ca-indiefocus11  |title='Bronson' shows inner chaos of violent British prisoner |author=Mark Olsen |date=October 11, 2009 |work= |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French publication ''Evene''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evene.fr/cinema/actualite/guerrier-silencieux-winding-refn-viking-valhalla-rising-2582.php|title=INTERVIEW NICOLAS WINDING REFN |author=Anne-Claire Cieutat   |date=March 2010  |work= |publisher=Evene.fr |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when asked by ''Twitch'' about the very frequent comparisons by critics of the film ''Bronson'' to ''A Clockwork Orange'', Refn denied the influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.com/interviews/2010/05/a-conversation-with-nicolas-winding-refn.php | title=A CONVERSATION WITH NICOLAS WINDING REFN |author=Paolo Gill  |date=May 25, 2010 |work= |publisher=Twitch Film | accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refn stated {{quote|Of course if you put violence with classical music, people think it's obvious that's ''Clockwork Orange'', because Kubrick used it very well and you always look at it as a reference.

Some filmmakers have been critical of Kubrick's work, such as those of the [[remodernist film]] movement; [[Jesse Richards]] described Kubrick's work as &quot;boring and dishonest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;When The Trees Were Still Real&quot;&gt;[http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html &quot;Remodernist Film Manifesto&quot;, When The Trees Were Still Real, August 27, 2008]. Retrieved October 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Rinaldi, in his essay on the ''Remodernist Film Manifesto'' for Mungbeing, ''The Shore as Seen from the Deep Sea'', defends the manifesto, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I certainly don't share in my friend's opinion of this man's work, but I actually think this is a hugely important part of the manifesto. A lot of us came to be filmmakers because a particular director's (or a number of directors) work inspired us. A friend of mine calls these inspirational figures his &quot;Giants&quot;, which I think is a great word for them because sometimes they are built up so much in our minds that we don't think we, or our work, can ever really reach them and theirs. I think, for the most part, the generation that I grew up in had Kubrick as their Giant. His work has a mystical &quot;perfectionism&quot; that is awe-inspiring at times. This perfectionism is anathema to the Remodernist mentality and for many healthy reasons, this giant (or whatever giant towers over your work) must fall in our minds. We must become the giant.&lt;ref name=MungBeing&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=34&amp;sub_id=1568#1568 &quot;Remodernist Film&quot;, MungBeing, October 4, 2009].

Actor [[Robert Duvall]] (who never worked for Kubrick) stated on the fifth in The Hollywood Reporter's roundtable series in 2010 that he thought Kubrick's knack for an unusually high number of takes (often over 50) made him an &quot;actor's enemy&quot;. He stated that both ''A Clockwork Orange'' and ''The Shining'' were &quot;great movies&quot; but contained &quot;the worst performances he had ever seen in movies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/video-awards-watch-roundtable-actors-55245 |title=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Nicole Kidman (who co-starred in Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut'') held that the value of Kubrick's enormous number of takes was that actors stopped consciously thinking about acting technique and went to a deeper place. She stated &quot;He believed that what it does to you, as an actor, was that you would lose control of your sense of self, of the part of you that was internally watching your own performance. Eventually, he felt, you would stop censoring yourself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 4 |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=February 22, 2002 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homages===

In 2001, a number of persons who worked with Kubrick on his films created the documentary ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]'', released by Warner Bros. It was produced and directed by Kubrick's brother-in-law, [[Jan Harlan]], who had also been executive producer of Kubrick's last four films. The camera and sound for the documentary was managed by his son, [[Manuel Harlan]], who was also the still photographer for ''Eyes Wide Shut'' and video operator for ''Full Metal Jacket''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|363222|Manuel Harlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, BAFTA renamed their Britannia award the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award. Kubrick is among filmmakers such as [[D. W. Griffith|Griffith]], [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]] (whom Kubrick directed in ''Spartacus''), [[Cecil B. DeMille]], and [[Irving Thalberg]], all of whom have had annual awards named after them. Kubrick won this award in 1999, one year prior to its being renamed in his honor.

Analysts of the TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' argue it contains more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. References abound not only to ''2001'', ''A Clockwork Orange'', and ''The Shining'' but also to ''Spartacus'', ''Dr. Strangelove'', ''Lolita'', and ''Full Metal Jacket''. It has been noted that while references to &quot;fantastic fiction&quot; in ''The Simpsons'' are copious, &quot;there are two masters of the genre whose impact on ''The Simpsons'' supersedes that of all others: Stanley Kubrick and Edgar Allan Poe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Westfahl_1232&quot;&gt;[[#Westfahl2005|Westfahl 2005, p. 1232.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it has been observed that &quot;...the show's almost obsessive references to the films of Stanley Kubrick...[make it] as if the show's admittance of these films into the show's pantheon of intertextual allusions finally marked their entry into the deepest subconscious level of the global pop cultural mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberti_277&quot;&gt;[[#Alberti2003|Alberti 2003, p. 277.]]&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Director's Guild of Great Britain]] gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.movies.kubrick/browse_thread/thread/449227c2e5e20b6b/e8c08c6627c0669d?lnk=gst&amp;q=Katharina+Simpsons#e8c08c6627c0669d |title=Kubrick and Homer (Simpson) alt.movies.kubrick |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 there was an exhibition of paintings and photos inspired by Kubrick's films in Dublin, Ireland, entitled 'Stanley Kubrick: Taming Light'. It was displayed at the Lighthouse Cinema, Dublin from October 1 to 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/sep/27/stanleys-rubric/ |title=Stanley's Rubric |author=Paul Lynch |date=September 27, 2009 |publisher=Sunday Tribune (Ireland) |accessdate=March 21, 2011}} The Sunday Tribune shut down its website in early 2011, and the website of this article appears to have been not archived by the Wayback Machine.

The video for pop singer [[Lady Gaga]]'s song ''Bad Romance'' was found by Daniel Kreps of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine to be heavily influenced by the filmmaking style of Kubrick.&lt;ref&gt;Kreps, Daniel (November 11, 2009). &quot;Lady Gaga Premieres âBad Romance,â Her Craziest Video Yet&quot;. Rolling Stone (Jann Wenner) 1098 (32). ISSN 0035-791X&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Gaga has also employed a hip-hop remix of the electronic version of Purcell's music that opens the film ''Clockwork Orange'' in her concerts and in her mini-movie ''The Fame.'' Finally, her song ''Dance in the Dark'' has the lines &quot;Find your Jesus, Find your Kubrick&quot;.

===Studies of Kubrick===
At least two full-length books on Stanley Kubrick are devoted to frame-by-frame analyses of his visual style: ''Stanley Kubrick, Director: A Visual Analysis'' by Alexander Walker, and ''Stanley Kubrick: Visual Poet 1928â1999 (Basic Film)'' by Paul Duncan. History professor Geoffrey Cocks notes that Kubrick has what he calls an &quot;open narrative&quot; style that &quot;requires the audience to derive meaning actively rather than being passively instructed, entertained, and manipulated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocks2004_6&quot;&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004, p. 6.]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Cocks believes that Kubrick's preoccupation with sweeping overarching historical themes causes him to frequently sacrifice character development. &quot;His films consistently display a basic taxonomy of violence, systems of control, and inherent human evil. This idÃ©e fixe freezes the people in his films into types rather than fully developed characters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocks2004_11&quot;&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004, p. 11.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative adaptations===
Three of Stanley Kubrick's films have had their source material re-adapted in some fashion: Anthony Burgess's stage adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' in 1990, which he hoped would be considered a more definitive adaptation than Kubrick's film;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~fa1871/burgess.html |title=Anthony Burgess from A Clockwork Orange: A play with music (Century Hutchinson Ltd, 1987) |publisher=Home.wlv.ac.uk |accessdate=October 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the  [[The Shining (TV miniseries)|television miniseries]] of ''The Shining'', written and produced by Stephen King which King hoped would stand as the authorized adaptation; and [[Lolita (1997 film)|Adrian Lyne's adaptation]] of ''Lolita'', which had the blessing of Vladimir Nabokov's son, Dmitri (who echoed his father's moderate misgivings about Kubrick's version).&lt;ref name=&quot;KobelNYTimes&quot;&gt;[[#KobelNYTimes|Kobel 2001.]] Online at: [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EEDB1630F931A15757C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all, Nabokov Won't Be Nailed Down]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.ucsb.edu/lsv-cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=nabokv-l&amp;P=8171 |title=NABOKV-L Archives â September 1999 (#63) |publisher=Listserv.ucsb.edu |accessdate=October 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Burgess and King stated that they were annoyed by Kubrick's denying their lead characters (Alex DeLarge and Jack Torrance, respectively) a final redemption that was present in the source material.

===Portrayal in film===
Kubrick was portrayed by [[Stanley Tucci]] in the 2004 film ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers''. Sellers appeared in two Kubrick films, but the material with Kubrick in this film is focused on Sellers' appearance in ''Dr. Strangelove''.

==Hoaxes, parodies and conspiracy theories involving Kubrick==
{{Main|Alan Conway|Colour Me Kubrick|Dark Side of the Moon (mockumentary)|}}
{{See also|Moon landing hoax#Stanley Kubrick involvement|2001: A Space Odyssey (film)#Mock hoaxes and Conspiracy Theory}}

In the early 1990s, a con artist named [[Alan Conway]] frequented the London entertainment scene claiming to be Stanley Kubrick, and temporarily deceived ''New York Times'' theatre critic [[Frank Rich]]. Kubrick's personal assistant, Anthony Frewin, helped track Conway down and wrote the screenplay for the film [[Colour Me Kubrick]] based on the Conway affair.

In 2002, with the cooperation of Kubrick's surviving family, the French film maker [[William Karel]] (after initially planning a straight documentary on Stanley Kubrick) directed a hoax mockumentary about Kubrick and the NASA moon landing entitled ''[[Dark Side of the Moon (mockumentary)|Dark Side of the Moon]]''. The film purported to demonstrate that the NASA moon landings had been faked and that the moon landing footage had been directed by Stanley Kubrick during the production of ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. In spite of clues that the film is a news parody, some test audiences believed the film to be sincere, including at least one believer in the moon landing conspiracy.

An earlier 1995 tongue-in-cheek article promoted essentially the same mock hoax about Kubrick, and was also deemed sincere by some readers. Originally posted on the Usenet humor news group 'alt.humor.best-of-usenet', it was later reproduced in venues not devoted to parody. &lt;ref&gt;The original article (with correct attribution) can be read at &quot;[http://www.clavius.org/bibkubrick.html www.clavius.org]&quot;, a website devoted to debunking moon landing hoax theories. Material on the webmaster of &quot;clavius.org&quot; may be found at [http://www.clavius.org/about.html About this site] and [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1728117/ Imdb biography for Jay Windley]&lt;/ref&gt;

An entirely sincere documentary film making the same claim as Karel's parodic &quot;mockumentary&quot; was self-released on DVD in 2011 by conspiracy theorist and occultist Jay Weidner entitled ''Kubrick's Odyssey: Secrets Hidden in the Films of Stanley Kubrick; Part One: Kubrick and Apollo''. The science magazine ''Discovery'' reviewed an earlier article by Weidner on which his film was based as &quot;bunk&quot; but &quot;oddly compelling&quot; and &quot;strangely fascinating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/faked-moon-landings-and-kubricks-the-shining.html |title=FAKED MOON LANDINGS AND KUBRICK'S 'THE SHINING' |author=Robert Lamb  |date=Jan 21, 2010 |work= |publisher=Discovery News |accessdate=September 6, 2011}} The Discovery article is quoted on the film's Amazon.com as a review of the film itself, although it is actually a review of an earlier article that was the basis for the film.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second recurring conspiracy theory surrounding Stanley Kubrick is that he was a secret member of a massive Freemason-Illuminati organization and hid clues of its existence in many of his films. Theorists claim Kubrick disclosed too much in ''Eyes Wide Shut'' and was subsequently assassinated.  ''Cracked.com'' listed this as #1 in their list of ''5 Absurd (But Mind Blowing) Pop Culture Conspiracy Theories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_18747_5-absurd-but-mind-blowing-pop-culture-conspiracy-theories_p2.html |title=5 Absurd (But Mind Blowing) Pop Culture Conspiracy Theories |last1=Quercia  |first1=Jacopo della |last2= |first2= |date=September 22, 2010 |work= |publisher=Cracked.com |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the book ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the New World Order'' claims to be skeptical of the actual conspiracy theories, it takes at face value the claim that Masonic symbolism is woven into ''Eyes Wide Shut''.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix B {{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to the New World Order |last=Axelrod |first=Alan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010  |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=1615640398, 9781615640393 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sup&gt; Uncredited

Stanley Kubrick was responsible for the underlying concept of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[A.I.: Artificial Intelligence]]'' which was produced after his death, by his brother-in-law, [[Jan Harlan]]. Kubrick is thanked in the credits, but is not credited as writer. A new screenplay was written by Steven Spielberg based on a 90-page story treatment done in 1990 by Ian Watson which in turn had closely followed Kubrick's stated directives. The film is based on a short story by [[Brian Aldiss]].

===Home video and screen size===
With the exception of ''Space Odyssey'', Kubrick had authorized only cropped and screen-fitted transfers of his films to videotape. When he died in 1999, Warner Home Video released these films with the transfers that Kubrick approved. In 2007, Warner Home Video remastered five of his later films in High-Definition, releasing the titles for the first time in widescreen format, preserving the theatrical screen ratios.

During the laserdisc era, The Criterion Collection released six earlier Kubrick films, but released only ''Spartacus'' and ''2001'' in widescreen, although others had been widescreen in theatres. Earlier DVD releases of ''The Killing'', ''Paths of Glory'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'' (whether by Criterion, MGM, or Sony) were standard 4:3 screen, while later releases were widescreen.

Earlier widescreen releases of ''2001'' were slightly cropped due to being transferred from a 35mm print, but this was corrected in the most recent DVD release.

==Awards and nominations==

All of Stanley Kubrick's later films, except for ''The Shining'', were nominated for Oscars or Golden Globes, in various categories. ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' received numerous technical awards, including a BAFTA award for cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth and an Academy Award for best visual effects, which Kubrick (as director of special effects on the film) received. This was Kubrick's only personal Oscar win among 13 nominations. Nominations for his films were mostly in the areas of cinematography, art design, screenwriting, and music. Only four of his films were nominated by either an Oscar or Golden Globe for their acting performances, ''Spartacus'', ''Lolita'', ''Doctor Strangelove'', and ''A Clockwork Orange''.

Kubrick received two awards from major film festivals: &quot;Best Director&quot; from the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in 1959 for ''Killer's Kiss'', and &quot;Filmcritica ''Bastone Bianco'' Award&quot; at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1999 for ''Eyes Wide Shut''. He also was nominated for the &quot;[[Golden Lion]]&quot; of the Venice Film Festival in 1962 for ''Lolita''. The Venice Film Festival awarded him the &quot;[[Career Golden Lion]]&quot; in 1997. He received the [[Directors Guild of America Awards#Lifetime Achievement Award|D.W. Griffith Lifetime Achievement Award]] from the [[Directors Guild of America]], and another life-achievement award from the [[Director's Guild of Great Britain]], and the ''[[Career Golden Lion]]'' from the Venice Film Festival. Posthumously, the [[Sitges - Catalonian International Film Festival]] awarded him the &quot;Honorary Grand Prize&quot; for life achievement in 2008. He also received the coveted [[Hugo Award]] three time for his work in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hugo Awards: Search Results: Kubrick|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/?s=Kubrick|publisher=The Hugo Awards|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, three of Kubrick's films were selected by the [[American Film Institute]] for [[AFI's 100 Yearsâ¦100 Movies|their list of the 100 Greatest Movies in America]]: ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' at #22, ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' at No.26 and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' at #46. In 2007, the AFI [[AFI's 100 Yearsâ¦100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|updated their list]] with ''2001'' ranked at #15, ''Dr. Strangelove'' ranked at No.39 and ''Clockwork Orange'' ranked at #70; ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' was one of the new selections, ranking at #81.
