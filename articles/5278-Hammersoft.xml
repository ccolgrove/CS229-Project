'''Copyright''' is a legal concept, enacted by most governments, giving the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s to it, usually for a limited time. Generally, it is &quot;the right to copy&quot;, but also gives the copyright holder the right to be credited for the work, to determine who may adapt the work to other forms, who may perform the work, who may financially benefit from it, and other, related rights. It is an [[intellectual property]] form (like the [[patent]], the [[trademark]], and the [[trade secret]]) applicable to any expressible form of an idea or information that is substantive and discrete.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Intellectual Property Organisation 6â7&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |format=PDF| last = World Intellectual Property Organisation | title= Understanding Copyright and Related Rights | publisher = WIPO| accessdate = August 2008|pages= 6â7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright initially was conceived as a way for government to restrict printing; the contemporary intent of copyright is to promote the creation of new works by giving authors control of and profit from them. Copyrights have been internationally standardized, lasting between fifty to a hundred years from the creator's death, or a finite period for anonymous or corporate creations; some jurisdictions have required formalities to establishing copyright, most recognize copyright in any completed work, without formal registration. Generally, copyright is enforced as a [[civil law (common law)|civil]] matter, though some jurisdictions do apply [[criminal law|criminal]] sanctions.

Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations, allowing &quot;fair&quot; exceptions to the creator's exclusivity of copyright, and giving users certain rights. The development of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing copyright, and inspired additional challenges to copyright law's philosophic basis. Simultaneously, businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright have advocated the extension and expansion of their copy rights, and sought additional legal and technological enforcement.

==Justification==
{{main|Philosophy of copyright}}

Some take the approach of looking for coherent ''justifications'' of established copyright systems, while others start with general ethical theories, such as [[utilitarianism]] and try to analyse policy through that lens. Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law, viewing it simply as a result (and perhaps an undesirable result) of political processes.

Another widely debated issue is the relationship between [[copyrights]] and other forms of &quot;[[intellectual property]]&quot;, and material property. Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of [[property]], because it involves the [[exclusive right|exclusion]] of others from something. But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions.

There are many other [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright. They include such problems as determining when one work is &quot;derived&quot; from another, or deciding when information has been placed in a &quot;tangible&quot; or &quot;material&quot; form.

Some critics claim copyright law protects corporate interests while criminalizing legitimate use, while proponents argue the law is fair and just.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of copyright law}}
{{see also|Statute of Anne|United States copyright law|International copyright agreements|Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights}}

Copyright was invented after the advent of [[Printing press|the printing press]] and with wider public literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the eighteenth century. [[Charles II of England]] was concerned by the unregulated copying of books and passed the Licensing Act of 1662 by Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers Company, essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.

[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]
The British [[Statute of Anne]] (1709) further alluded to individual rights or the artist, beginning: &quot;Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing... Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors... to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families:...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne.html Statute of Anne]&lt;/ref&gt; A right to ''benefit financially'' from the work is articulated, and court rulings and legislation have recognized a right to ''control'' the work, such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved. An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.

Aside from the role of governments and the church, the history of copyright law is in essential ways also connected to the rise of capitalism and the attendant extension of commodity relations to the realm of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production. Similarly, different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in Europe and not, for example, in Asia. In the Middle Ages in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product, expression and property of the collective. Not until capitalism emerges in Europe with its individualist ideological underpinnings does the conception of intellectual property and by extension copyright law emerge. Intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual and their property, rather than a collective or social product which belongs in the commons. The most significant point is that under the capitalist mode of production, patent and copyright laws support in fundamental and thoroughgoing ways the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which capitalism led to the commodification of many aspects of social life that hitherto had no monetary or economic value ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;Bettig, Ronald V. (1996). ''Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property. Westview Press''. p. 9â17. ISBN 0813313856.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statute of Anne]] was the first real copyright act, and gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://web.archive.org/web/20110623191632/http://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language] |pages=13 |author=Ronan, Deazley |isbn=9781845422820 |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the publishing of books and maps to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern industry, covering such items as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]], films, photographs, software, and architectural works.

[[File:Copyright Act of 1790 in Colombian Centinel.jpg|thumb|250px|The Copyright Act of 1790 in the Columbian Centinel]]
The [[Copyright Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] (1787) authorized copyright legislation: &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot; That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could ''profit'' from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to his heirs.

The 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] first established recognition of copyrights among [[Sovereignty|sovereign nations]], rather than merely bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for [[creative works]] do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically in force at creation: an author need not &quot;register&quot; or &quot;apply for&quot; a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P109_16834 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5 |accessdate=2011-11-18 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as a work is &quot;fixed&quot;, that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100 years later with the passage of the ''Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988''. The USA did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkle, Ann M; Fries, Janet; Lopez, Daniel; Possessky, Laura (1997). &quot;Art conservation and the legal obligation to preserve artistic intent&quot;. [http://web.archive.org/web/20091221205936/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAIC JAIC]   36 (2): 165â179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and most [[Latin America]]n countries instead entered into the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] in 1910, which required a copyright notice (such as &quot;all rights reserved&quot;) on the work, and permitted signatory nations to limit the duration of copyrights to shorter and renewable terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.html International Copyright Relations of the United States]&quot;, U.S.&amp;nbsp;Copyright Office Circular No.&amp;nbsp;38a, August&amp;nbsp;2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf Parties to the Geneva Act of the Universal Copyright Convention] as of 2000-01-01: the dates given in the document are dates of ratification, not dates of coming into force. The Geneva Act came into force on 1955-09-16 for the first twelve to have ratified (which included four non-members of the Berne Union as required by Art.&amp;nbsp;9.1), or three months after ratification for other countries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/documents/pdf/berne.pdf Parties to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works] as of 2006-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Copyright Convention]] was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention, and ratified by nations such as the [[Soviet Union]] and developing nations.

The regulations of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] are incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] agreement (1995), thus giving the Berne Convention effectively near-global application.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy http://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] |pages=39 |author=MacQueen, Hector L; Charlotte Waelde and Graeme T Laurie |isbn=9780199263394 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]] enacted greater restrictions on the use of technology to copy works in the nations that ratified it.

==Scope==
Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or &quot;works&quot;. Specifics vary by [[jurisdiction]], but these can include [[poem]]s, [[theses]], [[drama|plays]], other [[book|literary works]], [[film|movies]], [[choreography|dances]], [[music|musical compositions]], [[sound recording|audio recordings]], [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[Computer software|software]], [[radio]] and [[television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]], and [[industrial design]]s. Graphic [[designs]] and industrial designs may have separate or overlapping laws applied to them in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights] |pages=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=9780275988838 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |format=PDF| last = World Intellectual Property Organisation | title= Understanding Copyright and Related Rights | publisher = WIPO| accessdate = August 2008|pages= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art and copyright&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;dq=idea-expression+dichotomy&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Art and copyright] |pages=48â49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=9781841132259 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the copyright to a [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon restricts others from making copies of the cartoon or creating [[derivative work]]s based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] particular [[anthropomorphic]] mouse, but doesn't prohibit the creation of other works about anthropomorphic mice in general, so long as they're different enough to not be judged copies of Disney's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art and copyright&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;dq=idea-expression+dichotomy&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Art and copyright] |pages=48â49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=9781841132259 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses (See [[Fair Use]], [[Fair Dealing]]). Meanwhile, other laws may impose additional restrictions that copyright does not â such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.

Copyright laws are standardized somewhat through international conventions such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and [[Universal Copyright Convention]]. These multilateral treaties have been ratified by nearly all countries, and [[international organizations]] such as the [[European Union]] or [[World Trade Organization]] require their member states to comply with them.

==Obtaining and enforcing copyright==
[[File:Fermat Last Theorem &quot;proof&quot; registered by Ukraine officials.jpg|thumb|left|A copyright certificate for proof of the Fermat theorem, issued by the State Department of Intellectual Property of Ukraine]]
Typically, a work must meet minimal standards of originality in order to qualify for copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the [[United Kingdom]] there has to be some 'skill, labour and judgment' that has gone into it.&lt;ref&gt;''Express Newspaper Plc v News (UK) Plc'', F.S.R. 36 ([[1991]])&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]] and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a [[trademark]] instead.

Copyright law recognises the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an original creation, rather than based on whether it is unique; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.

In all countries where the Berne Convention standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P109_16834 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5 |accessdate=2011-11-18 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] and attorney's fees. (In the USA, registering ''after'' an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)

The original holder of the copyright may be the ''employer'' of the author rather than the author himself, if the work is a &quot;[[work for hire]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. Â§ 201(b); Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[English law]] the ''Copyright, Designs and Patents Act'' 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a &quot;Work for Hire.&quot;

Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[File sharing and the law]])

===Copyright notices in the U.S.===
[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|150px|A copyright symbol used in copyright notice]]
Prior to 1989, use of a copyright notice â consisting of the [[copyright symbol]] ({{Unicode|Â©}}, the letter '''C''' inside a circle), the abbreviation &quot;Copr.&quot;, or the word &quot;Copyright&quot;, followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder â was part of United States statutory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act of 1976, {{USPL|94|553}}, 90 Stat. 2541, Â§ 401(a) ([[October 19]], [[1976]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (BCIA), {{USPL|100|568}}, 102 Stat. 2853, 2857. One of the changes introduced by the BCIA was to section 401, which governs copyright notices on published copies, specifying that notices &quot;'''may''' be placed on&quot; such copies; prior to the BCIA, the statute read that notices &quot;'''shall''' be placed on all&quot; such copies. An analogous change was made in section 402, dealing with copyright notices on phonorecords.&lt;/ref&gt; Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a [[sound recording copyright symbol]] (&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Unicode|â}}&lt;/font&gt;, the letter '''P''' inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright. Similarly, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright.

In 1989, the U.S. enacted the Berne Convention Implementation Act, amending the 1976 Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. As a result, the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright, because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.html U.S. Copyright Office - Information Circular&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit â using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of &quot;innocent infringement&quot; being successful.&lt;ref&gt;[[17 U.S.C.]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|401(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Poor man's copyright&quot;===
A widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the &quot;[[poor man's copyright]].&quot; It proposes that the creator send the work to himself in a sealed envelope by registered mail, using the [[postmark]] to establish the date. This technique has not been recognized in any published opinions of the United States courts. &lt;!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement,&quot;This technique has not been recognized by any United States court&quot; is overbroad because not all such cases are reported, and it is impossible to know whether this is correct.--&gt; The United States Copyright Office makes clear that the technique is no substitute for actual registration.&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright in General: [http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman Iâve heard about a &quot;poor manâs copyright.&quot; What is it?]'', U.S Copyright Office&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique but does not recommend its use.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm Copyright Registers]', United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusive rights==
Several exclusive rights typically attach to the holder of a copyright:

* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)
* to import or export the work
* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)
* to perform or display the work publicly
* to sell or assign these rights to others
* to transmit or display by radio or video&lt;ref name=&quot;Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |pages=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=9780275988838 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase &quot;exclusive right&quot; means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holders permission. Copyright is sometimes called a &quot;negative right&quot;, as it serves to ''prohibit'' certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than ''permitting'' people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to ''not'' use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term.

There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Many argue that copyright does not exist merely to restrict third parties from publishing ideas and information, and that defining copyright purely as a negative right is incompatible with the public policy objective of encouraging authors to create new works and enrich the public domain.{{weasel-inline|date=October 2011}}

The right to adapt a work means to transform the way in which the work is expressed. Examples include developing a stage play or film script from a novel, translating a short story, and making a new arrangement of a musical work.

Founded in 2001, [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization with headquarters centered in California and over 100 affiliates located throughout the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Website http://creativecommons.org/ retrieved October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; CC aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end the organization provides a number of copyright license options to the public, free of charge. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot; /&gt; Terms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enable the general public to use such works more freely. Four general types of CC licenses are available. These are based upon copyright holder stipulations such as whether the he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rubin&quot;&gt;Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals may register for a CC license via the [http://creativecommons.org/ Creative Commons website]. As of 2009 approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rubin&quot; /&gt;

==Limitations and exceptions to copyright==
{{main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright}}

===Idea-expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine===
{{main|Idea-expression divide}}

The idea-expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. Â§ 102(b).

===The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights===
{{main|First-sale doctrine|Exhaustion of rights}}
Copyright law does ''not'' restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the [[United States]] this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s. Some countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed '''does''' infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.

In addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.

===Fair use and fair dealing===
{{main|Fair use|Fair dealing}}
Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[Fair use|fair use doctrine]], codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:

# the purpose and character of your use
# the nature of the copyrighted work
# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In Australia, the [[fair dealing]] exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]] it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.

In the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.

:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''&lt;ref name=&quot;insert&quot;&gt;insert&lt;/ref&gt;

Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights&quot;/&gt; An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.

===Transfer and licensing, and assignment===
{{see also|Collective rights management|extended collective licensing|Compulsory license}}
[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|300px|DVD:[[All Rights Reserved]]]]
A copyright, or aspects of it, may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights] |pages=15 |isbn=9789280512717 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]], however the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy and/or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time. A transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective;&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights] |pages=8 |isbn=9789280512717 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; see section 239 of the Australia ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth). Under Australian law, it is not enough to pay for a work to be created in order to also own the copyright. The copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing.

Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.

Copyright may also be [[license]]d.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights&quot;/&gt; Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights] |pages=16 |isbn=9789280512717 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]] have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.

===Similar legal rights===
Copyright law covers the creative or artistic expression of an idea. [[Patent]] law covers [[invention]]s. [[Trademark]] law covers distinctive [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] which are used in relation to [[product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] as indicators of origin, as does (in a similar fashion), [[Trade dress]]. [http://www.patent.gov.uk/design/index.htm Registered designs] law covers the look or appearance of a manufactured or functional article. [[Trade secret]] law covers secret or sensitive knowledge or information.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Intellectual Property Organisation 6â7&quot;/&gt;

Although copyright and trademark laws are theoretically distinct, more than one type of them may cover the same item or subject matter. For example, in the case of the Mickey Mouse cartoon, the image and name of Mickey Mouse would be the subject of trademark legislation, while the cartoon itself would be subject to copyright. Titles and character names from books or movies may also be trademarked while the works from which they are drawn may qualify for copyright.

Another point of distinction is that a copyright (and a patent) is generally subject to a statutorily-determined term, whereas a trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely if the trademark is periodically used and renewal fees continue to be duly paid to the relevant jurisdiction's trade marks office or [[Civil registry|registry]]. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the [[public domain]] and may be freely used or exploited by anyone. Courts in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]] for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.

===Useful articles===
If a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work is a useful article, it is copyrighted only if its aesthetic features are separable from its utilitarian features. A useful article is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. They must be separable from the functional aspect to be copyrighted.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html |title=U.S Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two primary approaches to the separability issue: physical separability and conceptual separability. Physical separability is the ability to take the aesthetic thing away from the functional thing. Conceptual separability can be found in several different ways. It may be present if the useful article is also shown to be appreciated for its aesthetic appeal or by the design approach, which is the idea that separability is only available if the designer is able to make the aesthetic choices that are unaffected by the functional considerations. A question may also be asked of whether an individual would think of the aesthetic aspects of the work being separate from the functional aspects.

There are several different tests available for conceptual separability. The first, the Primary Use test, asks how is the thing primarily used: art or function? The second, the Marketable as Art test, asks can the article be sold as art, whether functional or not. This test does not have much backing, as almost anything can be sold as art. The third test, Temporal Displacement, asks could an individual conceptualize the article as art without conceptualizing functionality at the same time. Finally, the ''Denicola'' test says that copyrightability should ultimately depend on the extent to which the work reflects the artistic expression inhibited by functional consideration. If something came to have a pleasing shape because there were functional considerations, the artistic aspect was constrained by those concerns.

===Accessible Copies===
It is legal in several countries including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Law of the USA, Chapter 1 Section 121: http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 (England): http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duration==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Little Nemo]] --&gt;
{{main|copyright term|List of countries' copyright length}}
[[File:Copyright term.svg|thumb|left|300px|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for seventy years)]]
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
|title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA|last=Nimmer|first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2003|isbn=  978-9041188762|oclc=50606064|page=63|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/public_domain/ Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2008].&quot;, ''[[Cornell University]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain, except that books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country (see [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/renewals.html How Can I Tell Whether a Copyright Was Renewed] for more details).

But if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries. Some works are covered by copyright in Spain for 80 years after the author's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcu.es/propiedadInt/docs/RDLegislativo_1_1996.pdf Art. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act|The Copyright Term Extension Act]]. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a curiosity, the famous work ''[[Peter and Wendy#Copyright status|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' has a complex &amp;ndash; and disputed &amp;ndash; story of copyright expiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml  |title=Stanford Center for Internet and Society |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061027134508/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright and piracy==
{{main|Copyright infringement}}
[[File:Street hackers and mp3 pirates.jpg|thumb|Street hackers and mp3 pirates in Afghanistan]]
Piracy is considered to be the illegitimate use of materials held by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Lynette (2001) Piracy ''Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers'' 14(1) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; For the history of the term 'piracy' see [[Copyright infringement]]. For a work to be considered pirated, its illegitimate use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws and/or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]]. Improper use of materials outside of this legislation is deemed &quot;unauthorized edition,&quot; not piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Lynette (2001) Piracy ''Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers'' 14(1) p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piracy primarily targets software, film and music. However, the illegal copying of books and other text works remains common, especially for educational reasons. Statistics regarding the effects of piracy are difficult to determine. Studies have attempted to estimate a monetary loss for industries affected by piracy by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, S. Piracy Losses &quot;Billboard&quot; 199(36) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/227212689?accountid=14771&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates in 2007 stated 18.2 billion potential losses in consumer dollars lost as a result of piracy activities in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staff 2007&quot;&gt;Staff (2007) Piracy Statistics around the World &quot;Video Business&quot; 27(28).&lt;/ref&gt; International estimates suggest losses in the billions throughout the last decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staff 2007&quot;/&gt; However other reports indicate that piracy does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/dokumentation/mi/2011/2011-11-30.html&lt;/ref&gt;
