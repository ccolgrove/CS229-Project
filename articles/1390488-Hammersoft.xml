The '''Socialist Party''' (''Partido Socialista'') is a [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[political party]] in [[Argentina]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partidosocialista.com.ar Official web site].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/elecciones/comunicaciones/ppvigentes.asp?dist=25 Political parties of Argentina] (in Spanish) - A list of Argentina's registered political parties, at the Ministry of Interior's website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[socialism]] in Argentina began in the 1890s, when a group of people, notably [[Juan B. Justo]], expressed the need for a greater social focus.

The Socialist Party itself was founded in 1896, led by Justo and [[NicolÃ¡s Repetto]]. The party affiliated itself with the [[Second International]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, JosÃ© Luis. ''Las internacionales obreras en AmÃ©rica''. [[Madrid]]: 1971. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1924 and 1940 it was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]].&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its life, the party suffered from various splits (the [[International Socialist Party]], which became the [[Communist Party of Argentina]]) and the [[Independent Socialist Party (Argentina)|Independent Socialist Party]] were the most notable). The most important of those was in the 1960s, when the party divided itself in half, giving birth to the more radical [[Authentic Socialist Party|Argentine Socialist Party]] (''Partido Socialista Argentino''), and the more moderate [[Democratic Socialist Party (Argentina)|Democratic Socialist Party]] (''Partido Socialista DemocrÃ¡tico''). In 1966, two factions departed the PSA: ''Vanguardia Comunista'' and ''Partido Socialista de Vanguardia''. In 1972, the remaining of the PSA together with other leftist groups formed the [[Popular Socialist Party (Argentina)|Popular Socialist Party]] (''Partido Socialista Popular''). The PSP and PSD were rejoined in 2002, forming the Socialist Party.

Among the socialist leaders of Argentina, the most remarkable are [[Alfredo Palacios]], who was the first socialist parliamentarian in the [[Americas]] (1904) and a [[Argentine Senate|Senator]] in the 1960s; [[Juan B. Justo]], doctor, philosopher, writer and leader of the party until his death in 1928; [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]], (1895â1986), Justo's wife, who was for years the editor of the Socialist newspaper ''La Vanguardia''; [[Guillermo EstÃ©vez Boero]], founder of the Popular Socialist Party; and [[Alfredo Bravo]], a teacher, [[Trade union|unionist]], [[human rights]] militant and respected legislator in the last two decades of the 20th century (died 2003).

The Socialist Party of Argentina has not been a major choice for voters on the national level, but it maintains an electoral stronghold in the province of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and particularly in [[Rosario]], where mayors have been socialists since 1989. Former two-term mayor [[Hermes Binner]] slowly became acknowledged as a reference character for the party. In the [[Elections in Argentina, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]] a Socialist-Radical alliance led by Binner won 5 seats in the national [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Lower House]], and in the elections of 2007 Binner, leading a broad, centre-leftist political coalition (the [[Progressive, Civic and Social Front]]), became the first Socialist to be elected governor of an Argentine province. &lt;ref&gt;La Capital, 3 September 2007.

{{As of|2007}} the current president of the party is [[RubÃ©n Giustiniani]] (Senator for Santa Fe).
