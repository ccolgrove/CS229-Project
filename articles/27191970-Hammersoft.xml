'''Moombahton''' is a sub-genre of [[electronic dance music]] that was created by American [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] and [[music producer|producer]] [[Dave Nada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer |first=Jonathan L. |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/40191/our-year-in-moombahton/ |title=Our Year in Moombahton: How a local DJ created a genre, and why D.C.âs ascendant dance scene couldnât contain it |publisher=Washington City Paper |date=December 24, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (aka Dave Villegas) at a [[High School|high school]] [[homecoming]] &quot;skipping party&quot; for his younger cousin in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the fall of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shepherd |first=Julianne Escobedo |url=http://www.thefader.com/2010/03/05/dave-nada-creator-of-moombahton-interview-mp3s |title=Dave Nada, Creator of Moombahton |publisher=The Fader |date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific event that stimulated Nada's development of the Moombahton genre was his slowing the [[Afrojack]] remix of the [[Silvio Ecomo]] &amp; [[DJ Chuckie]] song &quot;Moombah&quot; to 108 beats per minute, a tempo near that of the [[reggaeton]]. The name of the sub-genre itself comes from the [[portmanteau]] of &quot;moombah&quot; and &quot;reggaeton.&quot;

Between fall 2009 and spring 2010, Nada perfected his vision of the new sub-genre in the [[recording studio]] utilizing intuitions and insights garnered from the &quot;skipping party&quot; experience to create a five track EP of newly-minted Moombahton tracks that was released in March 2010 with the promotional assistance and support of DJ Ayres and DJ Tittsworth at T &amp; A Records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djayres.com/tanda/index.php?/projects/tapr0-dave-nada---moombahton/ |title=Dave Nada - Moombahton |publisher=T&amp;A Records |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, Nada's &quot;Moombahton&quot; was much more than simply &quot;Dutch House pitched down to 108 BPMs.&quot;  The original Moombahton tracks feature not only the standard moombahton 108 BPMs but also: chopped vocals, layered [[a cappella]] vocal tracks, extended and enhanced build-ups and the introduction of new [[drum]]s and [[percussion]] elements.  These are some signature characteristics of the sub-genre. &quot;{{Cn|date=September 2011}}
