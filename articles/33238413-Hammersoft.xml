'''''Most Wanted''''' is the first compilation album by American recording artist [[Hilary Duff]]. Released on August 10, 2005, through [[Hollywood Records]], the album comprises ten previously released tracks (three of which are in a remixed form), and three new recordings: &quot;[[Wake Up (Hilary Duff song)|Wake Up]]&quot;, &quot;[[Beat of My Heart]]&quot;, and &quot;Break My Heart&quot;. A deluxe edition of the album, subtitled ''The Collector's Signature Edition'', was also released, containing additional remixes and another new recording &quot;Supergirl&quot;. At first, Duff was concerned about the reaction of fans to the new songs, since they carry a &quot;totally different sound&quot; and are more dance-oriented than her previous music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilary Draws the Line&quot;/&gt;

Following its release, ''Most Wanted'' received mostly negative reviews from critics, who deemed the release as premature, stating that Duff did not have enough material to warrant a compilation. However, the Executives produced tracks received favorable comments, who wrote that they stood out from the rest of the album. In the United States, the album debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming Duff's second number one album there. It was later certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Elsewhere, it debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand.

Two singles were released from the album. The lead single, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, was released in August 2005, and peaked within the top ten in countries including Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song reached number 29 and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The accompanying [[music video]] features Duff portraying styles from cities over the world like [[London]] and [[Tokyo]]. The second single, &quot;Beat of My Heart&quot;, peaked in the top 20 in countries such as Australia, Italy and Spain. Duff also embarked on a worldwide tour to support the album. Entitled the [[Hilary Duff concert tours#Still Most Wanted Tour|Still Most Wanted Tour]], the tour ran from July 2005 through September 2006.

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] gave a mixed review of ''Most Wanted'', stating that &quot;hardcore fans will be hard-pressed for a reason to add this to their collection&quot; and that the new songsâ&quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;Beat of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Break My Heart&quot;â&quot;sound a bit like leftovers&quot;. Although he wrote that ''Most Wanted'' &quot;isn't a terrible album by any means, it's not particularly a good one, since Duff's two pop albums [''Metamorphosis'' (2003) and ''Hilary Duff'' (2004)] have distinctive personalities that don't necessarily mesh together [...], and are both more fun than this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic Review&quot;/&gt; Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs &quot;seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction&quot; but said that &quot;[the] remaining bulk of this collection is strong.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;About Review&quot;/&gt; Anthony Miccio, from the ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'', wrote that the album &quot;doesn't signify the closure of a brief career&quot; but is &quot;meant to satisfy an audience that won't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;citypaper&quot;/&gt; He noted that Duff's voice was not strong enough and stated that the &quot;rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;citypaper&quot;/&gt; Talia Kraines of [[BBC Music]] commented that &quot;&amp;nbsp;... there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase if you're already the owner of her back catalogue&lt;!-- British spelling--&gt;. But if you're after your first taste of Duff-flavoured&lt;!-- British spelling --&gt; pop to listen to in the background as you do your homework, then this album can do no harm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Review&quot;/&gt;

Spence D. of [[IGN]] stated that &quot;the only draw for this album are the three new tracks and the three remixes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Review&quot;/&gt; He further commented that ''Most Wanted'' is a &quot;filler album&quot; and that &quot;[T]he new songs that are served up still show Duff chasing trends rather than setting them and actively searching for her own voice and image.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Review&quot;/&gt; Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] was critical of the album writing he &quot;literally laughed out loud when I heard the Duffster was releasing a best-of album titled Most Wanted.&quot; He praised the Dead Executives produced tracks and concluded the review by writing that &quot;apparently there aren't even enough bearable moments in Duff's recording career to fill one CD&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant Review&quot;/&gt; Gabriel Leong of [[MTV Southeast Asia]] started the review by writing &quot;A greatest hits album seems a tad flagrant when you've only had two albums so far. So let's call this one a compilation album instead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtvreview&quot;/&gt; Leong noted that the title fitted the album perfectly and that it proves &quot;its innocuous appeal of infectious bubblegum pop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtvreview&quot;/&gt; David Hiltbrand of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' commented that it was &quot;a little early in the career&quot; to release a greatest hits album and that it showcased that &quot;Duff is more product than talent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;philin&quot;/&gt; Aidin Vaziri of ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also commented that it was premature as it was too early in Duff's career to release a greatest hits compilation. He commended the new tracks produced by the Dead Executives writing that they &quot;help alleviate the feeling that this is a total cash grab.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot;/&gt; In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included the album in their Lamest Greatest Hits Albums Ever list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/list-of-the-day-lamest-greatest-hits-albums-ever-20060921|title=List of the Day: Lamest Greatest Hits Albums Ever|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
