The riots were a spontaneous uprising by hundreds of thousands of lower class people protesting [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]-mandated termination of state subsidies on basic foodstuffs. As many as seventy-nine people were killed and 800 wounded in the protests, which were only ended with the deployment of the army and the re-institution of the subsidies.

==Lead Up to Riots==
The riots' origin lay in president [[Anwar Sadat]]'s [[Infitah]] (openness) policy, which had, since he took power at the beginning of the decade, sought to liberalize the economy. In 1976, he sought loans from the World Bank in an effort to relieve the country's debt burden. The bank criticized the state's policy of subsidizing basic foodstuffs, and Sadat announced in January 1977 that it was ending subsidies on flour, rice, and cooking oil and that it would cancel state employee bonuses and pay increases.

==Food Riots==
Popular rejection of the announcement was not long in coming: On January 18 and 19, rioting by lower-class people who would have been hardest hit by the cancellation of the subsidies erupted across the country, from [[Aswan]] in upper Egypt to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;AFP (Jan. 21, 2007). &quot;[http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=5112 30 years after bread riots, Egypt reform moves forward]&quot;, ''Daily News Egypt''. Retrieved on July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For two days, rioters attacked targets that symbolized the prosperity of the middle class and the corruption of the regime, shouting slogans like, &quot;''Ya baá¹­al el-`obÅ«r, fÄn el-fotÅ«r?''&quot; (&quot;Hero of [[Operation Badr (1973)|the Crossing]], where is our breakfast?&quot;) and &quot;Thieves of the Infitah, the people are famished.&quot; There were also shouts of &quot;Nasser, Nasser,&quot; in reference to Sadat's predecessor, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. The rioting ended when the state abruptly canceled the new policies.
