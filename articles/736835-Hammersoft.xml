==Tanker Lease Scandal==
On June 7, 2005 General Jumper apologized to [[John McCain|Senator McCain]] for internal Air Force emails about the Senator in the context of the tanker lease scandal, calling them &quot;unprofessional and not worthy of a great Air Force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/business/08tanker.html Report Faults Air Force on Proposed Boeing Deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thunderbirds &quot;Thundervision&quot; Scandal==
Members of the [[United States Air Force]] were under investigation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for having awarded a $50 million dollar contract for audio-visual presentation services to Strategic Message Solutions of Plymouth Meeting, Pa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/19/national/w141413D78.DTL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/052006G.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/mrs_panstreppon/2006/jun/15/while_the_troops_are_getting_their_heads_blown_off_in_iraq&lt;/ref&gt; The contract involved the &quot;Thundervision&quot; project, meant to provide oversized video screens and perhaps content services during air shows that featured the Air Force Thunderbirds.  The investigation revolves around possible involvement of Jumper, and then Chief of Staff of the Air Force [[T. Michael Moseley]]. It was suggested that the contract price was inflated, because a friend of the two generals, Air Force General (ret.) [[Hal Hornburg]], was associated with Strategic Message Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5858]&lt;/ref&gt;  Two companies involved in the bidding process protested award of the contract, one having offered comparable services for half as much.  The Air Force later cancelled the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/pressreleases/release.asp?storyID=123016466]&lt;/ref&gt;
