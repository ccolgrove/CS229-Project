==Plot==
[[Roger (American Dad!)| Roger]] opens the episode by announcing that they will celebrate their 100th episode by killing off 100 previous characters.
At the Smith house, Jeff is serenading Hayley and Stan starts to shoot him. Hayley begs him not to, although she declares she has no interest in him at the present. When Roger and Steve lose the remote to the television, they decide it's time for another adventure for Wheels and the Legman until Klaus cuts them off and Roger finds he has the remote in his butt. Stan and Francine confront Jeff and tell him that he is not good enough for Hayley, leaving him in tears.

Meanwhile, Bullock has assigned Reginald to be his personal chauffeur. Reginald sees Jeff crying and tries to convince him that Hayley just needs her space. Roger and Steve attempt to keep they Wheels and the Legman fantasy going, but have trouble finding a mystery. Jeff confronts Hayley at Groff Community College and opens up to her. When Stan and Francine return home, they find a note from Hayley that she and Jeff have run off to elope.

Stan reveals he planted a tracking chip in the kids skulls and he and Francine start to follow. Jeff reveals his plans for the future which leave Hayley with regrets. The tracking chip leads Stan and Francine to a gas station where they find Hayley has transferred the chip to a dog. However, Hayley borrowed her mom's credit card and Stan and Francine start to follow where it was used. Fearing they still won't catch up in time, Francine grumbles about the $50,000 they set aside for a dream wedding for Hayley. Stan decides to offer it as a reward to anyone who can stop the wedding, setting off a wild chase.

Stopping at a motel, Hayley becomes depressed about their prospects and goes out for a walk. Jeff sees the reward offer on television and panics. As everyone pursues them to Reginald's amazement, Bullock tells of his sexual escapades with Hayley from &quot;Bullocks To Stan&quot;, angering Reginald who challenges Bullock to a fight.

Jeff calls Stan to take advantage of the reward, offering to leave Hayley in exchange for the money. They meet Jeff at a roadside store where Jeff takes the money and tells them to find Hayley back at the motel where Hayley is desperately trying to avoid everyone trying to capture her. Stan arrives and announces that Jeff was already given the reward. Francine tells her that Jeff is no good and Hayley leaves to get her stuff.

Puzzled when Hayley takes too long to get her stuff, Stan and Francine break into the motel room to find the motel manager had hanged himself. Hayley left a note explaining that they plotted to rip off her parents for the reward money so they could elope in style, although Hayley points out it was Jeff's idea. Stan finally becomes impressed with the resourcefulness of the two as Jeff and Hayley ride off together.

==Cultural references ==
* In the beginning, Roger acts like the Crypt Keeper from the TV series Tales from the Crypt.
* Roger also makes reference to the infamous Simpsons two-part episode, &quot;[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]&quot; where at the end it was revealed it was [[Maggie Simpson]].
* Reginald states that Jeff smells like &quot;cheap weed and applesauce,&quot; paraphrasing a Brady Bunch quote from Peter Brady. Peter asked Alice, the housekeeper, what she was making for dinner and Alice said &quot;pork chops and applesauce&quot;. Peter repeated this line in an accent that sounded like a Bogart or Cagney type manner...&quot;pork chops and applesauce...that's swell&quot;.
* After Stan reads Hayley's letter, he fantasizes flying around the planet and reversing its time like in the original Superman film.
* The artist's rendering of Hayley and Jeff is that of Shaggy Rogers and Velma Dinkley from Scooby-Doo, Where are You? When Jeff sees it, he says, &quot;Zoinks!&quot;, Shaggy's catchphrase from the show.
* The professor demanding to know who solved his math problem and the janitor running away is a reference to the film Good Will Hunting.
* At the end of the episode, Jeff transforms his van into the flying car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang while an instrumental version of the song of the same name from the film of the same name plays in the background.
==Reception==
Rowan Kaiser from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' rated this episode a Grade A-, saying:  Apparently, [[Seth MacFarlane]] thinks that the bait-and-switch is funny. He calls the episode 100 A.D., and puts âStan tries to turn back time...â in the promo blurbs. But if you were hoping for wacky adventures involving Emperor Trajan or a journey to the Han Dynasty at its peak, you'll be sadly disappointed. I can see why the TV Club reviewers have been saying that American Dad is the best of the Fox animated block. There's a real storyline here, with jokes that flow naturally from the characterization, as well as the MacFarlane-style weirdness and profanity. The Principal shows up a couple times, is inappropriate and funny, and then is gone. Likewise, the scenes with Raunchy Patrick Stewart ( and a talking koala fighting over Hayley are great stuff. They make the joke, let the joke play out, and then move back to the main plot. I shouldn't have to praise a show for sticking to the basics of comedy, but let's just call this the soft bigotry of low expectations. If you think it sounds like I'm talking myself into giving this episode a good grade, you're right, and I've succeeded: Grade B+&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/articles/loanalisacleveland-liveexcellence-in-broadcasting1,45839/&lt;/ref&gt;
