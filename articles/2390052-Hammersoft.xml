'''720 ABC Perth''' ([[callsign]]: '''6WF''') is a radio station located in [[Perth, Western Australia]] broadcasting on 720 [[hertz|kHz]] on the [[amplitude modulation|AM]] band.&lt;ref name=&quot;acma1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abcfrequencies1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/perth/programs/frequencies.htm?ref=nav|title=ABC Radio Transmitter Frequencies|work=720 ABC Perth|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station is a member of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[ABC Local Radio]] network.

==History==
{{see also2|[[History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|[[ABC Local Radio]]}}
[[File:ABC Perth gnangarra.JPG|thumb|East Perth Studios]]
Broadcasting began on 6WF on Wednesday 4 June 1924 from a studio in the Westralian Farmers building in Perth. The [[Premier of Western Australia]], [[Philip Collier]] made a speech on-air to mark the opening of the station.&lt;ref name=&quot;westaustralian1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/32461787|title=Some Early History - The Original 6WF|date=8 April 1933|work=The West Australian|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;statelibrary1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/federation/iss/120_comm.htm|title=Communication|work=Western Australia and Federation|publisher=State Library of Western Australia|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station was equipped with a transmitter that was the most powerful allowed under Commonwealth Regulations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The owner [[Wesfarmers|Westralian Farmers Ltd]] started the station with the purpose of providing &quot;information and entertainment to rural areas&quot;. The station's original broadcast footprint covered most of the state of [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;720history1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2005/04/29/1356554.htm|title=The origins of 720|last=Perkins|first=Matthew|date=4 July 2008|work=720 ABC Perth|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wesfarmersheritage1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/U-Z%20-%20A-D/Wesfarmers%20Bldg%20(I-AD).PDF|title=Wesfarmers Building (fmr)|date=23 June 2000|work=REGISTER OF HERITAGE PLACES - ASSESSMENT DOCUMENTATION|publisher=Heritage Council of Western Australia|page=1|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1929 the radio station was sold to the [[History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Company]]. As a result the radio station moved from the Westralian Farmers buildings to the ESA Bank building on the corner of Hay and Milligan Streets in Perth. When the Australian Broadcasting Commission was founded in 1932, 6WF became part of the national network.&lt;ref name=&quot;720history1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;radioadelaide1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.adelaide.edu.au/intro/history_OZ-radio.pdf|title=The History of Australian Radio|work=Radio Adelaide|publisher=University of Adelaide|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station moved again in 1937 to the Stirling Institute building located in the [[Supreme Court Gardens]], [[St Georges Terrace, Perth|St Georges Terrace]]. Despite the fact the building had been built 21 years earlier as a temporary structure it became the home of 6WF for the next 23 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;720history1&quot; /&gt;

In 1960 a specially built 23 studio building complex was completed at 191 [[Adelaide Terrace]] and the station moved there during that year. This building was to provide the home for the [[Western Australian Symphony Orchestra]] for a number of years, running alongside three separate radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;720history1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=stateline1&gt;{{Cite episode |title=6WF celebrates 80 years |episodelink= |series=Stateline Western Australia |serieslink=Stateline (TV program) |credits=Presenters: Rebecca Carmody, Jonathon Beal |network=[[ABC Television]] |station= |airdate=4 June 2004 |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |quote= |language=|transcript=true|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/wa/content/2004/s1127842.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These buildings lasted 45 years, until it was decided that new buildings must be built. A site was commissioned and the radio station moved to its new offices and studios in [[East Perth, Western Australia|East Perth]] in March 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;720history1&quot; /&gt;

The [[Adelaide Terrace]] site was sold to property developers in 2008 who have proposed demolishing the structure and erecting residential buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;wabn1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wabusinessnews.com.au/story/1/81217/Plans-to-demolish-old-ABC-building|title=Plans to demolish old ABC building|last=Fuhrmann|first=Kim|date=15 June 2010|work=Western Australian Business News|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
