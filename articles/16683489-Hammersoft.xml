==Military career==
Prior to joining the [[Royal Marines]] in November 2000,&lt;ref name=MOD /&gt; he was a member of 2030 Squadron [[Air Training Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

He is a member of [[40 Commando]] which is based at [[Taunton]] in [[Somerset]], and serves in the Commando Reconnaissance Force.&lt;ref name=gazette /&gt;

On 9 November 2007 Croucher was credited with helping to save the life of a seriously wounded comrade who had been shot in the chest. Due to the intensity of the [[firefight]], the company medical assistant was [[pinned down]] and could not help for over 20 minutes, during which time Croucher stabilised the casualty until he could be evacuated.  Croucher himself was injured in a road accident during an operation the following week, and had to be returned to the United Kingdom for treatment on a suspected broken leg. After intensive physiotherapy, he returned to Afghanistan in a matter of weeks to resume his duties.&lt;ref name=gazette /&gt;

===Earning the George Cross===
[[File:Croucher, Matt (GC) backpack.JPG|thumb|left|The damaged backpack worn by Croucher along with his medals]]
Croucher was recommended for the award for [[Falling on a grenade|throwing himself]] on a Taliban [[tripwire]] [[hand grenade|grenade]] to save his comrades. He was part of a reconnaissance mission near [[Sangin]] in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] on 9 February 2008. Moving through a compound at night he felt a trip-wire against his leg and saw that he had activated a grenade. He threw himself to the ground, and used his [[Backpack|rucksack]] to pin the grenade to the floor, and tucked his legs up to his body.  He was thrown some distance by the explosion, but due to the protection offered by his rucksack and body-armour, suffered only a nose-bleed, perforated ear drums and some disorientation.  The pack was ripped from his back by the explosion, and his body armour and helmet were pitted by grenade fragments. Of the other three members of his patrol, the rear man managed to take cover by retreating round the corner of a building; the patrol commander threw himself to ground, and received a superficial face wound from a grenade fragment; and the final team member did not have time to react, and remained on his feet, and would have been within the lethal range of the grenade but for Croucher's action.  The explosion breached a large lithium battery which was in Croucher's pack to power the patrol's [[electronic countermeasures]] equipment, causing it to burst into flames.  A medic recommended that he be evacuated, but he insisted on continuing as the members of the patrol realised that Taliban fighters would probably come to investigate the explosion, and this would give the marines the opportunity to ambush them.&lt;ref name=gazette /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Croucher was initially put forward for the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), the highest decoration for valour in the [[British Armed Forces]]. Had he been awarded the Victoria Cross he would have been the first [[Royal Marine]] to receive the award since 1945 and only the second living British recipient in the 21st century.  The George Cross is awarded for the same level of bravery expected of a VC but is awarded when no enemy is present. Croucher is one of only 22 [[List of living George Cross recipients|living recipients of the medal]] of which only 406 have been awarded.&lt;ref name=GCDB&gt;{{Cite web
