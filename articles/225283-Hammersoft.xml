The '''Sri Lankan Civil War''' was a conflict fought on the [[island]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Beginning on July 23, 1983, there was an on-and-off [[insurgency]] against the [[Government of Sri Lanka|government]] by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (the LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers), a [[Separatism|separatist]] militant organization which fought to create an [[Independence|independent]] [[Tamil people|Tamil]] state named [[Tamil Eelam]] in the north and the east of the island. After a 26 year long military campaign, the Sri Lankan military defeated the Tamil Tigers in May 2009.&lt;ref name='mod-defeat'&gt;{{cite news|title=LTTE defeated; Sri Lanka liberated from terror|date=18 May 2009|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090518_10|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 25 years, this civil war caused significant hardships for the population, environment and the [[Economy of Sri Lanka|economy]] of the country, with an estimated 80,000â100,000 people killed during its course.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC200509&quot;/&gt; The tactics employed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam resulted in their being branded as a [[terrorist]] organization in 32 countries, including the [[United States]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the member nations of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam#Proscription as a terrorist group|here]] for related references.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan government forces have also been accused of human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/archive/20071209/focus.htm Tough stand taken on Sri Lanka] The Sunday Leader, December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After two decades of fighting and four failed tries at peace talks, including the unsuccessful [[Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War|deployment of the Indian Army]], the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] from 1987 to 1990, a lasting negotiated settlement to the conflict appeared possible when a cease-fire was declared in December 2001, and a ceasefire agreement signed with international mediation in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;gd1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,655451,00.html|title =Ceasefire raises Sri Lankan peace hopes| publisher = Guardian|date = February 22, 2002|location=London|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, limited hostilities renewed in late 2005 and the conflict began to escalate until the government launched a number of major military offensives against the LTTE beginning in July 2006, driving the LTTE out of the entire [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern province]] of the island.

==Origin and evolution==
{{Main|Origins of the LTTE Insurgency}}
{{Sri Lankan Conflict}}

The root of modern conflict goes back to British colonial rule when the country was known as [[Ceylon]]. A nationalist political movement from [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] communities arose in the country in the early 20th century with the aim of obtaining political independence, which was eventually granted by the British after peaceful negotiations in 1948. Disagreements between the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic communities flared up when drawing up the country's first post-independence constitution.

After their election to the [[State Council of Ceylon|State Council]] in 1936, the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (LSSP) members [[N.M. Perera]] and [[Philip Gunawardena]] demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. In November 1936, a motion that 'in the Municipal and Police Courts of the Island the proceedings should be in the [[vernacular]]' and that 'entries in [[police station]]s should be recorded in the language in which they are originally stated' were passed by the State Council and referred to the Legal Secretary. However, in 1944, [[J.R. Jayawardene]] moved in the State Council that [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] should replace [[English language|English]] as the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr.J.R.Jayawardene on 'Sinhala Only and Tamil Also' in the Ceylon State Council|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/indictment/indict004.htm#Mr.J.R.Jayawardene}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 Prime Minister [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]]'s passage of the &quot;[[Sinhala Only Act]]&quot; led to ethnic riots. The civil war is a direct result of the escalation of the confrontational politics that followed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In 1963, shortly after the nationalisation of oil companies by the Sri Lankan government, documents relating to a separate Tamil state of '[[Tamil Eelam]]' began to circulate. At this time, [[Anton Balasingham]], an employee of the British [[High Commission]] in Colombo, began to participate in separatist activities. He later migrated to Britain, where he became the chief theoretician of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. In the late 1960s, several Tamil youth, among them [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] also became involved in these activities. These forces together formed the [[Tamil New Tigers]] in 1972. This was formed around an ideology which looked back to the 1st Millennium [[Chola Empire]] â the Tiger was the emblem of that empire.

A further movement, the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students, formed in [[Manchester]] and [[London]]; it became the backbone of the Eelamist movement in the diaspora, arranging passports and employment for immigrants and levying a heavy tax on them. It became the basis of the Eelamist logistical organization, later taken over entirely by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]].

The formation of the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF) with its Vaddukkodei (Vattukottai) resolution of 1976 led to a hardening of attitudes.

The TULF supported the armed actions of the young militants of the TNT who were dubbed &quot;our boys&quot;. These &quot;boys&quot; were the product of the post-war population explosion. Many partially educated, unemployed Tamil youth fell for revolutionary solutions to their problems. The leftist parties had remained &quot;non-communal&quot; for a long time, but the Federal Party (as well as its off-shoot, the TULF), deeply conservative and dominated by Vellala casteism, did not attempt to form a national alliance with the leftists in their fight for language rights.

Following the sweeping electoral victory of the [[UNP]] in July 1977, the TULF became the leading opposition party, with around one sixth of the total electoral vote winning on a party platform of secession from Sri Lanka.

In August 1977, Junius Richard Jayawardene's new UNP government began it's ethnic cleansing process against Tamils living in majority Sinhalese areas. In August the government granted only the educational rights demanded by the Tamils.&lt;ref name=&quot;kms&quot;&gt;ch. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; But to the Tamil leadership that was losing the control it had on the Tamil militants after not being able to follow through with the election promise of seceding from Sri Lanka to form Tamil, it was too little too late.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Outbreak of civil war==
{{Politics of Sri Lanka}}
{{Main|Four Four Bravo|Eelam War I}}
Supported by the on-going politics of conflict in Sri Lanka, politicized Tamil youth in the north and the east started to form [[List of Tamil militant groups|militant groups]]. These groups developed independently of the Colombo Tamil leadership, and in the end rejected and annihilated them. The most prominent of these groups was the TNT, which changed its name to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam or the [[LTTE]] in 1976. The LTTE initially carried out a campaign of violence against the state, particularly targeting policemen and also moderate Tamil politicians who attempted a dialogue with the government. Their first major operation was the assassination of the mayor of Jaffna, [[Alfred Duraiappah]] in 1975 by Prabhakaran.

The LTTE 's ''modus operandi'' of the early war was based on assassinations, whereas the mode of operation for the UNP was systematic ethnic cleansing through a series of checkpoints set up around the city. The assassination in 1977 of a Tamil Member of Parliament, M. Canagaratnam, was carried out personally by Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE.&lt;ref&gt;Narayan Swamy, &quot;Inside an Elusive Mind-Prabhakaran&quot; Konark Publishers, New Delhi, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1983, the LTTE launched a deadly ambush on a [[Sri Lanka Army]] check point [[Four Four Bravo]] outside the town of [[Thirunelveli (Sri Lanka)|Thirunelveli]], killing an officer and 12 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DC09Df04.html|title =Whirlpool of Violence, Sri Lanka: The Untold Story|publisher =Asia Times| year =2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the nationalistic sentiments to their advantage, the Jayawardena organized massacres and [[pogrom]]s in [[Colombo]]{{ref}}, the capital, and elsewhere (see [[Black July]]). Between 400 and 3,000 Tamils were estimated to have been killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3090111.stm|title = Twenty years on â riots that led to war|publisher = BBC News| date = 23 July 2003|accessdate=January 4, 2010|first=Frances|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many more fled Sinhalese-majority areas. This is usually considered the beginning of the civil war.

Apart from the LTTE, there initially was a plethora of militant groups. The LTTE's position, adopted from that of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]], was that there should be only one. Initially, the LTTE gained prominence due to devastating attacks such as the [[Kent and Dollar Farm massacres|massacre of civilians at the Kent and Dollar Farms]] in 1984 and the [[Anuradhapura massacre|Anuradhapura massacre of 146 civilians]] in 1985. The Anuradhapura massacre was apparently answered by government forces with the [[Kumudini boat massacre]] in which over 23 Tamil civilians died. Over time, the LTTE merged with or largely exterminated almost all the other militant Tamil groups. As a result, many Tamil splinter groups ended up working with the Sri Lankan government as [[paramilitaries]] or denounced violence and joined mainstream politics, and some legitimate Tamil-oriented political parties remain, all opposed to LTTE's vision of an independent state.

Peace talks between the LTTE and the government began in [[Thimphu]] in 1985, but they soon failed, and the war continued. In 1986, many civilians were [[Akkaraipattu massacre|massacred]] as part of this conflict. In 1987, government troops pushed the LTTE fighters to the northern city of [[Jaffna]]. In April 1987, the conflict exploded with ferocity, as both the government forces and the LTTE fighters engaged in a series of bloody operations.

The Sri Lankan military launched an offensive, called âOperation Liberationâ or âVadamarachchi Operationâ, during MayâJune 1987, to regain control of the territory in the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE. This offensive marked the Sri Lankan military's first conventional warfare on Sri Lankan soil since independence. The offensive was successful, and the LTTE leader Prabhakaran and the [[Sea Tiger]] leader Soosai narrowly escaped from advancing troops at Valvettithurai. The key military personnel involved in the operation were Lt Col. Vipul Boteju, Lt Col. Sarath Jayawardane, Col. [[Vijaya Wimalaratne]], Brig. [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]] and Maj. [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]].

In July 1987, the LTTE carried out their first [[suicide]] attack. &quot;[[Captain Miller]]&quot; of the [[Black Tigers]] drove a small truck carrying explosives through the wall of a fortified Sri Lankan army camp, reportedly killing forty soldiers. They carried out over 170 [[suicide attack]]s, more than any other organization in the world, and the suicide attack became a trademark of the LTTE and a characteristic of the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;janes1&quot;&gt;''Jane's Information Group'', [http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/usscole/jir001020_1_n.shtml Suicide terrorism: a global threat].&lt;/ref&gt;

The killings of Father [[Mary Bastian]] and [[George Jeyarajasingham]], both human rights activists, have been attributed to the government forces. These are but two examples of the thousands murdered in this period.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;pc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://storage.paxchristi.net/AP29E97.pdf#search=%22Fr.%20Mary%20Bastian%20%22|title= Speaking truth to power:the human rights situation in Sri Lanka|accessdate=26 March 2006 |work=Paxchristi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian involvement==

[[India]] became involved in the conflict in the 1980s for a number of reasons, including its leaders' desire to project India as the regional power in the area and worries about India's own Tamils seeking independence. The latter was particularly strong in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], where ethnic kinship led to strong support for independence for Sri Lankan Tamils. Throughout the conflict, the Indian central and state governments have supported both sides in different ways. Beginning in the 1980s, India, through its intelligence agency [[Research and Analysis Wing|R&amp;AW]], provided arms, training and monetary support to a number of Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups, including the LTTE and its rival [[Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization]] (TELO) {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. The LTTE's rise is widely attributed to the initial backing it received from R&amp;AW. It is believed that by supporting different militant groups, the Indian government hoped to keep the Tamil independence movement divided and be able to exert overt control over it.&lt;ref name=&quot;at1&quot;&gt;''Asia Times'' [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/FC26Df04.html Who's behind the LTTE split?].&lt;/ref&gt;

India became more actively involved in the late 1980s, and on June 5, 1987, the [[Indian Air Force]] [[Operation Poomalai|airdropped food parcels]] to [[Jaffna]] while it was [[Operation Liberation|under siege]] by Sri Lankan forces. At a time when the Sri Lankan government stated they were close to defeating the LTTE, India dropped 25 tons of food and medicine by parachute into areas held by the LTTE in a direct move of support toward the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B0DE0D8173FF936A35755C0A961948260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fWorld%2fCountries%20and%20Territories%2fIndia| title = India airlifts aid to tamil rebels| work = STEVEN R. WEISMAN|publisher = New York Times| date = 5 June 1987|first=Steven R.|last=Weisman|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were held, and the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord]] was signed on July 29, 1987, by Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and Sri Lankan President [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|Jayewardene]]. Under this accord, the Sri Lankan Government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, including [[devolution]] of power to the [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|provinces]], a mergerâsubject to later referendumâof the Northern and the Eastern provinces into the [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|single province]], and official status for the Tamil language (this was enacted as the 13th Amendment to the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka]]). India agreed to establish order in the North and East through a force dubbed the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and to cease assisting Tamil insurgents. Militant groups including the LTTE, although initially reluctant, agreed to surrender their arms to the IPKF, which initially oversaw a cease-fire and a modest [[disarmament]] of the militant groups.

The signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord, so soon after JR Jayawardene's declaration that he would fight the Indians to the last bullet, led to unrest in south. The arrival of the IPKF to take over control of most areas in the North of the country enabled the Sri Lanka government to shift its forces to the south (in Indian aircraft) to quell the protests. This led to an [[Insurrection 1987-89|uprising]] by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] in the south, which was put down bloodily over the next two years.
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:IPKF SL 1.JPG|thumb|300px|left|The IPKF was forced to withdraw from Sri Lanka due to opposition from both sides of the conflict]] --&gt;

While most Tamil militant groups laid down their weapons and agreed to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict, the LTTE refused to disarm its fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;cp1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.chinapost.com.tw/latestnews/20061228/43353.htm| title =Tamil rebels abduct 2 rivals, Sri Lankan military says| agency = Associated Press|date = 12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen to ensure the success of the accord, the IPKF then tried to demobilize the LTTE by force and ended up in full-scale conflict with them. The three year long conflict was also marked by the IPKF being accused of committing various abuses of human rights by many human rights groups as well as some within the Indian media. The IPKF also soon met stiff opposition from the Tamils.&lt;ref&gt;Balasingham, Adele. (2003) ''The Will to Freedom â An Inside View of Tamil Resistance''. Fairmax Publishing Ltd, 2nd ed. ISBN 1-903679-03-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NorthEast Secretariat report on Human rights 1974â2004 (see Further Reading section).&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, nationalist sentiment led many Sinhalese to oppose the continued Indian presence in Sri Lanka. These led to the Sri Lankan government's call for India to quit the island, and they allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a ceasefire. The LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent hostilities, and according to some reports, the Sri Lankan government even armed the rebels in order to see the back of the Indian forces.&lt;ref&gt;Dissanayaka, T.D.S.A.: &quot;War or Peace in Sri Lanka, Volume II&quot;, p. 332. Swastika (Pvt.) Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although casualties among the IPKF mounted, and calls for the withdrawal of the IPKF from both sides of the Sri Lankan conflict grew, Gandhi refused to remove the IPKF from Sri Lanka. However, following his defeat in Indian parliamentary elections in December 1989, the new prime Minister [[V. P. Singh]] ordered the withdrawal of the IPKF, and their last ship left Sri Lanka on March 24, 1990. The 32 month presence of the IPKF in Sri Lanka resulted in the deaths of 1100 Indian soldiers and over 5000 Sri Lankans. The cost for the Indian government was estimated at over 20 billion rupees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Rajiv Gandhi's assassination===
Support for the LTTE in India dropped considerably in 1991, after the assassination of ex-Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] by suicide bomber [[Thenmuli Rajaratnam]]. The Indian press has subsequently reported that Prabhakaran decided to eliminate Gandhi as he considered Gandhi to be against the Tamil liberation struggle and feared that Gandhi might re-induct the IPKF, which Prabhakaran termed the &quot;satanic force&quot;, if he won the 1991 Indian elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/28rajiv3.htm| title = Prabhakaran had Rajiv killed for being 'anti-Tamil'| publisher = Rediff| date = 31 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 a court in India presided over by Special Judge V. Navaneetham found the LTTE and its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran responsible for the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/28rajiv.htm| title = 26 sentenced to death for Rajiv Gandhi's assassination| publisher = Rediff| date = 31 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 2006 interview, LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham stated regret over the assassination, although he stopped short of outright acceptance of responsibility for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.ndtv.com/template/template.asp?template=Lanka&amp;slug=LTTE+regrets+Rajiv+assassination%3A+Anton&amp;id=19706&amp;callid=0| title = LTTE regrets Rajiv assassination: Anton| publisher = NDTV.com| date = 28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.wtop.com/index.php?nid=385&amp;sid=833337|title = Tiger Apologizes for Rajiv Gandhi's Death| publisher = Associated Press via WTOP|date = 27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India remains an outside observer to the ongoing peace process, with frequent demands by many groups for an extradition of [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]], now deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1932835.stm|title = Tamil Nadu demands Tiger extradition| publisher = BBC |date = 16 April 2006|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan-Tamil support===
In 2008, the central coalition in India was rocked by threats, resignations, and arrests based on [[Tamil nationalism]], and hence support to Tamils in Sri Lanka. Following the historically pro-Tamil DMK party's accession to power in Tamil Nadu and the centre, it was seen as though there would be more political support from India. In 2008, party chief and TN CM [[Karunanidhi]] accepted the [[United Progressive Alliance#DMK|resignation of multiple MP's]] of his party in protest against an increasing casualty count of Tamil civilians in the war. Following this, MDMK founder and [[general secretary]], [[Vaiko]], courted arrest on charges of sedition in saying he would take up arms to fight on the side of the Tamils. He then charged the Indian Government with abetting the Sri Lankan Government in order to eliminate the Tamils there. He added that Sri Lanka would heed a request for a ceasefire if India imposed economic sanctions on the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressbuzz.com/edition/story.aspx?Title=%E2%80%98Impose+economic+sanctions+on+Lanka%E2%80%99&amp;artid=jaOZ19vtMzY=&amp;SectionID=vBlkz7JCFvA=&amp;MainSectionID=vBlkz7JCFvA=&amp;SectionName=EL7znOtxBM3qzgMyXZKtxw==&amp;SEO= Impose economic sanctions on Lanka].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rare show of unanimity, all the parties in Tamil Nadu assembly unanimously demanded a ceasefire in conflict, while appealing to the Centre to make efforts to stop the Sri Lankan military offensive.

Even the Congress party, which had seen the issue as an untouchable subject for more than a decade, said there could be no two opinions on the need for a ceasefire. To this, party floor leader, D Sudarsanam, said that the Centre was making efforts to stop the war and the results would soon be known. Congress whip, Peter Alphonse, denied that his party was acting against the interests of the Sri Lankan Tamils and said he was ready to list his party's efforts for the welfare of the said Tamils. The deputy leader of the opposition and senior AIADMK leader, O Panneerselvam, made a charge that the &quot;intransigent attitude&quot; of the Sri Lankan government was the reason for the continuation of the war. He added that the Sri Lankan army was bombing schools and public places that had resulted in the deaths of innocent people, including children.

The LTTE, which was cornered in a tiny section of the island, desperately pleaded with the Indian Tamil parties to demand a ceasefire, in order to save their leadership from annihilation, which led to several Indian Tamil politicians requesting the Sri Lankan Government to call for an immediate ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=2&amp;theme=&amp;usrsess=1&amp;id=230675].{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eelam War II==
{{Main|Eelam War II}}
{{See also|List of attacks attributed to the LTTE}}
In the 1980s and 1990s, successive governments enacted a number of official acts to appease the Tamil community, including recognizing Tamil as an [[official language]] and merging the Northern and the Eastern Provinces of the country.

Yet the violence continued, as the LTTE continued to massacre innocent villagers living in the deep rural Eastern and North-Eastern areas, and the UNP responding with more ethnic cleansing of native Tamils.  The Dollar and Kent Farm massacres, where hundreds of men, women and children were attacked during the night as they slept and were hacked to death with fatal blows to the head from axes, are two clear examples of the acts committed by the LTTE. Some of the men who defended themselves were executed their hands tied behind their backs. The LTTE used these terror tactics to scare Sinhalese and Muslim farmers away from these areas and swiftly took control of significant parts of the North, which could also be considered an act of ethnic cleansing. When the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] withdrew, the LTTE established many government-like functions in the areas under its control. A tentative ceasefire held in 1990 as the LTTE occupied itself with destroying rival Tamil groups while the government cracked down on the JVP uprising. When both major combatants had established their power bases, they turned on each other and the ceasefire broke down. The government launched an offensive to try to retake Jaffna.

This phase of the war soon acquired the name ''Eelam War II''. It was marked by unprecedented brutality. The LTTE [[1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers|massacred 600-774 Policemen after they had surrendered]] on promises of safe conduct. The government placed an embargo on food and medicine entering the Jaffna peninsula and the air force relentlessly bombed LTTE targets in the area. The LTTE responded by [[List of attacks attributed to the LTTE#1990|attacking Sinhalese and Muslim villages]] and massacring civilians. One of the largest civilian massacres of the war occurred when the LTTE [[Palliyagodella massacre|massacred 166 Muslim civilians at Palliyagodella]]. The government trained and armed Home Guard Muslim units then took revenge on Tamil villages. There was also significant massacre of Tamil civilians attributed to government forces, especially in the Eastern Province. Notable international jurist [[Neelan Thiruchelvam]], in a speech at the ICES-Colombo, indicated that the appropriate investigations into [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] and [[forced disappearances|disappearances]] of civilians including many children in the [[Sathurukondan massacre|Sathurukondan]], [[Eastern University massacre|Eastern University]], [[Mylanthanai massacre|Mylanthanai]] and the mass murder and burial of school children at [[Sooriyakanda mass grave|Sooriyakanda]] were hampered by the adoption of [[emergency]] [[regulations]] which were contributing to a climate of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icescolombo.org/Neelan/ps060994.htm Speech by Neelan Tiruchelvam at the Debate on the Emergency].&lt;/ref&gt; Along roadsides in the North and East, burning bodies became a common sight. Throughout the country, government death squads hunted down, kidnapped, or killed Sinhalese or Tamil youth suspected of being JVP or LTTE sympathizers, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hrw.org/reports/1990/WR90/ASIA.BOU-11.htm#P718_161127 |title= Sri Lanka|accessdate= 7 August 2006|year= 1990|publisher= [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1990, the LTTE [[Expulsion of Muslims from Jaffna|expelled all the Muslims residing in Jaffna]]. A total of 28,000 Muslims were forced to leave their homes taking nothing but the clothes on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;http://uthayam.net/articles/

The largest battle of the war was in July 1991, when the army's [[Elephant Pass]] (Alimankada) base, which controlled access to the Yapanaya (Jaffna) peninsula, was surrounded by 5,000 LTTE troops. More than 2,000 died on both sides in the month-long siege, before 10,000 government troops arrived to relieve the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hrw.org/reports/1992/WR92/ASW-14.htm#P860_317153 |title= Sri Lanka|accessdate= 7 August 2006|year= 1992|publisher= [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1992, another series of government offensives failed to capture Jaffna due to Indian intervention, which led to a military stand-off as Indian threatened to invade Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Government backed off and ordered the withdrawal of its forces, only days away from capturing LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabharan, whilst he lay surrounded in his home town of Vellvetithurai. Lt. General [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]] together with Major General [[Vijaya Wimalaratne]] and [[Rear Admiral]] [[Mohan Jayamaha]], died on August 8, 1992, at Araly (Aeraella) point [[Jaffna]] due to a [[land mine]] blast, which badly affected military morale.

The LTTE, for its part, scored a major victory when one of their suicide bombers killed Sri Lankan President [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] in May 1993. In November 1993 the LTTE succeeded in the [[Battle of Pooneryn]].

==Eelam War III==
{{Main|Eelam War III}}
In the 1994 parliamentary elections, the UNP was defeated and, amidst great hope, the [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]], headed by [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], came to power on a peace platform. [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] won the presidential elections as well after the LTTE assassinated the opposition leader [[Gamini Dissanayake]]. A ceasefire was agreed in January 1995, but the ensuing negotiations proved fruitless. The LTTE broke the ceasefire on April 19 and thus began the next phase of the war, dubbed ''Eelam War III''.&lt;ref name=&quot;hrw2&quot;&gt;''Human Rights Watch'', [http://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/WR96/Asia-08.htm SRI LANKA Human Rights Developments].&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government then pursued a policy of &quot;war for peace&quot;. Determined to retake the key rebel stronghold of Jaffna, which was occupied by 2,000 rebels,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60714F7385D0C778EDDA80994DD494D81|title= Sri Lanka Says It Has Sealed Rebel Stronghold|accessdate= 9 March 2007|date= November 24, 1995|publisher= New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; it poured troops into the peninsula. In one particular incident in August 1995, Air Force jets bombed St. Peter's church at Navali (Naavaella), [[Navaly Church massacre|killing]] at least 65 refugees and wounding 150 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57jmas?opendocument|title= Sri Lanka: displaced civilians killed in air strike|accessdate= 7 August 2006|date= 11 July 1995|publisher= International Committee of the Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government troops initially cut off the peninsula from the rest of the island,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;/&gt; and then after 7 weeks of heavy fighting succeeded in bringing Jaffna under government control for the first time in nearly a decade. In a high profile ceremony, Sri Lankan Defense Minister Anurudda Ratwatte raised the national flag inside the Jaffna fort on December 5, 1995. The government estimated that approximately 2500 soldiers and rebels were killed in the offensive, and an estimated 7,000 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9512/sri_lanka/index.html|title= Sri Lankan army hails capture of Jaffna|accessdate= 9 March 2007|date= December 5, 1995|publisher= CNN |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050206004515/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9512/sri_lanka/index.html |archivedate = February 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many civilians were killed as part of this conflict such as the [[Navaly church bombing]] in which over 125 civilians died. The LTTE and more than 350,000 civilians, compelled by LTTE pressure to leave Jaffna,&lt;ref name=&quot;hrw1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/WR97/ASIA-06.htm#P487_223952|title= Sri Lanka|accessdate= 7 August 2006|year= 1997|publisher= [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; fled to the [[Vanni region]] in the interior. Most of the refugees returned later the next year.

The LTTE responded by launching [[Operation Unceasing Waves I|Operation Unceasing Waves]] and decisively won the [[Battle of Mullaitivu (1996)|Battle of Mullaitivu]] in July 1996.

The government launched another offensive in August 1996. Another 200,000 civilians fled the violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;hrw1&quot;/&gt; The town of [[Kilinochchi]] (GiraaNikke) was taken on September 29. On May 13, 1997, 20,000 government troops tried to open a supply line through the LTTE-controlled Vanni, but failed. Civilians were regularly killed and wounded by both sides.

As violence continued in the North, LTTE suicide and time bombs were exploded numerous times in populated city areas and public transport in the south of the country, killing hundreds of civilians. In January 1996, the LTTE carried out one of their deadliest suicide bomb attacks at the [[Central Bank Bombing|Central Bank]] in Colombo, killing 90 and injuring 1,400. In October 1997 they bombed the Sri Lankan World Trade Centre and, in January 1998, detonated a truck bomb in [[Kandy]] (Mahanuvara), damaging the [[Temple of the Tooth]], one of the holiest Buddhist shrines in the world. In response to this bombing, the Sri Lankan government outlawed the LTTE and with some success pressed other governments around the world to do the same, significantly interfering with their fund-raising activities.

On September 27, 1998, the LTTE launched the [[Operation Unceasing Waves II]] and after heavy fighting captured Kilinochchi, thus winning [[1998 Battle of Kilinochchi|Battle of Kilinochchi]].

In March 1999, in Operation Rana Gosa, the government tried invading the Vanni from the south. The army made some gains, taking control of Oddusuddan (Oththan-thuduva) and Madhu, but could not dislodge the LTTE from the region. In September 1999 the LTTE [[Gonagala massacre|massacred 50 Sinhalese civilians at Gonagala]]

The LTTE returned to the offensive with the [[Operation Unceasing Waves III]] on November 2, 1999. Nearly all the Vanni rapidly fell back into LTTE hands. The LTTE launched 17 successful attacks in the region which culminated in the overrunning of the Paranthan (Puranthaenna) Chemicals Factory base and the Kurrakkan Kaddukulam (kurakkan-kaela vaeva) base.&lt;ref name=&quot;tamilnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=16249|title= Sixth anniversary of Unceasing Waves-III commemorated|accessdate= 9 February 2009|date=November 3, 2005|publisher=Tamilnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands were killed in the fighting. The rebels also advanced north towards Elephant Pass (Alimankada) and Jaffna (Yapanaya). The LTTE was successful in cutting all land and sea supply lines of the Sri Lankan armed forces to the south, west and north of the town of Kilinochchi. In December 1999 the LTTE attempted to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga in a suicide attack at a pre-election rally. She lost one eye, among other injuries, but was able to defeat opposition leader [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] in the Presidential election and was reelected for her second term in office.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99dec23/head1.htm|title= Chandrikare-elected President|accessdate= 7 August 2006|date= December 23, 1999|publisher=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2000, the Elephant Pass military complex, which had separated the Jaffna peninsula from the Vanni mainland for 17 years, completely fell to the hands of the LTTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/apr2000/sri-a25.shtml |title= Military debacle at Elephant Pass set to trigger political crisis in Sri Lanka|accessdate= 7 August 2006|date= 25 April 2000|publisher= World Socialist Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brcslproject.gn.apc.org/slmonitor/april2000/tiger.html|title= Tigers seize Elephant Pass|accessdate= 7 August 2006|publisher= Sri Lanka Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army then launched Operation Agni Khiela to take back the southern Jaffna Peninsula, but sustained losses. The LTTE continued to press towards Jaffna, and many feared it would fall to the LTTE, but the military repulsed LTTE offensives and was able to maintain control of the city.

===Early peace efforts===

Exhaustion with the war was building as casualties mounted and there appeared to be no end in sight. By mid-2000, human rights groups estimated that more than one million people in Sri Lanka were [[internally displaced persons]], living in camps, homeless and struggling for survival. As a result, a significant [[peace movement]] developed in the late 1990s, with many organizations holding peace camps, conferences, trainings and peace meditations, and many other efforts to bridge the two sides at all levels. As early as February 2000, [[Norway]] was asked to mediate by both sides, and initial international diplomatic moves began to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/627281.stm |title= Norway role in Sri Lanka peace plan|date=February 1, 2000|work=Susannah Price|publisher= BBC News|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopes for peace gained ground as the LTTE declared a unilateral ceasefire in December 2000, but they canceled it on April 24, 2001, and launched another offensive against the government. After securing a vast area controlled by the military, the LTTE further advanced northwards. This advancement of the LTTE was posing a serious threat to the Elephant Pass (Alimankada) military complex that housed 17,000 troops of the Sri Lankan forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.flonnet.com/fl1708/17080520.htm |title= Another LTTE offensive|accessdate= 7 August 2006|date=April 15â28, 2000|publisher= Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, the LTTE carried out a devastating [[Bandaranaike Airport attack|suicide attack on Bandaranaike International Airport]], destroying eight of the air force's planes (2 [[IAI Kfir]]s, 1 [[Mil Mi-17|Mil-17]], 1 [[Mil Mi-24|Mil-24]], 3 [[Hongdu JL-8|K-8 trainers]], 1 [[Mikoyan MiG-27|MiG-27]]) and four [[Sri Lankan Airlines]] planes (2 [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A330|A330]]s, 1 [[Airbus A340|A340]] and 1 [[Airbus A320|A320]]), dampening the economy and causing tourism, a vital foreign exchange earner for the government, to plummet.

==2002 peace process==
===Beginning of the ceasefire===

Towards the end of 2001, however, following the attacks of [[September 11 attacks]], the LTTE began to declare their willingness to explore measures for a peaceful settlement to the conflict. The LTTE are believed to have taken this action after fear of international pressure and even direct US support of the Sri Lankan Government as part of the War on Terror.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbct&quot;/&gt; In the south, the government was facing increasing criticism over its &quot;war for peace&quot; strategy, with peace nowhere in sight, and the economy in tatters. After losing a no-confidence motion, President Kumaratunga was forced to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections. The [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2001|elections, held on December 5, 2001]], saw a sweeping victory for the [[United National Front (Sri Lanka)|United National Front]], led by [[Ranil Wickremasinghe]], who campaigned on a pro-peace platform and pledged to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict.

On December 19, amidst efforts by Norway to bring the government and the Tamil Tigers to the negotiating table, the LTTE announced a 30 day ceasefire with the Sri Lankan government and pledged to halt all attacks against government forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1719133.stm|title =Sri Lanka rebels announce truce| publisher = BBC News|date = December 19, 2001|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government welcomed the move, and reciprocated it 2 days later, announcing a month long ceasefire and agreeing to lift a long standing economic [[embargo]] on rebel-held territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbct&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1723419.stm|title =Sri Lanka enters truce with rebels| publisher = BBC News|date = December 21, 2001|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signing of Memorandum of Understanding===

[[File:Sea Tiger Fast Attack boat.jpg|thumb|left|250px|LTTE Sea Tiger boat patrolling during the peace.]]
The two sides formalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on February 22, 2002, and signed a permanent ceasefire agreement (CFA). Norway was named [[mediation|mediator]], and it was decided that they, together with the other Nordic countries, monitor the ceasefire through a committee of experts named the [[Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1835737.stm|title =Sri Lanka seals truce deal|publisher = BBC News|date = February 22, 2002]|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the government agreed to lift the ban on the LTTE and paved the way for the resumption of direct negotiations with the LTTE.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2217189.stm|title =Colombo lifts ban on Tamil Tigers| publisher = BBC News|date = August 26, 2002|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the signing of the ceasefire agreement, commercial air flights to Jaffna began and the LTTE opened the key A9 highway, which linked government controlled area in the south with Jaffna and ran through LTTE territory, allowing civilian traffic through the Vanni region for the first time in many years, but only after paying a tax to the LTTE. Many foreign countries also offered substantial financial support if peace was achieved and optimism grew that an end to the decades-long conflict was in sight.

The much-anticipated peace talks began in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], [[Thailand]] on September 16, and 5 further rounds followed in Phuket, Norway and [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc5&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2260047.stm|title =Upbeat opening for Sri Lanka talks |publisher = BBC News|date = September 16, 2002|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the talks, both sides agreed to the principle of a federal solution and the Tigers dropped their long-standing demand for separate state. This was a key compromise from the LTTE, which had always insisted on an independent Tamil state and it also represented a compromise from the government, which had seldom agreed to more than minimal devolution. Both sides also exchanged prisoners of war for first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbct&quot;&gt;''BBC News'', [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1166237.stm Timeline: Sri Lanka].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political changes in the South===

Following the elections of 2001, for the first time in Sri Lanka's history, the President and Prime Minister were of two different parties. This co-habitation was uneasy, especially since Prime Minister Wickremasinghe and the [[United National Party|UNP]] favoured a federal solution to the conflict, while hard-line elements within President Kumaratunga's party and other Sinhala nationalist groups allied to her opposed one as they did not trust the LTTE, which continued to levy taxes, strengthen themselves by smuggling in arms and ammunition, recruit child soldiers, and engage in killings of members of rival Tamil groups and government intelligence agents. During this time the LTTE also succeeded in setting up a series of vital bases around the Trincomalee (Gokanna) harbour (see [[Eelam War IV]]) and the Eastern Province.

The talks broke down on April 21, 2003, when the Tamil Tigers announced they were suspending any further talks due to their &quot;displeasure&quot; at the handling of some &quot;critical issues&quot;. Among the reasons the Tigers gave were their exclusion from reconstruction talks in Washington DC on April 14 and a more general insinuation that they were not receiving the full economic rewards of peace. They cited the failure, as they saw it, of peace-dividends to transfer to security withdrawals on the ground and the disparity, as they saw it, between the relative calm of the government-held northeast and continuing violence in Tiger-held areas. However, the LTTE maintained it was committed to a settlement to the two-decade conflict, but stated that progress had to be made on the ground before the settlement proceeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc6&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2964349.stm|title =Tamil Tigers call off peace talks| publisher = BBC News|date = April 21, 2003|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, the LTTE issued its own peace proposal, calling for an ''[[Interim Self Governing Authority]]'' (ISGA). The ISGA would be fully controlled by the LTTE and would have broad powers in the North and East. (see the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3232913.stm Full text of the proposals]) This provoked a strong backlash among the hardline elements in the South, who accused Prime Minister Wickremasinghe of handing the North and East to the LTTE. Under pressure from within her own party to take action, Kumaratunga declared a state of emergency and took three key government ministries, the Ministry of Mass Media, the Interior Ministry and the crucial Defense Ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc7&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3239303.stm|title =Sri Lanka thrown into political crisis| publisher = BBC News|date = November 4, 2003|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then formed an alliance with the JVP, called the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]], opposed to the ISGA and advocating a harder line on the LTTE, and called for fresh elections. The [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2004|elections]], held on April 8, 2004, resulted in victory for the UPFA with [[Mahinda Rajapakse]] appointed as Prime Minister. Initial fears of a resumption of the conflict were proved unfounded when the new government expressed its desire to continue the peace process and find a negotiated settlement to the conflict.

===Split of the LTTE===
Meanwhile, in March 2004 there had been a major fracturing between the northern and eastern wings of the LTTE. [[Colonel Karuna]], the Eastern commander of the LTTE and one of Prabhakaran's trusted lieutenants, pulled 5,000 eastern cadres out of the LTTE, claiming insufficient resources and power were being given to Tamils of the eastern part of the island. It was the biggest expression of dissension in the history of the LTTE and a civil war within the LTTE seemed imminent. After the parliamentary elections, brief fighting south of Trincomalee (formerly known as Gokanna) led to a rapid retreat and capitulation of Karuna's group, their leaders eventually going into hiding including Karuna himself, who was helped to escape by [[Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana]], a powerful politician from the ruling party. However, the &quot;Karuna faction&quot; maintained a significant presence in the East and continued to launch attacks against the LTTE.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/world/asia/31lanka.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title =Sri Lanka Says Rebels Took Losses in Raids| publisher = New York Times|date = December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE accuses the army of covertly backing the breakaway group, which subsequently formed a political party named the [[TamilEela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal]] (TMVP) and hopes to contest in future elections.

The ceasefire largely held through all this turmoil, with over 3000 infractions by the LTTE and some 300 by the SLA recorded by the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) by 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Lanka peace secretariat report, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was further complicated by allegations that both sides were carrying out covert operations against each other. The government claimed that the LTTE was killing political opponents, recruiting children, importing arms, and killing government security and intelligence officers. The rebels accused the government of supporting paramilitary groups against them, especially the Karuna group.

===Tsunami and aftermath===
On December 26, 2004, the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] hit Sri Lanka, killing more than 30,000 people, and leaving many more homeless. Aid poured in from donor countries, but disagreements arose instantly over how it should be distributed to the Tamil regions under LTTE control. By June 24, the government and LTTE agreed on the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure (P-TOMS), but it received sharp criticism from the JVP, who left the government in protest.
The legality of P-TOMS was also challenged in the courts. President Kumaratunga eventually had to scrap P-TOMS, which led to widespread criticism that sufficient aid was not reaching the North and East of the country. However, immediately following the tsunami there was a marked decrease in violence in the North.

Sri Lankan Foreign Minister [[Lakshman Kadirgamar]], a Tamil who was highly respected by foreign diplomats and who had been sharply critical of the LTTE, was assassinated at his home on August 12, 2005, allegedly by an LTTE sniper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4147196.stm |title=Senior Sri Lanka minister killed |accessdate=13 August 2005 |work=BBC News|date=August 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assassination led to the marginalization of the LTTE from the international community, and is thought to be the instant when the LTTE lost much of its sympathy in the eyes of foreign nations. Hence the silence of the international community when the Sri Lankan government took military action against the LTTE in 2006, when the latter closed the Mavil Oya (Mavil aru) sluice.

Further political change occurred when the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]] declared President Kumaratunga's second and final term over and ordered her to hold fresh presidential elections. The main candidates for the [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 2005|election]], which was held in November, were the UNF candidate, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, who advocated the reopening of talks with the LTTE, and the UPFA candidate, Prime Minister Rajapaksa, who called for a tougher line against the LTTE and a renegotiation of the ceasefire. The LTTE openly called for a [[boycott]] of the election by the Tamils. Many of them were expected to vote for Wickremasinghe, and the loss of their votes proved fatal to his chances as Rajapakse achieved a narrow win.

Following the election, the LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] stated in his annual address that the Tigers would &quot;renew their struggle&quot; in 2006 if the government did not take serious moves toward peace.

==Resumption of hostilities==
{{Main|Eelam War IV}}
Just days after Prabhakaran's speech, a new round of violence erupted. Beginning in December 2005, there was increased guerrilla activity to the northeast, including [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]] attacks which killed 150 government troops,&lt;ref name=&quot;st1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.sundaytimes.lk/060430/index.html|title =How President decided on retaliation| publisher = The Sunday Times|date = April 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; clashes between the [[Sea Tigers]] and the Sri Lanka navy, and the killings of sympathizers on both sides including [[Taraki Sivaram]], a pro-LTTE journalist, and [[Joseph Pararajasingham]], a pro-LTTE MP allegedly by the government of Sri Lanka.

At the beginning of 2008, the focus of the civil war turned to civilian targets, with commuter bus and train bombings carried out in most parts of the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7440183.stm|title=Sri Lanka's war turns on civilians|work=BBC News|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=January 4, 2010|first=Frances|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;
including a series of attacks against commuters in and around Colombo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/BCADEB7F-1755-4499-8719-C5E4181273B7.htm Deadly bus bombings hit Sri Lanka].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talks and further violence===

In light of this violence, the co-chairs of the [[Tokyo]] Donor conference called on both parties to return to the negotiating table. The co-chairsâthe United States in particularâwere heavily critical of the violence perpetrated by the LTTE. [[US State Department]] officials, as well as the US ambassador to Sri Lanka, gave warnings to the Tigers claiming a return to hostilities would mean that the Tigers would face a &quot;more capable and more determined&quot; Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article338232.ece| title =Sri Lanka bomb attack fuels fear of return to civil war| work =Justin Huggle|publisher = [[The Independent]]|date = January 13, 2006|location=London|first=Justin|last=Huggler|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the talks were going on there was violence targeted towards civilians such as [[2006 Trincomalee massacre|massacre of 5 Tamil students]] on January 2, 2006, in [[Trincomalee]] when high school students playing by the beach were briefly detained and then shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.lk/2006/07/23/newsfe3.htm|title=Is the State complacent?|accessdate=30 January 2007 |work=The Nation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930224026/http://www.nation.lk/2006/07/23/newsfe3.htm |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2006statements/612/|title='Murder of five Tamil youths highlights need to end impunity' â Govt must protect witnesses to Trinco killings â HRW|accessdate=30 January 2007 |work=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a last-minute effort to salvage an agreement between the parties, the Norwegian special envoy [[Erik Solheim]] and the LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham arrived in the island. The parties severely disagreed on the location of the talks; however, continued efforts produced a breakthrough when both parties agreed on February 7, 2006, that new talks could be held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] on February 22 and February 23. These talks were reported to have gone &quot;above expectations&quot;, with both the government and the LTTE agreeing to curb the violence and to hold further talks on April 19â21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4742208.stm|title = Sri Lanka foes to 'curb violence'| publisher = BBC News| date = February 24, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the weeks after the talks, there was a significant decrease in violence. However, the LTTE resumed attacks against the military in April beginning with a [[Claymore]] anti-personnel mine attack on military vehicles which killed 10 navy sailors on April 11. The following day, coordinated bombings by rebels and rioting in the north-eastern part of the country left 16 dead. First, a [[M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine|Claymore anti-personnel mine]] exploded in [[Trincomalee]], killing two policemen in their vehicle. Another blast, set off in a crowded vegetable market, killed one soldier and some civilians. Ensuing rioting by civilians left more than a dozen dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4901952.stm|title = Sri Lanka violence leaves 16 dead| publisher = BBC News|date = April 12, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for these attacks was claimed by an organisation called the [[Upsurging People's Force]], which the military accused of being a front for the LTTE.

In light of this violence, the LTTE called for a postponement of the Geneva talks until April 24â25, and the government initially agreed to this. Following negotiations, both the government and the rebels agreed to have a civilian vessel transport the regional LTTE leaders with international truce monitors on April 16, which involved crossing government-controlled territory. However, the climate shifted drastically when the Tamil Tigers canceled the meeting, claiming not to have agreed to a naval escort. According to the SLMM, the Tamil rebels had previously agreed to the escort. This led to Helen Olafsdottir, spokesperson for the SLMM saying &quot;It was part of the agreement. The rebels should have read the clauses carefully. We are frustrated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc8&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4911554.stm|title = Tamil Tigers harden talks stance| publisher = BBC News| date = April 17, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2006, the LTTE officially pulled out of peace talks indefinitely. While they stated that transportation issues had prevented them from meeting their regional leaders, some analysts and the international community held a deep skepticism, seeing the transportation issue as a delaying tactic by the LTTE in order to avoid attending peace talks in Geneva.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc9&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/04/printable/060423_eu_ban.shtml|title = EU ban on LTTE urged| publisher = BBC News|date = April 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence continued to spiral and on April 23, 2006, [[Gomarankadawala massacre|six Sinhalese rice farmers were massacred]] in their paddy fields by suspected LTTE cadres in the [[Trincomalee]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/COL157189.htm]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2009}} The following day, two suspected Tamil Tiger rebels were shot dead in [[Batticaloa]] when caught planting mines after rebels reportedly hacked a young mother to death and kidnapped her infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4937624.stm |title = 'Eight die' in Sri Lanka violence |publisher = BBC News|date = April 24, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After LTTE launched a suicide assault on a naval convoy in which 18 sailors died, the [[Allaipiddy massacre]] of May 13, 2006, happened in which 13 minority [[Sri Lankan Tamil|Tamil]] civilians were killed in separate incidents in three villages in the [[List of islands of Sri Lanka#Northern Province|islet of Kayts (Uruthota)]] in northern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|first = Dumeetha|last = Luthra|title = Sri Lanka villagers flee massacre|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5000920.stm|work = [[BBC]]|date = May 20, 2006|accessdate = 16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
International condemnation against the LTTE skyrocketed following the attempted assassination of the commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Lieutenant General [[Sarath Fonseka]] by a pregnant LTTE Black Tiger [[suicide bomber]] [[Anoja Kugenthirasah]], who blew herself up at the [[Sri Lankan Army]] headquarters in the capital, [[Colombo]]. Lt. Gen. Fonseka and twenty-seven others were injured, while ten people were killed in the attack. For the first time since the 2001 ceasefire, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out aerial assaults on rebel positions in the north-eastern part of the island nation in retaliation for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4941744.stm |title = Bomb targets Sri Lanka army chief |publisher = BBC News|date = April 25, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This attack, along with the assassination of Lakshman Kadiragamar a year earlier and an unsuccessful attack against a naval vessel carrying 710 unarmed security force personnel on holiday, proved the catalysts as the European Union decided to proscribe the LTTE as a terrorist organisation on May 19, 2006. It resulted in the freezing of LTTE assets in the member nations of the EU, and put an end to its efforts to raise funds its campaign in Sri Lanka. In a statement, the [[European Parliament]] said that the LTTE did not represent all the Tamils and called on it to &quot;allow for political pluralism and alternate democratic voices in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/31/stories/2006053117200100.htm| title =European Union bans LTTE| work =Amit Baruah|publisher = The Hindu|date = May 31, 2006|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the North and East of the country continued to be rocked by attacks, new talks were scheduled in Oslo, Norway, between June 8â9. Delegations from both sides arrived in Oslo, but the talks were canceled when the LTTE refused to meet directly with the government delegation claiming its fighters were not been allowed safe passage to travel to the talks. Norwegian mediator Erik Solheim told journalists that the LTTE should take direct responsibility for the collapse of the talks.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/06/060609_saroj-oslo.shtml| title =Collapse of talks|work =Saroj Pathirana|publisher = BBC News|date = June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further violence followed, including the [[Vankalai massacre]] in which a family of four minority [[Sri Lankan Tamil]]s from the village of [[Vankalai]] in the district of [[Mannar District|Mannar]] in Sri Lanka on June 8, 2006, were tortured and killed. Both the mother and the nine year old daughter were allegedly raped before being killed. The gory images of the corpses published by the pro rebel [[Tamilnet]] news site created controversy in Sri Lanka and abroad. The Sri Lankan army and [[Tamil Tiger]] rebels have blamed each other for the killings.&lt;ref name=ml&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.themorningleader.lk/20060614/focus.html |title= Another family wiped out in Vankalai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hhr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhr-srilanka.org/hhr/news/summary.pdf|title=Details of few extra judicial claims|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AN&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=6425|title = People terrorized after massacre of Tamil family}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.peacewomen.org/resources/Human_Rights/Statement_womensgroup.html |title=Statement by women for democracy and human rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs06/sri_lanka_021106.doc|title=Country of origin information reportâ Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.peacewomen.org/resources/Human_Rights/Statement_womensgroup.html|

===Mavil Aru water dispute===
A new crisis leading to the first large-scale fighting since signing of the ceasefire occurred when the LTTE closed the [[sluice gate]]s of the Mavil Oya ([[Mavil Aru]]) [[reservoir]] on July 21 and cut the [[water supply]] to 15,000 villages in government controlled areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc12&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5249884.stm|title = Sri Lanka forces attack reservoir|publisher = BBC News|date=August 6, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial negotiations and efforts by the SLMM to open the gates failed, the Air Force attacked LTTE positions on July 26, and ground troops began an operation to open the gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.dailymirror.lk/2006/07/27/front/6.asp|title = Air Force jets hit LTTE targets|work =Sunil Jayasiri|publisher = The Daily Mirror| date =July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sluice gates were eventually reopened on August 8, with conflicting reports as to who actually opened them. Initially, the SLMM claimed that they managed to persuade the LTTE to lift the waterway blockade conditionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;fline1&quot;/&gt; However a government spokesman said that &quot;utilities could not be used as bargaining tools&quot; by the rebels&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc12&quot;/&gt; and government forces launched fresh attacks on LTTE positions around the reservoir. These attacks prompted condemnation from SLMM Chief of Staff, who stated &quot;(The government) have the information that the LTTE has made this offer.&quot; &quot;It is quite obvious they are not interested in water. They are interested in something else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc12&quot;/&gt; The LTTE then claimed they opened the sluice gates &quot;on humanitarian grounds&quot; although this was disputed by military correspondents, who stated the water began flowing immediately after the security forces carried out a precise bombing of the Mavil Aru anicut.&lt;ref name=&quot;st2&quot;&gt;''The Sunday Times Situation Report'', [http://sundaytimes.lk/060813/index.html Eelam war IV rages on several fronts].&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, following heavy fighting with the rebels, government troops gained full control of the Mavil Aru reservoir on August 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;jw1&quot;&gt;''Iqbal Athas, Jane's Defence Weekly,'' [http://www.janes.com/defence/news/jdw/jdw060817_1_n.shtml Full-scale fighting flares in Sri Lanka].&lt;/ref&gt;

===LTTE offensives in Muttur and Jaffna===
As fierce fighting was ongoing in the vicinity of (Mavil Oya) Mavil Aru, the violence spread to Gokanna (Trincomalee), where the LTTE launched an attack on a crucial Sri Lanka Navy base,&lt;ref name=&quot;fline1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2316/stories/20060825001405400.htm |title = Water war |work = B.

Soon afterwards, 17 persons working for the International French charity [[Action Against Hunger]] (ACF) in Mooduthara (Muthur), [[2006 Trincomalee massacre of NGO workers|were found executed]].

Meanwhile, in the north of the country, some of the bloodiest fighting since 2001 took place after the LTTE launched massive attacks on [[Sri Lanka Army]] defence lines in the Jaffna peninsula on August 11. The LTTE used a force of 400 to 500 fighters in the attacks which consisted of land and amphibious assaults, and also fired a barrage of artillery at government positions, including the key military airbase at Paluyaala ([[Palaly]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200608121801.htm|title = At least 127 combatants killed in Lanka fighting: military |publisher = The Hindu| date = August 12, 2006|location=Chennai, India|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Tigers broke through army defense lines around Muhamalai (Mahakanda), and advanced further north,&lt;ref name=&quot;oi1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.oneindia.in/2006/08/12/sri-lanka-rebels-say-destroy-northern-defences-advance-1155353635.html|title = Lanka rebels destroy northern defenses, advance |publisher = One India| date = August 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were halted after 10 hours of fierce fighting.

===Chencholai air strike===
As ground battles were ongoing in the North and the East of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Air Force carried out an air strike against a facility in the rebel held Mullaitivu area, [[Chencholai airstrike|killing a number of Tamil girls]]. Although the LTTE claimed 61 girls were killed, the SLMM stated they were able to count just 19 bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.monstersandcritics.com/southasia/article_1190181.php/61_girls_killed_in_airstrike_8_dead_in_Colombo_blast__2nd_Roundup_|title = SLMM counted 19 Bodies|publisher = monstersandcritics.com |date = August 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government stated that it was an LTTE training facility and that the children were LTTE child soldiers,&lt;ref name=&quot;mg1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/&amp;articleid=280855|title = Unicef: Bombed orphans were not Tamil Tigers |publisher = [[Mail and Guardian Online]] |date = August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the LTTE claimed the victims were schoolgirls attending a course on first aid at an orphanage.&lt;ref name=&quot;mg1&quot;/&gt;

===Attack on the Pakistani High Commissioner===

{{Main|Attack on Pakistani ambassador to Sri lanka}}
On the same day, a convoy carrying the [[Pakistan]]i [[High Commissioner]] to Sri Lanka [[Bashir Wali Mohamed]] was attacked by a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|claymore antipersonnel mine]] concealed within an [[auto rickshaw]]. The High Commissioner escaped unhurt, but seven people were killed and a further seventeen injured in the blast.&lt;ref name=&quot;ndtv1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/template/template.asp?id=20040&amp;template=Lanka&amp;callid=0&amp;frmsrch=1&amp;txtsrch=Lanka|title=Lanka blast: Pak envoy safe, 7 killed|author = Rica Roy &amp; Anisa Khan |date=August 14, 2006|publisher =NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Sri Lankan government blamed the LTTE. The [[Pakistan]]i [[High Commissioner]], [[Bashir Wali Mohamed]], claimed that India was strongly believed to have carried it out,&lt;ref name=&quot;at2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HI22Df01.html|title=The Pakistani muscle behind Colombo|author = Sudha Ramachandran|date= September 22, 2006|publisher =Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to intimidate Pakistan, which is one of the main suppliers of military equipment to the Sri Lankan government.&lt;ref name=&quot;at2&quot;/&gt; Pakistan had promised one shipload of the wherewithal every 10 days in coming months, it was Pakistanâs assurance of solid support which prompted Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse to publicly state that Kilinochchi, the headquarters of the LTTE, would be liberated by the end of December.

===Fall of Sampur===
Since the resumption of violence, concerns were mounting among the military establishment that the strategically crucial&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=COL24804|title = Sri Lanka army battles rebels in northeast|work = Peter Apps|publisher = Reuters |date = September 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka Navy base in Trincomalee was under grave threat from LTTE gun positions located in and around Sampur, which lies across the Koddiyar Bay from Trincomalee.&lt;ref name=&quot;saag1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.saag.org/%5Cnotes4%5Cnote331.html|title = Sri Lanka: LTTE's moment of truth at Sampur â Update 101|work = Col R Hariharan (retd.)|publisher = South Asai Analysis Group |date = September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu4&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/05/stories/2006090505251300.htm|title = Sri Lankan army captures Sampur|work = B.

All movements of naval vessels were also under the constant surveillance of the LTTE.&lt;ref name=&quot;saag1&quot;/&gt; These fears were backed up by a United States military advisory team which visited the island in 2005.

Following the clashes in Mavil Aru (Mavil Oya) and Muttur (Mooduthara), the LTTE had intensified attacks targeting the naval base in Trincomalee (Gokanna),&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu4&quot;/&gt; and in a speech on August 21, Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapakse made clear the government intentions were to neutralize the LTTE threat from Sampur.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu4&quot;/&gt; On August 28, the Sri Lankan military launched an assault to retake the LTTE camps in Sampur and the adjoining Kaddaiparichchan (Gaeta-bara-hena)and Thoppur (Thupapura) areas. This led the LTTE to declare that if the offensive continued, the ceasefire would be officially over.

After steady progress, Sri Lankan security forces led by Brigade Commander Sarath Wijesinghe&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu5&quot;/&gt; re-captured Sampur (Somapura) from the LTTE on September 4, and began to establish military bases there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=ax6hzULkWuCE|title = Sri Lanka Army captures Sampur |publisher = [[Bloomberg.com]] |date = September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the LTTE admitted defeat and stated their cadres &quot;withdrew&quot; from the strategically important town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/09/060904_sampoor_defeat.shtml| title = LTTE admits defeat in Sampoor|publisher = BBC |date = September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the first significant territorial change of hands since the signing of the ceasefire agreement in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/04/asia/AS_GEN_Sri_Lanka.php|title = Sri Lankan military captures key rebel territory, Tigers vow to keep fighting|publisher = International Herald Tribune |date = September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan Military estimated that 33 personnel were killed in the offensive, along with over 200 LTTE cadres.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu5&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/12/stories/2006091204601400.htm|title = Fierce battles continue in Jaffna|work = B.

===LTTE retaliation and further peace talks===
The LTTE struck back in October. First, they killed nearly 130 soldiers in a fierce battle at Muhamalai (Mahakanda), the crossing-point between government and LTTE controlled area in the north of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.dailymirror.lk/2006/10/18/front/1.asp|title = No repeat of Muhamalai, President warns; orders full probe into debacle |work =Poorna Rodrigo and Sunil Jayasiri |publisher = The Daily Mirror|date=October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just days later, a suspected LTTE suicide bomber [[2006 Digampathana truck bombing|struck a naval convoy]] in Habaraba, in the center of the country killing about 100 sailors who were returning home on leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.playfuls.com/news_10_1683-Bloodbath-in-Sri-Lanka-At-Least-100-Unarmed-Sailors-Dead.html|title = Bloodbath in Sri Lanka: At Least 100 Unarmed Sailors Dead |publisher = Playfuls.com|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6045866.stm| title = Analysis: Sri Lanka military setbacks|publisher = BBC |date = October 16, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2010|first=Dumeetha|last=Luthra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deadliest suicide attack in the history of the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;zaman1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&amp;alt=&amp;hn=37451|title = Bloody Day in Sri Lanka: 103 Dead |publisher =Zaman Daily|date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, LTTE Sea Tiger cadres launched an attack against the ''Dakshina'' naval base in the southern port city of [[Galle]]. It was the farthest south any major LTTE attack had taken place, and involved 15 LTTE cadres who arrived in five suicide boats. The attack was repulsed by the government, and the damage to the naval base was minimum. All 15 LTTE suicide cadres are believed to have died in the attack, along with one Sri Lanka Navy sailor.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu6&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/19/stories/2006101915420100.htm|title = LTTE attack on Galle repulsed |work =B.

Despite these incidents, both parties agreed to unconditionally attend peace talks in Geneva on October 28â29.&lt;ref name=&quot;car1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://conflict-religion.boker.tv/news/conflicts/hinduism/sri_lanka_tamil_tigers_ok_talks_with_sri_lanka_tamil_tigers_agree_to_unconditional_talks_with_sri_lankan_government|title = Sri Lanka â Tamil Tigers OK Talks With Sri Lanka: Tamil Tigers Agree to Unconditional Talks With Sri Lankan Government |work =BHARATHA MALLAWARACHI |publisher = Conflict and Religion|date=October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the peace talks broke down due to disagreements over the reopening of the key A9 highway, which is the link between Jaffna and government controlled areas in the south. While the LTTE wanted the highway, which was closed following fierce battles in August, to be reopened, the government refused, stating the LTTE would use it to collect tax from people passing through and would use it to launch further offensives against government troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/29/europe/EU_GEN_Switzerland_Sri_Lanka_Talks.php|title = Sri Lankan peace talks end in deadlock over road blockade |publisher = International Herald tribune|date=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the dawn of the new year, suspected [[LTTE]] cadres carried out two bus bombings in the south of the country, killing 21 civilians. News reports stated that the attacks bore all the hallmarks of an LTTE attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;an1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/COL157334.htm| title =Fear and loathing in south Sri Lanka after bus bombs| work =Buddhika Weerasinghe|publisher = Reuters|date = January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan government condemned the attacks and blamed the LTTE for carrying them out,&lt;ref name=&quot;mcns1&quot;&gt;''Media Center for National Security'', [http://www.nationalsecurity.lk/fullnews.php?id=3298 The Government Condemns LTTE Terror Attacks on Civilians].&lt;/ref&gt; although the LTTE denied any involvement. Iqbal Athas, an analyst for Jane's Defence Weekly commented that the LTTE's targeting of civilians was a cause for concern, and that further attacks against civilians could not be ruled out.&lt;ref name=&quot;glp1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://godlikeproductions.com/news/item.php?keyid=11224&amp;category=1| title =Suspected suicide bomber attacks S. Lanka bus| work =Simon Gardner|publisher = Reuters|date = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts too expressed fears that LTTE attacks, which had largely been confined to military and political targets during the ceasefire period, may now increasingly target civilians as in earlier stages of a conflict.

===Government offensive in the East===
{{Main|Eastern Theater of Eelam War IV}}
{{See also|Operation Definite Victory}}
In December 2006, the Commander of the Army and other senior government officials expressed their plans to initially drive the LTTE out of the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] of Sri Lanka, and then use the full strength of the military to defeat the LTTE in the North of the country.&lt;ref name=dm1&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.dailymirror.lk/2007/01/03/front/5.asp|title =Jaffna next, Army Chief tells Mahanayakes| publisher = Daily Mirror|date = January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons cited by the military for the offensives in the East were the need to &quot;free the civilians in the area from the LTTE&quot;, who the military stated was firing artillery towards civilian settlements and were using 35,000 people as human shields.&lt;ref name=reuters-12/14/2006&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/COL298949.htm|title =Sri Lanka military vows to drive Tigers from east coast| publisher = Reuters|date = December 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were later backed by the civilians who told reporters that they were held by force by the Tamil Tigers.&lt;ref name=iht-12/18/2006&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/18/asia/AS_GEN_Sri_Lanka_Refugees.php|title =Fleeing Tamil refugees describe being held by separatists as Sri Lanka shelled camps| publisher = International Herald Tribune|date = December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, 2006, in the midst of conflicting claims over 45 Tamil civilians were killed in what is known as the [[Vaharai bombing]].

[[Image:Eastern peoples' victory monument.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Victory monument at Karadiyanaru junction.]]
Subsequently, the Army began an offensive against the LTTE on December 8, 2006, in the Batticoloa district with the objective of taking [[Vakarai]], the principle stronghold of the LTTE in the East,&lt;ref name=Hindu-12/9/06&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200612091430.htm|title =Heavy fighting in Sri Lanka's restive east, 13 injured| publisher = The Hindu|date = December 9, 2006|location=Chennai, India|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but temporarily aborted it after a week of fighting due to the large number of civilians in the area and the difficulty in conducting combat operations due to the ongoing [[Monsoon]] rain.&lt;ref name=saloon-12/16/06&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.salon.com/wire/ap/archive.html?wire=D8M22IEO0.html|title =3,000 Tamils Flee to Escape Fighting| work =GEMUNU AMARASINGHE|publisher = The Hindu|date = December 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few weeks, an estimated 20,000 civilians fled from Vaakare to Government controlled areas fearing the imminent assault. The Army launched a new offensive in mid January, and Vaakarr fell to the advancing troops on January 19, 2007. While the offensive in the East was ongoing, the LTTE and others accused the government of murdering 15 civilians in the [[Padahuthurai bombing]] on January 2, 2007, when the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] bombed what they claimed to be rebel [[LTTE]] naval base in Illuppaikadavai in Northern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/01/02/sri_lankan_air_force_says_tamil_base_hit/

The Army launched assaults from three different directions, and the LTTE and Defence Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella announced that &quot;The people of Vaakare have been liberated from the clutches of the terrorists&quot;. The loss of Vaakare (Vakarai) has been predicted to cut off supply routes of the northern Tigers to their cadres in the East, thus weakening the Tigers' already diminishing grip on the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/4211|title = Tigers admit fall of Vakarai |publisher = Asian Tribune| date = January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/4208|title =Sri Lanka Security forces captured LTTE controlled Vaharai|publisher = Asian Tribune| date = January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the military offensive was ongoing, the LTTE continued to carry out attacks against civilians in government held territory. On April 1, 2007, the Sri Lankan military accused the LTTE of killing six Sinhalese tsunami aid workers in the Eastern district of Batticaloa.&lt;ref name='smh-4/2/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka says rebels killed aid workers|date=April 2, 2007|url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Sri-Lanka-says-rebels-killed-aid-workers/2007/04/02/1175366108841.html|work =Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='toi-4/2/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=Tamil Tigers kill 6 civilian workers in Lanka|date=2 April 2007|url =http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/World/Rest_of_World/Tamil_Tigers_kill_6_civilian_workers_in_Lanka/articleshow/1842392.cms|work =Times of India|accessdate = 22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, suspected LTTE cadres set off a bomb aboard a civilian bus in Ampara which killed seventeen people, including three children.&lt;ref name='bbc-4/2/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka blast 'kills civilians'|date=2 April 2007|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6517167.stm|work =BBC|accessdate = 22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='mod-bus-4/2/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=Seventeen persons killed, over two dozens injured- Ampara [4th Lead]|date=2 April 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20070402_07|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops mostly operating in small groups of Special Forces and Commando units began a new operation in February&lt;ref name='ra-4/12/07'/&gt; to clear the last remaining LTTE cadres from the Eastern Province. As part of the operation, troops captured the key LTTE base in Gokatugolla ([[Kokkadicholai]]) on March 28,&lt;ref name='mod-kkd-3/28/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=Kokkadicholai LTTE base falls to SL Army|date=28 March 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20070328_06|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the strategic A5 highway on April 12, bringing the entire highway under government control for the first time in 15 years.&lt;ref name='mod-a5-4/12/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=SL Army Troops gain complete control over the A-5 Main Road|date=12 April 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20070411_07|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant the LTTE's presence in the East was reduced to a 140 square kilometer pocket of jungle land in the Thoppigala area north-west of Madakalapuva (Batticaloa). The offensive had left nine soldiers dead along with 184 Tiger cadres, with no civilian casualties, according to military estimates.&lt;ref name='ra-4/12/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka captures key highway in rebel territory|date=12 April 2007|url =http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s1895901.htm|work =Radio Australia|accessdate = 22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government offensive in the North. Targeting LTTE leadership===
{{Main|2008â2009 SLA Northern offensive}}

Sporadic fighting in the North had been going on for months, but the intensity of the clashes increased after September 2007. During clashes in the Forward Defence Lines, separating their forces, both sides exchanged heavy artillery fire, after which military incursions followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7046629.stm|title = Sri Lanka on brink of all-out war|publisher = BBC News| date = October 16, 2007|accessdate = 31 December 2007|first=Ethirajan|last=Anbarasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By December 22, 2007, the LTTE defences at Uyilankulama and Thampanai were lost to advancing troops of the Sri Lanka Army.&lt;ref name='mod-ma-12/22/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=LTTE defences in Mannar and Vavuniya fall to army; terrorists on the run with soaring casualties|date=December 22, 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071222_08|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 29, 2007, the Army overran the LTTE stronghold at Parappakandal, in [[Mannar District]].&lt;ref name='mod-ma-12/29/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=SLA overruns LTTE stronghold: several LTTE leaders injured- Mannar|date=29 December 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071229_04|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='mod-ma-12/30/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=33 terrorists killed, 38 wounded: SLA overruns LTTE stronghold- Mannar|date=30 December 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071230_02|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Sunday Observer]]'' the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said that the Army had occupied the LTTE's Forward Defence Lines and surrounded the Wanni LTTE bases from all directions. He also said that there were around 3,000 Tigers remaining and that the military intended to annihilate them within the first six months of the next year.&lt;ref name='mod-no-12/30/07'&gt;{{cite news|title=Wanni is surrounded on all prongs|date=December 30, 2007|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20071230_05|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A day later there were less optimistic statements by Army, Air Force and Navy Commanders. The Army was to face an estimated 5,000 Tiger cadres in the Wanni. The Commander of the Army intended to shift the current battles in the Forward Defence Lines to a decisive phase in August 2008.

===Significant military gains by the government===

On August 2, 2008, Vellankulam town, the LTTE's last stronghold in [[Mannar District]], fell to the advancing SLA troops, completing the eight-month effort to recapture the district.&lt;ref name='mod-ma-08/02/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=Troops capture LTTE's last stronghold in Mannar District|date=August 2, 2008|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20080802_06|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Army followed this up by taking control of [[Mallavi]] on September 2, following weeks of heavy military confrontation.&lt;ref name='mod-ma-09/02/08'&gt;{{cite news|title = LTTE's strategic bastion Mallavi falls to security forces|date=September 2, 2008|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20080902_07|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE countered with a surprise attack on the [[Vavuniya]] air base on September 9, in which both sides claimed victory.&lt;ref name='mod-va-09/09/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Forces crush major terror attack at Vavuniya|date=September 9, 2008|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20080909_02|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='mod-tn-09/09/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=Mission on Vanni SF HQ successful, Tiger aircrafts safe â LTTE|date=September 9, 2008|url =http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=26876|work =TamilNet|accessdate = 10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-09/10/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka jets attack rebel base|date=September 10, 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7607610.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Mannar, the Army had entered [[Kilinochchi District]], the last stronghold of the LTTE, at the end of July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gamini Gunaratna, Sri Lanka News Paper by LankaPage.com (LLC)- Latest Hot News from Sri Lanka |url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_08/August1145347CH.html |title=Sri Lankan troops enter Tigersâ final frontier |publisher=Colombopage.com |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of taking [[Kilinochchi]] before the end of the year. On October 3, 2008, a UN aid convoy managed to unload all its cargo in Kilinochchi District and described Kilinochchi town as having been nearly abandoned,&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-10/03/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=Civilians flee Tamil Tiger centre|date=October 10, 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7651232.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 3 October 2008|first=Swaminathan|last=Natarajan}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the LTTE were able to kill retired Major General [[Janaka Perera]] along with 26 other victims in a suicide blast on October 6.&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-10/06/08'&gt;{{cite news|title = Suicide blast hits Sri Lanka town|date=October 6, 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7653945.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 6 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2008, SLA troops cut off the Mannar-Poonaryn (A-32) road north of Nachchikuda, the main remaining [[Sea Tiger]] stronghold on the northwestern coast of the island, thus effectively encircling it.&lt;ref name='mod-ki-10/17/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=Troops encircle Nachchikudha; LTTE on the verge of losing Sea Tiger stronghold|date=October 17, 2008|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20081017_07|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began their assault on October 28 and captured it the next day.&lt;ref name='mod-ki-10/28/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=SLA crush LTTE defences: fall of Nachchikuda imminent|date=October 28, 2008|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20081028_08|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='mod-ki-10/29/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=Nachchikuda falls to troops â Kilinochchi|date=October 29, 2008|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20081029_08|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the situation of more than 200,000 civilians who had been displaced in the latest round of fighting was turning into a humanitarian disaster; however, due to a number of reasons including doubts regarding the sincerity of the LTTE's negotiations, neither Western governments nor India intervened to broker a new ceasefire.&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-10/17/08-2'&gt;{{cite news|title=West urged not to ignore Sri Lanka|date=October 17, 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7676839.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 18 October 2008|first=Ethirajan|last=Anbarasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Kilinochchi and subsequent events===
{{Main|Battle of Kilinochchi (2008â2009)}}

The Sri Lankan Army began the attack on Kilinochchi on November 23, 2008. Troops were attacking rebels' defences from three directions.&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-11/24/08'&gt;{{cite news|title=S Lanka attack on rebel 'capital'|date=November 24, 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7745162.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the LTTE offered a stiff resistance, and the prolonged attack resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-12/17/08'&gt;{{cite news|title='Many dead' in Sri Lanka battles|date=December 17, 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7786183.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until January 1, 2009, were SLA troops able to capture [[Paranthan]], located to the north of Kilinochchi along the A-9 route. This isolated the southern periphery of the Elephant Pass LTTE foothold and also exposed the LTTE's main fortification at Kilinochchi.&lt;ref name='mod-ki-01/01/09'&gt;{{cite news|title=Paranthan LTTE garrison captured: Troops make headway at Wanni battles|date=January 1, 2009|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090101_01|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the capture of Kilinochchi, which the rebels had used for over a decade as their de facto administrative capital, far simpler, and they were able to accomplish this on January 2. The loss of Killinochchi caused a substantial dent in the LTTE's image as a capable, ruthless terrorist group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/03/content_10596928.htm |title=The fall of rebel headquarters: what does it hold for Sri Lanka? |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=3 January 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observers forecasted the LTTE was likely to collapse before long under unbearable military pressure on multiple fronts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2009/01/03/editorial.html A blow to global terror].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers quickly abandoned their positions on the Jaffna peninsula to make a last stand in the jungles of [[Mullaitivu]], their last main base.&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-01/08/09'&gt;{{cite news|title=Army 'takes more Tiger territory'|date=January 8, 2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7817110.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Jaffna peninsula was captured by the Sri Lanka Army by January 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=aehebYR1I8gI&amp;refer=india |title=Sri Lankan Military Seizes Last Rebel Base on Jaffna Peninsula |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=14 January 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were unable to hold out for long, and on January 25, SLA troops captured Mullaitivu.&lt;ref name='mod-bbc-01/25/09'&gt;{{cite news|title=Last Tamil Tiger bastion 'taken'|date=January 25, 2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7849684.stm|work =BBC News|accessdate = 25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes 2009/01/26&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author = Somini Sepgupta |title = Sri Lankan Troops Take Last Rebel Stronghold |date = January 26, 2009 |publisher=New York Times |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/world/asia/26lanka.html?hp |accessdate = 26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Sea Tiger base in Chalai was next to fall on February 5, reducing the territory under rebel control to less than some 200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name='mod-mu-02/05/09'&gt;{{cite news|title=Army captures last sea tiger base &amp; clears entire Visuamadu area|date=February 5, 2009|url =http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090205_08|work =Ministry of Defence|accessdate = 5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stage of the war was marked by increased brutality against civilians and rapidly mounting civilian casualties. On February 19, 2009, [[Human Rights Watch]] issued a report accusing the Sri Lankan army of &quot;slaughtering&quot; the civilians during indiscriminate artillery attacks (including repeated shelling of hospitals) and calling on the Sri Lankan government to end its policy of &quot;detaining displaced persons&quot; in military-controlled internment camps. Human Rights Watch also urged the Tamil Tigers to permit trapped civilians to leave the war zone and to &quot;stop shooting at those who try to flee&quot;.&lt;ref name='hrw-2/19/08'&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/srilanka0209webwcover_0.pdf War on the Displaced: Sri Lankan Army and LTTE Abuses against Civilians in the Vanni], ''Human Rights Watch''. February 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN was also concerned over the condition of internally displaced persons and estimated that some 200,000 people were being squeezed into a narrow 14&amp;nbsp;square kilometre patch of land on the coast in Vanni, which the government had declared the 'no-fire zone'.&lt;ref name='un-2/27/08'&gt;[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30046&amp;Cr=sri+lanka&amp;Cr1= War UN relief chief concerned over physical condition of Sri Lankans trapped by clashes], ''United Nations''.

On February 20, 2009, two LTTE planes on [[2009 suicide air raid on Colombo|a suicide mission]] attacked the Sri Lankan capital [[Colombo]], killing 2 and wounding 45, but both planes were shot down by the [[Sri Lankan Air Force]] before they could damage the intended targets which were the Army Headquarters and the main Air Force base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=Cricket&amp;id=be92742a-93ec-45ae-8445-3255107d44ef&amp;MatchID1=4932&amp;TeamID1=7&amp;TeamID2=8&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1247&amp;PrimaryID=4932&amp;Headline=LTTE+air+power+has+collapsed%3a+officials |title=LTTE air power has collapsed: officials |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tamil Tiger planes raid Colombo|date=February 20, 2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7902392.stm|work=BBC|accessdate = 20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late March, the Tamil Tigers controlled only one square kilometre outside the no-fire zone. down from about 15,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; a mere three years previous. Political pressure was placed on Mahinda Rajapaksa to find a political solution to the conflict and he called for a meeting with parliamentarians allied with the Tigers, but they refused until the government resolved the humanitarian crisis faced by civilians trapped in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/090326/world/international_us_srilanka_war Sri Lanka says final standoff with Tigers approaches].&lt;/ref&gt;

I also offer my deepest sympathies to those who laid down their lives in battle and those innocent civilians killed, trapped in war.

In a sense we could say that we have won the battle but the war is not ended. The war would end only on the day that we grow in nationhood realizing that we are all one people in one country with equal right. We have to realize the fact that we are a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural community. As such we are now left with the great task of nation- building forgetting our ethnic, political and religious differences.

It is imperative that there be a political formula that will inspire confidence and promote a sense of belonging among the minority groups in the country. We have to leave the sad and bitter memories of the past three decades and look positively and optimistically towards the future in hope. All of us have to share the blame for our division and forgive each other. We should have the humility and wisdom to learn from the sad experiences of that past.

It is then, and only then, that we could build nationhood that will bring true peace and prosperity to our beloved country â Sri Lanka. Let us always remember that united we will flourish but divided we will perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090518_15 |title=Archbishop congratulates Armed forces on the conclusion of war |publisher=Defence.lk |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India will work with the people and Government of Sri Lanka to provide relief to those affected by the tragic conflict, and to rapidly rehabilitate all those who have been displaced, bringing their lives to normalcy as soon as possible.

It is our view that as the conventional conflict in Sri Lanka comes to an end, this is the moment when the root causes of conflict in Sri Lanka can be addressed.

The final five months of the civil war saw the heaviest civilian casualties. The [[UN]], based on credible witness evidence from aid agencies as well civilians evacuated from the ''Safe Zone'' by sea, estimated that 6,500 civilians were killed and another 14,000 injured between mid-January 2009, when the ''Safe Zone'' was first declared, and mid-April 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;TG240409&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/24/srilanka|title=Sri Lanka war toll near 6,500, UN report says|author=David Pallister &amp; Gethin Chamberlain|date=24 April 2009|publisher=The Guardian, UK|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC270409&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8019865.stm|title=Sri Lanka rejects rebel ceasefire|date=27 April 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no official casualty figures after this period but estimates of the death toll for the final four months of the civil war (mid-January to mid-May) range from 15,000 to 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/29/sri-lanka-casualties-united-nations|title=Sri Lanka death toll 'unacceptably high', says UN|last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin|date=29 May 2009|publisher=The Guardian, UK|accessdate=26 October 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article6382706.ece|title=Slaughter in Sri Lanka|date=29 May 2009|publisher=The Times, UK|accessdate=26 October 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[US State Department]] report has suggested that the actual casualty figures were probably much higher than the UN's estimates and that significant numbers of casualties were not recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;State&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/131025.pdf|title=Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Department of State]], USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former UN official has claimed that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final stages of the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buncombe|first=Andrew|title= Up to 40,000 civilians 'died in Sri Lanka offensive'|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/up-to-40000-civilians-died-in-sri-lanka-offensive-1897865.html|accessdate=23 May 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian Impact===

Towards the end of the war, as Sri Lankan government forces advanced deeper into Tamil Tiger controlled areas, international concern grew for the fate of the 350,000 civilians trapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/17/srilanka-tamil-tigers-trapped-civilians|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Fears grow for trapped civilians as army advances on Tamil Tigers|first=Amelia|last=Gentleman|date=January 18, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 2009, the Sri Lankan military declared a 32 square kilometers (12.4&amp;nbsp;mi) ''Safe Zone'' located northwest of Puthukkudiviruppu, between the A35 Highway and the Chalai Lagoon. [[Sri Lankan Air Force]] aircraft dropped leaflets urging civilians to relocate to the safe zone and wait until the army could move them into safer locations.

The fighting eventually caused civilians to flee the safe zone to a narrow strip of land between [[Nanthi Kadal]] and the Indian Ocean. The Sri Lankan military declared a new {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|adj=on|sp=us}} Safe Zone northwest of [[Mullativu]] on February 12. Over the next three months, the Sri Lankan military repeatedly attacked the Safe Zone with aircraft and artillery to destroy the last remnants of the Tamil Tigers trapped there. The Sri Lankan government claimed that it was trying to hit Tamil Tiger positions, and claimed that these raids started on February 15 and ended on April 19, the day before the Army breached Tamil Tiger defenses, and civilians started to pour out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/05/20095141557222873.html Sri Lanka admits bombing safe zone â Central &amp; South Asia].

The camps were surrounded by barbed wire, and internees attempting to escape were shot.

===Detainees===
The continuous defeats of the LTTE had made its cadres abandon the outfit in large numbers. With the end of the hostilities, 11,664 LTTE members, including over 500 child soldiers surrendered to the Sri Lankan military. Among them were 1,601 females. Government took action to rehabilitate these carders under a &quot;National Action Plan for the Re-integration of Ex-combatants&quot;. They were divided into 3 categores; hardcore, non-combatants, and those who were forcefully recruited (including child soldiers). 24 rehabilitation centres were set up in Jaffna, Batticaloa and Vavuniya. Among the apprehended carders, there had been about 700 hardcore members. Some of these cardres were integrated into State Intelligence Services to tackle the internal and external networks of LTTE.&lt;ref name=&quot;obshgd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/2011/03/Surrendered_Cadres.php?uid=4299&amp;print=true|title=Sri Lanka &quot;Taming The Tigers&quot;|publisher=Sangam.org|date=March 2011|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2006, government had released more than 7,000 cardres, and 4,301 remained.&lt;ref name=&quot;obsy&quot;/&gt;

===Land mines===
The end of the war left past conflict zones of 2046sqkms heavily contaminated with approximately 1.6 million land mines. By November 2011, deminers employed by Sri Lankan army and 8 foreign funded agencies had cleared 1,912sqms leaving about 133sqkms yet to be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/most-of-sri-lankan-minefields-cleared-military_739982.html|work=Zee News|location=India|title=Most of Sri Lankan minefields cleared: Military|date=5 Novermber 2011|accessdate=5 Novermber 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of the war, more than 5,000 Tamil youths have been gathering at selected police stations in Eastern Province for interviews to join the police force as the government has called for interviews. The Sri Lankan government had planned to recruit 2,000 new police officers to the department, especially for the services in the northern region of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colombopage.com/archive_091/May1242917634RA.html Sri Lanka : More Tamil youths want to join Sri Lanka Police].

===Protests===
{{Main|2009 Tamil diaspora protests}}
[[Tamil diaspora]] communities around the world protested the civilian casualties in [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka]] and the war in general. Active protests occurred in the major and/or capital cities of [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indopia.in/India-usa-uk-news/latest-news/554313/TamilNadu/2/20/2 Malaysian Tamils protest against &quot;Indian assistance&quot; to Lanka] Indopia, 21 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8043773.stm Tamil protesters take to streets] [[BBC]] 11 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misguided Tamil protesters|date=13 May 2009|url =http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/story.html?id=1590422|work =Martin Collacott|publisher =[[The National Post]]|accessdate = 13 May 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. The collective objective of the protests was to persuade world national leaders to stop the civil war and bring a permanent ceasefire with an internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy.

===War crimes===
{{main|Alleged war crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War}}
There are [[Alleged war crimes during the Sri Lankan Civil War|allegations that war crimes]] were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the rebel Tamil Tigers during the Sri Lankan Civil War, particularly during the final months of the conflict in 2009. The alleged war crimes include attacks on civilians and civilian buildings by both sides; executions of combatants and prisoners by both sides; enforced disappearances by the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary groups backed by them; acute shortages of food, medicine, and clean water for civilians trapped in the war zone; and child recruitment by the Tamil Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/10/22/sri-lanka-us-war-crimes-report-details-extensive-abuses|title=Sri Lanka: US War Crimes Report Details Extensive Abuses|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/12/08/govt-ltte-executed-soldiers/|title=Govt.: LTTE Executed Soldiers|date=8 December 2010|publisher=[[The Sunday Leader]]|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[United Nations]] expert panel investigating violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the final stages of the civil war found &quot;credible allegations&quot; which, if proven, indicated that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tigers.&lt;ref name=Island160411&gt;{{cite news|title=Report of the UNSGâs panel of experts on accountability in SL|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=23146|newspaper=The Island, Sri Lanka|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TN160411&gt;{{cite news|title=UN panel admits international failure in Vanni war, calls for investigations|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=79&amp;artid=33808|newspaper=[[TamilNet]]|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DM160411&gt;{{cite news|title=Summary of UN Panel report|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story/10913-summary-of-un-panel-report.html|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)]]|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel has called on the [[UN Secretary General]] to conduct an independent international inquiry into the alleged violations of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan military committed war crimes: U.N. panel|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article1701700.ece|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=16 April 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=france24&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaked UN report urges Sri Lanka war crimes probe|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110416-leaked-un-report-urges-sri-lanka-war-crimes-probe|newspaper=[[France24]]|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sri Lankan government]] has denied that its forces committed any war crimes and has strongly opposed any investigation.  In a significant announcement in August 2011, the Sri Lankan Government has acknowledged the civilian casualties occurred in the final phase of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2313299.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Sri Lanka admits to civilian deaths in Eelam war | date=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[counter-insurgency]] seminar conducted by Sri Lanka Army in June 2011, Lawrence Smith - an attachÃ© of the American embassy in Sri Lanka from 2008 revealed &quot;...from what I was privileged to hear and to see, the offers to surrender that I am aware of seemed to come from the mouthpieces of the LTTE -- [[Balasingham Nadesan|Nadesan]], [[Selvarasa Pathmanathan|KP]] -- people who weren't and never had really demonstrated any control over the leadership or the combat power of the LTTE. So their offers were a bit suspect anyway, and they tended to vary in content hour by hour, day by day. I think we need to examine the credibility of those offers before we leap to conclusions that such offers were in fact real...&quot; However the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] characterized the statement as &quot;personal opinion&quot;.&lt;ref name=asiantrib&gt;{{cite news|title=Surrender of top LTTE leadership: US records show Defense AttachÃ© was correct|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2011/06/05/surrender-top-ltte-leadership-us-records-show-defense-attache-was-correct|newspaper=Asian Tribune|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
