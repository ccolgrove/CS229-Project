==Career==
===Acting and rise to fame===
[[File:snips-cc-2010.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Snipes signing autographs at [[Comic Con International]] in 2010.]]
At age 23, Snipes was discovered by an agent while performing in a competition. He made his film debut in the 1986 [[Goldie Hawn]] vehicle ''[[Wildcats (film)|Wildcats]]''. Later that year he appeared on the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' as a drug-dealing [[pimp]] in the episode &quot;Streetwise&quot; (first aired December 5, 1986). In 1987, he appeared as [[Michael Jackson]]'s nemesis in the [[Martin Scorsese]]-directed music video &quot;[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]&quot; and the feature film ''[[Streets of Gold (film)|Streets of Gold]]''. That same year, Snipes was also considered for the role of [[Geordi La Forge]] in the TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/08/star-trekcasting.html|title=Letters of Note: STAR TREK/Casting|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snipes' performance in the music video &quot;Bad&quot; caught the eye of director [[Spike Lee]]. Snipes turned down a small role in Lee's ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' for the larger part of Willie Mays Hayes in ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', beginning a succession of box-office hits for Snipes. Lee would later cast Snipes as the jazz saxophonist Shadow Henderson in ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' and as the lead in the interracial romance drama ''[[Jungle Fever]]''. He played the drug lord Nino Brown in ''[[New Jack City]]'', which was written specifically for him by Barry Michael Cooper. He also played a drug dealer in the 1994 film ''[[Sugar Hill (1994 film)|Sugar Hill]]''.

Although Snipes is better known for his roles in action films like ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (with [[Sylvester Stallone]]), ''[[Money Train]]'', ''[[The Fan (1996 film)|The Fan]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshals (film)|U.S. Marshals]]'' and ''[[Rising Sun (film)|Rising Sun]]'', he has also had success in comedies like ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'', and ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]'' where he played a [[drag queen]] alongside [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[John Leguizamo]]. Snipes has also received critical acclaim for his performances in dramas like ''[[The Waterdance]]'' and ''[[Disappearing Acts]]''.

In 1997, he won the Best Actor Volpi Cup at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for his performance in [[New Line Cinema]]'s ''[[One Night Stand (1997 film)|One Night Stand]]''. In 1998, Snipes had his largest commercial success with ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', which has grossed over $150 million worldwide. The film turned into a [[Blade (film series)|successful series]]. He also received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and an [[honorary doctorate]] from his alma mater, SUNY/Purchase.

Most of his latest films have been released straight-to-DVD. His latest films are ''The Shooter'' (also known as ''[[The Contractor]]''), filmed in [[Bulgaria]] and the UK, with [[Charles Dance]], [[Lena Heady]] and [[Eliza Bennett]], ''[[Gallowwalker]]'', released in 2009, and ''Game Of Death'' with [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Robert Davi]], [[ZoÃ« Bell]], and [[Gary Daniels]].

Snipes was originally slated to play one of the four leads in Spike Lee's 2008 [[war film]] ''[[Miracle at St. Anna]]'' but had to leave the film due to his widely publicized [[Wesley Snipes#Tax problems|tax problems]]; his role eventually went to [[Derek Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;Collis, Clark. &quot;Fall Movie Summer Preview, September: Miracle at St. Anna.&quot; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Iss. #1007/1008, August 22/29, 2008, pg. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snipes made a comeback performance in ''[[Brooklyn's Finest]]'' as Caz, a supporting character. He also had to turn down the part of Hale Caesar in ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' because he was not allowed to leave the United States without the court's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Tony.

He is currently in talks with [[Sylvester Stallone]] about a part in a sequel to ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Other ventures ===
In the late 1990s, Snipes and his brother started a security firm called the Royal Guard of [[Amun|Amen-Ra]], dedicated to providing [[VIP]]s with [[bodyguards]] trained in law enforcement and [[martial arts]].Amen- ra is also the name of his film company. In 1996,the first film produced by Amen Ra Was 'A Great And Mighty Walk-Dr. John Henrick Clarke'.  &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Nashawaty, Chris (December 21, 2007). &quot;The Trials of Wesley Snipes&quot;. ''Entertainment Weekly'', p. 45-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the business was investigated for alleged ties to the [[United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors]]. It emerged that Snipes had spotted {{convert|200|acre|km2}} of land with the intention to buy and use for his business academy, which were close to the aforesaid compound in [[Putnam County, Georgia|Putnam County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Both Snipes' business and the groups used Egyptian motifs as their symbols.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Ultimately, Snipes and his brother did not buy the land, instead establishing their company in [[Florida]], [[Antigua]], and [[Africa]]. The compound was raided in 2002 and their leader was convicted. Later the conviction was overturned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2005, Snipes was in negotiations to fight ''[[Fear Factor]]'' host [[Joe Rogan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiphopmusic.com/inane/archives/2005/11/joe_rogan_vs_we.html Joe Rogan vs. Wesley Snipes in a mixed martial arts bout&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Snipes has been romantically linked to a number of women, including [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Sanaa Lathan]], [[Halle Berry]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]. He has been married twice, first to April Snipes, with whom he has a son, Jelani Asar Snipes, born in 1988. Jelani had a cameo role in Snipes' 1990 film ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]''. In 2003, Snipes married painter Nakyung &quot;Nikki&quot; Park, with whom he has four children: son Akhenaten Kihwa-T Snipes, daughter Iset Jua-T Snipes (born July 31, 2001), son Alaafia Jehu-T Snipes (born May 26, 2004), and son Alimayu Moa-T Snipes (born March 26, 2007). Snipes spends a lot of time in Park's home country of [[South Korea]], which he calls his &quot;second home.&quot;

Snipes, who was raised a [[Christianity|Christian]], converted to [[Islam]] in 1978 but left Islam in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n11_v46/ai_11256186/?tag=content;col1 Wesley Snipes, Hollywood's hottest new star talks about: his divorce, his days on the streets and why he does not have 'jungle fever'.]&quot; ''[[Ebony Magazine]]''. Sept, 1991 by Laura B. Randolph&lt;/ref&gt;

Snipes' apartment was destroyed by the collapse of the [[World Trade Center|World Trade Center's Twin Towers]] during the [[September 11 attacks]]. He was on the West Coast at the time. During his time in New York Snipes was trained in fighting by his friend and mentor Brooke Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1067thefandc.radio.com/tag/wesley-snipes/ Interview with the Sports Junkies 2/19/10 (106.7 the Fan)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
===New Line lawsuit===
In 2005, Snipes sued [[New Line Cinema]], and [[David S. Goyer]], director of ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', which Snipes also produced. He claimed that the studio did not pay his full salary, that he was intentionally cut out of casting decisions, and that his character's screen time was reduced in favor of co-stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[Jessica Biel]].

Snipes contends that Goyer, his fellow producers, and New Line kept him out of the project's decision process, and that this alleged misconduct ended up harming the film's box office performance (it made just $52 million, compared to the previous installments' respective grosses of $70 million and $82 million). He says that a portion of his salary&amp;mdash;$3.6 million&amp;mdash;was withheld as punishment. Neither Goyer nor New Line has commented on these allegations. The suit is still pending.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Incident involving South African passport===
In 2005, Snipes was detained at [[OR Tambo International Airport]] for attempting to leave [[South Africa]] using a fraudulent [[South African passport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/mystery-surrounds-snipes-s-sa-passport-1.244011|title=Mystery surrounds Snipes's SA passport|author=Poloko Tau|date=June 17, 2005|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|accessdate= November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal tax convictions===
On October 12, 2006, Wesley Snipes, [[Eddie Ray Kahn]], and Douglas P. Rosile were charged with one count of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to defraud the United States under {{usc|18|371}} and one count of knowingly making or aiding and abetting the making of a false and fraudulent claim for payment against the United States, under {{usc|18|287}} and {{usc|18|2}}. Snipes was also charged with six counts of willfully failing to file federal income tax returns by their filing dates under {{usc|26|7203}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/tax/ussnipes101206ind.html Findlaw]&lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy charge against Snipes included allegations that he filed a false amended return, including a false [[tax refund]] claim of over US$4 million for the year 1996, and a false amended return, including a false tax refund claim of over US$7.3 million for the year 1997. The government alleged that Snipes attempted to obtain fraudulent tax refunds using a [[Tax protester arguments|tax protester theory]] called the [[Tax protester 861 argument|&quot;861 argument&quot;]] (essentially, an argument that the domestic income of U.S. citizens and residents is not taxable). The indictment said Snipes used accountants who already had a history of filing false returns to obtain refund payments for their clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/tax/ussnipes101206ind.html Findlaw]&lt;/ref&gt; The government also charged that Snipes sent three worthless, fictitious &quot;bills of exchange&quot; to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in the amounts of $1,000,000 (on November 30, 2000), $12,000,000 (January 18, 2001), and $1,000,000 (September 10, 2002), each accompanied by an IRS tax payment voucher coupon.&lt;ref&gt;Superseding Indictment, October 12, 2006, ''United States v. Wesley Trent Snipes'', entry 6, page 8, paragraphs 29 &amp; 30 and page 9, paragraph 39, case no. 5:06-cr-00022-WTH-GRJ, [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida]] (Ocala Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Snipes was a client of American Rights Litigators, which Kahn operated. As a client, Snipes gave a percentage of his tax refunds to Kahn's organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/os-wesley-snipes-supreme-court-20101123,0,5792656.story], Orlando Sentinel, as reported by The Baltimore Sun on 11-23-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The government also charged that Snipes failed to file tax returns for the years 1999 through 2004.

In a December 4, 2006, letter from Snipes in response to his indictment, he declared himself &quot;a non-resident alien&quot; of the United States; in reality, Snipes is a U.S.-born citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocala.com/article/20080124/BREAKING_NEWS/790471096/1053/BREAKING_NEWS &quot;Feds: Snipes Declared Himself Alien, Warned Against Past Tax Prosecution&quot;], Foxnews.com, January 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Snipes said he was being made an example of and was unfairly targeted by prosecutors because of his fame in connection with the federal tax fraud investigation. He attempted unsuccessfully to get the trial moved away from [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], [[Florida]], on the ground that [[racism|racist]] attitudes in that town would prejudice his chance for a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Gentile, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323050,00.html &quot;Wesley Snipes Could Face Wrath of IRS&quot;], Fox News, January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Snipes faced the possibility of serving up to 16 years in prison and paying substantial fines if convicted on all the charges.&lt;ref&gt;The sixteen years was calculated from one year on each of the six counts under 26 U.S.C. section 7203, five years under 18 U.S.C. section 371, and five years under 18 U.S.C. section 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began on January 14, 2008, in Ocala, Florida,&lt;ref&gt;Travis Reed, [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080114/ap_en_mo/people_wesley_snipes;_ylt=AmHLU6UyjjTlHxD6mUZvGjRxFb8C &quot;Snipes' tax fraud trial opens in Ocala&quot;], Associated Press, January 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with opening statements beginning on January 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22675264/ &quot;Jury selected in Wesley Snipes tax trial&quot;], Associated Press, January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2008, Snipes was acquitted on the felony count of conspiracy to defraud the government and on the felony count of filing a false claim with the government. He was, however, found guilty on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns (and acquitted on three other &quot;failure to file&quot; charges). His co-defendants, Douglas P. Rosile and Eddie Ray Kahn, were convicted on the conspiracy and false claim charges in connection with the income tax refund claims filed for Snipes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wesley Snipes acquitted of federal tax fraud,&quot; MSNBC, February 1, 2008, at [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22955757/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/01/snipes.court.ap/index.html Snipes acquitted of tax-fraud, conspiracy], Associated Press, as reported by CNN, February 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the ''Los Angeles Wave'' reported that Snipes has refused to answer certain questions in connection with a talent agency lawsuit in which the agency claims that Snipes owes over $1.4 million in commissions. Snipes is reported to have taken the position that his answers could incriminate him in a federal tax investigation. Lawyers for the talent agency stated that Snipes' lawyer advised the lawyers for the talent agency that &quot;Snipes and his [ ... ] companies are under an additional investigation by the Internal Revenue Service and Snipes would be asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and would not answer any questions at his deposition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wesley Snipes pleads fifth, wonât answer more lawsuit questions,&quot; April 28, 2009, ''Los Angeles Wave'', at [http://www.wavenewspapers.com/news/43951577.html].&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 2008, the trial court ruled that Snipes could remain free while his appeal is being considered.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hudak, &quot;[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-wesley-snipes-052308,0,1742086.story Judge grants appellate bond for Wesley Snipes]&quot;, ''Orlando Sentinel'', May 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2010, in a 35-page decision, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] affirmed Snipes's convictions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Federal Panel Upholds Wesley Snipes Tax Sentence,&quot; CBS News, July 16, 2010, at [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/16/ap/entertainment/main6685245.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Bluestein (Associated Press), &quot;Federal panel upholds Wesley Snipes sentence,&quot; ''Miami Herald'', July 16, 2010, at [http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/16/1734088/federal-panel-upholds-wesley-snipes.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usversus&gt;''[http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200812402.pdf United States v.

{{bquote|Although Snipes argues that there were mitigating factors that the judge did not specifically mention at sentencing, these facts&amp;mdash;his college education, his family, and his charitable activities&amp;mdash;do not compel the conclusion that the sentence crafted in accordance with the 18 U.S.C. [section] 3553(a) factors was substantively unreasonable. The district court acted well within its considerable discretion in sentencing Snipes to thirty-six months in prison.&lt;ref name=usversus /&gt;}}

On November 19, 2010, the United States District Court in [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], [[Florida]], denied motions for permission to interview jurors and motions for a new trial which had been filed by attorneys for Snipes.

===Imprisonment===
In a television appearance on December 7, 2010, Snipes was asked by [[CNN|CNN's]] [[Larry King]] if he was nervous about going to prison, and he admitted his trepidation about doing time. &quot;I think any man would be nervous,&quot; Snipes said. &quot;Given the length of time that they are suggesting that I be away from my family, away from my profession, away from my ability to provide for my family and for those who have depended upon me to contribute to society ... I think anyone would be nervous about that.&quot;

On December 9, 2010, Snipes reported to [[federal prison]] to begin his three-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;''London Daily Mail'', December 9, 2010, &quot;Wesley Snipes reports to prison to begin three-year sentence for tax evasion [''sic''],&quot; at [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1337223/Wesley-Snipes-reports-prison-begin-year-sentence-tax-evasion.html?ito=feeds-newsxml].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;Actor Snipes begins serving sentence at Pa. prison,&quot; December 9, 2010, at [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101209/ap_on_en_mo/us_wesley_snipes_prison].&lt;/ref&gt;
