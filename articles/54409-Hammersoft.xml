A '''jazz band''' ('''jazz ensemble''' or '''jazz combo''') is a [[musical ensemble]] that plays [[jazz]] [[music]]. Jazz bands usually consist of a [[rhythm section]] and a [[horn section]], in the early days often [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], and [[clarinet]] with rhythm section of [[piano]], [[banjo]], [[double bass|bass]] or [[tuba]], and [[drum kit|drums]]. 

==Eras==
; Swing
During the [[swing era]] in the mid-twentieth century, groups expanded into [[big band|jazz orchestras]] playing [[arrangement|arranged]] music, either written out or as 'head' or unwritten voicings. [[string section|String sections]] would sometimes appear, but their presence on the bandstand was often more for visual impact and not as a key component of the ensemble. With the rise of [[bebop]] at the end of [[World War II]], jazz bands settled into the classic bop line-up of trumpet, [[saxophone]], piano, bass, and drums which would dominate jazz through the [[1960s]].
; Jazz fusion
The [[jazz fusion]] era would add [[electric guitar]] and various electronic [[keyboards]], and by the end of the twentieth century a jazz group might employ an array of instruments, from [[viola]] to [[oud]], from [[synthesizer]] to [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa#Instruments|African percussion]]. 
==Rhythm section==
The rhythm section of a jazz band consists of the [[percussion instrument|percussion]], [[double bass]] or [[bass guitar]], and usually at least one instrument capable of playing [[chord (music)|chords]], such as a [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[Hammond organ]] or [[vibraphone|vibes]]; most will usually have more than one of these. The standard rhythm section is piano, bass, and drums, augmented by [[guitar]] at times in small combos and regularly in large ones. Some large swing era orchestras also employed an additional piano, [[accordion]], and [[banjo]].
==Horn section==
The horn section consists of [[wind instrument|wind]] and [[brass instruments]], which play the [[melody]] and main [[accompaniment]]. The standard small combo usually limits itself to one trumpet and one saxophone at times augmented by a second saxophone or a trombone. Typical horns found in a big jazz band include 4-5 [[trumpets]], 4-5 [[woodwind instruments]] usually [[saxophones]], and 3-4 [[trombones]]. The saxophone section consists of two alto saxophones, two tenor saxophones, and one baritone saxophone. The saxophonists may also double on [[flutes]] and [[clarinets]].
==Saxophone section==
In the saxophone section, all of the saxophones will play a similar melodic line, but the baritone sax doubles by occasionally joining in with the fourth trombone and bass to play the bass line.

==Notable jazz bands== 
A very short listing of notable jazz bands includes [[King Oliver|King Oliver and his Creole Jazz Band]], [[Jelly Roll Morton]] and his [[Red Hot Peppers]], [[Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five]], the [[Fletcher Henderson Orchestra]], the [[Duke Ellington Orchestra]], the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], the [[Benny Goodman Orchestra]], the [[Dizzy Gillespie]]-[[Charlie Parker]] Quintet, the [[Gerry Mulligan#The Pianoless Quartet with Chet Baker|Gerry Mulligan Quartet]], the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]], the [[Miles Davis Quintet]], the [[Jazz Messengers]], the [[Clifford Brown]]-[[Max Roach]] Quintet, the [[Sun Ra Arkestra]], the [[John Coltrane Quartet]], the [[Bill Evans Trio]], [[Weather Report]], the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], [[The Headhunters|Herbie Hancock's Headhunters]], the [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]], [[Oregon (band)|Oregon]], [[Return to Forever]], the [[Pat Metheny Group]], and the [[World Saxophone Quartet]].
