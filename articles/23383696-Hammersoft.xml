Metro Trains Melbourne operates a fleet of 381 three-car train sets on 830 kilometres of track. There are sixteen regular service train lines and one special events train line. The train fleet travels over 30 million kilometres and provides more than 228 million customer boardings each year, over 12,000 services each week and carries over 680,000 passengers each weekday. Metro Trains Melbourne is also responsible for 212 train stations and employs a workforce of 3,500 rail professionals including train drivers, mechanical and electrical engineers, network operations specialists and customer service representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/pt/facts-and-figures/summary |title=Facts &amp; figures |publisher=Department of Transport |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotrains.com.au/About-us/Overview.html|title=Metro Trains Melbourne: About Us|accessdate=14 January 2010|publisher=Metro Trains Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a strategy for improving train punctuality, Metro is trialling the re-introduction of platform attendants at some stations. As a train is ready to depart, the platform attendant will blow a whistle and raise a white, illuminated dispatch paddle as an indication to late passengers not to board the train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/metro-bid-to-reinstate-white-flag-on-platforms-is-rejected-by-unions/story-e6frf7jo-1225850688262|title=Herald Sun|accessdate=27 June 2010|publisher=News Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Metro Trains Melbourne was selected as the new operator by the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|State Government of Victoria]] through its relevant agency, the [[Director of Public Transport]], in June 2009 and replaced the previous operator [[Connex Melbourne]] on 30 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/new-train-tram-operators-for-melbourne-20090625-cxgx.html|publisher=The Age|title=New train, tram operators for Melbourne|accessdate=14 January 2010|author=Cooper, Mex|date=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an eight-year contract with the option of being extended for a further seven years.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtmnewoperator&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,,26011100-2862,00.html|publisher=Herald Sun|title=Melbourne's train system name changes from Connex to Metro|accessdate=14 January 2010|author=Gardiner, Ashley|date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Metro Trains Melbourne fleet consists of:
* 187 3-car [[Comeng (train)|Comeng]] [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]]s (built 1981-1988, refurbished 2000-2003)
* 12 3-car [[Hitachi (train)|Hitachi]] [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]]s (built 1972-1980, refurbished 2007)
* 72 3-car [[Siemens (train)|Siemens]] [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]]s (built 2002-2005, purchased by the [[Victorian Government]])
* 108 3-car [[X'Trapolis 100|X'Trapolis]] [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]]s (built 2002-2004; 2009âpresent, purchased by [[Connex Melbourne]]
* 21 [[Sprinter (Victorian train)|Sprinter]] [[diesel multiple unit]]s hired from [[V/Line]].

The majority of rolling stock is owned by the Victorian Government business enterprise [[VicTrack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;doiwho&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/B324F53A00F987B9CA2571F50007F1BB?OpenDocument|title=Department of Transport: Who's who in Victoria's public transport network|accessdate=14 January 2010|publisher=Department of Transport, State Government of Victoria, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Metro Trains Melbourne is ultimately responsible for maintaining the train fleet.

As part of the 2008 Victorian Transport Plan, 38 new 6-car [[X'Trapolis 100|X'Trapolis]] EMUs have been ordered, with the first of 19 trains that are being built by Alstom in Italy arriving at the [[Newport Workshops]] on Monday, 24 August 2009 at approximately 10:00pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25979694-2862,00.html|publisher=Herald Sun|title=First of new trains arrives in Melbourne|accessdate=14 January 2010|author=Gardiner, Ashley|date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trains will be assembled at United Group's [[Ballarat North Workshops|Ballarat plant]], under a state government requirement for a minimum of 40% local content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vicsig.net/index.php?age=suburban&amp;traintype=X%27Trapolis VICSIG: Suburban Trains - X'Trapolis, accessed: 2009-08-12]&lt;/ref&gt; The new trains will only be used in revenue service on lines already cleared for their operation, with displaced trains on these lines being cascaded to those that miss out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/28/2639013.htm?site=melbourne|publisher=ABC|title=Limited run for new Melbourne trains|accessdate=14 January 2010|date=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two sets (1M-1301T-2M and 3M-1302T-4M) have been delivered and are currently being introduced into mainstream service. The new X'Trapolis fleet have a different seating layout to the original X'Trapolis trains (2-2 instead of 3-2). Concerns from the Union regarding minor technical issues have delayed the entry to service for the trains from late 2009 to early 2010. The Siemens fleet already have a 2-2 seating layout, and as part of the franchise agreement, Metro Trains Melbourne are required to alter the seating layout of the Comeng and original X'Trapolis fleet to 2-2 seating. As part of the plan, the Victorian Government will also be purchasing next generation trains, with 30 per cent more room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/web23/Home.nsf/AllDocs/8237085489F555C3CA257625001B9F5A?OpenDocument|title=The Victorian Transport Plan: New Trains and Trams|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lines and stations ===
{{Main|List of Melbourne railway stations}}
Metro Trains Melbourne operates 16 train lines ([[Alamein railway line|Alamein]], [[Belgrave railway line|Belgrave]], [[Craigieburn railway line|Craigieburn]], [[Cranbourne railway line|Cranbourne]], [[Epping railway line|Epping]] (Soon to be South Morang), [[Frankston railway line|Frankston]], [[Glen Waverley railway line|Glen Waverley]], [[Hurstbridge railway line|Hurstbridge]], [[Lilydale railway line|Lilydale]], [[Pakenham railway line|Pakenham]], [[Sandringham railway line|Sandringham]], [[Stony Point railway line|Stony Point]], [[Sydenham railway line|Sydenham]], [[Upfield railway line|Upfield]], [[Werribee railway line|Werribee]] and [[Williamstown railway line|Williamstown]]) and 1 special events train line  ([[Flemington Racecourse railway line|Flemington Racecourse]]) as well as the [[City Loop|Melbourne City Loop]]. They are responsible for the day-to-day operations of 212 stations. Metropolitan train stations include: [[Terminal train station|terminus]] stations, [[premium station]]s manned by staff the entire day who provide extra assistance and information to commuters, and [[host station]]s manned only during peak hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/pt/facts-and-figures/summary |title=Facts &amp; figures |publisher=Department of Transport |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ticketing===
{{Main|Metcard|myki}}
[[File:Metro-liveried-XTrapolis-train-863M.jpg|thumb|right|Metro Trains Melbourne's livery on a [[X'Trapolis 100|X'Trapolis]] train]]
[[File:Siemens train in Metro Trains Melbourne Livery.jpg|thumb|right|Metro Trains Melbourne's livery on a [[Siemens (train)|Siemens]] train]]

Metro Trains Melbourne currently utilizes the [[Metcard]] ticketing system, alongside the new [[myki]] smartcard ticketing system. Metcard and myki are both a time and zone based ticketing system, with validity periods ranging from two-hours to yearly, and two zones covering the [[Melbourne]] metropolitan area.

The [[Metcard]] ticketing system is being phased-out and is expected to be fully decommissioned in late 2012, leaving [[myki]] as the only ticketing system for metropolitan Melbourne.

====Fare enforcement====
Like the other modes of public transport in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Metro Trains Melbourne employs public transport Authorised Officers, who are commonly known as ticket inspectors and have the right to exercise coercive powers under the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].&lt;ref name=&quot;doiwho&quot;/&gt; The main responsibilities of Authorised Officers are to report ticketing and behavioural offences to the Victorian [[Government of Victoria (Australia)#Department of Transport|Department of Transport]], they are also required to assist at major events and to provide customer service information.

Authorised Officers are authorised by the Victorian Department of Transport to exercise [[Police power|power]]s similar to those of police, allowing them to check tickets and perform arrests when aboard vehicles operating under [[Metlink]] or when on Department of Transport-owned premises, such as railway stations or train tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;doiao&quot;&gt;[http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/82681CF0741763ADCA256DB70011EEE2?OpenDocument Department of Infrastructure: Authorised Officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorised Officers are required to abide by the State Government-established 'Authorised Officer Code of Conduct' and violations of this code are prosecuted. The Code of Conduct states that an Authorised Officer may use discretion when reporting an alleged offender, and must supply their name and work address when asked.&lt;ref name=&quot;doiaococ&quot;&gt;[http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/2EDCD5A35EE3A806CA256DB7000BD004?OpenDocument Department of Infrastructure: Code of Conduct for Authorised Officers]&lt;/ref&gt; If an Authorised Officer believes that a passenger has committed an offence, they have the right to request the offender's name and address after having explained the nature of the alleged offence to the offender. The Authorised Officers also have the right to request proof of the given information if the offender refuses to provide identification or provides false information, Authorised Officers will the contact [[Victoria Police]]. Authorised Officers also have the right to detain the offender until the police or further assistance arrives.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlfaq&quot;&gt;[http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/fares_tickets/faqs Metlink Melbourne: FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorised Officers are required to submit a Report of Non Compliance with the details, specific nature and circumstances of the offence to the Department of Transport, who then processes the reports and decide upon any penalties. Any fines levied are payable to the Department, not to Metro Trains Melbourne, however Metro Trains Melbourne receives a small administration fee to cover the costs associated with employing Authorised Officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlfaq&quot;/&gt;

===Transition===
Metro Trains Melbourne entered into a franchise contract with the relevant Government agency responsible for public transport in Melbourne, namely the [[Director of Public Transport]]. Metro Trains Melbourne took over the rail network from French-owned Connex Trains on 30 November 2009 at 3:01am.&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,26419264-421,00.html|title=Melbourne train operators Metro cancel more than dozen services|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=1 December 2009 | agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sections of the media criticised it during its first few days of operation, for train cancellations, including a power failure on the Glen Waverley line (due to a damaged [[Pantograph (rail)|pantograph]] - the mechanical linkage between the train and overhead power lines), and vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/melbournes-new-rail-operator-metro-hit-by-major-delays-20091201-k1oi.html|accessdate=1 December 2009|title=Melbourne's new rail operator Metro hit by major delays|author=Hunter, Thomas|date=1 December 2009 | work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punctuality===
Metro failed to meet Government set targets for punctuality in all of its first 9 months in operation, with almost 1 in 4 trains being late.&lt;ref name=&quot;late&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/metro-extends-unbroken-monthly-record--late-again-20100530-wni4.html|accessdate=1 June 2010|title=Metro extends unbroken monthly record|author=Lucas, Clay|date=31 May 2010 | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2011, Metro's performance has continued to improve. In November 2011, Metro announced that they had exceeded performance benchmarks for the fifth consecutive month - the first time this had been achieved since December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotrains.com.au/About-Us/News/Performance-on-target-customer-satisfaction-up-.html |title=Performance on target, customer satisfaction up - Metro Trains Melbourne |publisher=metrotrains.com.au |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==27 July 2010 problems==

[[File:MTM service 27 Jul.jpg|thumb|right|The Live Service Updates from Metro for the morning of 27 July, showing disruptions on most lines]]
On 27 July 2010, Metro Trains Melbourne experienced widespread cancellations and delays on most lines across Melbourne, impacting over 400,000 passengers. The disruptions were caused by an electrical fault between Southern Cross and Flinders Street stations. Because most trains run through these stations, the number of trains able to be moved through was severely limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuesday 27 July - Major delays and disruptions|url=http://www.metrotrains.com.au/About-us/News/Major-Disruptions-Tuesday-Morning.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with the real-time information systems at stations across Melbourne caused further difficulties for commuters.

== Legislation and governance ==
=== Transport Integration Act===
{{Main|Transport Integration Act}}
The prime transport-related statute in Victoria is the [[Transport Integration Act]].  The Act establishes the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system.  The Act also establishes and sets the charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the [[Director of Public Transport]] and [[V/Line]].  The Act authorises the Director of Public Transport&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act]], section 68(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; to enter into contracts for the provision of transport services and this provision is the source of the power for the contract between Metro and the Director.  In addition, the Transport Integration Act establishes [[VicTrack]] which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. VicTrack leases public transport land and infrastructure to the [[Director of Public Transport]] who leases it to transport operators such as Metro as well as entering into franchise agreements with the operators for them to run public transport services on behalf of the State.

=== Rail Safety Act ===
{{Main|Rail Safety Act}}
The safety of rail transport operations in Melbourne is regulated by the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]] which applies to all commercial passenger operations.&lt;ref&gt;Official copy of the Rail Safety Act from the Victorian Government legislation web site - http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt3.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/6D4190C62DE6207FCA257761002C568A/$FILE/06-9a016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act establishes a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations.  Accredited operators are also required to have a [[Safety Management Systems|safety management system]] to guide their operations.  Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the [[Rail Safety Act]] are contained in the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;See Part 7 of the Act.  Official copy of the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]] from the official Victorian Government legislation site - http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt5.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/7BB774D3E0245B77CA2577CE00030B90/$FILE/83-9921a153.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The safety regulator for the rail system in Melbourne including trams is the [[Director, Transport Safety]] (trading as Transport Safety Victoria) whose office is established under the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].  No blame investigations for rail matters are undertaken by the [[Chief Investigator, Transport Safety]].
