==Career==

===Business career===

Miller started his career as a bartender; buying, building and operating bars with a group of friends at the age of 17.  The company, 4M Holdings, now known as 5M Group LLC, was a successful pairing between Miller, and partners Michael Neufeld, Josh Mele, Mauricio Aquino and most recently, Michael Urbaitel.

Billy has more than 10 years of experience in the bar and restaurant industry, including design, management, promotions, and service. He has created two bars from the ground up in [[Austin, Texas]]: Voodoo Room and Speakeasy. Voodoo Room was Millerâs first all-inclusive project. Working for Girard Diversified Interests (G.D.I.) and side-by-side with G.D.I's founder, Michael Girard, he contributed to the design, construction, marketing, service concept, and daily operations of the business. Voodoo Room received immediate success in Austin's historic 6th Street bar culture, averaging a gross of $75,000 monthly. He also contributed to many of G.D.I.'s other profitable 6th Street ventures including Daiquiri Factory, Amazon, and Abrattos.

The success of Voodoo Room allowed Michael Girard and G.D.I. to venture outside the 6th Street's bar market and enter into Austin's sophisticated nightlife climate of the Historic District. At 412 D South Congress Avenue, Billy worked as Michael Girard's trusted employee in the purchase and overhaul of this Austin landmark, morphing it into the profitable bar Speakeasy.  Miller implemented major changes to the staff and daily operations to grow this successful business. To date, Speakeasy has maintained its impeccable service to the community, grossing an average monthly sale of more than $200,000. 

In Manhattan Beach, CA, Miller managed and operated several bars including Towne Restaurant and Trio before designing, constructing, and managing Chakra restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;4M Holdings [http://www.4mholdings.com/Bio.html. &quot;Bio&quot;].
