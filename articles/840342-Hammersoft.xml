The '''''Battlefield''''' franchise is a series of computer and console games that started with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/[[Mac OS|Mac]] game ''[[Battlefield 1942]]''. The series is developed by the Swedish company [[EA Digital Illusions CE]], and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The games feature a greater focus on large maps, teamwork and vehicle warfare than traditional [[first-person shooter]]s. The [[Personal computer game|PC games]] in the series are mainly focused on [[online game|online multiplayer]]. The ''Battlefield'' series has sold 17 million units as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21167 |title=News - Q&amp;A: DICE's Grondal On Evolving Battlefield For Heroes |publisher=Gamasutra |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has a recognizable 6-beat [[sting (musical phrase)|sting]] which is often used in promotional material for the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3178381 |title=Bottling Lightning: Recording the Music of Battlefield: Bad Company 2 from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joeleriksson.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|List of Battlefield video games}}
''[[Battlefield 1942]]'' was released on September 10, 2002, using the ''[[Refractor_Engine|Refractor]]'' gaming engine, and introduced the &quot;Conquest&quot; gameplay mode, in which players fought for &quot;capture points&quot; throughout the map. Two [[expansion pack|expansion packs]] were released, ''[[Battlefield_1942:_The_Road_to_Rome|The Road to Rome]]'' and ''[[Battlefield 1942:_Secret_Weapons_of_WWII|Secret Weapons of WWII]]''.

''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'', released in 2004, moved the setting to the [[Vietnam War]], and was built on a modified ''Refractor'' engine with various gameplay improvements, such as firing personal weapons while seated in vehicles.

The 2005 game ''[[Battlefield 2]]'' takes place in the modern day, during a fictional war between the [[United States]], [[China]], and the fictional Middle Eastern Coalition (MEC). Despite it requiring numerous [[Patch (computing)|software patches]] due to the large number of bugs and glitches in the game upon its release, it was a commercial success, selling over 2,250,000 copies worldwide, as of July 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;financial&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://global.dice.se/finance/reports/?article=916754ba-fd14-40e9-b3cc-39119edff67d&amp;page=0 | title = Digital Illusions Interim report JanuaryâJune 2006 | page = 3 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061013164910/www.dice.se/PDF.aspx?article=0a204e8e-a1a6-434d-894f-b8d9147750b7 | archivedate = 2006-10-10 | accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also received widespread critical acclaim, with an aggregate review score of 91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/battlefield2|title=Metacritic: Battlefield 2|accessdate=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One expansion pack, ''[[Battlefield_2#Battlefield_2:_Special_Forces|Special Forces]]'', and two [[Booster_pack|booster packs]], ''Armored Fury'' and ''Euro Force'', were also released. A version of the game called ''[[Battlefield 2: Modern Combat]]'' was released for consoles, with an improved single player mode but more limited online play.
{{BattlefieldTimeline}}
''[[Battlefield 2142]]'' was released in 2006, taking place during a global [[ice age]] in the 22nd century. While much of it is graphically similar to ''Battlefield 2'', it introduced a variety of equippable items to unlock and battles between two giant &quot;Titan&quot; [[airship]]s. Its use of [[in-game advertising]] was controversial among players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154522|title=Gamers Wary of Battlefield 2142's 'Spyware'|accessdate=2006-10-20|first=Patrick|last=Klepek|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While generally praised by critics, it received lower review scores than its predecessors, with an average [[GameRankings]] score of 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932358.asp |title = Game Rankings Rating |publisher = Game Rankings |accessdate = 2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Battlefield 2142#Northern Strike|Northern Strike]]'' booster pack was later released, including new maps, vehicles, and a new game mode.

''[[Battlefield: Bad Company]]'', released in 2008, followed the infamous &quot;B&quot; Company's [[desertion|AWOL]] escapades and their search for mercenary gold. This new, modern day ''Battlefield'' game had modern day weapons, as well as a variety of vehicles for land, air and sea. It had a remarkably realistic destruction system that allowed the player to break, destroy, or create new environments, based on a new next generation gaming engine named ''[[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite]]''.

In 2009, EA released two [[Online distribution|download-only]] games, ''[[Battlefield Heroes]]'', a [[free-to-play]] ''Refractor 2'' engine game, supported by advertising and [[micropayment]]s and ''[[Battlefield 1943]]'', a ''Frostbite'' engine game, released in July 2009, for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], and was scheduled for release in Q1 2010, for [[Personal computer|PCs]], but was cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;1943pc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/114/1147611p1.html|title=Battlefield 1943 PC Canceled|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2011-02-03|accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a direct sequel to ''Battlefield: Bad Company'', ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2]]'', was released, involving &quot;B&quot; Company's search for an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] weapon (called a scalar weapon ingame). It had a larger, and arguably better multiplayer than its predecessor &quot;Bad Company&quot;, with updated graphics and new realistic effects (e.g. bullet-drop). It also featured a &quot;VIP&quot; system of content distribution where player with VIP codes gain free access to new maps released periodically. DICE also released an expansion for ''Bad Company 2'', ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2#Expansion pack|Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam]]''.

''[[Battlefield 3]]'' was announced in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/696413/Electronic-Arts-Confirms-Battlefield-3-In-Development.html|title=Electronic Arts Confirms Battlefield 3 In Development|author=Patrick Klepek|date=2009-06-10|publisher=[[G4 (TV channel)|G4TV]]|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/993/993660p1.html|title=EA Confirms Battlefield 3 Development|last=Reilly|first=Jim|date=2009-06-10|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 it was confirmed that gamers who [[pre-order|pre-ordered]] ''[[Medal of Honor (2010 video game)|Medal of Honor (2010)]]'' Limited Edition [http://www.ea.com/1/beta or who pre-ordered from origin(in the U.S. only) would receive a beta of ''Battlefield 3''] 48 hours before the open beta was released. On February 4, 2011, the first teaser trailer for the game was revealed, with a preliminary release in the Fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2011/02/04/battlefield-3-is-coming-preorder-now.aspx Release-window announced]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the features that remain in the game are Jets and the ability to go prone. The game still allows 64 (on the PC) players as in all previous ''Battlefield'' titles, though the consoles allow for 24 player matches. The ''Battlefield 3 Beta'' was released on September 29th, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battlefield.ea/]&lt;/ref&gt;
Battlefield 3 was released on October 25th, 2011 and has received almost unanimous high review scores.

On November 5, 2010, EASY Studios announced a follow-up to its free-to-play ''[[Battlefield Heroes]]'', ''[[Battlefield Play4Free]]''.  EASY develops the free-to-play variants of ''Battlefield''. Its latest offering gives players the same free-to-play pricing structure of ''Heroes'', while still offering a more serious, core ''Battlefield'' experience (as opposed to ''Heroes''{{'}} lighthearted, cartoon-styled environment).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/113/1132713p1.html EA Blows Up Online PC Gaming with Battlefield Play4Free--IGN.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Battlefield Play4Free'' went into open beta on April 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33926/EAs_Battlefield_Play4Free_Starts_Open_Beta.php EA's Battlefield Play4Free Starts Open Beta--gamasutra.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game mechanics==
''Battlefield'' series games usually focus on large, online multiplayer battles, with emphasis on piloting a number of [[vehicle]]s as well as team-based infantry combat. Playing in squads has also become a major element of games in the series.

Since ''[[Battlefield 2]]'', all games in the series centrally record online statistics for each player allowing the players to receive rank promotions and weapon unlocks based on their statistics as well as awards such as medals, ribbons and pins.

A class system has been present within all the ''Battlefield'' games. Each class features a different type of primary weapon along with different equipment, differentiating roles on the battlefield.

The ability to melee other players with a knife has always been present in ''Battlefield'' games. Also since ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', the series has included an award of [[dog tag]]s for each player killed using a knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ocampo |first=Jason |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2142/news.html?sid=6150162&amp;mode=previews |title=E3 06: Battlefield 2142 Hands-On - PC Previews at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
