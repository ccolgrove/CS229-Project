[[The Smashing Pumpkins]] is an [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1988. The band was formed by guitarist/vocalist [[Billy Corgan]] and guitarist [[James Iha]] after the demise of Corgan's first band, [[The Marked]]. Since its inception, The Smashing Pumpkins has gone through multiple line-up changes, with Corgan the only consistent member.

After the breakup of his gothic rock band The Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store. While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. The pair soon began writing songs together with the aid of a drum machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot;&gt;Kot, Greg. &quot;Pumpkin Seeds&quot;, ''Guitar World''. January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Corgan met bassist [[D'arcy Wretzky]] in mid 1988 after a show by the [[Dan Reed Network]] where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass, Corgan stated his band's need for a bassist and gave Wretzky his telephone number. Wretzky soon joined the band, and she and Iha later had a short-lived romance.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;From Fighting to Smashing&quot;, ''Washington Post''. November 19, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of The Smashing Pumpkins was on July 9, 1988, at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan and Iha with a drum machine.&lt;ref name=infighting&gt;Kelly, Christina. &quot;Smashing Pumpkins: The Multi-Platinum Band Is Over the Infighting But Can the Harmony Last?&quot;, ''US Weekly''. December 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 1988, the band played for the first time as a trio at the Avalon Nightclub.&lt;ref name=&quot;modern drummer&quot;&gt;&quot;Jimmy Chamberlin [interview]&quot;, ''[[Modern Drummer]]''. January 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; After this show, [[Metro Chicago|Cabaret Metro]] owner [[Joe Shanahan]] agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer. Jazz drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]] was recruited for the band after a recommendation from a friend of Corgan's.&lt;ref name=&quot;modern drummer&quot;/&gt; On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.&lt;ref name=&quot;modern drummer&quot;/&gt;

Soon after the release of their third album, ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'' in 1995, the group recruited keyboardist [[Jonathan Melvoin]] to perform on the ensuring tour. However, on July 11, 1996, Melvion and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a New York City hotel room. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Errico, Marcus | date= 1996-07-17| title= Smashing Pumpkins Drum Out Jimmy Chamberlin | publisher =Eonline.com | url= http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=c10135f0-c1bc-425c-961a-fd93076178af | accessdate=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] and keyboardist [[Dennis Flemion]] as temporary replacements. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt;

In early 1999, Jimmy Chamberlin rejoined the band; however, the lineup was short-lived, as bassist D'arcy Wretzky announced her departure that September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=1999-09-10| title= D'Arcy Exits Smashing Pumpkins | publisher =Billboard.com | url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=950611 | accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was subsequently replaced by former [[Hole (band)|Hole]] bassist, [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], who performed on the âSacred and Profane&quot; tour and appeared in music videos. On May 23, 2000, in a live radio interview on [[KROQ-FM]] (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band's decision to break up at the end of that year following additional touring and recording.&lt;ref name=breakup&gt;{{cite web | author=Newman, Melinda, and Jonathan Cohen| date=2000-05-24| title= Corgan: Smashing Pumpkins To Break Up | publisher =Billboard.com | url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=875747 | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smashing Pumpkins played at the Cabaret Metro on December 2, 2000, before a six-year disbandment.

On July 21, 2005, Corgan stated in full-page advertisements in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' to announce that he had planned to reunite the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Corgan, Billy. &quot;A Message to Chicago from Billy Corgan&quot;, ''Chicago Tribune'', June 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2006, the band's official website confirmed the reunion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Kaufman, Gil | date=2006-04-21| title= Smashing Pumpkins Site Says &quot;It's Official&quot;âBand Has Reunited | publisher= MTV.com | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1529202/20060421/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml?headlines=true | accessdate=2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate. In April 2007, Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Goodman, Elizabeth | date= 2007-04-06 | title= Exclusive: James Iha Speaks Out Regarding His Involvement in Pumpkins Reunion | publisher= RollingStone.com | url= http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/04/06/exclusive-james-iha-speaks-out-regarding-his-involvement-in-pumpkins-reunion | accessdate= 2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= 2007-04-23 | title= Movers and Shakers in Canadian Arts | publisher=TheGlobeAndMail.com |url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070423.NUBIZ23/TPStory/TPEntertainment/Music/ | accessdate= 2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wretzky did not make an announcement, but Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky &quot;didn't want to be a part of&quot; the reunion.&lt;ref name = &quot;mdrummer&quot;&gt;Micallef, Ken. &quot;The Evolution of Jimmy Chamberlin: Still Smashing!&quot; ''[[Modern Drummer]]''.

This line-up toured to promote the 2007 album ''[[Zeitgeist (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Zeitgeist]]'' and performed again throughout 2008 to celebrate the band's 20th anniversaryâthis time, the instrumentation was augmented by [[No Doubt]] trumpeter [[Stephen Bradley (musician)|Stephen Bradley]] and trombonist [[Gabrial McNair]], [[Kristopher Pooley]] on accordion and keyboards, and [[Gingger Shankar]] playing the rare 10-string violin. In March 2009, Corgan announced on the band's website that longtime drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, had left the group;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Prince, David J. | title=Smashing Pumpkins Sheds Chamberlin; Billy Corgan Heads To Studio All Alone |date= 2009-03-20 |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/smashing-pumpkins-sheds-chamberlin-billy-1003953891.story | publisher=Billboard.com | accessdate=2009-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamberlin stated that the split was amicable, commenting that he was &quot;glad [Corgan] has chosen to continue under the name.
