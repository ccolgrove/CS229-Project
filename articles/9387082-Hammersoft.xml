'''TrÃºc Báº¡ch Lake''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: {{linktext |Há»| TrÃºc| Báº¡ch}}) is one of the many lakes in the city of [[Hanoi]], the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Vietnam]]. It is known outside Vietnam as the site where the US politician [[John McCain]] landed as a navy pilot during the [[Vietnam War]] after being shot down. 

TrÃºc Báº¡ch Lake is located northwest of Hanoi's Old Quarter, immediately adjacent to the eastern shore of the city's largest lake, the [[West Lake, Hanoi|West Lake]] (Há» TÃ¢y), [[oxbow lake|a former branch]] of the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]] whose west bank is nearby. TrÃºc Báº¡ch Lake was separated from the West Lake by the construction of a narrow [[Dike (construction)|dike]] (Cá» NgÆ°, &quot;reinforcement&quot;) in the 17th century to allow raising fish. The inhabitants of the Truc Yen Village, located on the south shore of the newly formed lake, were in the business of making bamboo blinds and hence cultivated a small variety of bamboo&lt;ref name=thingsasian&gt;[http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/2746 Story on thingsasian.com]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1957 and 1958, major Thanh NiÃªn Road was built between the lakes. In 1730s, the [[Trá»nh Lords|Trá»nh Lord]] [[Trá»nh Giang]] had TrÃºc LÃ¢m [[Palace]] constructed on the lake shore. The building first served as a pleasure palace but was later converted into a prison for royal [[concubines]] found guilty of crime. The [[silk]] they produced, known as &quot;Bamboo Village Silk&quot; became famous for its beauty.
 
The lake front is open only along Thanh NiÃªn Road, the other sides are occupied by houses and residential streets. The lake is among the most seriously polluted in Hanoi. Nearby historical sites include: QuÃ¡n ThÃ¡nh Temple to the southwest of the lake,  ChÃ¢u Long Pagoda to the east, An TrÃ¬ Temple (dedicated to the worship of a hero from the war against the Chinese [[Yuan Dynasty]]) on PhÃ³ Äá»©c ChÃ­nh Street, and Cáº©u Nhi temple on a small hill near the northern corner of the lake.

On October 26, 1967, during the [[Vietnam War]], [[John McCain]], then a US Navy pilot, was [[Early life and military career of John McCain#Prisoner of war|shot down by an anti-aircraft missile]] on a mission against a Hanoi power plant and parachuted wounded into TrÃºc Báº¡ch Lake, nearly drowning. He was dragged out of water and mauled by a mob. A monument celebrating the downing of &quot;Tchn Sney Ma Can&quot; was erected at the western shore on Than NiÃªn Road; McCain saw it on his first journey to Vietnam in 1985.
