'''Google Chrome''' is a [[web browser]] developed by [[Google]] that uses the [[WebKit]] [[layout engine]]. It was first released as a [[beta version]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] on September 2, 2008, and the public stable release was on December 11, 2008. The name is derived from the [[graphical user interface]] frame, or &quot;chrome&quot;, of web browsers. As of November 2011, Chrome is the second most widely used browser with 25.69% worldwide [[usage share of web browsers]] and the most popular browser in [[South America]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-sa-monthly-201111-201111-bar Stats Counter Global Stats - Top 5 Browsers in South America November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;, according to [[StatCounter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsCounter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gs.statcounter.com/ |title=Top 5 Browsers from November 2010 to November 2011 |publisher=StatCounter |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; For additional sources see [[Usage share of web browsers#Summary table]] &lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code, including its [[V8 (JavaScript engine)|V8 JavaScript engine]], as an [[open source]] project entitled [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/09/google-unveils-chrome-source-code-and-linux-port.ars |title= Google unveils Chrome source code and Linux port |author=Ryan Paul |publisher=Ars Technica |date= September 2, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Google Chrome is built with open source code from Chromium.&quot; Retrieved from [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/getting-started Chromium.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This move enabled third-party developers to study the underlying source code and to help port the browser to the Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.

==History==
For six years, Google's Chief Executive [[Eric E. Schmidt|Eric Schmidt]] was against the idea of building an independent web browser. He stated that &quot;At the time, Google was a small company&quot;, and he did not want to go through &quot;bruising browser wars&quot;. However, after co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several [[Mozilla Firefox]] developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt admitted that &quot;It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Julia Angwin |date=July 9, 2009 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/07/09/sun-valley-schmidt-didnt-want-to-build-chrome-initially-he-says/ |title=Sun Valley: Schmidt Didn't Want to Build Chrome Initially, He Says |work=WSJ Digits Blog |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Announcement===
The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by [[Scott McCloud]] was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features for the new browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccloud&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott McCloud |date=September 1, 2008 |url=http://smccloud.livejournal.com/15488.html |title=Surprise! |work=[[Google Blogoscoped]] |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and German blogger [[Philipp Lenssen]] of [[Google Blogoscoped]]&lt;ref name=&quot;lenssen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Philipp Lenssen |date=September 1, 2008 |title=Google Chrome, Google's Browser Project |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-09-01-n47.html |accessdate=September 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;comic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Philipp Lenssen |date=September 1, 2008 |title=Google on Google Chrome â comic book |url=http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/ |work=[[Google Blogoscoped]] |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google subsequently made the comic available on [[Google Books]]&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/|title=Google Chrome|work=[[Google Book Search]]|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mentioned it on their official blog along with an explanation for the early release.&lt;ref name=&quot;releasedate&quot; /&gt;

===Public release===
[[File:File-Chromium-Linux-Alpha.png|thumb|200px|right|An early version of Chromium for Linux, explaining the difference between Chrome and Chromium]]

The browser was first publicly released for Microsoft Windows (XP and later versions) on September 2, 2008 in 43 languages, officially a beta version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doeswhat.com/2008/09/02/it-was-when-not-if-google-chrome/ |title=It was when not if... Google Chrome |accessdate=September 2, 2008 |year=2008 |month=September}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome quickly gained about 1% market share despite being only available for Microsoft Windows at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;releasedate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Pichai, Sundar |coauthors=Upson, Linus |date=September 1, 2008 |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html |title=A fresh take on the browser |publisher=Google Blog |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10030025-2.html|title=Google Chrome update: First screenshot, and live-blog alert|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2008|publisher=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/09/01/google-browser.html |title=Google launches Chrome web browser |date=September 2, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doeswhat.com/2008/11/22/come-on-google-chrome-for-mac/ |title=Come on Google...

It then started rising again and by December 2008, Chrome again passed the 1% threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Wolfgang |last=Gruener |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/40575/113/ |title=Google Chrome crosses 1% market share again |publisher=TG Daily |location=Chicago (IL) |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2009, [[CNET]] reported that Google planned to release versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux in the first half of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChromeMacDeadline&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/chrome-gets-mac-deadline-extensions-foundation/|title=Chrome gets Mac deadline, extensions foundation|last=Shankland|first=Stephen|date=January 9, 2009|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official Chrome Mac OS X and Linux developer previews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel |title=Early Access Release Channels}}&lt;/ref&gt; were announced on June 4, 2009 with a blog post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.chromium.org/2009/06/danger-mac-and-linux-builds-available.html |title=Danger: Mac and Linux builds available |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying they were missing many features and were intended for early feedback rather than general use.

In December 2009, Google released beta versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2009/12/beta-update-linux-mac-and-windows.html |title= Beta Update: Linux, Mac, and Windows |author=Mark Larson |publisher=Google |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Extensions beta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chrome-for-holidays-mac-linux.html|title=Google Chrome for the holidays: Mac, Linux and extensions in beta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Chrome 5.0, announced on May 25, 2010, was the first stable release to support all three platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/05/new-chrome-stable-release-welcome-mac.html |title= A new Chrome stable release: Welcome, Mac and Linux! |publisher=Google |author=Brian Rakowski |date= May 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome was one of the twelve browsers offered to [[European Economic Area]] users of [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8537763.stm |title= Microsoft offers browser choices to Europeans |publisher=BBC News   |date= March 1, 2010 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===

Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as [[Mozilla]]'s [[Netscape Portable Runtime]], [[Network Security Services]], [[NPAPI]], as well as [[SQLite]] and a number of other open-source projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://catonmat.net/blog/code-reuse-in-google-chrome-browser/ |title= Code reuse in Google Chrome Browser |author=Peteris Krumins |date= September 5, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[JavaScript]] [[virtual machine]] was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]/[[Mozilla]]'s [[Tamarin (JavaScript engine)|Tamarin]]) and handled by a separate team in [[Denmark]] coordinated by [[Lars Bak (computer programmer)|Lars Bak]] at [[Aarhus]]. According to Google, existing implementations were designed &quot;for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important&quot;, but [[web application]]s such as [[Gmail]] &quot;are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to [[Document Object Model|DOM]] manipulations and [[JavaScript]]&quot;, and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.

[[File:Usage share of alternative web browsers (Source StatCounter).svg|right|thumb|[[Usage share of web browsers]] (excluding IE) according to [[StatCounter]]&lt;ref&gt; http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200807-201106 &lt;/ref&gt;]]

Chrome uses the [[WebKit]] rendering engine to display web pages, on advice from the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] team.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; Like most browsers, Chrome was extensively tested internally before release with [[unit testing]], &quot;automated user interface testing of scripted user actions&quot;, and [[fuzz testing]], as well as WebKit's layout tests (99% of which Chrome is claimed to have passed). New browser builds are automatically tested against tens of thousands of commonly accessed websites inside the Google index within 20â30 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt;

The Windows version of Chrome includes [[Gears (software)|Gears]], which adds features for [[web developer]]s typically relating to the building of web applications (including offline support).&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; However, Google is phasing out Gears in favor of [[HTML5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html |title= Hello HTML5 |publisher=Google |author=Ian Fette |date= February 19, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 Google announced that to make deploying Chrome easier in a business environment they would provide an official Chrome [[Windows Installer|MSI package]]. The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's home directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul16Dec10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/12/google-offering-msi-to-simplify-chrome-enterprise-deployment.ars|title = Google offering MSI to simplify Chrome enterprise deployment|accessdate =December 16, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan |year = 2010|month = December| work=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; â it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using [[Google Pack]]. Google also created [[Group Policy|Group Policies]] to fine tune the behavior of Chrome in the business environment, for example setting automatic updates interval, a home page etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=146164|title=Google Update for Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2011 the Chrome Product manager, Mike Jazayeri, announced that Chrome will no longer support [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264 video codec]] for its HTML 5 player, citing the desire to bring Google Chrome more inline with the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html|title=HTML Video Codec Support in Chrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-releases====
In addition to the stable build of Google Chrome, Google makes several pre-release versions, or &quot;early release channels&quot; available. These are referred to as ''channels'' because the browser is dynamically updated and are designated &quot;Beta&quot; &quot;Dev&quot; and &quot;Canary&quot;. The Chrome Beta build is intended to be tested by anyone and is slightly newer than the stable version of chrome. The Dev, or developer build, is intended for users with software testing or programming experience. The Canary build is an automatically created version of the latest software from the parent Chromium project, which is not tested prior to release. As a result Google blocks the ability to set the Canary build as the user's default browser and allows it to be installed alongside another version of Chrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/#!5596337/chrome-canary-build-provides-bleeding+edge-updates-alongside-stable-chrome|title=Chrome Canary Build Provides Bleeding-Edge Updates Alongside Stable Chrome|author=Kevin Purdy|work=Lifehacker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chromium====
While [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] is the parent project of Google Chrome, there are some key differences that set the two apart. Chromium, unlike the pre-release versions of Chrome, is updated almost every day, but does not include the built-in Flash Player (it has to be downloaded separately) and Google Auto-updater found in Chrome. Chromium also has a less restrictive end user license than the compiled builds of Chrome, and does not implement user RLZ tracking, a [[privacy]] concern.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Chromium Blog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Chrome, Chromium, and Google|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2008/10/google-chrome-chromium-and-google.html|accessdate=February 17, 2010|publisher=The Chromium Blog|year=2008|work=blog.chromium.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Differences between Google Chrome and Linux distro Chromium&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Differences between Google Chrome and Linux distro Chromium|url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/ChromiumBrowserVsGoogleChrome|accessdate=2010-09=01|publisher=Google /|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChromiumBlog20Jun10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.chromium.org/2010/06/in-open-for-rlz.html|title = In The Open, For RLZ|accessdate =June 20, 2010|last = Google|year = 2010|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Google Chrome aims to be secure, fast, simple&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html|title=Technology overview â Google chrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stable. There are extensive differences from its peers in Chrome's minimalistic user interface,&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; which is atypical of modern web browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glosonblog.com/google-chromes-unique-features/ |title= Google Chrome's Unique Features |author=Gloson |date= December 4, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Chrome does not render [[RSS]] feeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=84], chromium issue tracker.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome's strength is its application performance and [[JavaScript]] processing speed, both of which were independently verified by multiple websites to be the swiftest among the major browsers of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10030888-92.html |title= Speed test: Google Chrome beats Firefox, IE, Safari â Business Tech |author=Stephen Shankland |publisher=[[CNET News]] |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5286869/lifehacker-speed-tests-safari-4-chrome-2-and-more |title= Lifehacker Speed Tests: Safari 4, Chrome 2, and More â Browsers |author=Kevin Purdy |publisher=[[Lifehacker]] |date= June 11, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Chrome's unique features had been previously announced by other browser developers, but Google was the first to implement and publicly release them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techstroke.com/12-unique-features-of-chrome-fast-and-powerful-web-browser-from-google.html 12 Unique features of Google Chrome], TechStroke&lt;/ref&gt; For example, its most prominent [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) innovation, the merging of the [[address bar]] and search bar (the ''Omnibox''), was first announced by [[Mozilla Corporation|Mozilla]] in May 2008 as a planned feature for [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9944662-2.html |title= The future of the Firefox address bar |author=Rafe Needleman |publisher=CNET News |date= May 14, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a feature was already implemented in [[Konqueror]] in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Acid tests===
[[File:Acid3-Chrome4Dev.PNG|thumb|The results of the [[Acid3]] test on Google Chrome 4.0]]

The first release of Google Chrome passed both the [[Acid1]] and [[Acid2]] tests. Beginning with version 4.0, Chrome passed all aspects of the [[Acid3]] test.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome 4.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/01/stable-channel-update_25.html Stable Channel Update |title= Stable Channel Update |publisher=Google |author=Anthony Laforge  |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web standards conformance tests===

On [[Ecma International]]'s [[ECMAScript]] standards conformance Test 262&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test262.ecmascript.org/|title=ECMAScript test262|accessdate=May 6, 2011|publisher=ECMAScript}}&lt;/ref&gt; (version ES5 of 2011-11-04), Chrome version 15.0.874.120 scores 418/11029. The beta version, 16.0.912.36, scored 417/11029. The dev version, 17.0.938.0, scores 262/11029. Lower scores are better, as the figure represents the number of failed tests out of the total number of tests.

On the official CSS 2.1 test suite by standardization organization [[W3C]], WebKit, the Chrome rendering engine, passes 89.75% (89.38% out of 99.59%) of covered CSS 2.1 tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS2.1/20110323/reports/results.html|title=CSS 2.1 Test Suite RC6 Results|accessdate=May 6, 2011|publisher=W3C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
Chrome periodically retrieves updates of two [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklists]] (one for [[phishing]] and one for [[malware]]), and warns users when they attempt to visit a harmful site. This service is also made available for use by others via a free public [[API]] called &quot;Google Safe Browsing API&quot;. Google notifies the owners of listed sites who may not be aware of the presence of the harmful software.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt;

Chrome will typically allocate each [[Tab (GUI)|tab]] to [[Sandbox (computer security)|fit]] into its own [[process (computing)|process]] to &quot;prevent malware from installing itself&quot; and prevent what happens in one tab from affecting what happens in another; however, the actual process-allocation model is more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.marcchung.com/2008/09/05/chromes-process-model-explained.html |title=chromes-process model explained |first=Marc |last=Chung |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[principle of least privilege]], each process is stripped of its rights and can compute, but cannot write files or read from sensitive areas (e.g. documents, desktop)âthis is similar to the &quot;Protected Mode&quot; used by Internet Explorer on [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]. The ''Sandbox Team'' is said to have &quot;taken this existing process boundary and made it into a [[operating system-level virtualization|jail]]&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesforthebrain.com/google-chrome/26|title=Google Chrome|author=Google|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, malicious software running in one tab is supposed to be unable to sniff credit card numbers entered in another tab,&lt;!--this does not stop XSS attacks--&gt; interact with mouse inputs, or tell Windows to &quot;run an executable on start-up&quot; and it will be terminated when the tab is closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; This enforces a simple [[computer security model]] whereby there are two levels of [[multilevel security]] (''user'' and ''sandbox'') and the ''sandbox'' can only respond to communication requests initiated by the ''user''.&lt;ref name=sec&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Barth|coauthors=Collin Jackson, Charles Reis, and The Google Chrome Team|title=The Security Architecture of the Chromium Browser |publisher=Stanford Security Laboratory|url=http://crypto.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/chromium-security-architecture.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Linux sandboxing uses the [[seccomp]] mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Markus Gutschke|title=Re: [[PATCH 2/2]] x86-64: seccomp: fix 32/64 syscall hole|url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sparc/11622|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jake Edge|title=Google's Chromium sandbox|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/347547/|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]s such as [[Adobe Flash Player]] are not standardized and as such, cannot be sandboxed as tabs can be. These often must run at, or above, the security level of the browser itself. To reduce exposure to attack, plugins are run in separate processes that communicate with the renderer, itself operating at &quot;very low privileges&quot; in dedicated per-tab processes. Plugins will need to be modified to operate within this [[software architecture]] while following the [[principle of least privilege]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; Chrome supports the [[Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface]] (NPAPI),&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-faq-activex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/webmasters-faq.html#activex|title=Google Chrome FAQ for web developers}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not support the embedding of [[ActiveX]] controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-faq-activex&quot;/&gt; On March 30, 2010 Google announced that the latest development version of Chrome would include Adobe Flash as part of the browser, eliminating the need to download and install it separately. Flash would be kept up to date as part of Chrome's own updates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul31Mar10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2010/03/google-bakes-flash-into-chrome-hopes-to-improve-plugin-api.ars|title = Google bakes Flash into Chrome, hopes to improve plug-in API|accessdate =March 14, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|year = 2010|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Java applet]] support is available in Chrome with Java 6 update 12 and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.com/en/download/chrome.jsp|title=Java and Google Chrome|publisher=Java.com|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Java under Mac OS X was provided by a Java Update released on May 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10812|title=Issue 10812 â chromium â No java plugin support yet|publisher=Google |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[privacy mode|private browsing]] feature called ''Incognito'' mode is provided that prevents the browser from storing any [[web browsing history|history]] information or [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] from the websites visited. Google Chrome erases the non privacy browsing history periodically to ensure the fastest browsing session possible. Default is set to be done once a month, but can be changed in settings to do more or less frequent.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95464&amp;hl=en |title=Explore Google Chrome Features: Incognito Mode |date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incognito mode is similar to the private browsing feature in [[Internet Explorer 8]] (and up), [[Mozilla Firefox 3.5]] (and up), [[Opera browser|Opera 10.5]] (and up) and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].

====Security vulnerabilities====
{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities}}
On January 12, 2011 versions of Chrome prior to version 8.0.552.237 were identified by [[US-CERT]] as &quot;contain[ing] multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities...By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document, PDF file, or video file, an attacker can cause the application to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.&quot; The vulnerability was subsequently patched and a new stable version was released to the public with Chrome's auto-update mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCERT13Jan11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/258423|title = Vulnerability Note VU#258423 â Google Chrome multiple vulnerabilities|accessdate =January 19, 2011|last = [[US-CERT]]|year = 2011|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No security vulnerabilities in Chrome have been successfully exploited in three years of [[Pwn2Own]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Keizer, [http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9214022/Google_s_Chrome_untouched_at_Pwn2Own_hack_match Google's Chrome untouched at Pwn2Own hack match], Computerworld, March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malware blocking===

Statistics show that users are four times more likely to be tricked into downloading malware than be compromised by an exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2010/abstracts/Hughes.xml|title=Virus Bulletin : 2010 - Social engineering trumps a zero-day every time |publisher=[[AVG Technologies]] |first=Brian|last=Hughes|accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study, Chrome 10 blocked only 13% of malicious URLS, tied for third place with Safari and Firefox.  In contrast, Internet Explorer 9 blocked 92% of malware with its URL-based filtering, and 100% with application-based filtering enabled. Internet Explorer 8, in second place, blocked 90% of malware.  Exploits that install malware without the user being aware (also referred to as &quot;clickjacking&quot; and &quot;drive-by downloads&quot;) were not included in this particular study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/07/internet-explorer-9-utterly-dominates-malware-blocking-stats.ars|title=Internet Explorer 9 utterly dominates malware-blocking stats |date=2011-07-16 |publisher=Ars Technica |first=Peter|last=Bright|accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsslabs.com/research/endpoint-security/browser-security/web-browser-group-test-socially-engineered-malware-europe-q2-2011.html |title=Web Browser Group Test Socially-Engineered Malware |date=2011-07-16 |publisher=[[NSS Labs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed===
The [[JavaScript]] [[virtual machine]] used by Chrome, the [[V8 JavaScript engine]], has features such as ''[[just-in-time compilation|dynamic code generation]]'', ''hidden class transitions'', and ''[[garbage collection (computer science)#Precise vs. conservative and internal pointers|precise garbage collection]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; Tests by Google in September 2008 showed that V8 was about twice as fast as [[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3.0]] and the WebKit nightlies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Several websites performed benchmark tests using the [[SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark]] tool as well as Google's own set of computationally intense benchmarks, which include [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[constraint solving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/apis/v8/run.html|title=V8 Benchmark suite|accessdate=September 3, 2008|publisher=Google code}}&lt;/ref&gt; They unanimously reported that Chrome performed much faster than all competitors against which it had been tested, including [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (for Windows), [[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3.0]], [[Internet Explorer 7]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and [[Internet Explorer 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Chrome â first benchmarks.

He stated that Firefox 3.0 performed poorly on [[recursion]]-intensive benchmarks, such as those of Google, because the Mozilla team had not implemented recursion-tracing yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Resig|authorlink=John Resig|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-performance-rundown/|title=JavaScript Performance Rundown|date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after Chrome's launch, the WebKit team announced a new JavaScript engine, [[WebKit#Further development|SquirrelFish Extreme]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://webkit.org/blog/214/introducing-squirrelfish-extreme/ |title= WebKit blog: Introducing SquirrelFish Extreme |author=Maciej Stachowiak |date= September 18, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing a 36% speed improvement over Chrome's V8 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://summerofjsc.blogspot.com/2008/09/squirrelfish-extreme-has-landed.html |title= SquirrelFish Extreme has landed! |author=Cameron Zwarich |date= September 18, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.builderau.com.au/news/soa/Step-aside-Chrome-for-Squirrelfish-Extreme/0,339028227,339292128,00.htm?feed=pt_performance |title= Step aside, Chrome, for Squirrelfish Extreme â News |author=Stephen Shankland |publisher=Builder AU |date= September 22, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.satine.org/archives/2008/09/19/squirrelfish-extreme-fastest-javascript-engine-yet/ |title= SquirrelFish Extreme: Fastest JavaScript Engine Yet |author=Charles Ying |date= September 19, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome uses [[Domain Name System|DNS]] prefetching to speed up website lookups, as do Firefox&lt;ref name=&quot;features&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/three_hidden_chrome_features_youll_love|title=Three hidden Chrome features you'll love|author=Preston Gralla|date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Safari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#performance|title=What's new in Safari 5|author=Apple Inc.|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is available in Internet Explorer as an extension, and in [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] as a UserScript.

Chrome utilizes the faster [[SPDY]] protocol designed to augment [[HTTP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/spdy/|title=Chromium SPDY client implementation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-proxy-examples|title=Chromium: SPDY proxy examples}}&lt;/ref&gt; when communicating with Google services, such as [[Google Search]], [[Gmail]], Chrome sync and when serving Google's ads. Google acknowledges that the use of SPDY is enabled in the communication between Chrome and Google's [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]-enabled servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/spdy-dev/browse_thread/thread/4c2396ecbc36b1c4|title=spdy-dev mailing list: SPDY on Google servers?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stability===
The [[Gears (software)|Gears]] team implemented a multi-process architecture in Chrome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html|title=Multi-process Architecture |last=Reisn|first=Charlie|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, by default, a separate process is allocated to each site instance and plugin. This procedure is termed [[process isolation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models|title=Process Models|date=September 3, 2008|work=The Chromium Projects|publisher=Google|accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it prevents tasks from interfering with each other, raising security and stability. An attacker successfully gaining access to one application gains access to no others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Google-Chrome-Puts-Security-in-a-Sandbox/|title=Google Chrome Puts Security in a Sandbox|last=Prince|first=Brian|date=December 11, 2008|work=eWeek.com|publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and failure in one instance results in a ''Sad Tab'' [[screen of death]], similar to the well-known ''[[Sad Mac]]'', but only one tab crashes instead of the whole application. This strategy exacts a fixed per-process cost up front, but results in less memory bloat overall as fragmentation is confined to each instance and no longer needs further memory allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google.com/googlebooks/chrome/|title=Google Chrome book|work=Google|date=September 21, 2008|accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This architecture is being adopted in upcoming versions of Safari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2010-April/012235.html|title=Webkit.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Firefox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2010/04/08/firefox-lorentz-beta-available-for-download-and-testing/ |title=Firefox Lorentz beta available for download and testing |date=April 8, 2010 |publisher=Mozilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the near future most common browsers will use a multi-process architecture.

Chrome includes a [[process management (computing)|process management]] utility called ''Task Manager'' which lets users see what sites and plugins are using the most [[random-access memory|memory]], [[download]]ing the most [[byte]]s and overusing the [[central processing unit|CPU]] and provides the ability to terminate them.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt;

===User interface===

By default, the main [[user interface]] includes back, forward, refresh/cancel and menu buttons. A home button is not shown by default, but can be added through the preferences menu to take the user to the new tab page or a custom home page.

[[tab (GUI)|Tabs]] are the main component of Chrome's user interface and as such, have been moved to the top of the window rather than below the controls. This subtle change contrasts with many existing tabbed browsers which are based on [[window (computing)|windows]] and contain tabs. Tabs, with their state, can be transferred seamlessly between window containers by dragging. Each tab has its own set of controls, including the ''Omnibox''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt;

The ''Omnibox'' is the [[address bar|URL box]] at the top of each tab, which combines the functions of both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing ''Tab'' to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before â powered by [[Google Suggest]]), and popular searches. Although [[Google Suggest]] can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also [[autocomplete]] the URLs of sites visited often.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; If a user types several keywords into the Omnibox and press enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.

When Google Chrome is not maximized, the tab bar appears directly under the title bar. When maximized, the tabs become flush with the top of the titlebar. Like other browsers, it has a full-screen mode that hides the operating system's interface as well as the browser chrome.

One of Chrome's differentiating features is the ''New Tab Page'', which can replace the browser [[home page]] and is displayed when a new tab is created. Originally, this showed thumbnails of the nine most visited web sites, along with frequent searches, recent bookmarks, and recently closed tabs; similar to [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Firefox]] with [[Google Toolbar]] 6, or [[Opera (web browser)|Opera's]] Speed Dial.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt; In Google Chrome 2.0, the New Tab Page was updated to allow users to hide thumbnails they did not want to appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/05/speedier-google-chrome-for-all-users.html |title=A Speedier Google Chrome for all users |work=Google Chrome Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| caption2  = Google Chrome logos. Top: 3D motif from project start until March 2011. Bottom: 2D motif from March 2011 until present.}}
Starting in version 3.0, the New Tab Page was revamped to display thumbnails of the eight most visited web sites. The thumbnails could be rearranged, pinned, and removed. Alternatively, a list of text links could be displayed instead of thumbnails. It also features a &quot;Recently closed&quot; bar that shows recently closed tabs and a &quot;tips&quot; section that displays hints and tricks for using the browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-chrome-after-year-sporting-new.html |title=Google Chrome after a year: Sporting a new stable release |author=Anthony Laforge |publisher=Google |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome includes a bookmark manager that can be opened from a menu. Adding the [[command-line interface|command-line]] option: ''--bookmark-menu'' adds a bookmarks button to the right of the Omnibox that can be used in place of the bookmarks bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5350737/add-a-bookmark-button-to-google-chromes-toolbar |title=Add a Bookmark Button to Google Chrome's Toolbar |author=Kevin Purdy |publisher=Lifehacker |date=September 2, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, this function was unavailable on the Linux and Mac platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Issue21152&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21152 |title=Issue 21152: Expose UI for bookmark menu on all platforms |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |last=Google |year=2009 |month=September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[pop-up ad|Popup]] windows are associated with the tab they came from and will not appear outside the tab unless the user explicitly drags them out.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt;

Google Chrome's preferences page has four parts: ''Basic'', ''Personal Stuff'', ''Under the Hood'', and as of Chrome 15, a ''Downloads'' part. The ''Basic'' part includes options for the home page, search engine, and default browser. The ''Personal Stuff'' part lets users configure synchronization, saved passwords, form autofill, browsing data, and themes. The ''Under the Hood'' part allows changing network, privacy, download, and security settings. The ''Downloads'' part was a separate page at one time showing previous and active downloads but as of Chrome 15 is incorporated into Preferences.  

Like Firefox, Chrome does not have a status bar, but displays loading activity and hover-over information via a status bubble that pops up at the bottom left of the relevant page, excluding hovering over links in image maps.

For [[web developer]]s, Chrome features an element inspector similar to the one in [[Firebug (Firefox extension)|Firebug]].&lt;ref name=&quot;features&quot;/&gt;

As part of Google's [[Google's hoaxes#2009|April Fools' Day jokes]], a special build of Chrome was released on April 1, 2009 with the added feature of being able to render pages in [[Anaglyph image|anaglyph 3D]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-3d&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/chrome/cadie/ |title=Google Chrome with 3D |date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=Google |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome has special URLs that load application-specific pages instead of websites or files on disk. Chrome also has a built-in ability to enable experimental features. Originally called ''about:labs'', the address was changed to ''about:flags'' to make it less obvious to casual users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/url_constants.cc |title=Chromium url_constants.cc |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutFlags19Oct10&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lifehacker.com/5667846/chromes-aboutlabs-renamed-to-aboutflags-adds-a-warning |title=Chrome's About:Labs Renamed to About:Flags, Adds a Warning |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |last=Pash |first=Adam |year=2010 |month=October |work=LifeHacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Google introduced a new simplified logo to replace the previous 3D logo that had been used since the project's inception. Google designer Steve Rura explained the company reasoning for the change, &quot;Since Chrome is all about making your web experience as easy and clutter-free as possible, we refreshed the Chrome icon to better represent these sentiments. A simpler icon embodies the Chrome spirit â to make the web quicker, lighter, and easier for all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blog21Mar11&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/03/fresh-take-on-icon.html |title=A fresh take on an icon |last=Rura |first=Steve |year=2011 |month=March |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desktop shortcuts and apps===
Chrome allows users to make local desktop [[computer shortcut|shortcuts]] that open [[web application]]s in the browser. The browser, when opened in this way, contains none of the regular interface except for the title bar, so as not to &quot;interrupt anything the user is trying to do.&quot; This allows web applications to run alongside local software (similar to [[Mozilla Prism]] and [[Fluid (web browser)|Fluid]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;chrome-comic&quot;/&gt;

This feature, according to Google, will be enhanced with the [[Chrome Web Store]], a one-stop web-based web applications directory which opened in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore|title=Chrome Web Store|date=May 19, 2010|publisher=Google|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2010/05/chrome-web-store.html|title=The Chrome Web Store|author=Erik Lay|date=May 19, 2010|publisher=Google|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chrome Web Store====
Announced on December 7, 2010, the [[Chrome Web Store]] allows users to install web applications as extensions to the browser, although most of these function simply as links to popular web pages and/or games, but some of the apps like [[Springpad]] do provide extra features like offline access. The themes and extensions have also been tightly integrated into the new store, allowing users to search the entire catalog of Chrome extras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul09Dec10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2010/12/thoughts-on-the-chrome-store-does-the-web-need-an-app-delivery-channel.ars|title = Chrome Web Store: a solution in search of a problem?|accessdate =December 10, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|year = 2010|month = December| work=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chrome Web Store now acts as an App Store for [[Chromebooks]].

Criticism of the idea came quickly. Ryan Paul of [[Ars Technica]] wrote on December 9, 2010: &quot;The way that users consume applications in the desktop and mobile world is fundamentally different than they (sic) way that they do it on the Webâwhere paywalls are often reviled and there is little distinction between content and software. In such an environment, does the application store model make any sense? We are not convinced...Aside from gaming, the idea of an application store in a Web browserâwhere installation is little more than bookmarkingâseems counterintuitive and leaves us with the impression that the entire exercise is a solution in search of a problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul09Dec10&quot; /&gt;

The Chrome Web Store was opened on February 11, 2011 with the stable, non-beta, release of Google Chrome 9.0.597.98.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/02/dash-of-speed-3d-and-apps.html|title = A dash of speed, 3D and apps|accessdate =February 7, 2011|last = [[Google]]|year = 2011|month = February}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aero peek capability===
Google has included ''aero peek'' capability for each tab on Windows 7. This has not been added by default but can be user enabled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8036|title=Issue 8036: Show thumbnails for open tabs on Windows 7 superbar (Aero Peek)}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a displayed thumbnail image of the tab. This will create similar functioning to that which is already included in IE8, Firefox and other browsers.

Negative responses from beta users on the inefficiency of aero peek tabs implementation in Chrome lead Google to exclude this as a default function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37957|title=Issue 37957: Investigate solutions for Aero Peek flooding users with tab thumbnails}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensions===
On September 9, 2009, Google enabled extensions by default on Chrome's Dev channel, and provided several sample extensions for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.chromium.org/2009/09/extensions-status-on-runway-getting.html |title= Extensions Status: On the Runway, Getting Ready for Take-Off |author=Aaron Boodman |publisher=Google |date= September 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the Google Chrome extension gallery beta began with over 300 extensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Extensions beta&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.chromium.org/2009/12/extensions-beta-launched-with-over-300.html |title= Extensions beta launched, with over 300 extensions! |author=Erik Kay |publisher=Google |date= December 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Google Chrome 4.0, the extension gallery was officially launched on January 25, 2010, containing over 1500 extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/01/over-1500-new-features-for-google.html |title= Over 1,500 new features for Google Chrome |author=Nick Baum |publisher=Google Chrome Blog |date= January 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google became leaders in the field of [[Search engine optimization]] and have even published an SEO Starter Guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides valuable information on how to optimize your site in the Google era. [[Matt Cutts]] who works for the Search Quality group in Google, specializing in search engine optimization issues, is well known in the SEO community for enforcing the Google Webmaster Guidelines and advising the public on how to get better website visibility in Google.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/type/googleseo/ Matt Cutts: Gadgets, Google, and SEO]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thanks to Google's cooperation with the SEO industry, Google Chrome became a valuable browser for developers in the SEO business who developed many SEO [[Google Chrome Extensions|extensions for Google Chrome]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/groups/tweakthetweet/wiki/f109e/SEO_Extensions_for_Google_Chrome.html SEO extensions for Google Chrome]&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome web store also enables many SEO tools.

As of February 4, 2011, the extension gallery featured over 11500 extensions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.chromium.org/2010/08/security-improvements-and-registration.html |title= Security improvements and registration updates for the Google Chrome Extensions Gallery |date= August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including official extensions from [[The Independent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mdonfjaemnemdnnpebbcelibeocdmkai?hl=en-GB|title=Official Independent Chrome Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CEOP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jgmdagpgkaiajnllhiabcamdlggjopnj?hl=en-GB|title=CEOP Official Chrome Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transport for London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dcbnpmjhmjhpaegikhpjlaemjiilnkgb?hl=en-gb|title=Official TfL Chrome Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cricinfo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ijhlikjoigjegofbedmfmlcfkmhabldh|title=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WOT: Web of Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp|title=WOT â Google Chrome extension gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FIFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/naenffbbmemiekgcjgelmggkaohdeaab?hl=en-gb|title=Official World Cup FIFA Chrome Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2011, the Chrome webstore aka Extension gallery received a major upgrade, along with new extensions and better organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-chrome-even-more-app-ealing.html |title= Making Chrome even more app-ealing |author=Shannon Guymon |publisher=Google Chrome Blog |date= October 25, 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Many Chrome extensions, once installed, have access to your data. According to the [http://www.google.com/support/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=186213&amp;rd=1 Chrome Web Store Help], there are three levels of permissions that an app or extension may request: 
* High Alert - &quot;plug-ins can do almost anything, in or outside of your browser. For example, they could use your webcam, or they could read your personal files.&quot;

Many seemingly simple extensions, such Google's own [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg# Screen Capture Tool], require High Alert permissions.

===Themes===
Starting with Google Chrome 3.0, users can install themes to alter the appearance of the browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/10/splash-of-color-to-your-browser-artist.html |title= A splash of color to your browser: Artist Themes for Google Chrome |author=Glen Murphy |publisher=Google Chrome Blog |date= October 5, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many free third-party themes are provided in an online gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html|title=Google Chrome Themes Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; accessible through a &quot;Get themes&quot; button in Chrome's options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=148695 Basic settings: Change browser theme] Google Chrome Help&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automatic web page translation===
Starting with Google Chrome 4.1 the application added a built-in translation bar using [[Google Translate]]. Translation is currently available for 52 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hlrm=ru&amp;answer=173424|title=Support Google Chrome â Automatic web page translation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release channels and updates===
On January 8, 2009 Google introduced a new release system with three distinct channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the &quot;Dev&quot; channel). Before this change there were only two channels: Beta and Developer preview. All previous Developer channel users were moved to the Beta channel. The reason given by Google is that the Developer channel builds are less stable and polished than those that Developer channel users were getting during Google Chrome's Beta period. The stable channel will be updated with features and fixes once they have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel will be updated roughly monthly with stable and complete features from the Developer channel.
The Developer channel is where ideas get tested (and sometimes fail) and can be very unstable at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Larson |date=January 8, 2009|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/google-chrome-release-channels.html |title=Google Chrome Release Channels |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Larson|date=January 8, 2009|url=http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2009/01/dev-update-new-webkit-version-new.html|title=Dev update: New WebKit version, new features, and a new Dev channel|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 2010 Google announced it will ramp up the speed it will release new stable versions; they will shorten the release cycles from quarterly to 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anthony Laforge|date=July 22, 2010|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/release-early-release-often.html|title=Release Early, Release Often|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faster release cycle brought a fourth channel: the &quot;Canary&quot; release; the name refers to [[Canary in a coal mine|using canaries in coal mines]], so if a change &quot;kills&quot; Chrome Canary, they will block it from the developer build. Canary will be &quot;the most bleeding-edge official version of Chrome and somewhat of a mix between Chrome dev and the Chromium snapshot builds&quot;. Canary releases run side-by-side with any other channel; it is not linked to the other Google Chrome installation and can therefore run different synchronization profiles, themes, and browser preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lee Mathews|date=July 23, 2010|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/07/23/google-chrome-canary-run-two-channels-at-once/|title=Google drops Chrome Canary build down the Chrome mineshaft|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be set as the default browser. Canary was Windows-only at first, a [[Mac OS X]] version was released on May 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.chromium.org/2011/05/adding-more-yellow-to-mac-color-scheme.html The Chromium Blog: Adding more yellow to the Mac color scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome automatically keeps itself up to date. The details differ by platform.
On Windows, it uses [[Google Updater]], and autoupdate can be controlled via [[Group Policy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/05/google-update-releases-update-controls.html |title= Google Update Releases Update Controls |author=David Dorwin |date= May 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or users can download a standalone version that does not autoupdate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?standalone=1|title=standalone download page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/03/standalone-offline-installer-for-google.html |title= Standalone Offline Installer for Google Chrome |author=Alex Chitu |publisher=Google Operating System |date= March 1, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Mac, it uses Google Update Service, and autoupdate can be controlled via the Mac OS X &quot;defaults&quot; system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=147176&amp;ctx=go|title=Google Help page &quot;Managing updates in Google Software Update&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Linux, it lets the system's normal [[package management system]] supply the updates.

Google uses its Courgette algorithm to provide the binary difference of the user's current version in relation to the new version that's about to be automatically updated to. These tiny updates are well suited to minor security fixes and allow Google to push new versions of Chrome to users quickly, thereby reducing the window of vulnerability of newly discovered security flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.chromium.org/2009/07/smaller-is-faster-and-safer-too.html |title= Chromium Blog: Smaller is Faster (and Safer Too) |author=Stephen Adams |date= July 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage tracking===
Chrome sends details about its usage to [[Google]] through both optional and non-optional user tracking mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2008/10/google-chrome-chromium-and-google.html|title=Communications between Chromium/Google Chrome and service providers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the tracking mechanisms can be optionally enabled and disabled through the installation interface&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html?brand=CHKZ Google Chrome Privacy Notice â Google]&lt;/ref&gt; and through the browser's options dialog.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogoscoped&quot;/&gt; Unofficial builds, such as [[SRWare Iron]] and ChromePlus, seek to remove these features from the browser altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;iron&quot;/&gt; The RLZ feature is not included in the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] browser either.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChromiumBlog20Jun10&quot;/&gt;

In March 2010, Google devised a new method to collect installation statistics: the unique ID token included with Chrome is now only used for the first connection that Google Update makes to its server. This sole remaining non-optional user tracking mechanism is removed following the server ping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/16/google_chrome_unique_identifier_change/ |title=Google Chrome Unique Identifier Change |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System requirements==
The recommended requirements for optimal performance of Chrome are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System requirements : Install or update Google Chrome : Google Chrome Help|url=http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95411|author=Google|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Linux: Ubuntu 8.04 or later / Debian 5 / OpenSuse 11.1 , Intel Pentium 3 / Athlon 64 or later, 100MB Hard Disk, 128MB memory

===64-bit builds===
As of 2011, [[64-bit]] builds are available for Linux, with only 32-bit available for Mac OS X and Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=64-bit Support â The Chromium Projects|url=http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/64-bit-support|author=Google|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Chrome for Linux â Terms and Conditions Agreement|url=http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?platform=linux&amp;hl=en|author=Google|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{See|Usage share of web browsers|Browser wars}}
[[File:Wikimedia browser share pie chart.png|frameless|left]]
[[File:Usage share of web browsers (Source StatCounter).svg|thumb|right|[[Usage share of web browsers]] according to [[StatCounter]], Chrome was 23.16% in August 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsCounter&quot;/&gt;]]
In 2008, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'''s Matthew Moore summarizes the verdict of early reviewers: &quot;Google Chrome is attractive, fast and has some impressive new features, but may notâyetâbe a threat to its Microsoft rival.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Moore |title=Google Chrome browser: Review of reviews |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3358306/Google-Chrome-browser-Review-of-reviews.html |accessdate=2011-09-24 |date=2008-09-02 |work=Daily Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Microsoft reportedly played down the threat from Chrome and predicted that most people will embrace [[Internet Explorer 8]]. [[Opera Software]] said that &quot;Chrome will strengthen the Web as the biggest application platform in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/03/google-polishes-product-line-with-chrome-browser.html|title=Google polishes product line with Chrome browser |first=Michael |last=Liedtke |date=2008-09-03|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by February 25, 2010, ''BusinessWeek'' had reported that &quot;For the first time in years, energy and resources are being poured into browsers, the ubiquitous programs for accessing content on the Web. Credit for this trendâa boon to consumersâgoes to two parties. The first is Google, whose big plans for the Chrome browser have shaken Microsoft out of its competitive torpor and forced the software giant to pay fresh attention to its own browser, Internet Explorer. Microsoft all but ceased efforts to enhance IE after it triumphed in the last browser war, sending Netscape to its doom. Now it's back in gear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_10/b4169074693523.htm |title=Browser Wars: The Sequel |first=Rich |last=Jaroslovsky |work=BusinessWeek |date=February 25, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozilla said that Chrome's introduction into the web browser market comes as &quot;no real surprise&quot;, that &quot;Chrome is not aimed at competing with Firefox&quot;, and furthermore that it should not affect [[Mozilla Foundation#Financing|Google's revenue relationship with Mozilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/09/01/thoughts-on-chrome-more/ |title= Thoughts on Chrome &amp; More |publisher=John's Blog |date= September 1, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/222147/mozilla-google-is-not-trying-to-kill-us.html |title=Mozilla: Google's not trying to kill us |first=Barry |last=Collins |date=September 2, 2008 |publisher=PC Pro |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Chrome's design bridges the gap between desktop and so-called &quot;[[cloud computing]].&quot; At the touch of a button, Chrome lets you make a desktop, [[Start menu]], or [[Quick Launch]] shortcut to any Web page or [[Web application]], blurring the line between what's online and what's inside your PC. For example, I created a desktop shortcut for [[Google Maps]]. When you create a shortcut for a Web application, Chrome strips away all of the [[toolbar]]s and tabs from the window, leaving you with something that feels much more like a [[desktop application]] than like a Web application or page.|[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/150579/google_chrome_web_browser.html |title=Google Chrome Web Browser |first=Nick |last=Mediati |date=September&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;2008 |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to StatCounter, Chrome was the most used web browser in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], [[Tunisia]], [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Armenia]] in July 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsCounter&quot; /&gt;

Due to a faulty virus definition update on September 30, 2011, [[Microsoft Security Essentials]] incorrectly identified Google Chrome as malware and began deleting it from user's systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keizer30Sep11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9220435/Microsoft_kills_Google_Chrome_with_bad_malware_signature|title = Microsoft kills Google Chrome with bad malware signature|accessdate = 1 October 2011|last = Keizer|first = Gregg|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = September| work = [[Computerworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bott30Sep11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/users-report-microsoft-security-essentials-removes-google-chrome/4006|title = Users report Microsoft Security Essentials removes Google Chrome|accessdate = 1 October 2011|last = Bott|first = Ed|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = September| work = [[ZDNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metz30Sep11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/09/microsoft-anti-malware-tool-mistakenly-snuffs-google-chrome/|title = Microsoft Anti-Malware Tool Mistakenly Snuffs Google Chrome|accessdate = 1 October 2011|last = Metz|first = Cade|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = September| work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sampson30Sep11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.infoworld.com/t/patch-management/microsoft-security-update-treats-chrome-malware-174721|title = Microsoft security update treats Chrome as malware|accessdate = 1 October 2011|last = Sampson|first = Ted|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = September| work = [[InfoWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User tracking===
Concern about Chrome's optional usage collection and tracking have been noted in several publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elise |last=Ackerman |title=Google browser's tracking feature alarms developers, privacy advocates |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_10510989 |publisher=Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10031661-56.html?tag=txt |title=Google's Omnibox could be Pandora's box |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2008, a [[CNET]] news item&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10030522-2.html | title=Be sure to read Chrome's fine print |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew attention to a passage in the Terms of Service statement for the initial beta release, which seemed to grant to Google a license to all content transferred via the Chrome browser. The passage in question was inherited from the general Google terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/accounts/TOS?hl=en|title=Google Terms of Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Google responded to this criticism by stating that the language used was borrowed from other products, and removed the passage in question from the Terms of Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Chrome Terms of Service (English) |url=http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?hl=en |accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google noted that this change would &quot;apply retroactively to all users who have downloaded Google Chrome.&quot;&lt;ref name=license-change&gt;{{Cite document |title=Google Amends Chrome License Agreement After Objections |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/150637/google_amends_chrome_license_agreement_after_objections.html |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 3, 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was subsequent concern and confusion about whether and what information the program communicates back to Google. The company stated that usage metrics are only sent when users opt in by checking the option &quot;help make Google Chrome better by automatically sending usage statistics and crash reports to Google&quot; when the browser is installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html |title=Google Chrome Privacy Notice |accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optional suggestion service included in Google Chrome has been criticized because it provides the information typed into the Omnibox to the search provider before the user even hits return. This allows the search engine to provide URL suggestions, but also provides them with web usage information tied to an [[IP address]]. The feature can be selected off in the ''preferences-under the hood-privacy'' box.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fried3Sep08&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10031661-56.html |title=Google's Omnibox could be Pandora's box |accessdate=May 13, 2010 |last=Fried |first=Ina |date=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Do Not Track===
In April 2011, Google was criticized for not signing onto the [[Do not track header|Do Not Track]] feature for Chrome that is being incorporated in most other modern web browsers, including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera. Critics pointed out that a new patent Google was granted in April 2011, for greatly enhanced user tracking though web advertising, will provide much more detailed information on user behavior and that ''do not track'' will hurt Google's ability to exploit this. Software reviewer Kurt Bakke of ''Conceivably Tech'' wrote, &quot;Google said that it intends charge advertisers based on click-through rates, certain user activities and a pay-for-performance model. The entire patent seems to fit Google's recent claims that Chrome is critical for Google to maintain search dominance through its Chrome web browser and Chrome OS and was described as a tool to lock users to Google's search engine and â ultimately â its advertising services. So, how likely is it that Google will follow the do-not-track trend? Not very likely.&quot; Mozilla developer Asa Dotzler noted, &quot;It seems pretty obvious to me that the Chrome team is bowing to pressure from Google's advertising business and that's a real shame. I had hoped they'd demonstrate a bit more independence than that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakke18Apr11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/6863/products/chrome-shields-websites-from-denial-of-service-attacks|title = Chrome Shields Websites From Denial-Of-Service Attacks|accessdate =April 20, 2011|last = Bakke|first = Kurt|year = 2011|month = April| work=Conceivably Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakke19Apr11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/6891/business/google-menu-ad-tracking-a-case-of-bad-timing|title = Google Menu Ad Tracking: A Case Of Bad Timing?|accessdate =April 20, 2011|last = Bakke|first = Kurt|year = 2011|month = April| work=Conceivably Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dotzler14Apr11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2011/04/chrome_do_not_track.html |title = Chrome, Do Not Track, and Google Advertising|accessdate =April 20, 2011|last = Dotzler|first = Asa|year = 2011|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google argued that the technology is useless at the present time, as advertisers are not required to obey the user's tracking preference and as it is still unclear on what constitutes tracking (as opposed to storing statistical data or user preferences). As an alternative, Google offers an extension called &quot;Keep My Opt-Outs&quot;, which permanently bars ad companies from installing cookies on the user's computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhnjdplhmcnkiecampfdgfjilccfpfoe |title = Keep My Opt-Outs, Chrome Web Store |accessdate =June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to this extension was mixed. Paul Thurrott of ''Windows IT Pro'' called the extension &quot;much, much closer to what I've been asking forâi.e. something that just works and doesn't require the user to figure anything outâthan the IE or Firefox solutions&quot; while lamenting the fact that the extension is not included as part of the browser itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.winsupersite.com/blogs/entryid/76091/daily-update-googles-do-not-track-solution-apple-stuff-crysis-2-demo-more |title = Daily Update: Google's Do Not Track Solution, Apple Stuff, Crysis 2 Demo, More|accessdate =April 22, 2011|last = Thurrott|first = Paul|year = 2011|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bundling practices ==
On Windows, Chrome comes bundled with the installers of various other applications such as the Adobe Flash Player plug-in (when installing it for Firefox, Opera, or Safari)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salsitasoft.com/blog/2011/09/23/wonder-how-chrome-is-growing-market-share-ask-adobe/ | title=Wonder How Chrome is Growing Market Share? Ask Adobe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Skype.  In the case of Skype, the installer makes Chrome the default browser unless the user explicitly opts out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://people.mozilla.org/~khuey/skype-install-2011-10-3.png |title= Screenshot of Skype's install dialog on Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=November 2011}} This has since changed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
