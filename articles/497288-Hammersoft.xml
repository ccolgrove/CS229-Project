Eastern Connecticut State University is ranked in the top 100 regional universities in the North in the 2011 edition of the ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' list of Best Colleges. Eastern was the 28th top public institution on the list and was also the highest ranked university among the four Connecticut State University institutions.  It is also ranked as one of the best colleges in the Northeast, according to the [[Princeton Review]].  Eastern is one of 218 institutions that the Princeton Review recommends as the &quot;Best in the Northeast.&quot; 

The President of the University is Dr. Elsa NuÃ±ez.  Prior to Dr. NuÃ±ez, the university was led for nearly 18 years by Dr. David G. Carter. Dr. Carter became Chancellor of the Connecticut State University System in January 2006, and Dr. Michael Pernal succeeded him in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Dr. Elsa NuÃ±ez Appointed Eastern's Sixth President | publisher=Eastern Connecticut State University | date=2006-05-18 | url=http://www.easternct.edu/depts/urel/pressreleases2006/051806n.pdf | accessdate=2006-08-25|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eastern was founded in 1889 as the '''Willimantic State Normal School''', an institution whose sole purpose was to train teachers. Thirteen female students attended classes on the third floor of the Willimantic Savings Institute during its first year; the first male student was not enrolled until four years later in 1893.

In 1890, the town of Windham deeded {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of land to the State. The State decided to use it as new home for the Willimantic State Normal School, which was quickly outgrowing its space. Construction of a new, larger facility was completed in 1895. In September 1921, the school opened its first dormitory, Burr Hall, which is still in use today. In 1937, the Willimantic State Normal School, which had begun offering a four-year curriculum and granting [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees, became '''Willimantic State Teachers College'''.

Shafer Hall, dedicated in November 1946, was built to replace the original Normal School building, which had been lost to fire. The College established its first graduate program (in education) in 1958. By 1967, the school had widened its focus and was renamed '''Eastern Connecticut State College''' to reflect its expanded curricula. In 1983, the school officially became Eastern Connecticut State University in recognition of its greater mission, as it offered an ever-expanding variety of undergraduate and graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eastern's History of Excellence | url=http://www.easternct.edu/visitors/visitors_history.htm | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Eastern is home to 33 undergraduate [[Academic major|majors]] and 56 undergraduate minor programs.  Academically, the university is split into three schools.  Departments in the School of Arts and Sciences include Biology, Computer Science, English, Environmental Earth Science, History, Mathematics, Modern and Classical Languages, Performing Arts, Physical Sciences, Political Science, Philosophy, and Geography, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, and Social Work, Visual Arts, as well as the university's Writing Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ECSU School of Arts and Sciences | url=http://www.easternct.edu/depts/art_sciences/ | accessdate=August 25, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060818170009/http://www.easternct.edu/depts/art_sciences/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute for Sustainable Energy===
{{main|Institute for Sustainable Energy}}
The Institute for Sustainable Energy was opened in 2001 and focuses on [[sustainable energy]] education, becoming a source for sustainable energy information, assistance in sustainable energy [[Public policy|policy]] making, and assistance in implementing sustainable energy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Institute for Sustainable Energy Mission Statement | url=http://www.easternct.edu/depts/sustainenergy/about_us/mission_statement.html | accessdate=August 25, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060918042011/http://www.easternct.edu/depts/sustainenergy/about_us/mission_statement.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute is located at 182 High Street.  The current director of the Institute is William Leahy.

==Student life==
===Housing===
92% of first-year students, and 64% of all full-time undergraduates live in college [[Dormitory|housing]], making it by far the most residential of the Connecticut State University campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=College Board - ECSU Housing &amp; Campus Life | url=http://apps.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4119&amp;profileId=8 | accessdate=August 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campus is separated into first-year halls and upper-class halls.  All students with Sophomore status and higher are eligible to live in upper-class halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Housing and Residential Life | url=http://www.easternct.edu/depts/housing/index.html | accessdate=August 25, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060914183234/http://www.easternct.edu/depts/housing/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six first-year halls, five upper-class halls and two sets of apartments.

===Student organizations===
Eastern offers more than 60 [[student organization]]s in which students can participate, including athletic, political, cultural, artistic, and communication clubs.  The Campus Activity Board sponsors many of the events on campus, including movies, concerts, comedians, and trips.  The [[Student newspaper|campus newspaper]] is ''The Campus Lantern'' and the [[Student television station|campus newscast]] is News 22. The Campus Lantern is available on the web at [http://www.campuslantern.org CampusLantern.org]. The Student Government Association is the liaison between the student body and university administration and each residence hall has a student council that plans events and trips for hall residents.

===Athletics===
[[Image:Ecsu warriors.png|thumb|right|The old ECSU Warriors logo, used until May 2009]]
Eastern teams are known as the &quot;Warriors.&quot; The university is a member of the [[NCAA]] Division III, the [[Little East Conference]] and the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fast Facts | url=http://www.easternct.edu/admis/fact.html | accessdate=August 25, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060427191740/http://www.easternct.edu/admis/fact.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intramural and/or collegiate teams are offered for these sports: badminton, baseball, basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross-country, dodgeball, field hockey, lacrosse, racquetball, rugby, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, indoor and outdoor track, volleyball, and water polo.

For many years the official logo of the Eastern Warriors consisted of a &quot;Warrior Cat&quot; pouncing on a ball. The University recognized, however, that student enthusiasm for this logo was low and announced in 2009 that with the input of students, coaches and the Student Athlete Advisory Council, it would seek to create a new logo to replace its old &quot;Warrior Cat&quot; logo. The process of creating the new logo took many months. After receiving the endorsement of the Student Government Association, the new logo was unveiled on May 1, 2009 and made effective immediately. The University has hinted that it may also develop a new mascot in the near future. The new logo, depicting a shield superior to two crossed swords, received mixed reactions from the student body. A [[Grassroots]] effort to incorporate a frog, or &quot;Warrior Frog&quot; by a percentage of the student body never made much head way, as it formed so late in the logo development process. The &quot;Warrior Frog&quot; supporters believed that incorporating the local municipal mascot of [[Willimantic]], [[Connecticut]], a Frog,[http://www.curbstone.org/index.cfm?webpage=102] would have strengthened local ties to the community.

==Campus==
Eastern's campus, which is spread over {{convert|182|acre|km2}}, is divided into three areas: South Campus, North Campus, and the University Baseball Complex. South Campus is the historic part of the University and includes buildings such as Burr Hall, the schoolâs first dormitory, which dates back to 1921.

===Improvement Projects===
The university has undergone a number of construction projects in recent years, much of it under the leadership of former President Dr. David G. Carter.  Past projects have included the construction of a new administration building, a new library, five new residence halls, the conversion of Burr Hall from a women-only residence hall to a co-ed residence, renovation and expansion of the Student Center, the construction of a state-of-the-art Science Building, and the Child and Family Development Center. A new public safety building opened in August 2009.  A new parking garage was built next to the other parking garage in the north part of campus, having opened in January 2011 and artificial turf was installed on the soccer/field hockey/lacrosse field during the summer of 2009. Projects being planned for the future include a fine arts building, development of major campus entrances, a new softball stadium next to the site of the baseball stadium and the second phase of the track project which includes installing bleachers and lighting. One of the major driving forces behind Eastern's construction projects is to make more green space for their students.
