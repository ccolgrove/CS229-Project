The airport, with its five operating terminals spread over an operational area of {{Convert|1450|acre|km2|abbr=on}}, is India's and South Asia's largest and most important [[airline hub]]; it handled more than 29.9 million passengers and 670,235 tonnes of cargo in 2010â2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csia.in/knowyourairport/aboutcsia.aspx CSIA |Know Your Airport | About CSIA | The Airport&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thaindian.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/mumbai-airport-voted-best-in-india_10049866.html |title=ThaIndian |publisher=ThaIndian |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Delhi]]'s [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]], it handles more than half of the air traffic in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;delhibeatsmumbai&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Saurabh Sinha, TNN, 10 July 2008, 03.54am IST |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Delhi_is_countrys_busiest_airport/articleshow/3216435.cms |title=Delhi beats Mumbai to become busiest airport |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;igiedgecsi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domain-b.com/aero/airports/20080901_csia.html |title=Delhi's IGIA edges ahead of Mumbai's CSIA as country's busiest airport |publisher=Domain-b.com |date=2008-09-01 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mumairport&quot;&gt;[http://www.travelbizmonitor.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?aid=1777&amp;sid=18&amp;sname=Coverstory Travel Biz Monitor: Mumbai airport gets ready for new innings]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the period of Apr&amp;ndash;Nov 2010, it was the ''busiest'' airport in India in terms of international passenger traffic and the ''second busiest'' in terms of overall passenger traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aai.aero/traffic_news/nov2k10annex3.pdf AAI traffic figures]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the airport was ranked the 30th busiest airport in the world [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|in terms of cargo]] with 671,238 tonnes handled. Formerly called Sahar (international) Airport and Santa Cruz (domestic) Airport, the two airports were merged and renamed after the 17th century [[Maratha]] Emperor, [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji]] Bhosle, to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.  In February 2006, Mumbai International Airport Limited, a consortium of GVK Industries Ltd, [[Airports Company South Africa]], and Bidvest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bidvest.co.za/ |title=Bidvest.co.za |publisher=Bidvest.co.za |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to carry out the modernisation of Mumbai Airport. A massive scale modernisation is underway and once it is  completed in 2013 it is again set to become the busiest airport in the country. The airport has almost reached its saturation point. Mumbai airport is amongst the very few international airport which is located within the city itself unlike many major airports which are constructed in outskirts of the city. Also Mumbai has only one major International airport but citizens are often confused that International airport is at Andheri and Domestic airport is at Santacruz, The fact it is only one airport but two different terminals at different suburbs of Mumbai. The airport is located in a Mumbai suburb. The business district of Andheri where many major international offices are located is just few minutes away from the international terminal.

==History==
The [[Juhu Aerodrome]] functioned as Mumbai's sole airport until 1942. Due to operational constraints imposed by its low-level location and proximity to the Arabian Sea coastline making it vulnerable during the monsoon season, a move further inland became necessary.
 
In 1942 a bigger airfield was set up at [[Santacruz, Mumbai|Santa Cruz]], which was also home to several [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Squadrons  from 1942 to 1947  during [[World War II]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Stations/Stations-S.htm |title=RAF Santacruz |publisher= www.rafweb.org |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=17-09-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The apron existed on the south side of runway 09/27, and the area, referred to today as the &quot;Old Airport&quot;, houses, among others, maintenance hangars of [[Air India]], Air Works India and MIAL's [[General Aviation]] Terminal.

In its first year, it handled six civilian services a day. Traffic at the airport increased after [[Karachi]] was partitioned to [[Pakistan]] and as many as 40 daily internal and foreign services operated by 1949.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1949/1949%20-%200920.html |title=Santacruz to be developed|work=[[Flight Global]] |date=19 May 1949 |accessdate=17 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 the RAF began the process of handing  over the airfield to the civil aviation authorities in India.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1946/oct/30/airfield-santa-cruz |title=Airfield, Santacruz |publisher= Hansard |date=30 October 1946 |accessdate=17-09-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1948, a new terminal building and [[Airport ramp|apron]] had been constructed across the runway 09/27, which was used by [[Air India]] for its maiden international flight to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowindia.net/aviation.html |title=Indian Aviation |publisher=knowIndia.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named after the neighbourhood in which it stood and initially under the aegis of the Public Works Department, the new airport was subsequently run by the [[Ministry of Civil Aviation (India)|Ministry of Civil Aviation]]. It's name remained Santa Cruz Airport until the new international terminal at nearby [[Sahar, Maharashtra|Sahar]] became operational in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutmumbai.net/client_coverstory/client_coverstory_details.asp?coverstoyrcode=90&amp;coverpage=true |title=city guide and fortnightly listing magazine :::: |publisher=Time Out Mumbai |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a major fire gutted the Santa Cruz terminal in 1979, a temporary departure extension or &quot;Gulf Terminal&quot; became functional in October that year. Prior to the fire, plans were already underway by the mid-1970s to construct a new international terminal since Santa Cruz, despite several extensions, had insufficent operational capacity. Even today, the domestic terminals 1-A and 1-B are still commonly referred to as Santa Cruz. Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), a consortium of GVK Industries Limited (GVK) and Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), was appointed to carry out the modernisation of Mumbai Airport in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2008/jan/03mumbai.htm |title=Mumbai airport: What will it be like |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report submitted by GVK to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the airport's total operating area covers {{convert|936|acre|km2}} of which actual encroached land is {{convert|262|acre|km2}} against a government estimate of {{convert|147|acre|km2}}. Land subject to legal proceedings covers an area of {{convert|34|acre|m2}}.

&quot;BOM&quot; , the Airport's [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code is derived from Bombay, Mumbai's former name.

==Structure==
[[File:Mumbai India Airport.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of Terminal 2]]
[[Image:Bombay Aport.JPG|thumb|right|Domestic Departures]]
[[Image:Terminal 1C.jpg|thumb|right| New Terminal 1C]]

The airport consists of two main terminals: Terminal 1 (Santa Cruz) for domestic flights and Terminal 2 (Sahar) for international flights. These terminals use the same airside facilities but are physically separated on the landside, requiring a 15â20 minute (airside) drive between them. The operating agency of the airport (MIAL) operates coach shuttle services between the domestic and international terminals for transit passengers. Terminal 1 is further divided into Terminal 1-A (which opened in April 1992, and serves Air India and Kingfisher Airlines), Terminal 1-B, the original Santa Cruz building used for international and domestic operations (refurbished since 1998, and serves [[JetLite]], SpiceJet, GoAir, IndiGo Airlines, and other private domestic low cost carriers) and Terminal 1-C (which opened in April 2010, is a boarding-only facility used by all airlines). Terminal 2, designed by ''[[AÃ©roports de Paris]]'' and opened in January 1981, was structurally divided as 2-A, 2-B, and 2-C. The original complex, 2-A, consisting of parking bays 41â46, namely, gates 3 to 8, were the first [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]] installed in the subcontinent and served most international carriers airlines whereas 2-C, inaugurated in October 1999, was, originally, exclusively for Air India, [[Air-India Express]], and those carriers whose ground operations were handled by Air India. Terminal 2-B functioned between September 1986 and October 1999 for Air India and handled airlines, before being decommisisoned when 2-C opened. Terminal 2-B, now extensively refurbished is operational following the demolition of 2-A. 

Mumbai has two intersecting [[runway]]s designated 09/27 and 14/32. Runway 14/32, {{convert|2925|m|ft|avvr=on|sigfig=4}},&lt;ref name=WAD&gt;{{WAD|VABB|source=[[DAFIF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs between terminals 1 and 2, while the main runway 09/27 is {{convert|3445|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=5}}&lt;ref name=&quot;WAD&quot;/&gt; (previously designated as {{convert|3489|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=5}}) intersects it south of the terminal buildings. The main runway is code F, which means it can accomodate larger aircraft like the [[Airbus A380]]. [[Instrument landing system]] (ILS) approaches are available on all runways, with runway 27 having CAT2 capabilities. The ILS on 27 starts at {{convert|3700|ft|m|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|10.5|nmi|km}} long with a glide slope path of 3.3Â°. With regard to (truncated) use of both runways, only {{convert|11303|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} is designated usable at 09/27 and {{convert|9596|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} at 14/32, especially for landings. Runway 14 approach requires [[aircraft]] to backtrack and exit upon landing as the turning pad at 32 end is unusable. Due to maintenance runway 09/27 is unavailable for operations between 0715â0915[[Coordinated Universal Time|Z]] on Mondays and Saturdays, and between 0715â0845Z on Wednesdays. A parallel taxiway has been installed on runway 14/32 for aircraft landing and taxing which saves time as well as runway occupancy.Meanwhile the lengths of both the runways are being extended.

From 1 January 2006, both runways were operated simultaneously for three hours in the morning from 0530 to 0830. On average, about 50 flights of smaller aircraft have taken off daily from 14/32 in this time period. Since the experiment was deemed successful it has recently been decided to carry out simultaneous use in the evenings too. It is not clear if this will be for two hours or three hours. A rate of 25 departures per hour is being targeted in the evening slot. The problems with utilising 14/32 are: (i) Mumbai's controversial new [[control tower]] erected in 1996 and some {{convert|72|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall penetrates transitional obstacle limitation surfaces by over {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} for [[instrument approach]]es, and in excess of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} for visuals. Approach minima at both 14 and 32 ends are higher (based on best approach aid) and are as follows: runway 14 (DA {{convert|580|ft|m|abbr=on}}), runway 32 (MDA {{convert|1440|ft|m|abbr=on}}) compared to runway 09 (DA {{convert|270|ft|m|abbr=on}}) or runway 27 (DA {{convert|230|ft|m|abbr=on}}), meaning that there is a higher probability of missed approaches and diversions in inclement weather (ii) a hillock, Trombay Hill, lies {{convert|4.5|nmi|km|abbr=on}} away from the 32 end, an approach also questioned recently by security agencies because the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC) nuclear complex at Trombay ([[Anushakti Nagar]]) lies within its flight path.

L&amp;T ECCD have been awarded the contract to expand Terminal 1 and to construct a new international terminal. The brand new International Terminal T2 is being designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] (SOM). Design Cell, a reputed firm based in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and New York has been appointed as Landscape Architects for the cityside open spaces at the departure and arrival level. T2 is expected to be completed by 2013. The terminal is X-shaped and has a total floor area of 4.3 million square metres across four floors. The new terminal will have 184 check-in counters, 56 passenger boarding bridges, 14 reclaim belts, around 700,000 sq ft of retail space and lounges and travel services and a car parking facility for over 5,000 cars. Currently, the airport has around 30 boarding bridges, 135 check-in counters and parking capacity for 3,600 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/New-terminal-network-of-taxiways-for-Mumbai-by-2013/articleshow/10810975.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=New terminal, network of taxiways for Mumbai by 2013 - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
[[File:Bombay port.JPG|thumb|right|Newly renovated International Arrivals at Terminal 2]]
[[Image:Mumbai Airport .jpg|thumb|right|Domestic Arrivals Terminal 1B]]
[[Image:Bombay Aiport.JPG|thumb|right|Domestic Arrivals]]

Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), a consortium of GVK Industries Limited (GVK) and Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), was appointed to carry out the modernisation of Mumbai Airport in February 2006. MIAL improved areas of passenger convenience like curbside, terminal entrances, and improved cleanliness. Human resources initiatives were taken such as employee communication and training. Some of the changes that have taken place at CSIA in the recent past include: aesthetic changes, additional check-in counters, refurbished toilets, improved signage, additional food and beverage outlets, better curbside, and management leading to a smoother traffic flow. The Airport's expansion plans have been repeatedly thwarted by slums encroaching onto the airport area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pinglay |first=Prachi |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7195357.stm |title=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |publisher=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic design and ambientation of the airport has mainly been created by Argentinan design studio Steinbranding. Landscape improvements were designed by Design Cell, a firm specialising in landscape architecture.

===Master plan===
[[File:Mumbai Airpot.jpg|thumb|right|Upgraded signage]]
In October 2006, MIAL unveiled the master plan&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csia.in/masterplan.asp |title=Master plan |publisher=Csia.in |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; for CSIA, which has been designed to expand and upgrade the infrastructure to cater for 40 million passengers per year and one million metric tonnes of cargo per year by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=25 March 2010 3:58PM |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/mumbai-airports-22bn-makeover/story-e6frgaho-1225845361584 |title=Mumbai Airport's $2.2bn makeover |publisher=The Australian |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The separate international and domestic terminals will be merged into one terminal building at the current international building and the current domestic terminal will be converted to a dedicated cargo terminal. MIAL has also incorporated a parallel runway as part of the master plan but there are some obstructions to this part of the which includes land acquisition and rehabilitation of slums as well as relocation of a number of airport facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/chhatrapati/ |title=Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, Maharashtra |publisher=Airport Technology |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation will be undertaken in two stages:
*The Interim Phase is the implementation of several immediate measures. These were completed in 2008 and include:
**Refurbishment and construction at Terminal 2
**Revamp of Terminal 1A to upgrade and expand facilities such as check-in counters and boarding bridges
**Setting-up of temporary cargo facilities to add capacity
**Upgrading of the airside runway facilities such as rapid exit [[taxiway]]s to increase runway capacity to cater to traffic growth
**Enhancing city-side facilities such as [[Multi-storey car park|multi-level car parks]]

*Phase One (to be completed by 2011) includes:
**Creation of a brand new terminal building (T2) at Sahar catering to both international and domestic operations
**Construction of a dedicated link from the Western Express Highway to T2 at Sahar
**Enhancement of the airside facilities by shifting the [[air traffic control]] tower and construction of a parallel taxiway
**Development of infrastructure on the city-side
**Building new cargo facilities
**Construction of Terminal 1C

New taxiways have been developed to reduce the runway occupancy time by aircraft after landing. The airport has five rapid exit taxiways. By 2013, 11 rapid exit taxiways will be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/New-terminal-network-of-taxiways-for-Mumbai-by-2013/articleshow/10810975.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=New terminal, network of taxiways for Mumbai by 2013 - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIAL is undertaking the installation of a centralised data system which will provide information about domestic as well as international flights to all display devices at both terminals instead of just one or the other as at present. There are plans to extend the scope of the system to the air traffic control (ATC) and [[Airport ramp|apron]] control areas, the airport website and even to leading hotel chains. A centralised [[call centre]] to provide flight details is also envisaged. While a parallel runway has apparently been ruled out by the AAI and Civil Aviation Ministry, at least for the time being, the ATC tower is now expected to be taken down and relocated to facilitate cross-runway operation.

A [[Wi-Fi]] service is available free of charge throughout the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=24 Apr, 2007, 03.40AM IST,TNN |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Transportation/Airlines__Aviation/Free_wi-fi_at_Mumbai_airport_/articleshow/1947218.cms |title=Free wi-fi at Mumbai airport |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2007-04-24 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parallel runway====
A second parallel runway is one of the options being considered to meet objections raised by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests against the proposed location of the [[Navi Mumbai International Airport]] near Kopra [[Panvel]].

Two alternatives have been mooted by MIAL in unveiled the master plan&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; for CSIA.
#An east-west runway parallel to the existing runway 09/27 on the southern side. With a length of {{convert|12500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, this runway will accommodate new-generation aircraft, and also be sufficiently distant (more than {{convert|800|ft|m}} apart) from the existing runway; it would necessitate the relocation of Air-India's hangars and maintenance facilities.
#A second runway parallel to the current cross runway 14/32 on the northern side, between the international terminal to the north and the Kalina campus university grounds. The airport's flight kitchens and the Sahar police station would have to be moved and the area to which they could be relocated is occupied by thousands of slum-dwellers.

===Terminals===
The airport consists of four terminals:
*'''Terminal 1''', at Santacruz, for domestic flights
**This terminal has two terminals: 1A and 1B. 1C is a gates-only facility and can be reached from both 1A and 1B after security check. Check-in and security are all performed only in 1A and 1B.
*'''Terminal 2''', at Sahar, for international flights.
**All international flights, as well as domestic segments of international flights operate from Terminal 2
**It is under redevelopment and will handle all passenger traffic (international and domestic) when completed.
*'''General Aviation Terminal''' for private and non-scheduled flight operators (NSOPs).
**CSIA's  GA Terminal is located at Kalina on the south-west side of the airfield.

This airport, along with Delhi's [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]], is the primary international gateway to India and served by approximately 50 international airlines. It is the primary hub for [[Jet Airways]] and [[GoAir]] and also serves as a secondary hub for a few other airlines, including [[Air India]], [[IndiGo]], [[JetLite]], [[Kingfisher Airlines]] and [[SpiceJet]]. International traffic peaks late in the night, whilst peak domestic traffic is before 10:00. Nevertheless, at least 45% of traffic flows between 10:00 and 18:30 daily.

In July 2010, the Airport was ranked fourth best in the world for having aerobridges, fancy food courts, spas, and salons.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindustantimes1&quot;&gt;http://epaper.hindustantimes.com/PUBLICATIONS/HT/HM/2010/07/27/Article//004/27_07_2010_004_002.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; This airport, along with airports in [[Delhi]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]], and [[Kolkata, West Bengal|Kolkata]] handles more than 50% of the passengers in India. In the eleven months between April 2006 and February 2007, it handled 180,000 landings and take-offs and over 20 million passengers, with a total of 13.56 million domestic air passengers and 6.73 million international passengers{{Update after|2010|11}}. It registered a 21.28% growth in passenger traffic over the previous year 2005â06, when the figure was 17.6 million passengers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TNN, 17 March 2007, 02.11am IST |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/Mumbai/Airport_records_20_mn_passengers_in_11_months/articleshow/1774055.cms |title=Airport records 20 mn passengers in 11 months |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2007-03-17 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010|11}}. In 2008, for the second year in a row, it was the world's most-delayed airport in terms of arrivals. Only 49.95% of arrivals were on time. About 58% of its late arrivals in 2008 were delayed by 30 minutes or more, although the delay in these arrivals is largely attributed to air congestion at a flight's origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/08/airports-india-europe-biz-logistics-cx_bw_0108airports_slide_2.html?partner=yahooca Forbes.com - The World's Most-Delayed Airports for 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
