'''Laval University''' ([[French language|Fr]]: '''UniversitÃ© Laval''') is the oldest centre of education in [[Canada]] and was the first institution in [[North America]] to offer higher education in [[French language|French]]. Its main campus is located in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], the capital of the province, on the outskirts of the [[Old Quebec|historic city]]. 

The university is ranked among the top ten Canadian universities in terms of research funding.&lt;ref&gt;UniversitÃ© Laval. [http://www.scom.ulaval.ca/Presentation/anglais/background.html &quot;UniversitÃ© Laval at a Glance&quot;]. (accessed 17 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:FranÃ§ois de Laval - Project Gutenberg eText 17174.jpgâ|bum|left|200px|FranÃ§ois de Laval]] The origins of the university are the SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec founded in [[1663]] by [[FranÃ§ois de Laval]], the first bishop of [[New France]]. The SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec was granted a Royal Charter on December 8, 1852, by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], creating UniversitÃ© Laval with 'the rights and privileges of a university'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 Laval University/UniversitÃ© Laval&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ignace Bourget|Bishop Bourget]] of Montreal suggested interesting the SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec in the establishment of UniversitÃ© Laval. The Principal, M. Louis Casault, visited Europe to obtain a Royal charter, and studied the best university systems. The charter was signed in 1852. Pope Benedict XV approved the scheme, and authorized the erection of chairs of theology and the conferring of degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tlctd10.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Grand-SÃ©minaire-QuÃ©bec.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Old SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec today]]

In 1878, the university opened a second campus in [[Montreal]], which later became the [[UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al]] on May 8, 1919, by a writ of Pope Benedict XV. In 1971, a second charter vesting supreme authority in the UniversitÃ© Laval council was proclaimed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

''Laval'' composed by Wilfrid Beaudry was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal. The music for piano was published in QuÃ©bec by J. Beaudry, circa 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Laval http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/c.php?id=16182129&amp;l=eng&amp;s=amicus&lt;/ref&gt;

While the main campus moved out from the SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec since then, the architecture school returned to that heritage building (now affectionately referred to as ''Le Vieux SÃ©minaire'') in 1989.

The governance structure at Laval incorporates the powers of board and senate. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1911, the Medical Faculty of UniversitÃ© Laval set up courses on public hygiene.   

In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.&lt;ref&gt;Behiels, Michael, &quot;Le pÃ¨re Georges-Henri LÃ©vesque et l'Ã©tablissement des sciences sociales Ã  Laval: 1938-1955&quot;, Revue de l'UniversitÃ© d'Ottawa 52, no. 3 (juil.-sept. 1982). Appears in English translation in &quot;Youth, University, and Canadian Society&quot;, edited by Paul Axelrod and John G. Reid. Kingston and Montreal: McGill-Queen's University of Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of Laval University by Royal Charter in 1852 was designated a National Historic Event in 1972 and plaqued in 1975. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=1378&amp;oqeName=Laval+University&amp;oqfName=Universit%E9+Laval National Historic Event&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and features==

[[Maurice Perrault]] designed [[Laval University]] on St. Denis Street, 1893-94. &lt;ref&gt; http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1389 Maurice Perrault &lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Simeon Bergeron (architect) designed several buildings at Laval University including: School of Chemistry, (1923); Ste. Famille Street, major addition, 1931; Mining School (1938) and cafeteria building (1945) &lt;ref&gt; http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1103 Joseph Simeon Bergeron (architect) &lt;/ref&gt;

UniversitÃ© Laval's main campus covers 1.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and has over 30 buildings, all linked by 10&amp;nbsp;km of underground walkways, which are frequently used, particularly in the winter, when temperatures drop below the freezing point. Of the campus lands, 56 per cent are wooded areas, grasslands, and sports fields. The campus is home to the [[List of botanists by author abbreviation|Roger-Van den Hende]] [[botanical garden]] and a plethora of different [[Flora (plants)|flora]] and [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]], including some 67 species of deciduous and coniferous trees and 60 different species of birds.

==Programs==
As of 2002, UniversitÃ© Laval offers over 350 programmes to more than 38,000 students, 20 per cent of whom are studying at the postgraduate level. The university also attracts more than 2,500 foreign students annually, and has close to 1,000 students drawn from Canadian provinces outside of Quebec. Many students also come to the university for the ''FranÃ§ais pour non-francophones'' programme that offers instruction in French as a second language to students from Canada and around the world. It is also the only university in Quebec which trains forestry engineers. From the mid-80s, UniversitÃ© Laval also offers distance learning. As of now over 30 programmes and over 400 courses are offered by distance learning, of which 80% are accessible from the internet.[[Image:Ãcole architecture ULaval.JPGâ|thumb|right|225px|UniversitÃ© Laval School of Architecture]]
