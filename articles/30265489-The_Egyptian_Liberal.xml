The '''2011 Alexandria bombing''' was an attack on [[Copts|Coptic Christians]] in Alexandria, Egypt, on Saturday, 1 January 2011. Twenty three people died as a result of the attack, all of them Coptic Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yom7&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ø£Ø³ÙØ§Ø¡ Ø¶Ø­Ø§ÙØ§ ÙÙØµØ§Ø¨Ù Ø­Ø§Ø¯Ø« Ø§ÙÙØ¬Ø§Ø± Ø§ÙØ¥Ø³ÙÙØ¯Ø±ÙØ©|url=http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=328202|accessdate=2 January 2011|newspaper=El Yom El Sabe|date=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 97 more people were injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Egypt bomb kills 21 at Alexandria Coptic church|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12101748|accessdate=1 January 2011|newspaper=BBC News  |date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the deadliest act of violence against Egypt's Christian minority in a decade, since the [[Kosheh massacre]] in 2000 left 21 Copts dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fatal Bomb Hits a Church in Egypt |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/world/middleeast/02egypt.html?_r=3&amp;hp|accessdate=3 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Modern persecution of Coptic Christians}}
Copts in Egypt complain of increasing persecution, including attacks by Muslim extremists and what they see as official discrimination by the state. Copts celebrate Christmas on 7 January. This was the second consecutive Christmas with violence. On Christmas Eve in 2010, a Muslim gunman fired on worshipers leaving a church in Upper Egypt, killing 7 people and wounding 10 others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahim 2011-01-07&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/nyregion/08coptic.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=Sorrow in Brooklyn for Terror in Egypt|work=The New York Times |last=Fahim|first=Kareem|page=A16|date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months prior to the incident, the religious ambiance in Egypt had been clouded by anti-Church sentiment, in particular regarding the public allegation made by [[Mohammad Salim Al-Awa]] that the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] was storing weapons in churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Awa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/65471152-9030-4350-9448-79714469B785.htm |title=Ø§ÙØ£Ø®Ø¨Ø§Ø± â Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù â ÙØ­Ø§ÙÙÙ ÙØµØ±ÙÙÙ ÙØªØ¶Ø§ÙÙÙÙ ÙØ¹ Ø§ÙØ¹ÙØ§ |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ysaleh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

In November, a group calling itself Al-Qaeda in Iraq announced that all Christians in the Middle East would be &quot;legitimate targets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt; The Alexandria bombing occurred almost two months to the day after the [[2010 Baghdad church attack|attack on Our Lady of Salvation church]] in central Baghdad in what militants called a response to the mistreatment of Muslim converts by Egyptian Copts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ysaleh&quot; /&gt; Al-Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate claimed responsibility for that attack and made new threats against Christians. The group threatened to attack Egyptian Copts if their church did not free two Christians, it said had been &quot;imprisoned in their monasteries&quot; for having converted to Islam. The two women were [[Kamilia Shehata|Camilia Chehata]] and Wafa Constantine, the wives of Coptic priests whose claimed conversion caused a stir in Egypt.&lt;ref name=jazeera&gt;{{Cite news|title=Deadly blast outside Egypt church|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/20111111533958901.html|accessdate=27 Jan 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=1 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks before the bombing an [[Islamism|Islamist]] website called for attacks on a list of Egypt's churches, and included the church that was hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;ysaleh&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title= Suspected suicide bomber kills 17 at Egypt church.|author=Saleh, Yasmine |url= http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110101/wl_nm/us_egypt_church_blast|newspaper=Yahoo News|date= 1 January 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;longwar&quot;&gt;[http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/01/suspected_suicide_bo.php &quot;Suspected suicide bomber kills 21 in attack on Egyptian church&quot;].

An explosive device detonated in front of the Coptic Orthodox church of [[Saint Mark]] and [[Pope Peter of Alexandria|Pope Peter]] in the Sidi Bishr neighbourhood in Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Explosion kills at least 21 at Egyptian church|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/01/01/egypt.attack/index.html?iref=NS1|accessdate=1 January 2011|publisher=CNN|date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;longwar&quot;/&gt; Initial reports stated that it was a car explosion, however an Interior Ministry statement later declared that it was a [[suicide attack]], through the Egyptian official news agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Batty|first=David|title=Egypt bomb kills new year churchgoers|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/01/egypt-bomb-kills-new-year-churchgoers|accessdate=1 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;India News&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.indiavoice.info/news/suicide-bomber-kills-21-in-egypt-2011010120146 |title=Suicide bomber kills 21 in Egypt |publisher=IndiaVoice |date=1 January 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Interior ministry: Suicide bomber behind Egypt church blast|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/01/01/egypt.attack/index.html?hpt=T2|accessdate=1 January 2011|publisher=CNN|date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the blast, several thousand Coptic Christians were attending midnight prayer service at the church at the occasion of the new year.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;longwar&quot;/&gt; The explosion resulted in scattered body parts, destroyed cars and smashed windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ysaleh&quot;/&gt; 21 Coptic Christians were killed immediately following the explosion, or soon after, and about 97 people â most of them Christians â were injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;masrawy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;longwar&quot;/&gt; The remains were covered with newspapers until they were brought inside the church. Two more Copts died in the hospital over the few days following the attack, raising the total number to 23, all of whom were Coptic Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;/&gt;

Forensic testing confirmed that the explosive device used was homemade and contained nails and ball-bearings.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2&quot;/&gt; The Interior Ministry stated that the bomb was filled with small pieces of metal to serve as [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristen Chick&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Egypt's former Interior minister [[Habib Ibrahim El Adly]] said on 23 January that evidence proved that the Gaza-based ''Army of Islam'' planned and executed the attack.

== Reactions ==
=== Coptic community in Egypt ===
Copts were deeply aggrieved by this attack, many believing that the Egyptian state security's failure to deal firmly with past attacks on Christians in Egypt contributed to this attack, while others went as far as to directly blame the State Security for the bombings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clashes Grow&quot;/&gt; One member of the Coptic community declared, &quot;The government is the reason this happened. They are the terrorists who attack us every day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clashes Grow&quot;/&gt;

Following the bombing, several thousand Copts took to the streets in protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; Furious Christians clashed with Egyptian police and Egyptian security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2011/01/01/deadly-church-blast-sparks-christian-rage-in-egypt/ &quot;Deadly church blast sparks Christian rage in Egypt&quot;]. Euronews, 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Christians and Muslims pelted each other with rocks, and cars were torched.&lt;ref name=&quot;ysaleh&quot;/&gt; After these overnight protests, more than 100 Christians protested the following morning near the church that was attacked, chanting &quot;We sacrifice our souls and blood for the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]]&quot; and &quot;O Mubarak, the heart of the [[Copts]] is on fire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ysaleh&quot;/&gt; The Egyptian police reacted by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;/&gt;

In [[Cairo]], about 4,000 Christians and Muslims demonstrated against terrorism in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of [[Shubra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elaph2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ø£Ø±Ø¨Ø¹Ø© Ø¢ÙØ§Ù ÙØµØ±Ù ØªØ¸Ø§ÙØ±ÙØ§ Ø¶Ø¯ Ø§ÙØ¥Ø±ÙØ§Ø¨ ÙÙ&quot; Ø´Ø¨Ø±Ø§&quot;|url=http://www.elaph.com/Web/news/2011/1/622220.html|accessdate=1 January 2011|newspaper=Elaph|date=1 January 2011}} (in Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration lasted for six hours and was joined by both government and opposition members of the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian parliament]] and a number of political figures, including a former minister and [[Tomorrow Party]] leader [[Ayman Nour]]. In the same neighborhood of [[Shubra]], thousands of Coptic Christians clashed with riot police for three consecutive days, resulting in injuries to both Coptic civilians and riot police soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clashes Grow&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Thousands of Copts demonstrated at the Monastery of [[Simon the Tanner|Saint Simon the Tanner]] in [[Cairo]]. The demonstrators called for the resignation of the Egyptian government. They chanted, &quot;With our souls and blood we redeem our [[Christian cross|Cross]]&quot;. They then clashed with the Egyptian security forces, resulting in injuries to 12 of the Coptic demonstrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asia One&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Australian&quot;/&gt;

In addition, thousands of Coptic Christians demonstrated outside the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs and the state television buildings for two consecutive days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asia One&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Australian&quot;/&gt;

[[Pope Shenouda III]] strongly condemned the &quot;criminal assault&quot;, blaming it on &quot;forces that wish no good for Egypt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elaph1&quot;/&gt; The Pope also called upon the government to &quot;speedily arrest and prosecute the perpetrator of this criminal act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elaph1&quot;/&gt; His personal secretary said the incident had &quot;severely grieved us, because it is very alien to the love and harmony in which the nation lives&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashraf Sadiq&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

The top cleric in Alexandria, the [[Vicar|Patriarchal Vicar]] [[Hegumen]] Ruweis Marcos, said that the Egyptian government and security forces wanted to blame the bombing on a suicide bomber instead of a car bomb in order to write off the crime as something carried out by a lone attacker.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; He also denounced the lack of protection in front of the church, stating he was surprised to find only three soldiers and one officer guarding the church at such a sensitive time in spite of the recent numerous threats against Copts.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

The Synod of priests in Alexandria unanimously criticized the lax attitude of the Egyptian authorities towards the public expression of hatred against Coptic Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;ÙØ¯Ø§Ø³ Ø§Ø­Ø¯ Ø­Ø²ÙÙ ÙØºØ§Ø¶Ø¨&quot;/&gt; In a statement issued by the Synod, the priests said that the attack on the church was &quot;the result of anti-Christian mobilization and the lies recently propagated against the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ÙØ¯Ø§Ø³ Ø§Ø­Ø¯ Ø­Ø²ÙÙ ÙØºØ§Ø¶Ø¨&quot;/&gt;

=== Coptic community in the diaspora ===
Memorial services were held in Coptic churches across Europe in memory of the victims of the bombing.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack threats&quot;/&gt;

The [[Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom]] issued an official statement condemning the massacre, and expressing concern that incidents of violence and terror against Christians in Egypt were increasingly spiraling out of control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coptic Orthodox Church in UK&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Official Press Release of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom |url=http://coptsunited.com/Details.php?I=340&amp;A=2801|accessdate=5 January 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement also criticized the fact that crimes against the Copts in Egypt were going unchecked and unresolved, and their perpetrators were not brought to justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coptic Orthodox Church in UK&quot;/&gt;

President Hosni Mubarak promised in a televised address that terrorists would not destabilize Egypt or divide Christians and Muslims.
