It is currently produced by [[Nokia]]'s [[Qt Development Frameworks]] division, which came into being after Nokia's acquisition of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] company [[Trolltech]], the original producer of Qt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qt.nokia.com/about/the-nokia-acquisition Qt Software â Nokia acquired Trolltech]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia announced that it is going to drop  [[Symbian]] technologies and base their future smartphones on [[Microsoft]] platform instead in February 2011. One month later Nokia announced the sale of Qt's commercial licensing and professional services to [[Digia PLC]], although Nokia will remain the main development force behind the framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nokia and Digia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.qt.nokia.com/2011/03/07/nokia-and-digia-working-together/ |title=Nokia and Digia working together to grow the Qt community |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2011-03-08 |first=Sebastian |last=Nystrom}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, it was announced on the Qt Labs website that the groundwork was being laid for the next major version of Qt, with the expectation that Qt 5 would be released in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoughts about Qt 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/09/thoughts-about-qt-5/ |title=Thoughts about Qt 5 |date=2011-05-09 |accessdate=2011-05-09 |first=Lars |last=Knoll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qt uses standard [[C++]] but makes extensive use of a special code generator (called the ''Meta Object Compiler'', or ''moc'') together with several macros to enrich the language. Qt can also be used in several other [[programming language]]s via [[language binding]]s. It runs on the major desktop platforms and some of the mobile platforms. It has extensive [[internationalization]] support. Non-GUI features include [[SQL]] database access, [[XML]] parsing, [[Thread (computer science)|thread]] management, network support, and a unified cross-platform [[application programming interface|API]] for file handling.

Distributed under the terms of the [[GNU]] [[Lesser General Public License]] (among others), Qt is [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]].  All editions support a wide range of compilers, including the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] C++ compiler and the [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] suite.

==Design==
The innovation of Qt when it was first released relied on a few key concepts.

===Modules===

* Modules for general software development
** The '''QtCore''' module contains the core non-GUI classes, including the event loop and Qt's signal and slot mechanism. It also includes platform independent abstractions for [[Unicode]], threads, mapped files, shared memory, [[regular expressions]], and user and application settings.
** The '''QtGui''' module contains the majority of the GUI classes. These include a number of table, tree and list classes based on the [[Modelâviewâcontroller|model-view-controller]] design pattern. Also provided is a sophisticated [[2D computer graphics|2D]] canvas widget capable of storing thousands of items including ordinary widgets.
** The '''QtMultimedia''' module implements low-level multimedia functionality.
** The '''QtNetwork''' module contains classes for writing [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] and [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] clients and servers. It includes classes that implement [[FTP]] and [[HTTP]] clients and support [[Domain Name System|DNS]] lookups. Network events are integrated with the event loop making it very easy to develop networked applications.

===Use of native UI-rendering APIs===
Qt used to emulate the native look of its intended platforms, which occasionally led to slight discrepancies where that emulation was imperfect. Recent versions of Qt use the native style APIs of the different platforms to query the platform for the desired appearance of the Qt controls, and so do not suffer from such issues as much.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt/index.html Products â Qt â A cross-platform application and UI framework] 'Qt uses the native graphics APIs of each platform it supports, taking full advantage of system resources and ensuring that applications have native look and feel.'&lt;/ref&gt;

One should note that on some platforms (such as MeeGo and KDE) Qt ''is'' the native API.

===Metaobject compiler===
The [[metaobject]] compiler, termed ''moc'', is a tool that is run on the sources of a Qt program. It interprets certain macros from the C++ code as annotations, and uses them to generate additional C++ code with &quot;Meta Information&quot; about the classes used in the program. This meta information is used by Qt to provide programming features not available natively in C++: the [[signals and slots|signal/slot system]], [[Type introspection|introspection]] and asynchronous function calls.

===QtScript ECMAScript interpreter===
[[QtScript]] is a cross-platform toolkit that allows developers to make their Qt/C++ applications scriptable using an interpreted scripting language: Qt Script (based on ECMAScript/[[JavaScript]]).

From Qt 4.3.0 onward, the scripting API,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qtscript.html |title=Qt 4.3: QtScript Module |publisher=Doc.trolltech.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on QSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.2.2/ |title=QSA 1.2: Qt Script for Applications |publisher=Doc.trolltech.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is integrated as a core part of Qt and is no longer a separate library.

===Bindings===
As shown in the table below, Qt has a range of [[Language binding|bindings]] for various languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qt.nokia.com/products/programming-language-support |title=QT Language Bindings |publisher=Qt.nokia.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that implement some or all of its feature set.

==History==
[[Haavard Nord]] and [[Eirik Chambe-Eng]] (the original developers of Qt and the CEO and President, respectively, of [[Trolltech]]) began development of &quot;Qt&quot; in 1991, three years before the company was incorporated as Quasar Technologies, then changed the name to Troll Tech and then to Trolltech.

The toolkit was called Qt because the letter [[Q]] looked appealing in Haavard's [[Emacs]] font, and &quot;t&quot; was inspired by [[Intrinsics|Xt]], the X toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safari.oreilly.com/0131872494/pref04|title=A Brief History of Qt|accessdate= 2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two versions of Qt had only two flavors: Qt/X11 for Unix and Qt/Windows for Windows. The Windows platform was only available under a proprietary license, which meant free/open source applications written in Qt for X11 could not be ported to Windows without purchasing the proprietary edition.

At the end of 2001, Trolltech released Qt 3.0, which added support for Mac OS X. The Mac OS X support was available only in the proprietary license until June 2003, when Trolltech released Qt 3.2 with Mac OS X support available under the GPL.

In June 2005, Trolltech released Qt 4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dot.kde.org/2005/06/28/trolltech-releases-qt-40 |title=Trolltech Releases Qt 4.0 &amp;#124; KDE.news |publisher=Dot.kde.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia acquired Trolltech ASA on June 17, 2008 and changed the name first to Qt Software, then to Qt Development Frameworks.
Since then it focused on Qt development to turn it into the main development platform for its devices, including a port to the [[Symbian]] [[S60 (software platform)|S60 platform]]. Version 1.0 of the Nokia Qt SDK was released on June 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Niels Weber |url=http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2010/06/23/nokia-qt-sdk-10-released/ |title=Nokia Qt SDK 1.0 released |publisher=Labs.trolltech.com |date=June 23, 2010 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source code was made available over [[Gitorious]], a community oriented [[Git (software)|git]] source code repository, in order to gather an even broader community that is not only using Qt but also helping to improve it.

===Licensing ===

At all times, Qt was available under a commercial license that allows the development of proprietary applications without restrictions on licensing. In addition, Qt has been gradually made available under a number of increasingly free licenses.

Until version 1.45, source code for Qt was released under the FreeQt license. This was viewed as not compliant with the open source principle by the [[Open Source Initiative]] and the free software definition by [[Free Software Foundation]] because while the source was available, it did not allow the redistribution of modified versions.

Controversy erupted around 1998 when it became clear that [[KDE|KDEâs]] [[KDE Software Compilation]] was going to become one of the leading [[desktop environment]]s for [[Linux]]. As it was based on Qt, many people in the [[free software movement]] worried that an essential piece of one of their major operating systems would be proprietary.

With the release of version 2.0 of the toolkit, the license was changed to the [[Q Public License]] (QPL), a [[free software]] license but one regarded by the [[Free Software Foundation]] as incompatible with the GPL. Compromises were sought between KDE and Trolltech whereby Qt would not be able to fall under a more restrictive license than the QPL, even if Trolltech was bought out or went bankrupt. This led to the creation of the [http://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php KDE Free Qt foundation], which guarantees that Qt would fall under a [[BSD-style license]] should no free/open source version of Qt be released during 12 months.

In 2000, Qt 2.2 was released under the GPL v2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qt.nokia.com/about/news/archive/00000043 |title=Trolltech offers a choice in licensing with the addition of GPL licensing for the upcoming release of Qt |publisher=Qt.nokia.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending all controversy regarding GPL compatibility.

In 2002, members of the [[KDE on Cygwin]] project began porting the GPL licensed Qt/X11 code base to Windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qtwin.sourceforge.net/qt3-win32/history.php Q../Windows Edition history], June 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This was in response to Trolltech's refusal to license Qt/Windows under the GPL on the grounds that Windows was not a free/open source software platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-cygwin&amp;m=104431728920022&amp;w=2 E-mail to the kde-cygwin mailing list] by Chris January, February 4, 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20031005175911/http://www.trolltech.com/developer/faqs/noncomm.html Qt Non-commercial FAQ], October 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The project achieved reasonable success although it never reached production quality.

This was resolved when Trolltech released Qt/Windows 4 under the GPL in June 2005. Qt&amp;nbsp;4 now supports the same set of platforms in the free software/open source editions as in the proprietary edition, so it is now possible to create GPL-licensed free/open source applications using Qt on all supported platforms.  The GPL v3 with special exception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/license-gpl-exceptions.html |title=Nokia Corporation Qt GPL Exception Version 1.3 |publisher=Doc.trolltech.com |date=July 22, 1999 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was later added as an additional licensing option. The GPL exception allows the final application to be licensed under various GPL-incompatible [[free software license|free software]]/[[open source license|open source]] licenses such as the [[Mozilla Public License]].

On January 14, 2009, Qt version 4.5 added another option, the [[LGPL]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qtsoftware.com/about/news/lgpl-license-option-added-to-qt LGPL License Option Added to Qt] January 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which should make Qt even more attractive for non-GPL open source projects and for closed applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.com/files/docs/Qt_LGPL.pdf |title=ICS Whitepaper on the Implications of Qt under LGPL for Commercial and Government users |format=PDF |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
