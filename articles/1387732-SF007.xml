'''KnoppMyth''' is a [[Linux]] distribution designed for use on Home Theater PCs ([[HTPC]]s). As of version R6, it is now called LinHES (Linux Home Entertainment Server). The most recent release (R6) is based on [[Arch Linux]], though previous versions were based on [[Debian]] Linux with configuration scripts from the [[Knoppix]] Linux distribution.  Knoppmyth also contains &quot;Knoppmyth&quot;-specific scripts that install and configure the [[MythTV]] [[Personal Video Recorder|PVR]] software as well as a number of add-ons. Most standard [[HTPC]] hardware is supported, and much of it is even configured automatically, making the often complex installation and configuration of a MythTV-based [[Linux]] Home Theater PC system relatively easy and pain-free. The operating system was developed and is maintained by Cecil Hugh Watson.

==Details==
=== Practical Explanation ===
KnoppMyth is a Linux equivalent of the [[Microsoft]] Media Center Operating System. KnoppMyth comes as a [[CD-ROM]] software distribution which automates the setup of the popular MythTV package as well as several HTPC-related add-ons.

Ultimately, KnoppMyth is used to create an HTPC (Home Theater PC). These HTPCs are commonly plugged into standard- or high-definition televisions rather than monitors for a complete Home Theatre experience. HTPCs bring the power of PCs to the lounge in one single 'all in one' device.

===Ease of installation===
A common complaint about MythTV is that it is difficult and time-consuming to install and configure. KnoppMyth is a general-purpose solution which contains a pre-configured MythTV installation system built on a full Linux platform.  Using a computer with common and well-documented hardware, the manual configuration required will be considerably simpler than the alternative option of manually 'building' (installing) MythTV, in addition to 'building' numerous other programs that MythTV depends on.

===Applications of KnoppMyth===
==== Complete Installation (Front-end and Back-end)====
KnoppMyth can be used to install a full MythTV client and server system; in simple terms this means that the  [[Front-end and back-end|front-end]] is stored on the same device as the backend.  The front-end is the software required for the visual elements (or the [[GUI]]) and is utilised by the common user to find, play and manipulate media files etc.  The back-end is the server where the media files are actually stored.  A full front-end and back-end system may have an advantage in that it has 'portability', i.e. it is a standalone device that is not dependent on a separate server (like a [[video game console]] for example).

====Front-end only installations====

Alternatively, KnoppMyth can be used to install a MythTV client, front-end-only system.  For example, users may have a central storage device (server) in their house, the server can then be accessed from numerous other devices throughout the house, these other devices needing only a front-end installation on devices containing minimal hardware.  KnoppMyth can also run directly from a CD-ROM (i.e. without installation) providing that there is a network connection to a PC with a 'complete installation' (a MythTV back-end server).

Using a 'server' separate from one or more front-end units has the obvious advantages of multiple simultaneous access to shared media files.  The server used would generally have hardware of a relatively high specification and would be kept outside of the main living room. An advantage of keeping the server PC outside the living room is that the cooling fan required to accommodate a 'fast' processor can be quite noisy (as can certain hard drives), it can be expensive to invest in fanless/heat sinking equipment to avoid such noise problems.

KnoppMyth can also be used to upgrade an existing KnoppMyth installation.
