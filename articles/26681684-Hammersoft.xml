'''NightLink''' is the name given to the all-night [[TransLink (South East Queensland)|TransLink]] services that leave [[Fortitude Valley]], [[Brisbane City]] and [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] late Friday and Saturday nights.

==History==
NightLink services started as a six month trial in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper =  [[Northside Chronicle]]  | title =  Late-night trains kick off quietly| first =  | last =  | section =  | page = 4  | date = 7 December 2005 | accessdate = 30 June 2010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper =  [[Westside News]]  | title =  Catching on to new bus links| first =  | last =  | section =  | page = 4  | date = 18 January 2006 | accessdate = 30 June 2010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first weekend, the service was so popular that TransLink had to put on extra buses to meet demand. In its first year of operation, close to 200,000 passenger trips were made on NightLink services.&lt;ref name='NightLink a hit with Brisbane revellers'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Paul|last=Lucas|url=http://statements.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=49799|title=Extra services for New Year's Eve revellers|accessdate=18&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;2007|date=December&amp;nbsp;28&amp;nbsp;2006|work=Ministerial Media Statements|publisher=[[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally rail services ran on all lines in greater Brisbane; those with low patronage were discontinued in August 2006 and replaced with buses.

==Routes==
These services help passengers get home safely after a night out. As they depart the CBD after 21:30, passengers can be dropped off anywhere along the route where it is safe to do so.&lt;ref name='NightLink a hit with Brisbane revellers'&gt;{{Cite web|first=Paul|date=December&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;2005|url=http://statements.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=44000|title=NightLink a hit with Brisbane revellers|last=Lucas|accessdate=24&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2010|work=Ministerial Media Statements|publisher=[[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='TransLink NightLink'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.translink.com.au/nightlink.php|title=TransLink NightLink|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now 23 NightLink bus routes&lt;ref name='TransLink NightLink Buses'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.translink.com.au/nightlink_bus.php|title=TransLink NightLink Buses|accessdate=22&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three NightLink train routes&lt;ref name='TransLink NightLink Trains'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.translink.com.au/nightlink_train.php|title=TransLink NightLink Trains|accessdate=22&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in operation.

===Buses===
NightLink bus routes run every hour from 1am to 5am and are prefixed by the letter &quot;N&quot;. Most NightLink routes mirror the equivalent 'normal' service, although slight variations apply on some routes to maximise coverage.&lt;ref name='TransLink NightLink Buses'/&gt;

===Trains===
NightLink trains run on the Beenleigh, Caboolture and Ipswich lines with a single service around 4am.&lt;ref name='TransLink NightLink Trains'/&gt;

===FlatFare Taxis===
The NightLink brand also includes special &quot;FlatFare&quot; taxi services operating on Friday and Saturday nights. The NightLink FlatFare taxis operate from designated taxi ranks and pick up multiple passengers travelling in the same general direction. The taxis can travel as far as zone 5 of the TransLink system, and passengers are charged based on the number of TransLink zones included in their journey.&lt;ref name='NightLink FlatFare Taxi'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transport.qld.gov.au/Home/Industry/Taxi_and_limousine/Services/Nightlink_flatfare/|title=NightLink FlatFare Taxi|accessdate=22&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
