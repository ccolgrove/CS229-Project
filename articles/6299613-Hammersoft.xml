==Background==
{{Main|Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
Cross-border attacks from [[southern Lebanon]] into Israel by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) date as far back as 1968, and followed Israel's forceful occupation of [[Occupied Territories (Israel)|additional Arab territory]] the previous year; the area became a significant base for attacks following the arrival of the PLO leadership and its [[Fatah]] brigade following their 1971 [[Black September in Jordan|expulsion from Jordan]]. Starting about this time, increasing [[Demographics of Lebanon|demographic tensions]] related to the Lebanese [[National Pact]], which had divided governmental powers among religious groups throughout the country 30 years previously, began running high and led in part to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975â1990). Concurrently, Syria began a [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|29 year military occupation]] in 1976. Israel's [[Operation Litani|1978 invasion of Lebanon]] failed to stem the Palestinian attacks, but [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,CHRON,,LBN,469f38b21e,0.html Chronology for Druze in Lebanon] UNHCR Retrieved 26th May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Israel withdrew to a [[Israeli Security Zone|borderland buffer zone]] in southern Lebanon, held with the aid of proxy militants in the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA).&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta: Arab-Israeli Conflict&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

Ten years later, Israel withdrew from South Lebanon to the UN-designated and internationally recognized [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]] border in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dKkaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sy8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2779,7283268&amp;dq=israel+lebanon&amp;hl=en UN Chief Says Israel Is Completely Out Of Lebanon], Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 17 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The withdrawal also led to the immediate collapse of the SLA, and Hezbollah took control of the area in rapid succession. Later citing continued Israeli control of the disputed [[Shebaa farms]] region and the [[internment]] of [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel]], Hezbollah intensified its cross-border attacks, and used the tactic of seizing soldiers from Israel as leverage for a [[Israeli MIA prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Institute for Palestinian Studies&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Abduction efforts in the year prior to conflict==
In June 2005, an [[Israel Defense Forces]] paratroop unit operating near the [[Shebaa Farms]] engaged three Lebanese it identified as Hezbollah special force members, killing one. Videotapes recovered by the paratroopers contained footage of the three recording detailed accounts of the area. &lt;ref name=&quot;Harel&quot;&gt;Amos Harel, âChronicle of Disaster,â  18 July 2008, www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1003170.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following 12 months, Hezbollah made three unsuccessful attempts to abduct Israeli soldiers. On 21 November 2005, a number of Hezbollah special forces attempted to attack an Israeli outpost in [[Ghajar]], a village straddling the border between Lebanon and the [[Golan Heights]]. The outpost had been deserted following an intelligence warning, and three of the Hezbollah militants were killed when Israeli sniper David Markovich shot a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] they were carrying, causing it to explode. From his sniper position, Markovich shot and killed a fourth gunman shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dudkevitch, Paratrooper Sniper Becomes Hero, Jerusalem Post Online Edition,  22 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezbollah engaged in [[guerrilla]] warfare with IDF ground forces, fighting from well-fortified positions, often in urban areas, and attacking with small, well-armed units. Hezbollah fighters were highly trained, and were equipped with flak jackets, night-vision goggles, communications equipment, and sometimes with Israeli uniforms and equipment. An Israeli soldier who participated in the war said that Hezbollah fighers were &quot;nothing like Hamas or the Palestinians. They are trained and highly qualified. All of us were kind of surprised&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;disciplined&quot;/&gt; During engagements with the IDF, Hezbollah concentrated on inflicting losses on the IDF, believing that an unwillingness to absorb steady losses to be Israel's strategic weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%DD=860 |title=The Jamestown Foundation: single |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hezbollah sustained greater losses than the IDF during ground engagements.

Hezbollah countered IDF armor through the use of sophisticated Russian-made [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGMs). According to Merkava tank program administration, 52 [[Merkava]] [[main battle tank]]s were damaged (45 of them by different kinds of ATGM), missiles penetrated 22 tanks, but only 5 tanks were destroyed, one of them by an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED). The Merkava tanks that were penetrated were predominantly Mark II and Mark III models, but five Mark IV tanks were also penetrated. All but two of these tanks were rebuilt and returned to service. The IDF declared itself satisfied with the Merkava Mark IV's performance during the war. Hezbollah caused additional casualties using ATGMs to collapse buildings onto Israeli troops sheltering inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdw230806&quot; /&gt; As a result, IDF units did not linger in any one area for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;disciplined&quot;/&gt; Hezbollah fighters often used tunnels to emerge quickly, fire an anti-tank missile, and then disappear again.&lt;ref name=&quot;disciplined&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/world/middleeast/07hezbollah.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Steven | last1=Erlanger | first2=RICHARD A. | last2=OPPEL Jr | title=A Disciplined Hezbollah Surprises Israel With Its Training, Tactics and Weapons | date=7 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strikes focused on Hezbollah bases, command centers, rocket launching positions, long-range rocket stockpiles, arms storages, vehicles, and Lebanese military bases, which were often hidden inside civilian areas.  The strikes caused significant casualties among Hezbollah and the Lebanese Army, and destroyed most of Hezbollah's long-range missiles on the ground, along with a portion of its unguided short-range rockets. The Israelis launched several successful commando operations throughout the war, which inflicted significant losses on Hezbollah, and resulted in the capture of military equipment. The IDF's main ground attacks focused on Hezbollah-occupied areas in South Lebanon, and engagements often took place in urban areas. During clashes, Hezbollah losses were greater than those of the Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hirst (journalist)|Hirst, David]]: ''Beware of Small States - Lebanon: Battleground of the Middle East''&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli forces found and destroyed a large portion of Hezbollah's military infrastructure.

Con Coughlin of the Daily Telegraph reported that the difficulty in ascertaining an accurate Hezbollah casualty count was due in large part to deliberate attempts by Hezbollah to conceal the true extent of its losses. Citing a âsenior security officialâ he wrote, âHizbollah(sic) is desperate to conceal its casualties because it wants to give the impression that it is winning its war. People might reach a different conclusion if they knew the true extent of Hizbollahâs (sic) casualties.â In his article, it was claimed that Lebanese security officials disclosed that [[Iran]] was compensating the families of Hezbollah dead, and that Hezbollah's operational council had drawn up casualty lists to be sent to Iran, copies of which were obtained by Lebanese newspapers that did not publish them due to Hezbollah pressure. Lebanese officials also disclosed that many of Hezbollah's wounded were secretly hospitalized in [[Syria]] after being taken through the al-Arissa border crossing with the assistance of Syrian security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Coughlin, Daily Telegraph, 4 Aug 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Bishop of the Telegraph reported that Hezbollahâs âculture of secrecy has disguised the true number of its losses â funerals of âmartyrsâ are being staggered to soften the impact of losses. Some were interred without ceremony for re-burial later.â&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, [[Daily Telegraph]], 22 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Lebanese militias===
The [[Amal movement]], a militia that fought alongside Hezbollah, suffered 17 dead. The [[Lebanese Communist Party]], which chose to fight with Hezbollah, suffered 12 dead. The [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command]], a Palestinian militia that also fought alongside Hezbollah, lost two fighters.&lt;ref name=DailyStarTimeline&gt;Daily Star.

==Cluster munitions==
Both sides used [[cluster bomb]]s during the conflict. Israel fired 4.6&amp;nbsp;million submunitions into dozens of towns and villages in southern Lebanon in 962 separate strikes, the vast majority within the final days of the war. Israel claimed to have warned civilians prior to a strike, and that firing was limited to open areas or military targets inside urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/62428/section/10 |title=Flooding South Lebanon |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=2008-02-16 |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel used advanced cluster munitions produced by [[Israel Military Industries]], and large numbers of older cluster bombs, some produced in the 1970s, purchased from aging [[United States|American]] stockpiles. These were fired by [[multiple rocket launcher]]s, 155mm artillery guns, and dropped by aircraft. As many as 1&amp;nbsp;million submunitions failed to explode on impact, lingering as land mines that killed or maimed almost 200 people since the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/02/17/israel-s-use-cluster-bombs-shows-need-global-ban |title=Israelâs Use of Cluster Bombs Shows Need for Global Ban |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=2008-02-17 |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, munitions were still causing casualties and being cleared by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/12/lebanon-women-clear-cluster-bombs | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rachel | last=Stevenson | title='I feel like I've saved a life': the women clearing Lebanon of cluster bombs | date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological warfare==
During the war, the IAF dropped 17,000 leaflets over Lebanon in 47 missions, and sent more than 700,000 computerized voice messages. Many of them contained caricatures of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah leading Lebanon to ruin and making civilians suffer, showing them as puppets of Iran and Syria, and calling on civilians to help remove Hezbollah. Another leaflet addressing Hezbollah fighters told them that they were lied to by their leaders, that they were &quot;sent like sheep to be butchered, lacking military training and without proper combat gear&quot;, that they could not hope to face &quot;highly trained soldiers that fight to protect their homeland, their people, and their home&quot;, referring to them as &quot;mercenaries&quot; without the support of the Lebanese public, and urging them to run and save their lives. On 26 July, Israel dropped leaflets containing illustrations of nine tombstones with the name of a dead Hezbollah fighter on each one, in response to Nasrallah &quot;deceiving&quot; people on the amount of Hezbollah casualties. Another leaflet urged Hezbollah fighters to stop bleeding and fighting for Nasrallah, who sat safe in a bunker, to stop fighting against Lebanese national interests, and to return to their homes and families. On 11 August, Israel dropped leaflets accusing Hezbollah of hiding its &quot;great losses&quot;, and containing the names of 90-100 Hezbollah fighters killed. Israeli technicians also hacked into [[Al-Manar]] and broadcast clips, criticizing Nasrallah, showing the bodies of Hezbollah fighters, footage from Israeli raids and airstrikes, and captured Hezbollah equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywar.org/israellebanon.php |title=Psychological Operations during the Israel-Lebanon War 2006 |publisher=Psywar.org |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceasefire==
{{See also|Ceasefire attempts during the 2006 Lebanon War}}
Terms for a ceasefire had been drawn and revised several times over the course of the conflict, yet successful agreement between the two sides took several weeks. Hezbollah maintained the desire for an unconditional ceasefire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hezbollah wants an unconditional ceasefire|date=2006-07-17|publisher=CTV.ca|url= http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060716/mideast_template_060717/20060717?hub=CTVNewsAt11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Israel insisted upon a conditional ceasefire, including the return of the two seized soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Israel sends instructions to Lebanon through Italy|date=2006-07-16|publisher=Jerusalem Post|url= http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1164881823793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon frequently pled for the [[United Nations Security Council]] to call for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] confirmed that the US and UK, with support from several Arab leaders, delayed the ceasefire process.

On 11 August 2006 the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved [[UN Security Council Resolution 1701]], in an effort to end the hostilities. It was accepted by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah on 12 August 2006, and by the Israeli government on 13 August 2006. The ceasefire took effect at 8:00&amp;nbsp;AM (5:00&amp;nbsp;AM GMT) on 14 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Lebanon truce holds despite clashes| date=2006-08-14| publisher=CNN| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/14/mideast.main/index.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080613073546/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/14/mideast.main/index.html| archivedate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the ceasefire, the two Hezbollah members of cabinet said that their militia would not disarm south of the [[Litani River]], according to another senior member of the Lebanese cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/12/mideast.main/index.html|title=UN: Cease-fire begins Monday|accessdate=2006-08-13|date=12 August 2006|publisher=CNN| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060819041624/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/12/mideast.main/index.html| archivedate = 19 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a top Hezbollah official similarly denied any intention of disarming in the south.

===Lebanon===
[[File:Hezbollah territory.JPG|thumb|A sign erected after the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war in [[South Lebanon]] which displays rockets and Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]]]]

At the outbreak of hostilities, Prime Minister [[Fuad Saniora]] promised to rein in Hezbollah in an effort to stop Israelâs offensive. Saniora said that there could be no sovereign state of Lebanon without the groupâs disarming. The former President of Lebanon [[Amin Gemayel]], a longtime critic of Hezbollah said, &quot;Hezbollah took a unilateral action, but its repercussions will affect the entire country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,203825,00.html Fighting with Israel deepens Lebanese divisions over Hezbollah], Associated Press, 15, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
The war deepened the longtime divide in Lebanon over Hezbollah's role. Many admired the organization for being the sole group to fight against Israel. Others considered it to be a dangerous militia that executes Iran and Syria policies in Lebanon. The divide over Hezbollah followed mostly sectarian lines, with [[Shias]] largely supporting the group and [[Sunnis]], Christians and [[Druze|Druse]] mostly opposing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;/&gt;

A poll in July 2006 showed that 80 per cent of Lebanese Christians, 80 per cent of Druze and 89 per cent of Sunnis supported Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article694265.ece | work=The Times of London | title=To Arabs, he's the new Nasser, but to the West he has become the new Bin Laden | first=Giles | last=Whittel | date=2006-07-29 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2006, Nasrallah stated, &quot;Had we known that the capture of the soldiers would have led to [the war], we would definitely not have done it.&quot; This was the day before [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]]'s visit to Lebanon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasrallah apologizes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

On 22 September 2006, some eight hundred thousand Hezbollah supporters gathered in Beirut for a rally at which Nasrallah stated that Hezbollah had achieved a &quot;divine and strategic victory.&quot;&lt;ref name=CNN_800&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/22/lebanon.rally |title=Hezbollah leader: Militants 'won't surrender arms' |publisher=CNN|date=22 September 2006|accessdate=2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/766373.html|title=Lebanese Christian leader: War was disaster, Hezbollah must disarm|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=24 September 2006|accessdate=2008-07-13}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-21T223752Z_01_L2115474_RTRUKOC_0_US-MIDEAST-LEBANON.xml&amp;archived=False| title=Hizbollah backers gather for Lebanon &quot;victory&quot; rally| date=21 September 2006|first= Laila| last= Bassam| publisher=Reuters}}{{dead link|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours of Israeli's bombing of Lebanon on 13 July 2006, hundreds of protesters gathered in [[Tel Aviv]] to oppose the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Beinin | first = Joel | title = The 2006 Lebanon War and the Israeli Peace Forces | publisher=New Insight | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://www.wilberforce.edu/cdsp/cdsp_art1_1.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gpG1IXEj|archivedate=2009-05-16|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July, about 2,000 people, including many Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, demanded an end to the offensive during a protest march in Tel Aviv's [[Rabin Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Somfalvi | first = Attila | title = Tel Aviv: Thousands rally against war | publisher=[[Ynetnews]] | date = 22 July 2006 | url = http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3279792,00.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gpG1h2rB|archivedate=2009-05-16|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August, some Israelis demonstrated in Tel Aviv, including former [[Knesset]] members of the [[Meretz]] party, [[Mossi Raz]], [[Naomi Hazan]] and [[Yael Dayan]].

Olmert admitted to the [[Knesset]] that there were mistakes in the war in Lebanon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Olmert: Mistakes made in Lebanon war |publisher=United Press International |date=14 August 2006 | url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060814-032625-7313r }}&lt;/ref&gt; though he framed UN Security Council resolution 1701 as an accomplishment for Israel that would bring home the captured soldiers, and said that the operations had altered the regional strategic balance vis-Ã -vis Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/PMSpeaks/speechknes140806.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070210035841/http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/PMSpeaks/speechknes140806.htm|archivedate=2007-02-10|title=PM Olmertâs Speech at the Knesset Regarding the War in the North|publisher=Office of the [[Prime Minister of Israel]]|date=14 August 2006|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Israeli Chief of Staff]] [[Dan Halutz]] admitted to failings in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Israel army chief admits failures |date=24 August 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5282548.stm |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August, Israeli government and defense officials called for Halutz' resignation following a [[Dan Halutz#Investment portfolio scandal|stock scandal]] in which he admitted selling stocks hours before the start of the Israeli offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Stocks scandal spells doom of embattled Israeli army chief |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=16 August 2006 | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060816/wl_mideast_afp/mideastconflictisrael_060816134450 }}{{dead link|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halutz subsequently resigned on 17 January 2007.

On 21 August, a group of demobilized Israel reserve soldiers and parents of soldiers killed in the fighting started [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest|a movement]] calling for the resignation of Olmert and the establishment of a state commission of [[Public inquiry|inquiry]]. They set up a [[protest tent]] opposite the Knesset and grew to over 2,000 supporters by 25 August,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoman&quot;&gt;[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&amp;ar=yoman &quot;Yoman&quot;], ''Israel Broadcasting Authority'', 25 August 2006 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the influential [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel|Movement for Quality Government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3295083,00.html &quot;Hundreds support protesting reservists&quot;], ''[[Ynetnews]]'', 24 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August, Olmert [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest#Prospects for a state commission|announced]] that there would be no independent state or governmental commission of inquiry, but two internal inspection probes, one to investigate the political echelon and one to examine the IDF, and likely a third commission to examine the [[Home Front]], to be announced at a later date. These would have a more limited mandate and less authority than a single inquiry commission headed by a retired judge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/755787.html &quot;Olmert: An inquiry commission will not be formed, we do not have the luxury to submerge in investigating the past&quot;], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 28 August 2006 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political and military committees were to be headed by former director of [[Mossad]] [[Nahum Admoni]] and former Chief of Staff [[Amnon Lipkin-Shahak]], respectively. Critics argued that these committees amount to a [[whitewash]], due to their limited authority, limited investigatory scope, their self-appointed basis, and that neither would be headed by a retired judge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&amp;ar=mabat &quot;Mabat&quot;], ''[[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]'', 28 August 2006 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to these pressures, on 11 October, Admoni was replaced by retired justice [[Eliyahu Winograd]] as chair of the political probe, and the probe itself was elevated to the status of governmental commission with near-state commission mandate: the [[Winograd Commission]]. On 12 September, former defense minister [[Moshe Arens]] spoke of ''&quot;the defeat of Israel&quot;'' in calling for a state committee of inquiry. He said that Israel had lost ''&quot;to a very small group of people, 5000 Hezbollah fighters, which should have been no match at all for the IDF&quot;'', and stated that the conflict could have ''&quot;some very fateful consequences for the future.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/commentary/newsblogs/jerusalemdateline/060908.aspx CBN.com]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosing his intent to shortly resign, [[Ilan Harari]], the IDF's chief education officer, stated at a conference of senior IDF officers that Israel lost the war, becoming the first senior active duty officer to publicly state such an opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Halutz disputes officer's remarks that Israel lost war|date=2006-09-22|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/766154.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IDF Major General [[Yiftah Ron-Tal|Yiftah Ron Tal]], on 4 October 2006 became the second and highest ranking serving officer to express his opinion that the IDF failed ''&quot;to win the day in the battle against Hezbollah&quot;'' as well as calling for Lt.

However, Eyal Zisser, director of the [[Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies]] at Tel Aviv University, took a contrary position and expressed the view that the war was in fact a strategic success for Israel and a Hezbollah defeat. He noted that Hezbollah had &quot;lost about a third of its elite fighting force&quot; and that &quot;despite mistakes made by the IDF in conducting the military campaign, Israeli soldiers triumphed in every face-to-face battle with Hezbollah.&quot; He concluded that &quot;as time passes, the severity of the blow suffered by Lebanon and its people from the 2006 war becomes clear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zisser, [http://www.meforum.org/2054/nasrallahs-defeat-in-the-2006-war Nasrallahâs Defeat in the 2006 War: Assessing Hezbollahâs Influence],  23 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Zisser's view was shared by Dutch-Israeli military historian and author [[Martin van Creveld]] who argued that Hezbollah âhad the fight knocked out of it,â lost hundreds of its members and that the organization was âthrown out of South Lebanon,â replaced by âa fairy robust United Nations peacekeeping force.â He also stressed that as a result of the war, Israel is experiencing a level of calm on the Lebanon border not seen in over four decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/12579/ |title=Israelâs War With Hezbollah Was Not A Failure |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Ehud Barak]], the replacement defense minister for Peretz, stated that the conflict failed to disarm Hezbollah, and that the group is increasingly entrenched in South Lebanon, further stating that &quot;Hezbollah is stronger than ever and has more rockets than at the outbreak of the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gZEvvDWHJCrybf38T2Ylf0aplRXw |title=Israel's Barak says Hezbollah stronger than ever: report |work=AFP |date= 7 January 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he later noted that &quot;[Israeli] deterrence still exists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3810160,00.html |title=Barak warns Lebanese government |publisher=Ynetnews.com |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF's Northern Command cited this deterrence as one reason Hezbollah did not fire any rockets into Israel during [[Operation Cast Lead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Yaakov |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1253198148634&amp;pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull |title=Analysis: Teheran is restraining an already wary Hizbullah |publisher=Fr.jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli military historian [[Martin van Creveld]] stated that the war was a strategic Israeli victory and a setback for Hezbollah, and criticized the [[Winograd Commission]] for its failure to mention the many successes achieved by Israel's military campaign. He noted that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters were killed in the war, and that the organization had &quot;the fight knocked out of it&quot;, since following the war, Israel experienced a level of calm on its Lebanon border not seen since the mid-1960s. He also noted that Hezbollah was &quot;thrown out of South Lebanon&quot;, and was replaced by &quot;a fairly robust United Nations peacekeeping force&quot; to prevent its return. He also said that there were a number of Israeli failures in the war, including the failure to terminate hostilities earlier and with fewer casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/12579/ |title=Forward.com |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDF Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror highlighted the number of Hezbollah militants killed, the quick military response to Hezbollah's long-range rocket attacks, the post-war replacement of Hezbollah by the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, and Iran's loss of Hezbollah as a deterrent against an Israeli first strike following the war.&lt;ref&gt;Amridor, Misreading the Second Lebanon War,  16 January 2007, www.JCPA.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Friedman]] concurred, stating that the war was a &quot;huge strategic loss for Hezbollah&quot;, and contrasted the billions in damage suffered by Hezbollah and Lebanon with the &quot;relatively minor damage&quot; suffered by Israel, which enjoyed an economic &quot;growth spurt&quot; immediately following the war.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, The Arab Commission, New York Times, 5/9/07&lt;/ref&gt;

====Winograd Commission Report====
{{Main|Winograd Commission}}
According to the Winograd Commission Report, the Second Lebanon War was regarded as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; and that &quot;Israel initiated a long war, which ended without a defined military victory&quot;. The report continued to state that &quot;a semi-military organization of a few thousand men resisted, for a few weeks, the strongest army in the Middle East, which enjoyed full [[air superiority]] and size and technology advantages&quot;. Furthermore, [[Hezbollah]]'s rocket attacks continued throughout the war and the IDF did not provide an effective response to it. Following a long period of using standoff fire power and limited ground activities, the IDF launched a large scale ground offensive close to the UN Security Council's resolution which imposed a cease-fire. &quot;This offensive did not result in military gains and was not completed&quot;.

Later in the Report, the Commission stated that &quot;[a] decision [was] made in the night of 12 July to react (to the capturing) with immediate and substantive military action and to set... ambitious goals.&quot; This decision had immediate repercussions in that subsequent decisions were limited mainly to a choice between a) &quot;a short, painful and unexpected blow on Hezbollah&quot; and b) &quot;to bring about a significant change of the reality in the South of Lebanon with a large ground operation,[occupying]...the South of Lebanon and 'cleaning' it of Hezbollah&quot;. &quot;The fact Israel went to war before it decided which option to select and without an exit strategy, all these constituted serious failures of the decision making process.&quot;

As for achievements, the Commission reported that &quot;SC resolution 1701, and the fact that it was adopted unanimously, were an achievement for Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/world/middleeast/31winograd-web.html | title=English Summary of the Winograd Commission Report | date=30 January 2008 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine concluded that by surviving this asymmetrical military conflict with Israel, Hezbollah effectively emerged with a military and political victory from this conflict. They cite the facts that Hezbollah was able to sustain defenses on Lebanese soil and inflict unmitigated rocket attacks on Israeli civilians in the face of a punishing air and land campaign by the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hizbullah's shallow victory|work=The Economist |date=19 August 2006|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=E1_SSJGSJD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt M. Matthews, a military historian at the Combat Studies Institute of the U.S. Army [[Command and General Staff College]] praised Hezbollah [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and reflected on what he described as &quot;the lackluster performance of the IDF.&quot; He attributed this to several factors including (Lieutenant-General and Chief of the IDF General Staff) Halutzâs steadfast confidence in air power coupled with continuing [[counterinsurgency|COIN]] operations against the Palestinians at the expense of training for major combat operations.&lt;ref name=csi&gt;{{Cite journal

The US [[Congressional Research Service]] found that although Hezbollahâs military capabilities may have been substantially reduced, its long-term potential as a guerrilla movement appeared to remain intact: &quot;Observers note that Hezbollahâs leaders have been able to claim a level of 'victory' simply by virtue of not having decisively 'lost'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service, 2006 [http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33566.pdf Lebanon: The Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah Conflict]&lt;/ref&gt;

British military historian [[John Keegan]] stated that the outcome of the war was &quot;misreported as an Israeli defeat&quot; due to anti-Israel bias in the international media. He concluded that Hezbollah had suffered heavy losses, and that a cease-fire came into effect before Israel could completely dislodge Hezbollah from its positions. He also stated that the casualties sustained by Israel during the war had alarmed the Israeli Government and High Command because Israel's small population is acutely vulnerable to losses in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[Charles Krauthammer]], a syndicated columnist and political commentator, citing an interview by which Nasrallah admitted that he would not have captured the soldiers had he known that it would lead to war, wrote, &quot;Nasrallah's admission, vastly underplayed in the West, makes clear what Lebanese already knew. Hezbollah may have won the propaganda war, but on the ground it lost. Badly.&quot; He noted that Hezbollah's entrenched infrastructure along Israel's border was shattered and would not be easily rebuilt due to the presence of the Lebanese Army and a robust UNIFIL force, hundreds of Hezbollah's best fighters were killed in the war, and that many Lebanese were angry with Hezbollah for provoking a war which largely devastated the country.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthammer, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083101444.html Hezbollah's 'Victory'], 9/1/06&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Young, opinion page editor at the Lebanese ''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]'' newspaper, stated that Hezbollah turned &quot;the stench of defeat into the smell of victory,&quot; through clever use of its propaganda machine. He suggested that Hezbollah had &quot;hoodwinked&quot; pundits who believed that Hezbollah was victorious, and opined that &quot;one dreads to imagine what Hezbollah would recognize as a military loss.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Young, [http://reason.com/archives/2006/08/24/hoodwinked-by-hezbollah Hoodwinked by Hezbollah]&lt;/ref&gt;

American military strategist and historian [[Edward Luttwak]] drew comparisons with the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where what initially looked like an Israeli setback later turned out to be an IDF victory and an Arab defeat. He stated that although some IDF tanks were penetrated by missiles, they also largely limited IDF casualties, and that Hezbollah had failed to inflict massive losses on the IDF and to kill large numbers of Israelis in rocket attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Lutttwak, [http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5573,news-comment,news-politics,again-israeli-gloom-is-misplaced Again, Israeli gloom is misplaced]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] professor and Peterhouse Fellow [[Brendan Simms]] summed up the war this way; &quot;Hezbollah have suffered a setback (but are too clever to admit it) and the Israelis have scored a long-term success (but are too narrow-minded to realize it).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Hezbollah have suffered a setback, [[Social Affairs Unit]],  24 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Michael Totten]] wrote that &quot;Hezbollah lost and Hezbollah knows it.&quot; He questioned why Hezbollah did not attack Israel when the IDF attacked Hamas in [[Gaza]] in 2008, and noted that most of Nasrallahâs supporters &quot;want Hezbollah to deter Israeli invasions, not to invite Israeli invasions&quot;. Totten concluded that Nasrallah's boasts &quot;play well in much of the Arab world&quot;, but that the 2006 &quot;victory&quot; seemed &quot;empty at home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Totten, Michael, [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2009/01/30/who-really-won-the-second-lebanon-war/ Who Really Won the Second Lebanon War], 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Young Turks (talk show)|The Young Turks]], an American talk show, reviewed the war as an Israeli military victory, and a Hezbollah propaganda victory. [[Cenk Uygur]] pointed out that Israel had managed to drive back Hezbollah and create an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} buffer zone in South Lebanon, while Hezbollah managed to win the propaganda war because it was able to keep fighting on the ground and continue firing rockets into Israel until the war's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWC1F9Qdc_8 |title=2 Different Wars - Israel and Hezbollah both declared victory |publisher=Youtube |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial repercussions===
The fighting resulted in a huge financial setback for Lebanon, with an official estimate of a fall in growth from +6% to 2% and US$5&amp;nbsp;Billion (22% of [[GDP]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.undp.org.lb/about/AboutLebanon.cfm|title=UNDP in Lebanon|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=January 2007|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in direct and indirect costs, while the cost for Israel was estimated at US$3.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L08225712.htm|title=Factbox - Costs of war and recovery in Lebanon and Israel|publisher=Reuters|date=9 July 2007|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect costs to Israel include a cut in growth by 0.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/1188773011.html?dids=1188773011:1188773011&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+1%2C+2007&amp;author=SHARON+WROBEL&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=15&amp;desc=2006+GDP+growth+tops+forecasts |title=2006 GDP growth tops forecasts|author=Sharon Wrobel|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cost to [[tourism]] was estimated at 0.4% of Israel's GDP in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/aug/15/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon|title=Lebanon war cost Israel $1.6bn|author=Julian Borger|work=The Guardian | location=London |date=15 August 2006|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one analyst in the [[Associated Press]], the main casualty was the fragile unity between Lebanon's sectarian and political groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/Navariednews.asp?dismode=article&amp;artid=2015876870|title=Lebanon's fragile unity shatters|publisher=[[Kuwait Times]]|date=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; though an ''[[Asia Times Online|Asia Times]]'' piece points to [[Free Patriotic Movement]] head [[Michel Aoun]]'s support for Hezbollah and provision of housing for Shi'a refugees as evidence for strengthened relations.

==Media controversy==
{{Main|2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies}}
{{See also|Adnan Hajj photographs controversy}}

A 2007 report entitled &quot;War to the Last Moment&quot;: The Israeli Media in the Second Lebanon War by the Israeli media monitoring NGO [http://www.keshev.org.il/siteEn/default.asp Keshev] (trans. &quot;Awareness&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;keshev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Keshev - Keshev Publications |url=http://www.keshev.org.il/siteEn/FullNews.asp?NewsID=125&amp;CategoryID=9)|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ioW9ivp9|archivedate=2009-08-05|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the Israeli media &quot;except for a few exceptional instances...covered the war in an almost entirely mobilized manner&quot; serving more to support the goals of the Israeli government and IDF than to objectively report the news. &quot;The media created a general atmosphere of complete and absolute support and justification of the war, and systematically suppressed questions that arose as early as the first day of fighting... The criticism gradually increased toward the end of the war-as it became clearer that the IDF was not managing to win. But the general spirit of the war coverage, in the broad strategic sense, as utterly uncritical.&quot; Keshev's report documents a post-war memo from the Deputy CEO of Marketing for the Hebrew newspaper [[Maariv]] to Maariv employees which states, in part, that {{cquote| Even when we had problematic material related to the management of the war...we restrained ourselves. In a certain sense, we betrayed our role as journalists, but we did so because we took national, patriotic considerations into account and decided that in the event of war, and certainly a war which was not progressing as it should and was going awry, we were part of the Country; that it was permissible, and even required of us, to postpone disputes and criticism; and that we did not have to apologize, or to feel abashed, for our support and backing of the Army and the Government.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;keshev 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keshev.org.il/FileUpload/KESHEV-ENGLISH-ABSTRACT-LEBANON-WAR.pdf |title=&quot;WAR TO THE LAST MOMENT&quot; - The Israeli Media in the Second Lebanon War|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the war, according to the report, &quot;significant coverage of the decision-making process was almost entirely absent in Israel's media&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;keshev 2&quot; /&gt;
The media also marginalized reports on Israelis living in the North who did not receive proper governmental support and harped on the
question of the loyalties of Arab-Israelis in the North instead of focusing on inadequate provision of services by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;keshev 2&quot;/&gt;

While the Israeli media reported on Lebanese suffering, it divorced this suffering from the IDF operations which caused it.&lt;ref name=&quot;keshev 2&quot;/&gt; With regard to diplomacy, the media buried the stories on negotiations to reflect the derision held by decision-makers toward a diplomatic solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;keshev 2&quot;/&gt;

Several media commentators and journalists have alleged an intentionally distorted coverage of the events, in favour of Hezbollah, by means of [[photo manipulation]], staging by Hezbollah or by journalists, and false or misleading captioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjVlMmRjNDllNzhkZmE1OWM3NmE1OGQ4OGQxMDA1YjQ= |title=Media Missiles: Working for the enemy|author=Tom Gross|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=2 August 2006|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2006 Hezbollah Press Officer Hussein Nabulsi took CNN's [[Nic Robertson]] on an exclusive tour of southern Beirut. Robertson noted that despite his minder's anxiety about explosions in the area, it was clear that Hezbollah had sophisticated media relations and were in control of the situation. Hezbollah designated the places that they went to, and the journalists &quot;certainly didn't have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath.&quot; According to his reports, there was no doubt that the bombs were hitting Hezbollah facilities, and while there appeared to be &quot;a lot of civilian damage, a lot of civilian properties,&quot; he reiterated that he couldn't verify the civilian nature of the destroyed buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;reliable&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=CNN Reliable Sources, Coverage of Mideast Conflict|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/23/rs.01.html |publisher=CNN|date=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN]]'s Charlie Moore described a Hezbollah press tour of a bombed-out area in southern Beirut on 23 July 2006 as a &quot;dog-and-pony show&quot; due to perceived staging, misrepresentation of the nature of the destroyed areas, and strict directives about when and with whom interviews could take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Our very strange day with Hezbollah|url= http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/archives/2006_07_23_ac360_archive.html |publisher=CNN|date=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same interview aired on 23 July 2006, CNN's [[John Roberts (television reporter)|John Roberts]], who was reporting from an Israeli artillery battery on the Lebanese border, stated that he had to take everything he was told&amp;nbsp;â either by the IDF or Hezbollah&amp;nbsp;â &quot;with a grain of salt,&quot; citing mutual recriminations of civilian targeting which he was unable to verify independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;reliable&quot;/&gt;

[[Reuters]] withdrew over 900 photographs by [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy|Adnan Hajj]], a Lebanese freelance photographer, after he admitted to digitally adding and darkening smoke spirals in photographs of an attack on Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalphotopro.com/dppthisweek/2006/08/08/reuters-withdraws-all-photos-by-lebanese-freelance |title=Reuters withdraws all photos by Lebanese freelance|publisher=Reuters via Digital Photo Pro|date=7 August 2006|accessdate=2007-04-30}}{{dead link|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October, an Israeli fighter penetrated the {{convert|2|nmi|km|0|sing=on}} defence perimeter of the French frigate ''[[Courbet (F 712)|Courbet]]'' without answering radio calls, triggering a diplomatic incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/20061110.FIG000000186_l_armee_francaise_au_liban_se_sent_menacee_par_israel.html L'armÃ©e franÃ§aise au Liban se sent menacÃ©e par IsraÃ«l], ''[[Le Figaro]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October, six [[Israeli Air Force|Israeli]] [[F-16]]s flew over a [[German Navy]] vessel patrolling off Israel's coast just south of the Lebanese border. The German Defence Ministry said that the planes had given off infrared decoys and one of the aircraft had fired two shots into the air, which had not been specifically aimed. The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said &quot;as of now&quot; it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it. Israeli Defence Minister [[Amir Peretz]] telephoned his German counterpart [[Franz Josef Jung]] to clarify that 'Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions' against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of [[UNIFIL]] to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah. Germany confirmed the consultations, and that both sides were interested in maintaining good cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teluguportal.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=18958|title=Germany, Israel confirm naval vessel-planes incident|date=October 2006|publisher=Telugu Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/article_1214671.php/Germany_Israel_confirm_naval_vessel-planes_incident|title=Germany, Israel confirm naval vessel-planes incident|date=October 2006|publisher=Middle East News}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/b8de8e630faf3631/id/ba4623e8cf1e387d/|title=Israel denies firing shots at German ship|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2006, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council president maintaining &quot;there were no serious incidents or confrontations&quot; since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel &quot;almost on a daily basis,&quot; which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht_vio_challenge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/02/news/UN_GEN_UN_Lebanon_Peacekeepers.php |title=Annan: Israel's actions compromise efforts to stabilize the Israeli-Lebanon border |work=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a UNIFIL demining team was challenged by two Hezbollah members in combat uniforms armed with [[AK-47|AK-47 rifles]]; UNIFIL notified the Lebanese army, who arrested three suspects the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht_vio_challenge&quot;/&gt; There were also &quot;13 instances where UNIFIL came across unauthorized arms or related material in its area of operation&quot;, including the discovery of 17 katyusha rockets and several improvised explosive devices in [[Rachaiya El-Foukhar]], and the discovery of a weapons cache containing seven missiles, three rocket launchers, and a substantial amount of ammunition in the area of [[Bourhoz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iht_vio_challenge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ynet_annan_report&quot;&gt;Ynet News (2 December 2006).

After the war, the Lebanese Army deployed 15,000 soldiers, backed by a UNIFIL force of 12,000, deployed South of the [[Litani River]] to replace Hezbollah, although the Lebanese government said that it cannot and will not disarm Hezbollah by force. On 7 February 2010, the Lebanese Army fired at an Israeli bulldozer on the border, and Israeli forces returned fire. There were no reported casualties. Lebanon claimed that the bulldozer had crossed the border and entered Lebanese territory. In June 2007, Lebanese troops fired at an Israeli UAV over [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] with small arms, causing no damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Porat |first=Elisha |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=52232 |title=Lebanese army fires at Israeli UAV |work=Jerusalem Post |location=Israel |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2007, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]]'s [[Fourth report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701|fourth report on the implementation of SC Resolution 1701]] fingered Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah for violating the ceasefire, but called the firing of rockets into Israel by unknown elements &quot;the most serious breach of the cessation of hostilities since the end of the war.&quot; The report commended Israel on its restraint following this attack, and commended Lebanon for its continued efforts to disarm armed groups. It further stated that in spite of &quot;flexibility by Israel beyond the framework of UNSC-Resolution 1701, implementation of the resolution's humanitarian aspects has not yet been possible.&quot;&lt;ref name = forthReportOfTheSecretaryGeneral&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=83440 Report of the secretary general on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701], ''The Daily Star''. 30 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2009, an explosion in Khirbat Silim, a Lebanese village near the Lebanon-Israel border, killed eight Hezbollah militants. Israel and the United Nations stated that the explosion was a hidden Hezbollah weapons cache, and condemned Hezbollah for violating Resolution 1701.

On 4 November 2009 [[Israeli navy]] [[commando]]s of [[Shayetet 13]] boarded the ship {{MV|Francop}} in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and seized 500 tons of Iranian armaments disguised as civilian cargo.

In 4 August 2010, [[2010 IsraelâLebanon border clash|a clash on the border]] occurred when the Israel military tried to remove a tree from between the border and the border fence on Israeli territory. According to the Israeli's, the tree was blocking the view of one of their video cameras at the border. The Lebanese army fired at the Israeli forces and there was a clash for a few hours. In the ensuing clash, one Israeli soldier died as well as two Lebanese soldiers and one Lebanese journalist. There were also a number of injured military soldiers and civilians on both sides including Lebanese journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julie Stahl |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2010/August/Netanyahu-Lebanon-Ambush-a-Violent-Provocation |title=Netanyahu: Lebanon Ambush a 'Violent Provocation' |publisher=CBN News |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
