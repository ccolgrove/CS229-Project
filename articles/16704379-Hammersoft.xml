[[St Kilda Football Club]] competed in the 2008 [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) season, the 150th anniversary year of the first official game of the sport now known as [[Australian rules football]].

==NAB Cup competition==
The season began well with the club winning the preseason competition, the [[2008 NAB Cup]].

The club had wins over Richmond in the round of 16, Geelong in the quarter-finals, Essendon in the semi-finals and won the final against the [[Adelaide Crows]] by five points at Football Park (AAMI stadium) 2-7-9-(69) to 0-9-10-(64) - St Kilda's third preseason cup win in the AFL.  Jason Gram won the Michael Tuck medal for the player judged best on ground during the final.

==Home and away rounds==
[[Image:Aflgame.jpg|thumb|300px|right|St Kilda defeated Essendon (Round 22) 31/8/08 - (Click to expand)]] 
Despite the promising start, the Saints went on to have a mixed first half of the season with a five-win, six-loss record.  After this their fortunes vastly improved and they gained a place in the finals series.

This mixed season drew both criticism and praise at differing times towards Lyon from supporters and the media.  His game plan has been described as one championing accountability, similar to the [[Sydney Swans]] model by [[Paul Roos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,,23892430-11088,00.html All one way for Saint Nick Dal Santo]&lt;/ref&gt; Lyon's surprise move to drop midfielder [[Nick Dal Santo]] (as well as [[Stephen Milne]] from the side was due to them not meeting these &quot;benchmarks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/rise-and-fall-of-saint-nick/2008/06/19/1213770827314.html Rise and Fall of Saint Nick]&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, it was a turning point in the Saints' season, as they went on to win the next four games following this bold move.

In a very competitive [[2008 AFL season|2008 premiership season]] St Kilda Football Club qualified for the 2008 premiership season finals series, finishing the home and away rounds in the top four, in fourth position, with 13 wins.
