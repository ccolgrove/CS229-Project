}}
The '''Wales national under-21 football team''', also known as the Wales U21s, is the national under-21 [[association football|football]] team of [[Wales]] and is controlled by the [[Football Association of Wales]]. The team competes in the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], held every two years. To date Wales haven't yet qualified for the championship but in recent years have shown good form, losing in a playoff (5â4) to England in the 2009 qualifying campaign and finishing second in there group two years later, after leading their group until their last game Wales only needed a draw to qualify for the play-offs but lost 1â0 away to [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy]].

The U-21 team came into existence following the realignment of [[UEFA]]'s youth competitions in 1976. A goalless draw in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[England national under-21 football team|England]] at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers']] [[Molineux Stadium]] was Wales U21s' first result.

The national under-21 team is the highest level of youth football in Wales, and is open to any players who were born in Wales or whose parents or grandparents were born in Wales. This team is for Welsh players aged 21 or under at the start of a two-year [[European Under-21 Football Championship]] campaign, so players can be, and often are, up to 23 years old.  Also in existence are teams for Under-20s (for non-UEFA tournaments), Under-19s and Under 17s.  As long as they are eligible, players can play at any level, making it possible to play for the U21s, senior side and again for the U21s.

==Recent history==
The current manager is [[Brian Flynn]], who previously managed two Welsh club sides playing in the English leagues: [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]. He also had previously coached the Under-21 team for a while in the early nineties.

In recent decades, the team has been viewed by the Welsh national management as more of a hole to be filled than a team to be used to nurture young international players, many of the great Welsh players of recent years having not spent long in the under-21 team. [[Ryan Giggs]] only made one appearance for the under-21 team before making his senior debut against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] the next day.

More recently however, [[Wales national football team|Wales]]'s former manager, [[John Toshack]] and youth manager Brian Flynn have been seen to use the U21 team for the purpose of creating a pool of youthful Welsh talent. The team can now boast a much better tracking system of young Welsh players, and has seen a marked improvement in players and team results. Recent results have seen them achieve big wins against [[Estonia national under-21 football team|Estonia]] (5â1), [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|Northern Ireland]] (4â0) and [[France national under-21 football team|France]] (4â2).

Some of the young players who subsequently have made the step from the U21's to regular selection for the senior squad are [[Lewin Nyatanga]], [[Joe Ledley]], [[Chris Gunter]], [[Gareth Bale]], [[Sam Vokes]], [[Ched Evans]], [[Simon Church]], [[Wayne Hennessey]], [[David Cotterill]], [[Neal Eardley]], [[Andrew Crofts (footballer)|Andrew Crofts]], [[David Edwards (footballer)|David Edwards]], [[Jack Collison]], [[Andy King (footballer born 1988)|Andy King]], [[Craig Morgan (footballer)|Craig Morgan]], [[Neil Taylor (footballer)|Neil Taylor]], [[Darcy Blake]] and current international captain [[Aaron Ramsey]].

On 15 May 2008, they played a friendly against [[England national under-21 football team|England U21s]] to mark the 100th match in the history of the side, losing 2â0.

A 3â0 victory against Romania in September 2008 meant that the Under-21 side finished top of their qualifying group for the first time in their history.  It meant Wales would go into a two-legged play-off against [[England national under-21 football team|England]] in October 2008 for a place in the finals of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2009 UEFA U-21 Championship]] to be played in [[Sweden]]. Wales lost the playoff 5â4 over the course of two legs. Losing 3â2 at home in the first leg and drawing 2â2 away in the second.

Wales started their qualifying campaign for the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification Group 3|2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] with a 1-0 away win against Andorra, a 3-1 away loss against Montenegro, a 1-0 home win against Montenegro, a 1-0 home defeat against Czech Republic and a 0-0 away draw against Armenia.
