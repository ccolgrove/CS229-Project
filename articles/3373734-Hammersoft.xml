The '''Tel al-Zaatar massacre''' ({{lang-ar|ÙØ°Ø¨Ø­Ø© ØªÙ Ø§ÙØ²Ø¹ØªØ±}}) took place during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] on August 12, 1976. Tel al-Zaatar (The Hill of Thyme) was a [[UNRWA]] administered Palestinian Refugee camp housing approximately 50,000-60,000 refugees in northeast [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Suhair Majaj, Paula W.

==Background==
With the breakdown in authority of the Lebanese government the militancy of radical faction increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;HKYR&quot;/&gt;

The Palestinians started collecting forced taxes from manufactures near Tel al-Zaatar camp in order to maintain their armed militia in the refugee camp and their influence on Lebanese Christian resident of [[Dekwaneh]] and the neighboring villages. Many Palestinians began invading houses and buildings and changing it to an armed headquarters. The removal of the camp was demanded by many residents of the area years before the [[massacre]].

After [[Kataeb Party|Phalange]], [[Guardians of the Cedars]] and [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tiger militia]] forces took control of the [[Karantina massacre|Karantina]] district on 18 January 1976, Tel al-Zaatar was placed under siege by a plan elaborated by General Michel Aoun who was the army commander of the area at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;KW1979&quot;&gt;Kazziha, Walid (1979) Palestine in the Arab dilemma Taylor &amp; Francis, ISBN 0856648647 p 52&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 1976, a thin cordon was established around the camp by 300 fighters from the [[Al-Tanzim]] and 100 fighters from the [[Lebanese Youth Movement (MKG)|Maroun Khoury Group]] in an effort to contain the Palestinians. The [[Lebanese Youth Movement (MKG)|Maroun Khoury Group]] was a Dikwaneh based militia. One road was left open to allow Palestinian evacuation towards Aley but the Palestinians refused to enter into dialogue with the Lebanese Front.

The PLO, as they had done in Karatina, prevented many of the people of the camp from leaving, thereby taking them hostage. Ahrar forces surrounded and attacked Jisr al Basha and Kataeb and Guardian of the Cedars troops engaged the adjacent, mainly Shiite, area of Nabaa, which contained large numbers of leftist forces. The battle for the camps had started and was the final showdown between the Palestinians and the Lebanese Front in Beirut. It was one of the hardest battles fought during the war.

Syria put itself forwards as a &quot;mediator&quot; on the basis of historic claims.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} &lt;ref name=&quot;HKYR&quot;&gt;Kissinger, Henry (1999) Years of Renewal Simon Schuster, ISBN 1-84212-042-5 p 1022&lt;/ref&gt; Syrian forces with [[As-Sa'iqa]] units were intervening on behalf of hard presses{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} Christian militias by April. The influence of Syria led to the election of [[Elias Sarkis]].&lt;ref&gt;Yair Evron (1987) ''War and Intervention in Lebanon: The Israeli-Syrian Deterrence Dialogue'' Routledge, ISBN 0709914512 p 13&lt;/ref&gt;

By the first week of June, Syrian forces had applied a blockade of West Beirut, a predominantly Muslim section that contained the Palestinian headquarters, leaving only the southern route open.&lt;ref&gt;Amal Kawar (1996) ''Daughters of Palestine: Leading Women of the Palestinian National Movement'' SUNY Press, ISBN 0791428451 p 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WKPL&quot;&gt;Walid Kazziha (1979) ''Palestine in the Arab dilemma'' Taylor &amp; Francis, ISBN 0856648647 p 54&lt;/ref&gt; From 22 June the Christian Phalangist forces, Many Christian residents of Ras el-Dekweneh and [[Mansourieh|Mansouriye]] controlled by [[Lebanese Youth Movement (MKG)|Maroun Khoury]] with Syrian backing intensified the blockade to a full scale military assault that lasted 35 days.&lt;ref name=cobban/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WKPL&quot;/&gt; Christian militias had laid siege to the refugee camp for 7 months. When the camp fell, the Palestinian victims numbered in the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926327-2,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian militia loss was around 500 armed men{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

==The massacre and its aftermath==
{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}


On August 12 the camp finally fell, following an on-and-off siege of several months. During the last two months, the siege had tightened. Heavy [[artillery]] shelling damaged much of the camp and killed a number of inhabitants. John Bulloch, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' correspondent in Beirut at the time wrote, &quot;In their bitterness the Palestinian commanders ordered their artillery to open up on the fringes of the camp with the ostensible objective of hampering the attackers and helping those inside; instead the shells were landing among the hundreds who had got through the perimeter and were trying to escape. When they were told of this, the Palestinians made no attempt to lift their fire: they wanted martyrs&quot;.

[[Robert Fisk]] wrote in his biographical profile of Yasser Arafat, ''The Broken Revolutionary'', &quot;When Arafat needed martyrs in 1976, he called for a truce around the besieged refugee camp of Tel el-Zaatar, then ordered his commanders in the camp to fire at their right-wing Lebanese Christian enemies. When, as a result, the Phalangists and &quot;Tigers&quot; militia slaughtered their way into Tel el-Zaatar, Arafat opened a &quot;martyrs' village&quot; for camp widows in the sacked Christian village of Damour. On his first visit, the widows pelted him with stones and rotten fruit. Journalists were ordered away at gunpoint.&quot;

In an ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' interview published May 30, 2002, Fisk recalls &quot;Arafat is a very immoral person, or maybe very amoral. A very cynical man. I remember when the Tal-al-Zaatar refugee camp in Beirut had to surrender to Christian forces in the very brutal Lebanese civil war. They were given permission to surrender with a cease-fire. But at the last moment, Arafat told his men to open fire on the Christian forces who were coming to accept the surrender. I think Arafat wanted more Palestinian &quot;martyrs&quot; in order to publicize the Palestinian position in the war. That was in 1976. Believe me that Arafat is not a changed man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;LA Weekly [http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/34850/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre is said to have contributed to the mounting [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] dissent within the [[Alawite|Alawi]]-ruled country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} As a result, Syria broke off its offensive on the PLO and the LNM, and agreed to an [[Arab League]] summit which temporarily ended the Civil War.

The PLO used the former Christian town of [[Damour]] to house survivors of the Tel al-Zaatar massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fisk (2002) Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War Oxford University Press, ISBN 0192801309 p 98&lt;/ref&gt; Damour, a Christian town on the main highway south of Beirut, had been the site of a [[Damour massacre|massacre]] by PLO military units on January 20, 1976. The populace not killed in the massacre had been forced to flee the town.

The split in the PLO leadership was ended when the Syrian backed [[As-Sa'iqa]] movement was expelled from the PLO, leaving [[Fatah]] as the dominant party.&lt;ref&gt;Barry M. Rubin (1994) ''Revolution Until Victory?: The Politics and History of the PLO'', Harvard University Press, ISBN 0674768035 p 50&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimations of the numbers of victims==
* Harris (p.&amp;nbsp;165) writes that &quot;Perhaps 3,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, died in the siege and its aftermath&quot;
* Cobban (p.&amp;nbsp;142) writes that 1 500 camp residents were killed in one day and a total of 2 200 were killed throughout the events.
* James Ron (2003) p 84. gives 1,000 - 2,000
* [http://www.111101.net/facts/history/chronology/phase.php?year=1976 Canadian artist Jayce Salloum] states that 2,000 people died during the entire siege, and 4,000 were wounded.
* The [http://www.laa.org/thewar.htm Lebanese-American Association] estimates that &quot;many of the several thousand civilians who had remained there [during the siege] were killed.&quot;
