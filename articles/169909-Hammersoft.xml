}}'''Stetson University''' is a private university with four colleges and schools located across the [[Interstate 4|I-4]] corridor in [[Central Florida]]. The primary undergraduate campus is located in [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]], [[Florida]], USA. In the 2012 ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'s'' guide to America's Best Colleges, Stetson ranks third in the category of Southern Masters-granting institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/stetson-university-1531 US News: Universities-Master's (South): Top Schools]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other recent recognitions include being ranked No. 23 nationally in ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' magazineâs âTop 50 Masterâs Universities.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2010/masters_universities_rank.php Washington Monthly 2010 Master's Universities]&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Music was named to ''[[Parade Magazine]]âs'' national âCollege A-Listâ in the category highlighting Arts Programs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parade.com/news/2010/08/22-college-a-list-arts-programs.html?index=19 Parade Magazine, Aug. 22, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and the School of Business Administration was named one of the nation's 300 best by Princeton Review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/StetsonUniversitySchoolofBusinessAdministration.aspx Princeton Review: &quot;Best 300 Business Schools&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Stetson, the only university affiliated with the [[Bonner Foundation|Corella and Bertram F. Bonner Foundation]] in Florida, is also nationally recognized for its commitment to service and social justice-based community engagement and community-engaged learning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stetson.edu/secure/apps/wordpress/?p=6248 discover.stetson.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{| class=&quot;toccolours&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3px&quot; style=&quot;width: 24em; float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:left;&quot;
|The first charter stated that the objective of the university should be &quot;to promote the general interests of education, and to qualify its students to engage in the learned professions or other employments of society, and to discharge honorably and usefully the various duties of life.&quot;
|}According to [[Gilbert Lycan]], a Stetson history professor who wrote the university's official centennial history in 1983, Stetson University is Florida's first university, public or private. Stetson University was founded in 1883 by [[Henry Addison DeLand]], a New York philanthropist, as '''DeLand Academy'''. In 1887, the [[Florida Legislature]] enacted the Charter of DeLand University as an independent institution of higher learning. [[Rollins College]] was founded and chartered in 1885, thus making it the oldest recognized college, public or private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h9069__.doc&amp;DocumentType=Bill&amp;BillNumber=9069&amp;Session=2004 myfloridahouse.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''DeLand University''''s name was changed in 1889 to honor hat manufacturer [[John B. Stetson]], a benefactor of the university, who served with town founder, Henry A. DeLand, and others as a founding trustee of the university.

Stetson University was affiliated with the Florida Baptist Convention until the early 1990s, when the university and convention ended their relationship.

==Campus==
[[File:220stetson-delandhall-DSC0145.jpg|thumb|DeLand Hall]]
[[File:220-stetson-reshall-DSC03996.jpg|thumb|University Village Apartments and clubhouse]]
[[File:220stetson-flagler-exterior.jpg|thumb|Flagler Hall]]
The university's College of Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Business Administration, School of Music, and most graduate programs are housed at the DeLand campus, located just north of the downtown area of [[DeLand, Florida]]. More than 60 undergraduate majors and minors are offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stetson.edu/academics/programs.php stetson.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscollegesearch.org/stetson-university.html uscollegesearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stetson's campus is just north of the downtown area of DeLand, roughly halfway between [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. The {{convert|175|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus is nationally designated by the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Stetson University Campus Historic District]] for Florida's oldest collection of education-related buildings. DeLand Hall, which houses the Office of the President and the offices of other administrators, was constructed in 1884 and is the oldest building in Florida in continuous use for higher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stetson.edu/other/125years/ Transformations: 125 Years at Stetson]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, the Lynn Business Center â housing much of the university's School of Business â was Florida's first [[green building]] certified by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]].

Elizabeth Hall, named after [[John B. Stetson]]'s wife, houses a number of departments in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. The School of Music performs in Lee Chapel in the south of the building. The [[cupola]] atop Elizabeth Hall â modeled after the one on [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]] â is used as the official symbol of the undergraduate campus.

In 2010, Stetson became a pet-friendly campus,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stetson.edu/secure/apps/wordpress/?p=15013 Stetson University news]&lt;/ref&gt; and the university also invested $6.5 million to renew landscaping in the campus core, upgrade classrooms and add energy-saving lighting, all at the DeLand campus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stetson.edu/secure/apps/wordpress/?p=15609 Stetson University news]&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements included a new coffeehouse. In the past 3 years, over $17 million in new construction took place at the DeLand campus. Sage Hall, home of the departments of natural sciences, received an $8.5 million renovation, while the Homer and Dolly Hand Art Center, the Rinker Environmental Learning Center, and Mary B. McMahan Hall â rehearsal space for the School of Music â were new constructions. Along with student exhibitions, the university's extensive collection of paintings by American modernist [[Oscar Bluemner]] are housed in the Hand Art Center. 

The university also includes the [[Stetson University College of Law]], the first law school in Florida. It was relocated in 1954 from DeLand to [[Gulfport, Florida]], a suburb of [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. 

There are also two satellite centers:
*The Stetson University Center at [[Celebration, Florida]], which opened in 2004.
*The Tampa Law Center, which opened in 2004, in downtown [[Tampa, Florida]].

Stetson's campus has been used as a filming location for a number of films and television shows. These include the Adam Sandler film ''[[The Waterboy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120484/locations imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ghost Story (film)|Ghost Story]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082449/locations imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''From Earth to the Moon'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120570/locations imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''First of May'', and ''EstÃ¡s nominado: Cuando la realidad supera a la ficciÃ³n''.

The fraternity houses were renovated in 2009. The Wellness House serves as housing for students who wish to abstain from any substance use, including alcohol and tobacco. Nemec Hall is a pet-friendly residence hall. Smith, Gordis and Carson-Hollis halls are used primarily for first-year students. Conrad and Chaudoin Halls are all-female housing.
