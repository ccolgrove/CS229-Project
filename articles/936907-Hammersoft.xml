The '''Court of Appeal for Ontario''' (frequently referred to as '''Ontario Court of Appeal''' or '''OCA''') is headquartered in [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]] [[Toronto]], in historic [[Osgoode Hall]].

The [[Court]] is composed of 24 [[judge]]s who hear over 1,500 appeals each year, on issues of [[private law]], [[Canadian constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[Canadian criminal law|criminal law]], [[Canadian administrative law|administrative law]], and other matters. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] hears appeals from less than 3% of the decisions of the Court of Appeal; in a very practical sense, the Court of Appeal is the last avenue of appeal for most litigants in Canada's most populous province.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the Court of Appeal's most notable decisions was a 2003 ruling that legalized [[same-sex marriage in Ontario]], making Canada the first jurisdiction in the world where same-sex marriage was legalized by a court ruling. Among  many judges from the [[Court]] who have been elevated to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] are Justices [[Rosalie Abella]], [[Louise Arbour]], [[Peter Cory]], [[Louise Charron]], [[Andromache Karakatsanis]], [[Bora Laskin]], [[Michael Moldaver]] and [[Bertha Wilson]]. Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] was the first female justice on both the Ontario Court of Appeal (1975) and the Supreme Court of Canada (1982).

The court derives its jurisdiction from Ontario's ''[http://canlii.org/on/laws/sta/c-43/ Courts of Justice Act]''.

Over the dais is the Royal Arms of England, which until 1931 was the Royal Arms for general purposes throughout the British Empire.  The Statute of Westminster, 1931 effectively elevated the Royal Arms of Canada to the position of the Queen's Royal Arms for general purposes across Canada, which is why the Canadian Coat of Arms are now used by the court to represent the Canadian Crown.]]
