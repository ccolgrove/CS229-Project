The [[English compound]] [[noun]] '''''cellar door''''' (especially in its British pronunciation of {{IPA-en|sÉlÉËdÉÉ|}}) is commonly used as an example of a word or phrase which is beautiful in terms of [[phonaesthetics]] (sound) with no regard for [[semantics]] (meaning).&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt;  It has been variously presented either as merely one beautiful instance of many, or as the most beautiful in the [[English language]]; either as the author's personal choice, or that of an eminent scholar, or of a foreigner who does not speak the language.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nunberg&quot;/&gt;

==Phonaesthetics==
The semantics of &quot;cellar door&quot; derive straightforwardly from its component terms: in the United States, a cellar door is a door or pair of shutter doors between the outside of a building and its [[Basement|cellar]]. In Britain and Ireland, a cellar door is often located within a house and opens onto a flight of stairs leading to the cellar ([[basement]] in American English). Outside doors are more common to pubs and restaurants.  

From the nineteenth century, many American houses on large plots had slanted [[trapdoor]]s abutting the side and opening onto a flight of steps leading down into the cellar. By the mid-twentieth century this rustic feature was a rarity; in 1953, [[William Chapman White]] wrote in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eT4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=cellar-door%20slide%20down%20childhood&amp;pg=3182%2C3463962|title=The Lost Art of Bannister Sliding|last=White|first=William Chapman |date=20 April 1953|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=52|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&quot;The modern small home or apartment has ... deprived today's child of ... the pleasant summer afternoon activity of sliding down cellar doors. Just what happened to the slanted cellar door in this efficient age isn't clear; although cellars have remained, nothing has disappeared more quietly from modern life than these cellar doors.&quot;

[[Geoff Nunberg]] suggests the use of such a semantically banal term to illustrate the idea of beauty appeals to [[aesthete]]s as &quot;an occasion to display a capacity to discern beauty in the names of prosaic things&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nunberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2142|title=The Romantic Side of Familiar Words|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|date=26 February 2010|work=[[Language Log]]|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nunberg suggests the phonetic characteristics of &quot;cellar door&quot; are relevant, not for purely auditory reasons, but by phonological association with languages imbued with romantic preconceptions:&lt;ref name=&quot;nunberg&quot;/&gt;
:it at once brings to mind a word from one of those warm-blooded languages English speakers invest with musical beauty, spare in [[Consonant cluster|clusters]] and full of [[liquid consonant|liquid]]s, [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s, and [[open syllable]]s with [[cardinal vowel]] [[syllable nucleus|nuclei]] â the languages of the [[Mediterranean]] or [[Polynesia]], or the [[Celtic Revival|sentimentalized Celtic]] that [[C. S. Lewis|Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] turned into a staple of [[fantasy fiction]]

Nunberg further suggests the semantics of &quot;cellar door&quot; are not actually irrelevant; in fantasy, a mundane door can become a [[Portals in fiction|portal to another world]], as with the wardrobe of ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' or the [[Burrow|rabbit hole]] of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nunberg&quot;/&gt;  This idea is exploited in the 2001 film ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', where the phrase &quot;cellar door&quot; is discussed in one scene, and an actual cellar door looms ominously in a later scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kois|first=Dan|date=23 July 2003|title=Everything you were afraid to ask about &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;|journal=Slate|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2004/07/23/darko/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2010, [[Grant Barrett]] discussed the &quot;cellar door&quot; combination of words in the &quot;On Language&quot; column of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt; The earliest example he cites is from ''Gee-Boy'', a 1903 novel by Cyrus Lauron Hooper, where it is attributed to &quot;an Italian savant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/magazine/14FOB-onlanguage-t.html|title=On Language: Cellar Door |last=Barrett|first=Grant|date=14 February 2010|work=New York Times|page=16, Sunday magazine|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett surmises the idea was already current when Hooper was writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt; [[William Dean Howells]] in the March 1905 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' attributes to a &quot;courtly Spaniard&quot; the quote, &quot;Your language too has soft and beautiful words, but they are not always appreciated. What could be more musical than your word ''cellar-door''?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howells|first=William Dean|date=March 1905|title=Editor's easy chair|journal=Harper's Magazine|page=645|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/1905/03/page/0163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A story told by syndicated columnists Frank Colby in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Take My Word For It |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eZ4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4752%2C1357975 |last=Colby |first=Frank |date=3 November 1949|work=Miami Daily News|page=45|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[L. M. Boyd]] in 1979 holds that &quot;cellar door&quot; was [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s favorite phrase, and that the refrain ''Nevermore'' in &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot; was chosen as &quot;the closest word to 'cellar door' he could think of.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a90hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pqAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=cellar-door%20english%20word&amp;pg=3537%2C2682286|title=Quoth the raven &quot;cellar door&quot;?|last=Boyd|first=Louis M.|date=15 January 1979|work=Reading Eagle |page=5|accessdate=27 February 2010|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may derive from a 1914 essay by [[Alma Blount]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Alma|title=Intensive Studies in English Literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|date=January 1914 |pages=30â31|chapter=III: Melody and Harmony |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/intensivestudies00blourich#page/n59/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Poe, who studied sound effects carefully, says that he chose &quot;Nevermore&quot; as the refrain for ''The Raven'' largely because the word contains the [[sonority hierarchy|most sonorous]] vowel, ''o'', and the most &quot;producible&quot; consonant, ''r''. An amusing story is told of an Italian lady who knew not a word of English, but who, when she heard the word ''cellar-door'', was convinced  that English must be a most musical language. If the word were not in our minds hopelessly attached to a humble significance, we, too, might be charmed by its combination of [[spirant]], liquids, and vowels.

In 1919, with [[Prohibition in the United States]] about to come into force, ''Cartoons'' magazine jocularly invoked the idea when predicting the rise of [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] hidden in basements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PkYbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jEkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=cellar-door%20english%20word&amp;pg=5785%2C2334658|title=The most beautiful word |date=22 July 1919|work=The Pittsburgh Press |page=6|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:That eastern professor who said, one time that cellar-door was the most beautiful word in English was speaking oracularly. ... if cellar-door is not the most beautiful word it is probably, now that THE GREAT DROUTH [sic] is upon us, the most popular.

The rhythmic or musical quality of the phrase was referenced by [[H. L. Mencken]] in 1920, by professor David Allen Robertson in 1921,&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt; and by critic [[George Jean Nathan]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt;  In 1932, poet [[Wilfred John Funk|Wilfred J. Funk]] publicized [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]] dictionary with a top ten list of beautiful words, which did not include &quot;cellar door&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt; Writers were polled afterwards for their own candidates, and three included &quot;cellar door&quot;: [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]], [[Dorothy Parker]], and [[Albert Payson Terhune]].&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' responded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Francis Scott |title=Conversations with F. Scott Fitzgerald |editor=Matthew Joseph Bruccoli, Judith Baughman|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|year=2004 |series=Literary conversations series|chapter=&quot;'Cellar-Door'? Ugh!&quot; Quoth Baltimore Writers |page=106|isbn=1578066050|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M_BObJAl0lIC&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=%22cellar%20door%22&amp;num=100&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cellar%20door%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Three poets who were questioned as to their preferences agreed that the measure of a word and its associations are far more important in judging its beauty than the mere sound ...Although Baltimore writers showed wide disagreement in their preferences, none could make out why [writers] in New York think &quot;cellar-door&quot; should be ranked at the top.

A passage from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1955 essay &quot;[[English and Welsh]]&quot; has been cited as the origin of the idea:&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt;
: &quot;Most English-speaking people...will admit that ''cellar door'' is 'beautiful', especially if dissociated from its sense (and from its spelling). More beautiful than, say, ''sky'', and far more beautiful than ''beautiful''. Well then, in Welsh for me ''cellar doors'' are extraordinarily frequent, and moving to the higher dimension, the words in which there is pleasure in the contemplation of the association of form and sense are abundant&quot;

The teenage protagonist of [[Norman Mailer]]'s 1967 novel ''Why Are We in Vietnam?'' attributes the observation to &quot;a committee of Language Hump-type professors ... back in 1936 &quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;barrett&quot;/&gt;  [[Richard Lederer]] in ''Crazy English''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Lederer |title=Crazy English |origyear=1989 |year=1998 |edition=revised |isbn=978-0671023232 |publisher=Pocket Books |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that H. L. Mencken had claimed in a 1940s poll that &quot;cellar door&quot; had been favored by a student from China. 

In 1991, [[Jacques Barzun]] wrote:
:I discovered its illusory character when many years ago a Japanese friend with whom I often discussed literature told me that to him and some of his English-speaking friends the most beautiful word in our language was âcellardoor.â It was not beautiful to me and I wondered where its evocative power lay for the Japanese. Was it because they find l and r difficult to pronounce, and the word thus acquires remoteness and enchantment? I asked, and learned also that Tatsuo Sakuma, my friend, had never seen an American cellar door, either inside a house or outside â the usual two flaps on a sloping ledge. No doubt that lack of visual familiarity added to the wordâs appeal. He also enjoyed going to restaurants and hearing the waiter ask if he would like salad or roast vegetables, because again the phrase 'salad or' could be heard. I concluded that its charmlessness to speakers of English lay simply in its meaning. It has the l and r sounds and d and long o dear to the analysts of verse music, but it is prosaic. Compare it with â[[Celandine (disambiguation)|celandine]],â where the image of the flower at once makes the sound lovely.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Barzun, ''An Essay on French Verse for Readers of English Poetry'' (New Directions, 1991).  ISBN 0-8112-1157-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The remark is attributed to &quot;a famous linguist&quot; in the dialogue script of ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001). When asked about the origin of the phrase, writer-director [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]] inaccurately suggested [[Edgar Allan Poe]] as the possible source.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Smith, ''Inside Language'', [[Walking Tree Publishers]] (2007), p. 65).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Norden]], asked for his favorite word in 2008, said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://e-edition.metro.co.uk/2008/10/06/10.html |title=60 Second Interview: Denis Norden |date=6 October 2008 |work=Metro UK |publisher=Associated Newspapers |page=10 |accessdate=28 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:When I was at school a teacher told me the most beautiful word in the English language was 'cellar door'âand I believed him, even though it's strictly two words, and I made it mine. Many years later, I discovered the word he meant was 'celador'. It's still my favorite.
Paul Smith, who produced Norden's show ''[[It'll be Alright on the Night]]'', later co-founded [[Celador]] Productions.

The antiquarian book seller Cellar Door Books was founded in Indianola, Iowa, in 1971.  The company traces its name to the Poe attribution through English teacher Miles Sheffler in Coffeyville, Kansas, in 1961.   Moved to New Hampshire in 1975, the company has specialized for many years in the art and published books of the 20th century watercolorist Tasha Tudor (1915-2008).  A significant collection of Tasha Tudor's books and other documentation formed by Cellar Door Books was placed with the De Grummond Collecton, the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011.

==Respellings==
[[Respelling]]s of &quot;cellar door&quot; have been made to preserve its purported phonoaesthetics while obscuring the semantics. Some respellings presume a [[non-rhotic]] accent and do not represent the R of &quot;cellar&quot;. Some respellings may fail in accents lacking the [[horseâhoarse merger]].
