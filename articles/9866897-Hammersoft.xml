The '''[[Miami Dolphins]]-[[New York Jets]] rivalry''' is a [[List of sports rivalries|rivalry]] between two franchises in the [[National Football League]]. The teams both play in the [[American Football Conference East Division]], and play two scheduled games each season as a result. They have often competed for divisional supremacy, and have played a number of classic, memorable games. Currently, the Jets hold the advantage in the all-time series with a record of 47-43-1, while the Dolphins have won the lone postseason meeting, defeating the Jets in the [[1982â83 NFL playoffs|1982 AFC Championship]].

== History ==
The [[New York Jets]] were established in 1960 and the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966; both as members of the now defunct [[American Football League]].  After the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970 the Dolphins and the Jets were placed in the AFC East, guaranteeing that they would meet twice a year annually. The rivalry has stayed intense through the years as both teams are always competitive against one another no matter what the standings indicate. The rivalry also keeps a high intensity because of the large amount of transplanted New York Jets fans that retire to [[South Florida]].
 
Prior to the [[New England Patriots]] rise to dominance in the early 2000s, the Jets and Dolphins regularly contested for the AFC East title (along with the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the early 1990s). Upon the Dolphin's joining of the AFL in 1966, the Jets were laying the seeds for their 1968 [[Super Bowl III]] victory. After the Jets Super Bowl victory in 1968, the Dolphins began their ascension to the top of the NFL, culminating back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 1972 and 1973. The 1972 season also Miami finish with a 17-0 record; the only NFL team to finish the regular season and post-season without a loss or tie.

===1960s and 1970s===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Joe_Namath.gifâ|thumb|150px|left|Joe Namath was a perfect 8-0 in his first eight meetings against the Dolphins.]]  --&gt;
When the Dolphins joined the [[American Football League]] in 1966, the Jets were ascending the ranks of the AFL powerhouses on the arm of quarterback [[Joe Namath]]. The Jets won the first eight contests against the Dolphins. When the Dolphins finally posted their first winning record in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], injuries plagued Namath and the Jets stumbled to a 4-10 record. Thanks to Namath's inability to consistently stay healthy, the Jets never posted a record above .500 in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the Dolphins quickly surged to the NFL's elite after the [[AFL-NFL merger]], peaking with one the first and so far only undefeated season in NFL History (New England later had an undefeated regular season, but failed to win the Super Bowl)  [[1972 NFL season|1972]] and back-to-back [[Super Bowl]] wins in Super Bowls [[Super Bowl VII|VII]] and [[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]].

===1980s===
The 1978 season began a string of Jets success against the Dolphins that ran into the early 1980s.  Entering the [[1980 NFL season|1980 season]], the Dolphins were aiming toward another playoff run, while the Jets were struggling. The Jets won a total of only four games. Two of those games were wins over Miami:17-14 in New York on October 27, and 24-17 in Miami on December 20. Miami went on to finish with a record of 8-8, but it was the season sweep by the Jets that largely cost them their chances of a playoff berth.  

The mid-1980s saw both teams become simultaneously competitive for the first time, beginning with a battle for the AFC East in [[1981 NFL season|1981]]. That season also saw the only tie in the series, a 28-28 stalemate in Miami.  The game lead tied or changed on every score; in the first half Jet leads of 7-0 and 14-7 were answered by Miami touchdowns.  Miami took a 21-14 lead in the third but in the fourth touchdowns by [[Wesley Walker]] and a [[Richard Todd]] pass to [[Bobby Jones (American football)|Bobby Jones]] offset a [[Don Strock]] touchdown to [[Nat Moore]].  In overtime neither team could advance the ball, ending the game deadlocked.  Todd finished with 310 passing yards and four touchdowns to Strock's 279 yards and two scores.

The tie became crucial in the final standings; had the Jets won the game, combined with their 16-15 home victory during the season, they would've clinched the division on a tiebreaker. Instead, Miami won the division by one game. Still, the Jets' 10-5-1 record allowed them to clinch their first postseason berth in twelve seasons. but they lost to the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the [[NFL playoffs, 1981-82|Wild Card round]], 31-27, while Miami lost a [[The Epic in Miami|41-38 overtime epic]] to the [[San Diego Chargers]].  

With the conclusion of the 1981 season the Jets had won seven of the previous eight meetings with the Dolphins with the one tie.  Miami, however, returned to the rivalry's fore in 1982, a season that saw the apex of the rivalry, coming in the [[NFL playoffs, 1982-83|1982 AFC Championship]] on January 23, 1983, more appropriately known as &quot;The [[NFL_playoffs,_1982-83#AFC:_Miami_Dolphins_14.2C_New_York_Jets_0|Mud Bowl]].&quot; After the Dolphins swept the Jets during the strike- shortened regular season (winning 45-28 in [[Shea Stadium|New York]] and 20-19 in [[Orange Bowl|Miami]], the two teams met again, this time with a trip to [[Super Bowl XVII]] on the line.  The tarp was left off the field of the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] during a 72 hour rainstorm leading up to the game, which resulted in a sloppy field covered in mud which kept both teams scoreless in the first half. The game was a classic defensive battle that featured ten turnovers, eight of them on quarterback [[interception]]s. The star of the game was undoubtedly Dolphins linebacker [[A.J. Duhe]] who picked off three of Jets quarterback [[Richard Todd]]'s five interceptions, returning one 35 yards for a touchdown to help seal the 14&amp;ndash;0 win and send the Dolphins to Super Bowl XVII.  To this day, former Jets coach [[Walt Michaels]] believes that Miami coach [[Don Shula]] ordered to keep the tarp off the field, to neutralize New York's superior team speed.

On November 10, 1985, [[Mark Duper|Mark &quot;Super&quot; Duper]] set a Dolphins club single game record with 217 receiving yards, but not before helping catapult Miami to victory. Down 17-14 with less than a minute to play, Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino fired a 50 yard touchdown pass to Duper for the win, 21&amp;ndash;17. 

Two of the most memorable contests between the teams occurred in [[1986 NFL season|1986]]. On September 21, Jets quarterback [[Ken O'Brien]] and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]] put on a legendary offensive performance. The two quarterbacks combined set NFL single game records of 884 net passing yards and ten touchdown passes, records that still stand to this day. Dan Marino completed 30 of 50 passes for 448 yards and six touchdown passes. Mark Duper and [[Mark Clayton (American football, born 1961)|Mark Clayton]] had big games, each having over 100 yards receiving (Duper with 154, Clayton with 174). [[Ken O'Brien]] threw for 479 yards and four touchdown passes all to wide receiver [[Wesley Walker]], including one with no time left on the clock to force overtime, and then the game clincher in overtime for the win, 51-45. To this day, it is the highest scoring game between the teams (96 total points). &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Nyj_obrien_ken2.jpgâ|thumb|150px|left|Ken O'Brien was one of Miami's Torturers in the 1980s]] --&gt;
The win propelled the Jets to a team-record nine-game winning streak, and an NFL-leading 10-1 record, when the teams met again on November 24 on [[Monday Night Football]]. However, Marino and the Dolphins exacted some revenge with a blowout win at home. Dan Marino completed 29 of 36 passes for 288 yards and four touchdown passes, while Dolphins running back [[Lorenzo Hampton]] rushed for 148 yards on 19 carries and two scores, one being a 50-yard touchdown run. As for the Jets, they could only manage three points, as the Dolphins defeated the Jets 45-3. The game also reflected a swift change in momentum for the Jets, who lost their final five games of 1986 to finish with a 10-6 record, but managed to still back into a [[NFL playoffs, 1986-87|playoff]] berth. They eventually fell to the [[Cleveland Browns]] in a double-overtime Divisional round loss.

Dan Marino made history in 1988; on October 23 he joined a very elite club, becoming one of the few quarterbacks in NFL history to throw for 500 yards, completing 35 of 60 passes for a career high 521 yards. However, he also threw five interceptions; three of them were to rookie Jets cornerback [[Erik McMillan]], who returned one of them 55 yards for a touchdown. The Jets were ahead the entire game, including 30-10 at halftime, and despite a Dolphins rally (scoring three touchdowns but missing the PAT on one of them) the Jets won 44-30.  The game, however, was overshadowed in the Jets locker room, for days earlier defensive end [[Mark Gastineau]] announced he was retiring from football to be with his girlfriend [[Brigitte Nielsen]], who claimed to be suffering cancer in the uterus.

In the rematch on November 27 the Dolphins fell behind 24-14 at the half but Marino (353 passing yards) exploded in the third quarter with two touchdowns to [[Mark Clayton (American football, born 1961)|Mark Clayton]] (marred by a missed PAT) and an 80-yard score to [[Ferrell Edmunds]] for a 34-24 Miami lead.  [[Pat Ryan (American football)|Pat Ryan]] had started the game for the Jets, throwing for 341 yards and two touchdowns, but in the fourth quarter [[Ken O'Brien]] came in and wiped out Miami's lead with scores to [[Mickey Shuler]] and [[Wesley Walker]] and a 38-34 Jets win.

The two teams met in yet another high-scoring affair on September 24, 1989 in Miami, the Jets looking for their first win at 0-2 while Miami was 1-1.  Throwing for 427 yards and three touchdowns, Dan Marino raced the Dolphins to a 30-19 lead after three quarters, but again Ken O'Brien whipped the Jets to the win with two touchdown throws and a [[Johnny Hector]] rushing score in the fourth, ending a 40-33 Jets win.  The Jets, however, lost five of their next six games when they hosted the 5-4 Dolphins on November 12.  This time it was Marino leading a comeback; down 20-3 in the second quarter, Marino erupted with three touchdown throws while [[Sammie Smith]] added a two-yard rushing score and the Dolphins defense limited the Jets to one fourth-quarter field goal and a 31-23 Miami win.

===1990s===
The teams met in the season finale on December 22, 1991 a winner-take-all game for the final wild card spot in the [[NFL playoffs, 1991-92|playoffs]]. It was a seesaw battle, and the Dolphins took the lead 20-17 with 44 seconds remaining. When the Jets got the ball back, they drove down the field and tied the game to force overtime on [[Raul Allegre]]'s 44-yard field goal. Allegre came through for the Jets once again in OT with a 30-yard field goal, sending the Jets to the playoffs, and sending the Dolphins home.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Img6627403.jpgâ|thumb|150px|right|Dan Marino celebrates with teammates after the infamous &quot;fake spike&quot; in 1994.]] --&gt;
In 1994, the Jets found themselves one game back of the Dolphins for the AFC East division lead heading into their November 27 match at [[Giants Stadium|the Meadowlands]]. In a game with first place on the line, the Jets held a 24-6 lead, outplaying the Dolphins for three quarters. However, Dan Marino led the Dolphins back with two touchdowns, cutting the score to 24-21. Marino got the ball one last time and drove the Dolphins down the field to within the Jets' five-yard line. With thirty seconds remaining, and the clock continuing to wind down, it appeared Marino was going to spike the ball to stop the clock and send out the field goal unit to tie the game. Instead, Marino took the snap from center, and after motioning as if he would spike the ball, fired the ball in the corner of the end zone past [[Aaron Glenn]] and into the hands of [[Mark Ingram, Sr.|Mark Ingram]]. It was Ingram's fourth touchdown catch of the game, which tied a club record with former Dolphins wide receiver [[Paul Warfield]]. The touchdown gave the Dolphins a 28-24 victory, and Miami went on to win the division. The Jets went into a spiral after that play, losing all of their remaining games. Indeed, the game marked the beginning of a period of ignominy for the Jets as they compiled a record of 4-33 from that game to the end of the [[1996 New York Jets season|1996 season]].

One of the more bitter losses for the Jets in 1996 was at [[Pro Player Stadium|Miami]] in Week Three.  The Dolphins clawed to the Jets 5-yard line and tried for the touchdown on 4th and goal, but [[Aaron Glenn]] picked off the pass in the end zone and ran 100 yards for the touchdown.  Later [[Neil O'Donnell]] connected with ex-Oiler [[Webster Slaughter]] on a 35-yard score, but after this score Marino went 74 yards to [[Stanley Pritchett]] for the touchdown.  After [[Karim Abdul-Jabbar]] tied the score the Dolphins took over, scoring two touchdowns marred by a missed [[Joe Nedney]] PAT and a botched 2-point try.  The Jets despite being down 33-14 in the fourth kept fighting as [[Jeff Graham]] caught a long touchdown pass; later the Jets forced a Dolphins fumble but were pinned 4th and goal at the 29; O'Donnell threw deep and [[Keyshawn Johnson]] out-jumped the entire Dolphins defense to catch the touchdown.  But the Dolphins iced it on a Nedney field goal for a 36-27 final.  O'Donnell finished with 325 passing yards and three touchdowns.

After 1996, the Jets made several changes to turn things around, the most significant of which was the hiring of [[Bill Parcells]] from the [[New England Patriots]]. The turnaround was immediate, and by 1998 the team once again was a serious division contender. Both teams were 9-4 on December 13, 1998 when they met on [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] with the division lead, and possibly the division title, on the line. The Jets led 14-10 when Jets defender [[Chad Cascadden]] picked up a Marino fumble and returned it for a touchdown with just under two minutes to play to put the Jets ahead 21-10. The Dolphins were able to score a quick touchdown to come close, but it was not enough, and the Jets won 21-16, and they went on to win their first post-merger division title the following Saturday at [[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]].

The teams' contest on December 27, 1999 marked Marino's last against the Jets, as well as the last [[Monday Night Football]] appearance in his career. Marino faced a young quarterback named [[Ray Lucas]], who, along with [[Rick Mirer]], replaced an injured [[Vinny Testaverde]] early in the season. The Dolphins were trying to clinch a playoff spot, while the Jets, who started their season 1-6, and were at 6-8, having won five out of their last seven. The Jets did not make it easy for the Dolphins. Lucas completed 11 of 23 passes for 190 yards and three touchdowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999game&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jt-sw.com/football/boxes/index.nsf/Games/1999-16-nyj-mia |title=New York Jets 38, Miami Dolphins 31 |date=2001-09-09 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Marino put on one of his last great performances, completing 29 of 52 passes for 322 yards and three touchdown passes, but also three interceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999game&quot;/&gt; It was the last of Marino's NFL regular season record 63 career games with 300 yards passing.  The Jets came away with a 38-31 victory, with two long Lucas touchdowns sealing the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999game&quot;/&gt; The Jets finished the season 8-8 (including a season sweep of Miami), while the Dolphins finished the season 9-7 and made it to the second round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1999-00|playoffs]]; after defeating the [[Seattle Seahawks]] 20-17, they lost handily to the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], 62-7. Marino retired six weeks later.

===2000s===
Both the Jets and Dolphins started the [[2000 NFL season|2000]] season 5-1 when they met on [[Monday Night Football]] on October 23, 2000, to determine control of the AFC East. What looked to be an exciting match between two of the top teams in the NFL at the time was anything but for the first three quarters. The Dolphins held a 23-7 lead at halftime that grew to 30-7 at the end of the third quarter. [[Vinny Testaverde]] threw three interceptions, running back [[Curtis Martin]] was limited to 30 yards on the ground, and the Jets offense could only manage two first downs in the first half. Meanwhile, running back [[Lamar Smith (American football)|Lamar Smith]] scored two touchdowns for the Dolphins on his way to 155 rushing yards for the night. So great was the 23-point advantage that Dolphins quarterback [[Jay Fiedler]] was heard on the sidelines telling defensive end [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]], &quot;They ain't coming back on us!&quot; to which Taylor replied, &quot;Hell no! You kidding? C'mon now.&quot;

However, the Jets looked to prove that statement wrong. Touchdowns from Testaverde to [[Laveranues Coles]] and [[Jermaine Wiggins]] cut the lead to 30-20. After a field goal by [[John Hall (American football)|John Hall]], Testaverde fired a touchdown pass to [[Wayne Chrebet]] to tie the game 30-30 with 3:55 left. Fans who had left the stadium when the game looked to be a rout suddenly piled back in wanting to see the Jets' comeback. Still, it took only two plays for Miami to respond. Fiedler aired a long touchdown pass to [[Leslie Shepherd]] to retake the lead 37-30, seemingly crushing the Jets' hopes. Nonetheless, Testaverde marched the Jets down field and, with 42 seconds left, found eligible [[offensive tackle]] [[Jumbo Elliott (American football)|Jumbo Elliott]] on a three-yard touchdown (which Elliott memorably bobbled as he fell to the ground) to tie the game at 37-37 and sent it to overtime. In the fourth quarter, Testaverde was 18 for 26 for 235 yards and four touchdowns, and the offense converted twenty first downs in the quarter, after managing just five beforehand.

In overtime, Fiedler was intercepted for the third time, setting up the dramatic finish. At 1:08 AM [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EDT]], Hall nailed a 40-yard field goal to win the game for the Jets, 40-37. The game came to be known in [[National Football League lore|NFL lore]] as [[The Monday Night Miracle (American football)|The Monday Night Miracle]]. When Monday Night Football celebrated its 500th telecast on November 11, 2002, fans picked the game as the greatest in the series' history.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNF&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/greatestgames/miaminewyorkjets2000.html

Despite the win, and a subsequent victory later in the season in Miami, the Jets missed the playoffs losing six of their final nine games and their last three. Miami clinched the division with a win over [[New England Patriots|New England]] on the last day of the season.

The Jets, Dolphins, and Patriots each came into the last week of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]] with a chance to win the AFC East; the Dolphins had a record of 9-6, while the Patriots and Jets were 8-7. The Dolphins and Patriots met in [[Gillette Stadium|Foxborough]] in what was essentially an elimination game, while the Jets played the [[Green Bay Packers]] later in the afternoon. The Dolphins simply needed to win the game to win the division, while the Jets needed a Patriots victory coupled with their own. The Patriots came back from an 11-point fourth quarter deficit to force overtime, and won on an [[Adam Vinatieri]] field goal. News of the Patriots' victory sent the crowd at [[Giants Stadium|the Meadowlands]] into celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jets history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nflhistory.net/shared/greatestgames.asp?Team=4|title=New York Jets History Greatest Games|publisher=NFL History Network|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets, meanwhile, played a close first half with Green Bay before opening the game up in the second half for a 42-17 victory and the AFC East championship. 

The [[2003 Miami Dolphins season|2003 season]] [[2003 New York Jets season|for both teams]] wound up without playoff implications nor division title on the line as both teams were left in the division dust by [[2003 New England Patriots season|their mutual foe the Patriots]] as they swept both teams en route to a 14-2 record.  On September 14 the Jets hosted the Dolphins and Miami raced to a 21-10 win; the Jets were without quarterback [[Chad Pennington]] as he was sidelined with a shoulder injury incurred during preseason.   In the season finale on December 28 Miami took the early lead with a pair of [[Olindo Mare]] field goals and a Ricky Williams touchdown run to make the score 13-0. Jets running back [[Curtis Martin]] then scored a touchdown of his own to narrow the margin to 13-7. Miami quarterback [[Jay Fiedler]], who threw for 328 yards in this game, hit wide receiver [[Chris Chambers]] in the end zone for a touchdown grab.  [[Chris Chambers]] was magnificent all game as he hauled in 9 catches for 153 yards and a touchdown grab. A Jet field goal later and the score was 20-10 at halftime. Jets quarterback Chad Pennington did not give up however. In the third quarter, the Jets hit another field goal, and even got a safety to narrow the margin to 20-15. Pennington, who was 22 for 28 for 221 yards and one touchdown, hit his tight end [[Anthony Becht]] for a one yard touchdown to grab their first lead of the game 21-20 with less than nine minutes to go. The Dolphins however got the ball one last time and drove down the field. With three seconds left on the clock, the Dolphins relied on their kicker [[Olindo Mare]] who nailed an ugly 22 yard field goal to seal the win 23-21 and the season for both the Dolphins and the Jets.

Both games in [[2006 NFL season|2006]] were tight contests that came down to the wire. The season was surprising for both teams; the Dolphins were considered a serious playoff contender in the preseason,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=514986 |title=Ripe for the picking |first=Mark |last=McGuire |publisher=[[Albany Times Union]] |date=2006-09-07 |accessdate=2006-07-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but stumbled to a 6-10 record, while the Jets were considered to be in a rebuilding stage, yet managed to go 10-6 and reach the playoffs. On October 15, 2006, the Jets opened up a 20-3 lead with less than 13 minutes to play at home. Miami didn't give up, though, as touchdowns by [[Chris Chambers]] and [[Ronnie Brown]] cut the margin to three. The Dolphins got the ball one last time and got in field goal range for kicker [[Olindo Mare]] to attempt a 51 yard field goal with 33 seconds left to tie the game. Mare kicked it, but it was short and wide right and the Jets held on to win 20-17.

The teams met again on [[Christmas]] night that season. The Dolphins came into the game 6-8 and out of playoff contention. The Jets were 8-6 and in the position to clinch a playoff berth with victories in their final two games. A rainy field kept both offenses quiet for most of the night. All of the scoring happened in the final 17:25 of the game. Miami hit a game-tying field goal with 2:09 remaining to make the score 10-10. However, Chad Pennington threw a short pass to Leon Washington, which he turned into a 64-yard gain. Four plays later, Jets kicker [[Mike Nugent]] hit a 30-yard field goal with 10 seconds left to give the Jets a 13-10 win.

On August 7, 2008 the Jets acquired quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Favre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934|title=Packers trade Favre to Jets|author=Glazer, Jay|publisher=FOX Sports|date=2008-08-07|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favre's acquisition made Chad Pennington expendable, and he was subsequently released from the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d92dp0fo0/qb-chad-pennington-released-by-jets-after-eight-year-injury-plagued-stint-in-new-york.html|title=QB Chad Pennington released by Jets after eight-year, injury-plagued stint in New York|author=Waszak, Jr., Dennis|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=2008-08-07|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennington immediately signed with the Dolphins and became their starting quarterback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/sports/football/09pennington.html|title=As Dolphin, Pennington Will Face Jets in Opener|author=Crouse, Karen|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|page=D6|date=2008-08-09|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favre made his debut for the Jets against Pennington and the Dolphins in Miami on September 7. Favre threw two touchdown passes for the Jets, while Pennington attempted to rally the Dolphins in the fourth quarter, reaching the Jets' red zone with under a minute to play, before throwing an interception in the end zone to end a 20-14 Jets win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/sports/football/08jets.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=Favre Wins in Debut for Jets|author=Bishop, Greg|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|page=D1|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams met again in the season finale at the Meadowlands with the division title at stake in what was essentially an elimination game. Chad Pennington out dueled Brett Favre (who threw 3 costly interceptions) in leading his Dolphins to a 24-17 win and the team's first AFC East crown since 2000. The loss led the Jets to fire coach [[Eric Mangini]].

The Dolphins in 2009 authored their first sweep of the Jets since 2003, winning 31-27 in Miami and 30-25 in The Meadowlands; in the latter game [[Ted Ginn Jr.]], who'd been demoted to special teams weeks earlier, ran back two kick-returns for touchdowns, accounting for 201 of Miami's 299 return yards. Both wins came with a heavy reliance on the power-running [[Wildcat formation]] - notable because new Jets head coach [[Rex Ryan]], who panned the formation in post-match interviews, then used the formation to re-ignite his team's playoff run. The wins came as the Dolphins were bringing in Miami-area celebrities as part-owners of the club; among them were tennis stars [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]], producer [[Emilio Estefan]] and his pop-star wife [[Gloria Estefan|Gloria]], and actress-singer [[Jennifer Lopez]].

===2010s===
On January 30, 2010, Ryan flashed an [[Finger (gesture)|obscene gesture]] towards heckling  Dolphins fans during a [[Strikeforce]] [[mixed martial arts]] event at [[BankAtlantic Center]] in Sunrise, Florida. Ryan has apologized for his actions, stating that it was &quot;stupid and inappropriate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4875336|title=Jets' Ryan calls incident 'stupid'
|publisher=www.espn.com|date=2010-02-01|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan was fined $50,000 by the Jets for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2010/02/02/2010-02-02_new_york_jets_fine_head_coach_rex_ryan_50000_for_giving_middle_finger_to_fans_in.html New York Jets fine head coach Rex Ryan $50,000 for giving middle finger to Dolphins fans in Florida] [[New York Daily News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2010, longtime Dolphin [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] signed with the Jets. Taylor was known for his derogatory comments about the Jets during his tenure in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2009/11/jason-taylor-jets-fans-take-the-cl-out-of-class/1 | work=USA Today | title=Jason Taylor: 'Jets fans take the 'cl' out of class' | date=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2010, strength and conditioning coach [[Sal Alosi]] was caught by [[CBS Sports]] cameras as he tripped Dolphins player [[Nolan Carroll]] as he ran along the sideline on a kick return.  He was fined $25,000 by the Jets and suspended for the remainder of the season; the suspension was extended to indefinitely after it was discovered that he had instructed inactive Jets players to line up along the sideline so as to potentially impede opposing players. &lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/early-lead/2010/12/jets_suspend_coach_sal_alosi_i.html Jets suspend coach Sal Alosi indefinitely because of new information], Washington Post, December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   Later on December 30, The Jets was fined $100,000 by the NFL for violating league rules in the Alosi incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81d543b6/article/tripped-up-nfl-docks-jets-100000-for-sideline-incident Tripped up: NFL docks Jets $100,000 for sideline incident], NFL.com news, December 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
