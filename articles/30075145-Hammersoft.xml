'''Vercelli railway station''' ({{lang-it|Stazione di Vercelli}}) is the [[central station|main station]] serving the city and ''[[comune]]'' of [[Vercelli]], in the [[Piedmont]] [[Regions of Italy|region]], [[Northwest Italy|northwestern Italy]].  Opened in 1856, it forms part of the [[TurinâMilan railway|TurinâMilan]] railway, and is also a [[junction (rail)|junction station]] for two other lines, to [[Valenza railway station|Valenza]] and [[Pavia railway station|Pavia]], respectively.

The station is currently managed by [[Rete Ferroviaria Italiana]] (RFI).  However, the commercial area of the [[station building|passenger building]] is managed by [[Centostazioni]].  Train services are operated by [[Trenitalia]].  Each of these companies is a subsidiary of [[Ferrovie dello Stato]] (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.

==Location==
Vercelli railway station is situated at Piazza Roma, at the northwestern edge of the city centre.

==History==
The station was opened on 20 October 1856, upon the opening of the [[Torino Porta Susa railway station|Torino Porta Susa]]â[[Novara railway station|Novara]] section of the TurinâMilan railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;trenidicarta.it&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Alessandro Tuzza and others| url=http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html| title=Prospetto cronologico dei tratti di ferrovia aperti all'esercizio dal 1839 al 31 dicembre 1926| trans_title=Chronological overview of the features of the railways opened between 1839 and 31 December 1926|work=[http://www.trenidicarta.it Trenidicarta.it] |publisher=Alessandro Tuzza| accessdate=16 December 2010}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The passenger building is made up of three components: the central part has two levels and a large lobby consisting of five arches.  The single storey lateral wings spread symmetrically from the central part, and are smaller. The building is made of brick.  It is painted grey at ground floor level, and a rose colour above that level.
