'''Piges''' is a [[Charleroi Metro]] station, located in [[Dampremy]] (part of the [[Charleroi]] municipality), in fare zone 1. The station is built on a viaduct and is accessed through escalators and stairs from a street entrance located on ''ChaussÃ©e de Bruxelles'' (Brussels Road).

Although the station is built on a viaduct, tracks enter a tunnel at its western end, as they pass under a [[spoil tip]] (''Terril des Piges'') toward [[Dampremy (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Dampremy]].

A tram line to [[Gosselies]] starts at the station. While it's currently only used by trams from/to the [[Jumet]] garage, works are in progress to open it to commercial passenger service.

== Nearby points of interest ==

Station surroundings are sparsely populated (lower part of the ''ChaussÃ©e de Bruxelles'') and do not feature important points of interest, which explains the low passenger flow through the station.

== Transfers ==
