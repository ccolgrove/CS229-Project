The '''Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team''' ({{lang-bs|Nogometna/Fudbalska reprezentacija Bosne i Hercegovine}}; in Cyrillic: ÐÐ¾Ð³Ð¾Ð¼ÐµÑÐ½Ð°/Ð¤ÑÐ´Ð±Ð°Ð»ÑÐºÐ° ÑÐµÐ¿ÑÐµÐ·ÐµÐ½ÑÐ°ÑÐ¸ÑÐ° ÐÐ¾ÑÐ½Ðµ Ð¸ Ð¥ÐµÑÑÐµÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ð½Ðµ) is the national [[football (soccer)|football]] team of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], governed by the [[Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Until 1992, Bosnian-Herzegovinian players played for the [[Yugoslavia national football team]]. 

The independent Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team has never qualified for a major tournament since its debut attempt for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], but has come close on more than one occasion. Most notably the national team played against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in both [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Second Round|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification play-offs]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jubilant Bosnians book play-off place&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Jubilant Bosnians book play-off place | accessdate=October 10, 2009 | date = October 10, 2009 | publisher=UEFA.com | url = http://www1.en.uefa.com/worldcup/matches/season=2010/round=15218/match=301803/report/index.html#jubilant+bosnians+book+play+place}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Draw for the UEFA EURO 2012 play-offs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Draw for the UEFA EURO 2012 play-offs |author=UEFA.com | date = October 13, 2011| url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1695932.html#draw+uefa+euro+2012+play+offs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia and Herzegovina plays most of their home matches at a 15,600 capacity [[Bilino Polje|Bilino Polje Stadium]] in the city of [[Zenica]]. In a period stretching from April 1996 to September 2006, Bosnia were undefeated at home in [[Zenica]]. During [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification â UEFA Group 5|2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]], Bosnia and Herzegovina national team played all their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification â UEFA Group 5|First Round]] home matches at this stadium, losing only once, to current [[UEFA Euro 2008|European]] and soon to be [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Champion]]; [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. The larger [[Asim FerhatoviÄ Hase Stadium]] in the city of [[Sarajevo]], is the secondary home stadium of the national side.

Bosnia and Herzegovina's first ever [[FIFA]] international victory came against [[FIFA World Cup 1994]] runners-up [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 6 November 1996. The national teams highest [[FIFA World Ranking]] was 21st in October 2011, 14th in UEFA Zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zmajevi su 21. reprezentacija na svijetu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Zmajevi su 21. reprezentacija na svijetu |author=Sarajevo-x.com | date = October 19, 2011| url = http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/111019037 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
=== Pre-independence ===
The game reached Bosnia and Herzegovina at the start of the 20th century, with [[Mostar]] the first city to embrace it in 1905. [[Sarajevo]], [[Banja Luka]], [[Tuzla]], [[Zenica]] and [[BihaÄ]] were next along with numerous smaller towns as the sport spread. The country was under [[Austro-Hungarian]] rule when official competition began in 1908, though these activities were on a small scale within each territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=bih/profile/index.html |publisher=''Uefa.com''|author=Uefa.com |title=Bosnian standards continue to rise |date=February 21, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfsbih.net/Savez.aspx |publisher=''nfsbih.net''|author=nfsbih |title=Hronologija Razvoja Saveza|date=January 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of [[World War I]], there were four clubs in [[Sarajevo]] and approximately 20 outside the capital. The creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] post 1918 brought an increase in the number of leagues, and soon a domestic national championship was organised featuring two teams from Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1920, the direct predecessor of the football federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina was founded as the Sarajevo football subassociation. The unified championship ran until 1939/40.

The [[Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was founded after the [[Second World War]], being affiliated to the [[Yugoslav Football Association]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina's best sides played in the Yugoslavian first, second and third divisions with moderate success.

===The Bosnian War post-independence (1992â1995)===
Shortly after Bosnia and Herzegovina's [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|independence from Yugoslavia]], at the outbreak of [[Bosnian War]], a selection of Bosnia and Herzegovina players under the name &quot;Bosnia-Herzegovina Humanitarian Stars&quot; took part in humanitarian friendly matches away from home versus [[K.R.C. Genk]] and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] during 1992/93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUWtNq6z6Nc&amp; |publisher=''YouTube''|author=Australautern |title=Betze Legends 1992: 1.FC Kaiserslautern vs. Bosnia Herzegovina |date=August 22, 2009 |accessdate=2005-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As result, [[BlaÅ¾ SliÅ¡koviÄ]] became the first ever captain to lead the Bosnia and Herzegovina national side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/090531092 |publisher=''sarajevo-x.com''|author=Edin IsanoviÄ |title=Prve utakmice bh. reprezentacije|date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/100309007 |publisher=''Sarajevo-x.com''|author=Edin IsanoviÄ |title=SuÅ¡iÄ, SliÅ¡koviÄ, Å koro i drugi poÄeli stvaranje reprezentacije |date=March 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-09 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Bosnia and Herzegovina football team played their first match against another national team, and it took place in [[Tehran]] against [[Iran national football team|Iran]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina won 3:1.&lt;ref name=&quot;eloratings.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eloratings.net/Bosnia_Herz.htm |publisher=''eloratings.net''|author=eloratings.net |title=World Football Elo Ratings: Bosnia and Herzegovina |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the result was never registered as Bosnia and Herzegovina was not yet a member of [[FIFA]].

The team's first [[FIFA]] recognised friendly match, coming just nine days after the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]] brought an end to the [[Bosnian War]], was played in [[Tirana]] against [[Albania national football team|Albania]] on 30 November 1995. Bosnia and Herzegovina was granted provisional [[FIFA]] membership to play this game. All the gear needed to play was borrowed. Bosnia and Herzegovina lost 2:0. The starting eleven playing under head coach [[Fuad MuzuroviÄ]] at that friendly contest were: Ismir Pintol, [[Vedin MusiÄ]], [[Ibrahim Duro]], [[Muhamed KonjiÄ]], Senad BegiÄ, NedÅ¾ad FazlagiÄ, Esmir DÅ¾afiÄ, [[Enes DemiroviÄ]], [[Husref MusemiÄ]], Asim HrnjiÄ, and [[Almir TurkoviÄ]].

===The 1st generation in the making (1996â2002)===
In July 1996 Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of [[FIFA]]. In doing so Bosnia and Herzegovina became the only nation in the world in the modern times to first become a member of the World football organisation [[FIFA]] followed by becoming member of its continental organisation, [[UEFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfsbih.net/savez.aspx?id=H1995 |publisher=''nfsbih.net''|author=nfsbih |title=Hronologija Razvoja Saveza|date=January 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 1996 Bosnia and Herzegovina made their UEFA debut going down 3:0 versus [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in the qualifying match for [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. [[UEFA]] affiliation came in 1998 in [[Dublin]].

Bosnia and Herzegovina's first qualifying attempt for any major tournament saw them grouped with [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and two former Yugoslav republics [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] and [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] during qualifiers for the [[Football World Cup 1998 (qualification UEFA)#Table|1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina finished the group in fourth position, having beaten [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] both home and away as well as beating [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 3:0 at home. The Bosnia and Herzegovina home game against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] was played at [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]] in [[Bologna]] due to high tensions between the two countries at the time. [[Fuad MuzuroviÄ]] therefore led the team at it's first qualifying campaign.

[[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying Group 9|UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying campaign]] was the one to forget as [[MiÅ¡o SmajloviÄ]]âs Bosnia and Herzegovina side only managed to win 3 games from 10 played. The results were [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] (two losses), [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] (two losses), [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] (one win, one loss), [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] (one win, one loss), [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] (one win, one draw).

Miraculously team managed to conclude the qualifiers in the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying Group 9|third place]] with equal amount of total points with [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] and [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] but with better head-to-head record.

In April 25, 2000 Bosnia and Herzegovina played a humanitarian game for Bosnian orphans against FIFA World Stars XI in front of 25,000 people at the [[Asim FerhatoviÄ Hase Stadium|KoÅ¡evo Stadium]] in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-paul.net/baggio/english/prevupdates/200004.html |publisher=''pro-paul.net''|author=pro-paul.net |title=FIFA World Stars XI beat Bosnia|date=April 26, 2000 |accessdate=2000-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game finished 0:1 in favour of the Stars through a [[Roberto Baggio]] penalty. [[Dunga]] and [[Ali Daei]] also made appearances for the World XI.

In the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification â UEFA Group 7|World Cup 2002 qualifying round]], the Bosnians continued the bad form and finished in fourth place, behind [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and [[Israel national football team|Israel]] having only beaten [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] both home and away. After this campaign [[BlaÅ¾ SliÅ¡koviÄ]] was named to replace coach [[MiÅ¡o SmajloviÄ]].

===Bosnians' bid ends in tears (UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying)===
In the qualifying campaign for [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 2|Euro 2004]], only one goal in the last home game against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] separated the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team from qualifying directly to the finals in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1579/match=69314/postmatch/report/index.html#denmark+just+enough |publisher=''Uefa.com''|author=Uefa.com |title=Denmark do just enough|date=October 12, 2003 |accessdate=2003-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team ended the qualifiers in fourth position, with the same amount of won games as the other three teams. Denmark won the group, although Bosnia and Herzegovina took 4 points from them in two head to head matches.

The qualifying campaign for [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 2|Euro 2004]] did not start brightly as [[BlaÅ¾ SliÅ¡koviÄ]]âs men lost a home game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] who scored all three goals of the game in the first half, which followed with a loss to [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in [[Oslo]] to mark the end of qualifiers in 2002 for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In March the following year team beat [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] and came out with a stunning 2:0 win versus [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]]. [[Romania national football team|Romania]] however proved too strong once again for the Bosnians scoring once in each half to prevail in [[Craiova]].

In September 2003 Bosnia and Herzegovina pulled another great result thanks to [[Zlatan BajramoviÄ]]'s 87th minute strike to lead his country to victory over the solid [[Norway national football team|Norwegians]] in [[Zenica]]. This followed with a reverse victory in [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] with [[Sergej Barbarez]] scoring the only goal of the game in first half. Thanks to this victory Bosnia climbed to third on the table with 12 points, two points short of both [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. At this point [[Romania national football team|Romania]] completed their qualifying campaign and awaited results from the final round of matches. [[Norway national football team|Norwegians]] were placed fourth, but had a home game against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in the last round.

This meant that Bosnia with a victory over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in the last round in [[Sarajevo]] could top the group and qualify directly for [[Euro 2004]] in [[Portugal]]. Any other result meant finishing fourth as [[Norway national football team|Norway]] were sure to beat the minnows Luxembourg. [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] on the other side needed a draw to come through as group winners.

In the final match, the Bosnian team fell behind to a [[Martin JÃ¸rgensen]]'s 12th minute goal, stunning the crowd of just over 35,000 spectators. In reply, [[Emir Spahic]]âs long pass was met by [[Hasan Salihamidzic]] who crossed the ball into the penalty area from the right side, with [[Elvir BoliÄ]] promptly heading in the equaliser in the 39th minute ensuring it was all to play for in the second half. However, both teams could not score again as it finished a heartbreaking 1:1 home draw for the Bosnians, who although played to win the group, had to settle for a fourth place finish instead. [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] themselves finished with 10 men after [[Thomas Gravesen]] was sent off for his second bookable offence seconds before the end of match. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1579/match=69314/postmatch/report/index.html#denmark+just+enough |publisher=''Uefa.com''|author=Uefa.com |title=Denmark do just enough|date=October 12, 2003 |accessdate=2003-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finishing third (World Cup 2006 qualifying)===
In the [[Football World Cup 2006 (qualification UEFA)|World Cup 2006 qualifying round]], the Bosnians continued to play good football when matched against teams like [[Spain national football team|Spain]] (drawing both times), [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] (one win, one loss), and [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (one draw, one loss), but suffered a shock home draw against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] which cost them. Playing against the Serbian team inspires much [[nationalism|national pride]], as is common with any match that features two former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics. Against Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina drew at home but lost the crucial second leg in [[Belgrade]] with a score 1â0. Bosnia and Herzegovina was hoping to finish in atleast second position with an away win over their Eastern neighbours and hoping Spain to lose. Both matches had extra precautions employed by officials to prevent [[nationalistic]] rioting. Disturbances occurred anyway and [[UEFA]] fined both football federations. Bosnia and Herzegovina finished third in the group four points behind second placed Spain.

In August of 2007, the national team played a friendly match in [[Sarajevo]] against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. The result was [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team results#Friendly 13|3:5]] in favour of the Croatians. [[Zlatan MuslimoviÄ]] scored a hat-trick of goals for the Bosnians in the game.

===The golden generation - Portugal play-offs (2008âPresent)=== 
After the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification â UEFA Group 7|World Cup 2006 qualifying round]], much was expected of the Bosnia and Herzegovina squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|2008 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina opened their race for the tournament with a 5-2 victory over minnows [[Malta national football team|Malta]] playing away. However, major disappointing results followed with losses to [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[Greece national football team|Greece]] on home soil, and an unexpected draw with [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] in [[Chisinau]]. With hopes of finishing in the top two fading, major changes in the team took place. Coach [[Fuad MuzuroviÄ]] was placed as an interim coach before a long term replacement was to be found for now departed [[BlaÅ¾ SliÅ¡koviÄ]]. In addition to this change, 13 first team players protested against the [[Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by refusing to play for the national team until four FA officials â [[Milan JeliÄ]], Iljo DominkoviÄ, Sulejman ÄolakoviÄ, and Ahmet PaÅ¡aliÄ â resigned &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/clanak/061031019 | title = Reprezentativci BiH neÄe igrati dok ne odu JeliÄ, DominkoviÄ, ÄolakoviÄ i PaÅ¡aliÄ| publisher = Sarajevo-X | date = 31 October 2006 | accessdate = 31 August 2010 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As result, [[Fuad MuzuroviÄ]] had to rebuild the national team from scratch. This allowed for the next generation of players to come in. Players like [[Senijad IbriÄiÄ]], [[Edin DÅ¾eko]], [[Vedad IbiÅ¡eviÄ]] and [[Sejad SalihoviÄ]], who played in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs|2007 UEFA European Under-21 play-offs vs Czech Republic]], came up through the ranks and commenced their senior careers at this point. 

A team was successfully put together but little was expected of the squad since they did not have enough time to undergo proper preparations for the upcoming qualifying match against the solid [[Norway national football team|Norwegians]]. However, with a stunning upset Bosnia and Herzegovina took advantage of all chances in the game and came away with a 2-1 victory, bringing hopes of qualifying back to life.

After the game against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], Bosnia and Herzegovina continued with two further wins at home, an astounding 3:2 victory against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and a marginal victory against [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. [[Edin DÅ¾eko]] and [[Elvir RahimiÄ]] made debut appearances for the Bosnia and Herzegovina against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in [[Sarajevo]]. After these two games, the Bosnian squad unfortunately entered their second depression state for the qualifiers. A defeat by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and a horrible bitter defeat by [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] at home soil dramatically changed the morale of both the team and the fans. Bosnia and Herzegovina then suffered further defeats against [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], finishing their qualifiers in the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|fourth position]]. Following yet another failed campaign [[Meho Kodro]] was named as a replacement coach for [[Fuad MuzuroviÄ]].

In October 2009, the Bosnia and Herzegovina made their greatest achievement to date in their history by qualifying for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Second Round|UEFA Second Round]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification â UEFA Group 5|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] finishing second with a game to spare in a group won by then European Champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jubilant Bosnians book play-off place&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Jubilant Bosnians book play-off place | accessdate=October 10, 2009 | date = October 10, 2009 | publisher=UEFA.com | url = http://www1.en.uefa.com/worldcup/matches/season=2010/round=15218/match=301803/report/index.html#jubilant+bosnians+book+play+place}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edin DÅ¾eko]] was the top scorer of the group, and achieved equal second place overall in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|Europe section]] with 9 goals, having just been overtaken by [[Theofanis Gekas]] for the first place, who scored 4 goals against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] in their second last game of the qualifiers. Bosnia and Herzegovina played [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the unlucky play-off contest having hit woodwork three times (IbriÄiÄ, DÅ¾eko, MuslimoviÄ) in the first game, and eventually bowed out losing both games by single goal. Along the standard qualification process the team beat Belgium, Estonia and Armenia at both home and away, and drew one game with [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina's manager in these qualifiers was [[Miroslav BlaÅ¾eviÄ]] who also led [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] national team to third place in [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. He replaced [[Meho Kodro]] after only a few months in charge. &lt;ref name=&quot;Kodro fired as Bosnia-Herzegovina boss&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kodro fired as Bosnia-Herzegovina boss |author=uefa | date = May 17, 2008 | url = http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=697282.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] was the only team from [[UEFA]] play-offs to reach knock-out stage of [[FIFA World Cup 2010]], losing to the eventual World Cup Champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]], which shows how difficult opponent it was for Bosnia and Herzegovina to take on in the play-offs.

In October 2011, the national team coached by [[Safet SuÅ¡iÄ]] successfully reached their [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs|second consecutive play-off]] birth during qualification for the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] as they were unable to beat [[France national football team]] in Paris. The Bosnians had to win the game to top [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group D|Group D]] and qualify for the tournament. [[Edin DÅ¾eko]] scored a superb goal and they led 0:1 until the 77th minute when [[Scotland|Scottish]] referee [[Craig Thomson (referee)|Craig Thomson]] awarded a controversial penalty to France. The French leveled the game which meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina finished second, one point behind [[France national football team|France]]. 

As luck (or lack thereof) would have it, Bosnia and Herzegovina was drawn to play [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], who were the 8th ranked team in the world at the time. &lt;ref name=&quot;Draw for the UEFA EURO 2012 play-offs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuÅ¡iÄ and Bento expect to be pushed all the way&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=SuÅ¡iÄ and Bento expect to be pushed all the way |author=Piotr Kozminski | date = October 13, 2011| url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1696025.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a scoreless first leg in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it all came down to a reverse in Portugal four days later. Portugal's [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (two goals) and [[Nani]] both scored as [[Portugal national football team]] went on to record an emphatic 6:2 win and spoil the Bosnian party once again. Bosnia and Herzegovina kept coming back after being 2:0 down after 25 minutes. First [[Zvjezdan MisimoviÄ]] scored in the 41st minute to reduce the score to 2:1 from a penalty kick before [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] again restored a two goal advantage after the interval. At this point, Bosnia and Herzegovina were reduced to ten men as [[Senad LuliÄ]] received two yellow cards in less than a minute; LuliÄ complained to [[Wolfgang Stark]] about Ronaldo's third goal which seemed offside. In the 65th minute, Bosnian captain [[Emir SpahiÄ]], against all odds, reduced the deficit to one goal once again knowing that a scoring draw was all that was required for Bosnia and Herzegovina to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012]]. However, it wasn't to be as the 10-men Bosnia and Herzegovina weren't able to contain the Portuguese onslaught, crashing out 6:2 on the day. &lt;ref name=&quot;Portugal overwhelm ten-man Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Portugal overwhelm ten-man Bosnia and Herzegovina | date = November 15, 2011| url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=2000113/match=2008831/postmatch/report/index.html#portugal+storm+into+finals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani lead Portugal to 6-2 demolition of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Euro 2012 finals&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani lead Portugal to 6-2 demolition of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Euro 2012 finals | date = November 15, 2011| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/portugal/8891786/Cristiano-Ronaldo-and-Nani-lead-Portugal-to-6-2-demolition-of-Bosnia-Herzegovina-and-Euro-2012-finals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home stadiums==

The Bosnia and Herzegovina national team uses a small capacity center called &quot;Kulturno Sportski Centar Famos Hrasnica&quot; located in [[IlidÅ¾a|Hrasnica]] in the city of [[IlidÅ¾a]], a suburb of capital city [[Sarajevo]] for light training sessions ahead of international matches. 

[[Asim FerhatoviÄ Hase Stadium]] is a [[stadium]] owned by the city of [[Sarajevo]]. It is also known as KoÅ¡evo Stadium and formerly Olympic Stadium. The capacity is 37,500. KoÅ¡evo Stadium is located in the KoÅ¡evo neighborhood of [[Sarajevo]] and it is used mostly by [[FK Sarajevo]]. The stadium was opened in the year 1947. In 1984, it was reconstructed for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], and is therefore often called ''Olympic Stadium''. Now, it is officially called &quot;Asim FerhatoviÄ - Hase&quot; since July 2004, after [[Asim FerhatoviÄ]], the legendary FK Sarajevo player who retired in 1967. Today KoÅ¡evo can seat over 37,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcsarajevo.ba/klub.php?o=stadion |publisher=''fcsarajevo''|author=fcsarajevo |title=Stadion Asim Ferhatovic Hase|date=January 15, 2005 |accessdate=2005-01-15 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; though attendance for concerts can be expanded to roughly 80,000, such as for [[U2|U2's]] [[1997 U2 concert in Sarajevo|PopMart Tour]] in 1997 and [[Dino Merlin|Dino Merlin's]] Burek tour in 2004. It is also the home stadium of the national football side of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

[[Bilino Polje]] is the home [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] of [[NK Äelik Zenica|NK Äelik]] from the city of [[Zenica]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and one of two main stadiums of the national football team of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The stadium was built and opened in 1972. It was used in Bosnia and Herzegovina's first match, a friendly played against [[Albania national football team|Albania]] in 1995 with the final result being a 0â0 draw. The stadium is considered a &quot;curse&quot; for foreign national teams, due to the fact that the Bosnian national team usually wins or rarely loses their home games at Bilino Polje stadium. In a period stretching from 1995 to October 2006, Bosnia went undefeated at home in around 15 games played in Zenica. The city of Zenica had to wait another 5 years (1995â2000) before the next match of the national team was played at the stadium. This match was also a friendly, this time against [[Republic of Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], with the final result being a victory for the home side 1â0. The Bosnian national team never lost on this field until the [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] qualifier against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].

=== Nickname(s) ===
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the team is typically referred to as Lilies ({{lang-bs|Ljiljani}}), a reference to the [[Fleur-de-lis]] of the 14th century [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958â1463)|Bosnian Kingdom]] or Dragons ({{lang-bs|Zmajevi}}) which is not a reference to [[Husein GradaÅ¡ÄeviÄ]], a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] [[general]] who fought for autonomy of a Bosniak state in 19th century, even though he is known as Dragon of Bosnia (Dragon is a common [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] [[nickname]] for successful or aspiring men). 
The name Dragons was coined by [[Marjan MijajloviÄ]] a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] sports commentator; first while he worked for [[Sport Klub]] when he was commentating [[FuÃball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] matches in which Bosnian players played, he would call them Zmajevi (Dragons), later when he commentated the game against [[Belgium National Football Team|Belgium]] (during qualifiers for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]), he used this name to refer to the whole team. 

In foreign media, sometimes they are referred to as the ''Golden Lilies''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golden Lilies blossoming&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Golden Lilies blossoming | accessdate=October 10, 2009 | date = April 9, 2009 | publisher=FIFA.com | url = http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid=1046853.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporters ===

[[Image:Bosnia Soccer Fans Georgia Feb2011.jpg|thumb|left|Bosnian fans supporting the national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ybsRoiHlZU |publisher=''YouTube''|author=BHFProduction |title=BHFanaticos - Gdje Ti IgraÅ¡ Tu Smo Mi |date=October 2, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]Large number of national team's supporters come from [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Western Europe]] as well as [[North America]]. Those are mostly former citizens who escaped the [[Bosnian War]] in the 1990s. In away games, these Bosnian supporters come in large numbers, sometimes outnumbering the opposing supporters. In addition support also comes from local football fans, namely &quot;Horde Zla&quot; ([[FK Sarajevo]]), &quot;The Maniacs&quot; ([[FK Å½eljezniÄar Sarajevo]]), &quot;Red Army Mostar&quot; ([[FK VeleÅ¾ Mostar]]), &quot;RobijaÅ¡i&quot; ([[NK Äelik Zenica]]) and &quot;Fukare&quot; ([[FK Sloboda Tuzla]]). Most of these fans are members of BHFanaticos, who are the most loyal supporters of Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team.

These fans travel to all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and across the world in support of the national side. Within the last decade, BHFanaticos have strongly opposed Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina because of suspicions financial matters, among others. For these reasons, national qualifying games were the opportunity for BHF to visually show their opposition by lifting anti FA banners and throwing flares onto the pitch in hope that the federation would be fined. Bosnian rap artist [[Frenkie]] dedicated a song &quot;Rat Savezu&quot; (translated &quot;War on FA&quot;) to the Bosnian Soccer Fans BHFanaticos in their war against the corrupt Bosnian Football Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYOekMg6h8 |publisher=''YouTube''|author=Emir Icius |title=Rat savezu  |date=December 11, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game [[Norway national football team|Norway]] v Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the [[UllevÃ¥l Stadium]] in [[Oslo]] on 24 March 2007, Bosnian fans caused an hour long delay due to an unprecedented amount of flares that had been thrown onto the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOOcNLyFb0 |publisher=''YouTube''|author=BHFanatic1992 |title=BHFanaticos Norveska - Bosna i Herzegovina |date=March 27, 2007 |accessdate=2006-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before every game, during playing of [[DrÅ¾avna himna Bosne i Hercegovine|Bosnian national anthem]], BH Fanaticos sing lyrics from the old national anthem [[Jedna si jedina]] as current national anthem did not have lyrics until recently in all international sports Bosnia is part of (mainly football, basketball and handball). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSQRWBmFU-8&amp; |publisher=''YouTube''|author=BHFProduction |title=Skenderija pjeva, Jedna si jedina |date=June 14, 2008 |accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpr.gov.ba/bs/str.asp?id=375 |title=Proposal of the Text for the National Hymn of BiH Adopted by the Council of Ministers of BiH |author=Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2008, former Bosnia and Herzegovina players [[Meho Kodro]] and [[Elvir BoliÄ]] organised a friendly humanitarian game in Sarajevo called &quot;Kodro, Bola and Friends&quot; between former Bosnian football legends, in order to gain support, to say its time for changes in the Bosnian Football Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/fotogalerija-kodro-bola-i-prijatelji/3121 |publisher=''SportSport.ba''|author=Brza zmija |title=Fotogalerija: Kodro, Bola i prijatelji|date=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-01 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was organised to commence at the same time as Bosnia and Herzegovina national side faced [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] in a friendly in [[Zenica]]. The attendance in [[Sarajevo]] was 15,000 while in [[Zenica]] only about 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/bosna-i-hercegovina---azerbejdzan-10/2982 |publisher=''SportSport.ba''|author=Statler |title=BiH - Azerbejdzan|date=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-01 |language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game in Sarajevo was organised by the Federal TV who broadcast the humanitarian game live.

For team ''Kodro'' the following players played: Sedin TanoviÄ, [[Mirza KapetanoviÄ]], [[Edin MujÄin]], DÅ¾evad Å aÄirbegoviÄ, [[Bulend BiÅ¡ÄeviÄ]], [[Vedin MusiÄ]], [[Anel Karabeg]], [[Senad Repuh]], [[Sergej Barbarez]], [[Meho Kodro]].

==Managers==
===Current coaching staff - Under Safet SuÅ¡iÄ===

On 28 December 2009, SuÅ¡iÄ was named coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-12-29-1927934499_x.htm|title=Safet SuÅ¡iÄ named new Bosnia football coach | work=USA Today | date=29 December 2009 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut was a friendly match against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] in [[Sarajevo]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina won the game 2:1 after goals from [[Vedad IbiÅ¡eviÄ]] and [[Miralem PjaniÄ]]. After only 2 wins in SuÅ¡iÄ's 6 first matches in charge of the national team, including an important 2:0 loss to France in the qualification for [[Euro 2012]], SuÅ¡iÄ came under a lot of criticism from several journalists and columnists who called for his head.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/euro2012/clanak/100908109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scsport.ba/bs/tekst.php?ID=7571&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2011, SuÅ¡iÄ's Bosnia national football side recorded a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team results|7 game unbeaten run]] (beating Albania, Belarus twice, Luxembourg and recording three draws against Greece, France and Portugal), conceding one goal in the process, which led to FIFA rank of 21st in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking  |author=FIFA.com | date = October 19, 2011| url = http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This year team has also beaten Romania. Three losses against Romania, Mexico and Portugal complete all the results for the mentioned year for the SuÅ¡iÄ's Bosnia and Herzegovina national side. It is yet unknown whether the coach will extend his contract beyond 2011.
