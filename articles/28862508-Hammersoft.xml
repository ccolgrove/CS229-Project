'''''Bad Girls Club''''' is an American [[reality television]] series created by [[Jonathan Murray]] for [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. The show centers on seven mischievous and rebellious women with different backgrounds and personalities who have a number of [[psychological]] and behavioral problems. They are introduced to the show to change their pernicious behavior and accomplish specific goals. The cast, deemed &quot;bad girls&quot;, are asked to maintain and respect rules applied to them before enjoying a luxurious mansion and lifestyle for three months. Their lives inside â and outside â of the house are chronicled and recorded by the [[production team]]. 

The format of the show changed from antecedent seasons. If a &quot;bad girl&quot; had broke a rule she will be evicted from the show and will be replaced â if early in the season â by a new &quot;bad girl&quot;. There have been six complete seasons of ''The Bad Girls Club'', with the [[The Bad Girls Club (season 8)|eighth season]] scheduled to air January 23, 2012. The [[The Bad Girls Club (season 4)|fourth season]] had the highest ratings in Bad Girls' history, becoming the show's &quot;breakthrough season&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratings10&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/02/10/more-ratings-highs-for-oxygens-bad-girls-club/41693 |title=More ratings highs for Oxygen's &quot;Bad Girls Club&quot; |author=Robert Seidman |date=10 February 2010 |work=TV By The Numbers |publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Bad Girls Club'' is broadcast in five countries. The show received negative reviews from critics who believe the show promotes violence by adolescents viewers. Several cast-members also made controversial remarks which outraged many viewers. There have been three [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s of ''The Bad Girls Club''. [[Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too]], where alumni cast-members seek true love, has gained high ratings. Oxygen has also released a [[mobile game]], [[comic strip]] and [[merchandise]] to promote the show.

Of the 61 contestants, [[Kerry Harvick]] (of [[The Bad Girls Club (season 1)|season one]]) became a successful [[Country music|country singer]] after the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p684674/biography |title=Kerry Harvick's biography |author=Steve Leggett |date=22 September 2011 |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanisha Thomas (of [[The Bad Girls Club (season 2)|season two]]) later hosted Oxygen's ''OxygenLive!'' and the [[Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too (season 2)|second season]] of &quot;Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too&quot;. Amber Meade, Amber Buell, Sarah Michaels, Kendra Jones, Natalie Nunn, and Lea Beaulieu have competed in the &quot;Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too&quot; series.

== Format ==
The show follows seven rebellious women&lt;ref name=frankel&gt;{{cite web|last=Frankel|first=Danielle|title=Oxygen renews 'Bad Girls Club'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002046|work=Variety|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are between the ages of 21 and 27.&lt;ref name=show&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Mike|title=Oxygen Orders Third Season Of 'Bad Girls'|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/134039-Oxygen_Orders_Third_Season_Of_Bad_Girls_.php|work=multichannel|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They co-exist in a mansion for three months, as cameramen record their behavior in and out of the house. The girls, deemed &quot;bad girls&quot;, come from different backgrounds and have personality, psychological, and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=show/&gt;&lt;ref name=casting8&gt;{{cite web|last=Hwang|first=Kellie|title=Bad Girls Club casting for season 8|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/bars/articles/2011/05/19/20110519bad-girls-club-love-games-casting-tempe-hooters.html|work=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lowry&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=The Bad Girls Club|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932242?refCatId=32|work=Variety|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;bad girls&quot; try to cope with one another and change their promiscuous behavior to become role models for young women. Some cast members try to accomplish specific goals.&lt;ref name=show/&gt;&lt;ref name=monica&gt;{{cite news|last=Hesse|first=Monica|title='Queen Bees': Do You Catch More Eyes With Honey?|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1508559961.html?dids=1508559961:1508559961&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+11%2C+2008&amp;author=Monica+Hesse+-+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc='Queen+Bees'%3A+Do+You+Catch+More+Eyes+With+Honey%3F&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=28 September 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=11 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite news|title=&quot;Bad Girls Club&quot; Reunion Drama|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/24/entertainment/main6329855.shtml|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the show, the &quot;bad girls&quot; must adapt to the frequent mood and behavior changes of their roommates.&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppliger|first=Patrice A.|title=Girls gone skank : the sexualization of girls in American culture|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0786435224|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=First season of 'The Bad Girls Club'|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932242?refCatId=32|work=Variety|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must also obey rules that were presented to them prior to their arrival. If they engage in violence towards other roommates or breach other [[production team]] rules, they may be evicted due to the show's [[zero tolerance]] policy. The &quot;bad girls&quot; must also undergo interviews in the diary room and confessionals.&lt;ref name=format/&gt; 

In most cases, the &quot;bad girls&quot; divide into cliques, create havoc, book parties in night clubs, and shop for groceries while attempting to maintain their personal lives.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; The &quot;bad girls&quot; are allowed to contact their families and friends using a computer connected to a big screen television. 

The use of televisions or cell phones is prohibited in the house. Bullying and &quot;tag teaming&quot; (when multiple cast members intimidate another cast member) are seen throughout the series. On some occasions, a &quot;bad girl&quot; has departed the show because of their detrimental roommates, isolation, growing problems at home, court proceedings, or own [[wikt:Narcissism|narcissism]].&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;&lt;ref name=finn/&gt;

In rare occasions, multiple &quot;bad girls&quot; may wish to leave the show. The only seasons to have multiple cast-members to leave the show were [[The Bad Girls Club (season 1)|season one]] (2006), [[The Bad Girls Club (season 5)|season five]] (2010) and [[The Bad Girls Club (season 6)|season six]] (2011).&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; If a &quot;bad girl&quot; departs early in the season, a &quot;replacement bad girl&quot; is introduced within one or two episodes. In most cases, the &quot;replacement bad girl&quot; is treated reprehensible. In rare occasions, a &quot;replacement bad girl&quot; may leave voluntarily. The only season to have this done was in the fifth season.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; In the [[The Bad Girls Club (season 7)|seventh season]], cast-member Cheyenne Evans was exempted from the show by Tiara Hodge. This became the first event that a &quot;replacement&quot;/&quot;bad girl&quot; is removed from the show involuntarily and not removed from the show by producers.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Bad Girl knows what she wants and how to get it. She makes her own way, makes her own rules and she makes no apologies. A Bad Girl blazes her own trail and removes obstacles from her path. A Bad Girl fights and forces her way to the top with style and beauty. A Bad Girl believes in jumping first and looking later. People will love you. People will hate you. Others will secretly wish to be you. A Bad Girl is you.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bad-girls-club.oxygen.com/about-the-bad-girls-club |title=About the &quot;Bad Girls Club&quot; |author=|date= |work=|publisher=Oxygen.com |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Above is the ''Bad Girls Club'' [[creed]] which was introduced in the [[The Bad Girls Club (season 3)|third season]] of the ''Bad Girls Club''.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

=== Season's 1 and 2 ===
The format for the first season of the ''Bad Girls Club'' was contradistinctive from subsequent seasons.&lt;ref name=julio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=Julio|title=Bad Girls? Or Bad Wast??|journal=Pierce County Herald|date=16 April 2011|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age differences in the cast for season one was 21 and 31. The use of &quot;nicknames&quot; were not introduced until the third season of the ''Bad Girls Club''. Season one also saw the first time that a rare occasion of multiple &quot;replacement bad girls&quot; enters the show.&lt;ref name=julio/&gt;

Although there were distinctiveness in season one, the rules that are currently present in the show's format existed throughout subsequent seasons. Another format that continued was the way the show debuted; which allowed viewers to unfold a physical altercation leading to the first eviction of the season.&lt;ref name=julio/&gt;

In the [[The Bad Girls Club (season 2)|second season]], the format of the show changed drastically.&lt;ref name=julio/&gt; The maximum age requirements to apply dropped from 35 to 27. The cast of season two were given mandatory [[Voluntary association|non-profit job]]s to help them build a [[work ethic]] along with stability of being dependent on others, such as [[teamwork]] and commitment for success in later life.&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=James|title=Ratings Success for Oxygen's Bad Girls Club|journal=The Cheney Free Press|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, [[decision making]], and build [[cooperation]]. Season two became the first and only season of the ''Bad Girls Club'' to perform this and also was the final season to air 30-minute episodes.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

=== Live shows ===
On August 3, 2010, during the OxygenLive TV recap episode, the show combined Facebook and Twitter with a live broadcast. Fans submited opinions and comments about the show and its cast which were aired during the 10 p.m hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;#1show&quot;/&gt; 

In January 2011, Oxygen released ''OxygenLive!'' an [[online show|online]] [[talk show]] hosted by Tanisha Thomas (of season two). It was broadcast after [[The Bad Girls Club (season 6)|season six]] debuted on Oxygen. The talk show centered the cast of season six and occasionally alumni &quot;bad girls&quot;. Thomas asked several questions to the girls to prompt rumors and confessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxygenlive.com/ |title=OxygenLive.com |author=|date= |work=|publisher=Oxygen.com |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season 4 ===

Nunn told Anderson that [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] was at a night club that Nunn wanted to attend. She also asked Anderson if she was a fan. Anderson replied that she wasn't because of the [[Chris Brown (American singer)#Domestic violence case|domestic violence case]] that Brown was involved in.

During the episode &quot;The Wicked Witch Of Key West&quot;, Kristen Kelly was at a bar with Christina Marie Hopkins. While there, a stranger offered to buy drinks for the two girls. While doing so, the guy added [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] hypnotic sleeping pills which made Kelly to be [[Toxication|intoxicated]]. Kelly claimed she suffered bruises on her body when the guy grabbed her and handled her roughly. Kelly also reported that the producers of the show did not want to air the guy on television in order from being sued.
