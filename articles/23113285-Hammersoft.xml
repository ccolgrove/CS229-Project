'''''Welcome to the Masquerade''''' is the fifth studio album by Canadian [[hard rock]] band [[Thousand Foot Krutch]]. It was released on September 8, 2009. [[Trevor McNevan]], the band's frontman has stated, &quot;Yeah, I think the new record is definitely more aggressive. In some areas, it's the heaviest we've ever been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/Interviews/FMStatic2009.asp|title=Trevor McNevan Interview|publisher=Jesusfreakhideout.com|date=April 19, 2009|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album entered the Billboard top 200 at No. 35  and the Christian Album charts at No. 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard thousand foot krutch&quot; /&gt;

==Musical style and concept==
&quot;The inspiration behind the album comes from people hiding things in their life,&quot; McNevan has stated, &quot;Masquerading through life, hiding their frustrations.&quot;

&quot;Each song is kind of dealing with those different situations. Some of it is just saying, âIâve been through this, and this is how I found hope in this situation.&quot;

&quot;A lot of our peers are getting a little poppier, and I understand that and appreciate it,&quot; stated McNevan. &quot;I just felt like for us, it was the right time to step in the other direction. Itâs big crunchy rock and roll.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/1301/Trevor-McNevan-Talks-About-His-Double-Life |title=Trevor McNevan Talks About His Double Life |publisher=AlternativeAddiction.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

âBetween the economy and everything else, this is as good a time as has ever been to drop our stereotypes â all the stuff that separates us â and get down to the black and white of loving people as God intended it to be,â McNevan suggests.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearitfirst.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hearitfirst.com/artisthome.aspx?f=artisthome&amp;artist_id=1296 |title=Christian Music, Christian Music Video, Christian Music News |publisher=Hear It First |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guests==
''Welcome to the &quot;Masquerade'' features multiple performers. [[Aaron Sprinkle]] returned as the band's producer, from producing the band's previous record ''[[Phenomenon]]'', alongside Trevor McNevan. Matt Carter of [[Emery]] assisted with McNevan early in 2009. [[Phil X]], who had recorded guitars for the two previous Thousand Foot Krutch records, did not return for this album. However, Randy Torres recorded &quot;some sweet licks&quot; on the record according to a Tooth &amp; Nail podcast. Guitar duties were also shared by McNevan, Sprinkle and a third guest [[Pete Stewart]], who recorded the guitar solo near the end of the song &quot;Fire it Up&quot;. Stewart surprisingly entered the studio with TFK despite the fact that he no longer considers himself a Christian. The band additionally hired Randy Staub to mix &quot;Welcome to the Masquerade&quot;; Staub is famous for mixing [[Metallica]]'s record ''[[Metallica (album)|The Black Album]]''.

==Reception==
&quot;[[Fire It Up (Thousand Foot Krutch song)|Fire It Up]]&quot; has already been praised as a hit with a similar potential to &quot;[[Rawkfist]]&quot; and &quot;[[Move (TFK Song)|Move]]&quot; with Tyler Hess of ChristianMusicZine.com describing it as &quot;vintage Thousand Foot Krutch, with obvious arena play potential&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearitfirst.com&quot;/&gt;

C.E. Moore of TheChristianManifesto.com described the song &quot;as everything you've come to love about the band. It's a raucous number that will get your heart pumping, your feet moving, and your head banging. 'Fire It Up' fires on all cylinders.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hearitfirst.com&quot;/&gt;

Roger Gelwicks of Jesusfreakhideout praised the album on his review &quot;TFK dons a more produced approach to hard rock this time around while at the same time maintaining the unrestrained and raucous vibe the band is known for. And this being the fifth album from the Canadian band, there's a progression here that many old and new fans have waited to hear,&quot; he stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/WelcomeToTheMasquerade.asp |title=Thousand Foot Krutch, &quot;Welcome To The Masquerade&quot; Review |publisher=Jesusfreakhideout.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allmusic.com also had high praise for the album &quot;the band's full-scale audio assault makes it difficult to imagine that they could ever top the crystal-clear production and deliberate crunch of Masquerade. Each track is propelled by muscular riffs, fighting its way into permanent memory alongside the greatest mainstream rock bands of the decade,&quot; their review states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1629553|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Fire It Up&quot; has peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard Rock charts while &quot;[[Bring Me To Life(Thousand Foot Krutch)|Bring Me to Life]]&quot; has peaked at number No. 2 on Christian Rock radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard.com&quot;&gt;http://www.billboard.com/#/artist/thousand-foot-krutch/438426&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Forward Motion&quot; has reached No. 48 on the Billboard Christian Songs charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard.com&quot;/&gt;
