Its members were signed to [[major record label]] [[EMI Records]] and afterwards released their self-titled debut album ''[[Junoon (Junoon album)|Junoon]]'' in 1991.&lt;ref name=Junoon-Interview/&gt; After two years, the band recorded their second album ''[[Talaash]]'' (1993) with their new bassist [[Brian O'Connell (musician)|Brian O'Connell]] after [[Nusrat Hussain]] left the band. The release of their second album began to create a cult following for the band. In 1996, Junoon released their third album ''[[Inquilaab]]'', and it was only then that Junoon developed a nationwide fan following, with blending rock guitars and bluesy vocals with eastern elements like the use of [[tabla]]s, raga-inspired melodies, traditional [[folk music|Pakistani folk music]], and Eastern inspired poetry.&lt;ref name=Junoon-Interview/&gt; The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed ''[[Azadi (album)|Azadi]]'' (1997), being the band's first international record deal, and making it Junoon's debut album in [[India]]. The band went on to record and release ''[[Parvaaz]]'' in 1999. The band found renewed success and popularity starting with 2001's ''[[Andaz (album)|Andaz]]'' and through 2003's ''[[Dewaar]]'' and their supporting tours. 

After the release of their seventh studio album, vocalist Ali Azmat and lead guitarist Salman Ahmad went on to pursue a career as a solo singer, while bassist Brian O' Connell returned to his native [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nadeemfparacha.wordpress.com/2006/12/24/a-band-is-dead-long-live-music/ A band is dead.

In 2010, Junoon released the soundtrack album ''[[Rock &amp; Roll Jihad]]'' based on Salman Ahmad and Junoon's musical journey throughout the years.

==History==
===Early years (1980â1989)===
Junoon's roots stretch back to [[Tappan, New York]], in the 1970s. [[Salman Ahmad]] left [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]], for New York with his family when he was eleven, and received his baptism in [[rock music]] when a friend offered him a ticket to a [[Led Zeppelin]] concert. Salman Ahmad was so enthralled by the show that he saved $235 to buy his own [[electric guitar]]. He also befriended [[Brian O'Connell (musician)|Brian O'Connell]] in Tappan, another young aspiring musician, with whom Ahmad formed their first band together by the name of &quot;Eclipse&quot;. Before the two friends could take their aspirations out of the basement and onto a bigger stage, Salman Ahmad's parents moved back to Pakistan in 1981, and Salman began to study medicine at Lahore's [[King Edward Medical College|King Edward's Medical College]].&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography&gt;[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003880/Junoon.html Junoon - Biography] Retrieved on May 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/prof-rock-star-urges-muslim-students-in-queens-to-rock-out/#more-161771 âProf. Rock Starâ Urges Muslim Students in Queens to Rock Out] Retrieved on July 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[Nusrat Hussain]], by then the lead guitarist of the band [[Vital Signs (band)|Vital Signs]], after composing the song &quot;[[Dil Dil Pakistan]]&quot; parted ways with Vital Signs and suggested [[Rohail Hyatt]], founder and keyboardist of Vital Signs, to bring [[Salman Ahmad]] as his replacement in the band. Vital Signs then went on to record their debut album at the [[EMI Studios]] in [[Karachi]], but almost all the songs were written and composed at Salman Ahmad's residence where the band had been lodged. In March 1989, the band released their debut album, ''[[Vital Signs 1]]'', which was a success throughout the country. The following year, Salman Ahmad parted ways with the most successful pop band of [[Pakistan]] as he wanted a change in the band's music for their second album and therefore after leaving the band he went on to form his own band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chowk.com/articles/10653 Vital Signs: A Personal History] Retrieved on August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; First, he recruited singer [[Ali Azmat]] from the [[Jupiters]] and then the former Vital Signs lead guitarist, Nusrat Hussain, on keyboards.

===Formation (1990â1993)===
[[File:Junoon-rehearse.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Junoon, during its early days, rehearsing before a concert. Visible from left to right are; Ustad Ashiq Ali Mir and [[Salman Ahmad]].]]Junoon formed in 1990 when Salman Ahmad, founder, songwriter and lead guitarist, had a dream where one of his teachers shook him and said &quot;Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!&quot; (You have an obsession for music!).&lt;ref name=Junoon-Bio&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/artist/junoon/bio/338514#/artist/junoon/bio/338514 Junoon Biography &amp; Awards] Retrieved on May 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Junoon-Interview&gt;[http://www.junoon.com/articles/art_52_musicworld_may6.html Salman Ahmad â Interview] Retrieved on June 05, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Junoon were not an over night success, the band members struggled for the first few years. Their self-titled debut album, ''[[Junoon (Junoon album)|Junoon]]'', recorded at the [[EMI Studios]] in [[Karachi]] barely made a dent in the [[Pakistani music]] industry when released in September 1991.&lt;ref name=Junoon-Interview/&gt; After the release of their debut album, Nusrat Hussain parted ways with the band to pursue his own career as a solo singer and went on to release his debut solo album ''[[Amrit]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofpia.com/people62.htm Capt. Nusrat Hussain] Retrieved on July 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After the departure of Nusrat Hussain, Salman Ahmad contacted [[Brian O'Connell (musician)|Brian O'Connell]] and invited him to play bass on the band's second album. Brian O'Connell quit his job as a social worker and traveled 10,000 miles to [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], where he reunited with his old friend. It was after ten years both the friends reunited.&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography/&gt; In 1992, the band started working on their second [[studio album]]. The album was recorded and mixed at Tahir Gul Hasan's Sound On Sound recording studios in Karachi. While working on their second album at one side, on the other hand the band also featured in a television series, ''[[Talaash (TV series)|Talaash]]'', directed by [[Atiqa Odho]] and written by [[Anwar Maqsood]], based on the true story of the band in which the band members acted themselves and due to its novel storyline it became an extremely popular television series in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzFU3DMCqcE&amp;feature=related Talaash PTV Show] Retrieved on July 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The television series were aired on [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]]. 

On September 23, 1993, Junoon released their second album ''[[Talaash]]'' which began to create a cult of a following for the band. Singles from the album, such as &quot;[[Talaash (song)|Talaash]]&quot;, were politically influenced and became subject to censorship, which led to the eventual ban from all state run television and radio during the rule of by then the Pakistani Prime Minister, [[Nawaz Sharif]].

===Rise to fame (1994â1997)===
In 1994, Junoon started working on their third studio album. In 1995, the band released their first compilation album, ''[[Kashmakash]]'', which is believed to be the very first compilation album by a band in [[Pakistan]]. Junoon were courted for the controversial video release of the single &quot;[[Ehtesaab]]&quot;, from ''Kashmakash'', which included footage of a polo pony eating in a posh restaurant. Many thought that the image was an indictment of the corrupt [[Pakistan]]i political elite, and especially of former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=F5_VlFyCIBgC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Ehtesaab%22+%28political+accountability%29#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ehtesaab%22%20%28political%20accountability%29&amp;f=false Rock &amp; Roll Jihad] Retrieved on July 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The government quickly responded to it and banned the song and video from the state television.&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography/&gt; In 1996, the band released their third studio album, ''[[Inquilaab]]'', which was recorded and engineered with a completely new sound at Aamir Hasan Studios, ''[[Inquilaab]]'' was a blend of western music with classical eastern sufi music. It was the release of their third album when Junoon started to gain success and began to reach a wider audience when one of their singles, &quot;[[Jazba-e-Junoon]]&quot;, became the signature song of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography/&gt; 
[[File:Junoon-cdazadi.jpg|thumb|left|250px| Junoon's fourth studio album, ''[[Azadi (album)|Azadi]]'', hit platinum sales for which the band received a platinum certification. The album was a huge success in [[South Asia]], being Junoon's highest selling album.]] 
Following the success of their third album release, the following year Junoon went on their first full-scale tour of the [[United States]], performing from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], to [[Los Angeles]] where they appeared at the [[House of Blues]]&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography/&gt; and from there to [[Roosevelt Hotel (New York)|New York's Roosevelt Hotel]], which featured in ''[[Newsweek Magazine]]''. They also went on tour to [[Canada]] and the [[UAE]] through which Junoon's fame grew rapidly. In September 1997, Junoon released their fourth studio album, ''[[Azadi (album)|Azadi]]'', which was the band's first international record deal after the band manager, Shehryar Ahmad, secured a deal with [[EMI]]/[[Virgin Records]] and making it their debut album in [[India]]. Within three months of the release of ''Azadi'', the album had sold over half a million copies and hit platinum sales status in a record of four weeks.&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/old/may08/music4.htm Junoon's album Azadi hits platinum in record time] Retrieved on April 1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The music video of the first single, &quot;[[Sayonee]]&quot;, was shot by Asim Reza which became an instant hit in [[South Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], shooting to the top of all the Asian charts, and staying at #1 on both [[Channel V]] and [[MTV Asia]] for over two months.

Later that year, Junoon went on their first Indian tour. The band's first concert was held in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. After traveling throughout the country, Junoon saw crowds of as many as of 50,000 fans at different venues. The band was courted for a controversy during their tour to India by the Pakistani government. The Indian government was testing nuclear devices at that time, and [[Salman Ahmad]] suggested that the Indian and Pakistani leaders should spend more on education and health and less on weapons.&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography/&gt; This led to a prolonged ban on Junoon's music by the Pakistani government. [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]], the Pakistan state television, refused to show the audience even clips from Junoon releases. The Ministry of Culture charged Junoon with making comments in India amounting to sedition and treason. The band members denied these charges, reminding people of the fact that they had been victimised since the release of &quot;Ehtesaab&quot; because they chose to speak out against political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Salil | last=Subedi | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Songs of Freedom | date= 16 March 2001 | publisher=The Nepali Times | url =http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2001/03/16/Leisure/8290| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2001-03-16 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junoon performs a blend of western music and classical eastern poetry. Junoon aimed to combine loud guitar riffs with the tranquility of sufi poetry by the likes of [[Rumi|Maulana Rumi]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Bulleh Shah]] and [[Allama Iqbal]].&lt;ref name=Junoon-Interview/&gt; Their music has been based on worldly issues and to have peace in the world. Their music has been one major force which has truly kept the national spirits high amidst the prevailing social woes which have surely worsened in the last three decades. Songs like &quot;[[Jazba-e-Junoon]]&quot;, &quot;[[Talaash (song)|Talaash]]&quot;, &quot;Main Kaun Hoon&quot; and &quot;[[Sayonee]]&quot; are examples. Their music has been captivating to the Pakistani youth for over ten years and have been the only saving grace of Pakistani music internationally after the departure of groups like [[Vital Signs (band)|Vital Signs]] and [[Nazia and Zoheb]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 28-11-1997, [http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/28/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-344290.html?scp=6&amp;sq=Junoon&amp;st=cse Pop and Jazz Guide] Retrieved on May 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Junoon's music has also been compared by some critics with the likes of [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] and [[Lata Mangeshkar]]. 

While the music of Junoon is centered around a male lead singer, the band has also featured some female vocals on their albums ever since their self-titled debut release ''[[Junoon (Junoon album)|Junoon]]''.

===Live performances===

As the band started to gain success after the release of their third studio album ''[[Inquilaab]]'', Junoon went on their first full scale tour of the [[United States]], performing from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], to [[Los Angeles]] where the appeared at the [[House of Blues]]&lt;ref name=Junoon-Biography/&gt; and from there to [[Roosevelt Hotel (New York)|New York's Roosevelt Hotel]], which featured in ''[[Newsweek Magazine]]''. 

[[File:Junoonthree.jpg|thumb|left|250px| Junoon performing live at the [[Channel V|Channel V Music Awards]] in 1998.]]During the tour to [[India]] in 1997, Junoon saw crowds of as many as of 50,000 fans at different venues. The band was courted for a controversy during their tour to India by the Pakistani government. The Indian government was testing nuclear devices at that time, and [[Salman Ahmad]] suggested that the Indian and Pakistani leaders should spend more on education and health and less on weapons. This led to a prolonged ban on Junoon's music by the Pakistani government. [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]], the Pakistan state television, refused to show the audience even clips from Junoon releases. 

Junoon also became the first band ever to perform at an UN conference when they performed their Millennium Peace concert held in [[Paris]], [[France]]. For their performances they were presented with an award, &quot;Outstanding Achievements in Music and Peace&quot;, by [[UNESCO]].

One of the most popular concerts that Junoon performed was their tour to [[Denmark]] and [[Europe]] in 2000-2001. This tour played a pivotal role in increasing Junoon's international popularity and standing and in spreading awareness about [[Pakistani music]]. During their tour to Denmark they became the first Asian band to perform at the [[Roskilde Festival]] along with many well known bands and musicians like [[Pearl Jam]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[The Cure]], [[QueensrÃ¿che]]  and many other well known artists from around the world. On September 5, 2001, Junoon performed in [[Norway]] with Morten Harket of A-ha as they performed a duet, &quot;Piya (Ocean of Love)&quot;, at the [[Oslo Spektrum]] which attracted a crowd of about 3000 people.
