'''Anthony James &quot;A. J.&quot; Allmendinger''' (born December 16, 1981), nicknamed '''The Dinger''',  is an [[United States|American]] [[racecar driver]]. He is best known for his accomplishments in the [[Champ Car World Series]]. Allmendinger currently drives the #43 [[Best Buy]] [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] for [[Richard Petty Motorsports]] in the [[Sprint Cup Series]]. He is married to Canadian model [[Lynne Kushnirenko]].

==Racing career==
[[Image:AJandGrant.JPG|thumb|left|Allmendinger (seated-left) when he raced in the [[Skip Barber National Championship]]]]

===Early career===
He started his career in [[Kart racing|karts]].  He won two [[Kart Racing Championships|International Karting Federation]] Grand National championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajallmendinger.com/bio.php |title=AJ Allmendinger Biography |publisher=Ajallmendinger.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also raced in New Zealand in 2002 in the [[New Zealand Formula Ford Championship]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=83199&amp;FS=OPenwheel |title=News &gt; SBRS: Team USA New Zealand Friday practice |publisher=Motorsport.com |date=2002-01-04 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allmendinger won the [[Barber Dodge Pro Series]] championship in 2002, and the [[Champ Car Atlantic Championship]] in 2003 with [[Carl Russo]]'s [[RuSport]] team.

===Champ Car===
In 2004, Allmendinger and RuSport entered the [[Champ Car World Series]], with [[Michel Jourdain Jr.]] joining Allmendinger. He scored a run of 6 top-6 finishes towards the end of the season and won the Roshfrans Rookie-of-the-Year award ahead of [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]]. Wilson joined the team for 2005, and both drivers have been in regular contention for podium finishes.

On June 9, 2006, [[RuSport]] announced that Allmendinger would be replaced by 2002 [[Champ Car|CART]] champion [[Cristiano da Matta]]. 5 days later, [[Forsythe Championship Racing]] announced Allmendinger as their new driver, replacing [[Mario Dominguez]]. In the interim, he became engaged to [[Lynne Kushnirenko]], a Canadian model and chiropractor. In his first race with Forsythe, Allmendinger won the [[Portland International Raceway|Grand Prix of Portland]]. Allmendinger became the first American to win a [[Champ Car World Series]] event since [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]] won at [[The Milwaukee Mile]] in 2004. This began a three-race winning streak that included wins at the [[Grand Prix of Cleveland]] and the [[Grand Prix of Toronto]]. This victory moved Allmendinger into second place in the CCWS championship standings, behind leader [[Sebastian Bourdais]].

He chalked up his fourth and fifth wins of the season at Denver and [[Road America]]. He left Champ Car to accept a lucrative offer from the [[NASCAR]] operation [[Team Red Bull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ryan |first=Nate |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2006-11-01-nascar-report_x.htm |title=NASCAR report: Hornish, Allmendinger add to defections from open wheel |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASCAR===
Allmendinger made his [[NASCAR]] debut in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] driving for [[Bill Davis Racing]] at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]] on September 16, 2006 in the #24 [[Toyota Tundra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/nascar/32253/ SPEEDtv.com&amp;nbsp;â The Online Motorsports Authority | Craftsman Trucks | TRUCKS: Allmendinger Signs Two-Race Deal | by RAF  staff | The latest NASCAR headlines | Johnson, Kenseth, Martin, Stewart, Kahne, Earnhardt, Burton, Harvick, Hamlin, Busch, Gordon, Biffle, Edwards, McMurray, Mears, Bowyer, Newman, Jarrett, Sadler, Riggs, Vickers, Waltrip, Labonte, Truex, Nemechek, Petty&lt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;racingref&quot;&gt;[http://racing-reference.info/driver?id=allmea.01 NASCAR results at Racing-reference.info]&lt;/ref&gt;  He crashed his primary truck in qualifying but started the race 32nd in a backup truck from teammate [[Bill Lester]] and finished on the lead lap in 13th. He also competed at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in October with a finish of 5th. In his 3rd career truck series start, he qualified in 2nd place at Atlanta and led five laps before he wrecked and finished 34th.

Allmendinger attempted his first [[NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]] event at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]] in October 2006 driving the #84 [[Red Bull]] entry, however, due to qualifying being rained out, a lack of owner's points prevented Allmendinger from making the race. He also attempted to make the race at [[Texas Motor Speedway]], failing to qualify again, however. He was still named driver of the #84 full-time in 2007.

Allmendinger failed to qualify for the [[2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2007]] Daytona 500 after a crash in the first [[Gatorade Duel]] race. He also failed to qualify for the next four races before finishing 40th his first Nextel Cup start at the [[Food City 500]] at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]]. As the season progressed, Allmendinger made a handful of races, predominantly in the &quot;[[Car of Tomorrow]]&quot;. To assist him in the transition to stock cars, he participated in selected [[Craftsman Truck Series]] races for Toyota for the [[Darrell Waltrip Motorsports]] organization and the #42 [[Memorex]]/[[Chip Ganassi Racing|Chip Ganassi]] Dodge in the [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]].

}}

Allmendinger again failed to qualify for the [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2008]] Daytona 500. After three failures to qualify in 2 attempts (qualifying for the second race of the season, Fontana, was rained out and set by 2007 owner's points), he was replaced by veteran driver [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] on a temporary basis. Allmendinger returned to the Cup series at Talladega. On May 17, he won the Sprint Showdown at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] during NASCAR's annual All-Star weekend. The win qualified Allmendinger for the [[NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race|Sprint All-Star Race]] later that evening, where he finished 17th.

Due to Allmendinger's 11th place finish at [[2008 Centurion Boats at the Glen|Watkins Glen]], for the first time in his career, he had a guaranteed starting spot for the next race. He had his best career finish at the time at [[Kansas Speedway]] coming in 9th, but was released from the team two days later.  He was replaced for the rest of the season by [[Scott Speed]] and Skinner. Allmendinger made a one-race deal with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] and a deal to finish the 2008 season with [[Gillett Evernham Motorsports]], scoring an average finish of 15.4 in the #10 car. During the offseason it was rumored that due to the merger of [[Petty Enterprises]], GEM had released Elliott Sadler and placed Allmendinger in the #19 for 2009. However, Sadler was prepared to file suit against both the team and Allmendinger for a breach of contract (Sadler was signed on until 2010). In early January, it was announced that Gillett Evernham Motorsports had merged with Petty, that Sadler would return to the #19, and Allmendinger was to drive the #44 (formerly the #10) part time pending sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/aj_allmendinger.html Richard Petty Motorsports Signs AJ Allmendinger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allmendinger's team ended the 2008 season 36th in owner's points, meaning it did not have exemptions for the first five races of 2009. The retro-styled Valvoline 44 raced its way in to the Daytona 500, and third in his Daytona 500 debut, also his personal best, and is the best Daytona 500 debut except for [[Lee Petty]] in the [[1959 Daytona 500]], [[Scott Wimmer]] in the [[2004 Daytona 500]] and [[Trevor Bayne]] in the [[2011 Daytona 500]]. Allmendinger was one of two go-or-go-home drivers (the other being Tony Stewart) to successfully attempt the first five races of the 2009 season. He and his team had various sponsors for the season, including [[Dodge]], Hunts Brothers Pizza, [[Paralyzed Veterans of America]], [[Harrah's]], [[Charter Communications]], [[Best Buy]], [[Stanley Tools]], [[Valvoline]], [[Berlin City Auto Group]], Auto Value/Bumper to Bumper, and [[Super 8 Motel]]. For the final 3 races of the season, Allmendinger drove a [[Ford]] for [[Richard Petty Motorsports]], with sponsorship from Ford Drive One. It was announced that Allmendinger would be driving the #43 [[Best Buy]] Ford Fusion in 2011 for [[Richard Petty Motorsports]], with new teammate [[Marcos Ambrose]]. 

After finishing 11th in the [[2011 Daytona 500]], A.J. started the season 10th in points driving the #43 Ford sponsored by Best Buy. Allmendinger continued to have a career best year in 2011 with 10 top 10 finishes and an average finish of 16th. He finished the 2011 regular season contending for a wild card spot in the Chase for the Sprint cup but came up just short. Three races prior to setting the field for the Chase, Richard Petty Motor Sports #43 team had a change in Crew Chief's, bringing Greg Erwin on board starting at the [[2011 Brickyard 400]]. A.J. and Greg have melded effectively and have since recorded 6 top 10 finishes. Allmendinger finished the 2011 season a career best 15th in the points.

===DUI Arrest===
At 1:27 am on October 29, 2009, Allmendinger was arrested for drunk driving by [[Mooresville, North Carolina]] police.  He registered a .08 blood alcohol level according to a police report.  NASCAR placed him on probation for the rest of the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/orl-ajallmendinger-dui-arrest-nascar-102909,0,4938430.column |title=Motor Racing : Motor Racing News and Photos |publisher=OrlandoSentinel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
