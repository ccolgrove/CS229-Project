The [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]] was the [[Minnesota Vikings]]' 48th season in the NFL, and the 17th season in which they won their division. They won the [[NFC North]] with a 10â6 record, but had to play in the [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] round of the playoffs. They were paired with head coach [[Brad Childress]]'s former team, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], who ended the Vikings' season with a 26â14 win.

It was the third season for the team under the direction of Childress. The 2008 season also marked the first season since [[2000 Minnesota Vikings season|2000]] that the Vikings made the playoffs ''and'' finished with a winning record.

Second-year running back [[Adrian Peterson]] [[List of NFL rushing champions|led the league in rushing]] with 1,760&amp;nbsp;yards.

The Vikings began their 2008 campaign on the road against their NFC North foe, the [[Green Bay Packers]], in the first game of 2008's [[Monday Night Football]] doubleheader. After a scoreless first quarter, the Vikings attacked first with kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] getting a 37-yard field goal. The Packers responded with QB [[Aaron Rodgers]] completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB [[Korey Hall]], along with kicker [[Mason Crosby]] getting a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes tried to catch up as Longwell got a 27-yard field goal, but Green Bay replied with CB/PR [[Will Blackmon]] returning a punt 76&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota tried to rally as QB [[Tarvaris Jackson]] completed a 23-yard TD pass to WR [[Sidney Rice]] (with a failed 2-point conversion), yet the Packers responded with Rodgers getting a 1-yard TD run. The Vikes would reply with RB [[Adrian Peterson]] getting a 3-yard TD run, but their final rally ended in an interception.

With the loss, not only did the Vikings begin their season at 0â1, but Head Coach [[Brad Childress]] fell to 0â5 against the Packers in his coaching career. In the first half, Minnesota was widely outgained in passing yards 139â6.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Titans, the Vikings flew to the [[Louisiana Superdome]] for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with the [[New Orleans Saints]]. In the game, QB [[Gus Frerotte]] was making his first MNF start since 1997 (when he was with the [[Washington Redskins]]).

In the first quarter, the Vikes trailed early as Saints QB [[Drew Brees]] completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR [[Devery Henderson]]. Minnesota would respond with CB [[Antoine Winfield]] returning a blocked field goal 59&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown, the first (and longest) ever in franchise history. New Orleans would answer with kicker [[MartÃ­n GramÃ¡tica]] getting a 35-yard field goal, yet the Vikings replied with kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] getting a 53-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Vikes took the lead on a trick play as RB [[Chester Taylor]] completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE [[Visanthe Shiancoe]], along with Longwell kicking a 33-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Saints began to rally as RB [[Reggie Bush]] returned a punt 71&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans took the lead with GramÃ¡tica's 53-yard field goal and Bush's 64-yard punt return for a touchdown.

With the win, the Vikings improved to 2â3.

Antoine Winfield had a big game. In addition to his touchdown off of a blocked field goal, he had 8 tackles and a sack (with a forced fumble recovery).

This was also the first time in NFL history that a game had a combination of a blocked field goal, a TD pass by a non-quarterback, two field goals of 50+ yards, and two punts returned for touchdowns.
