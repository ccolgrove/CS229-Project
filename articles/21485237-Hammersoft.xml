'''''Crystal Ball''''' is the twentieth [[studio album]] by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (who at the time went by an unpronounceable symbol). ''Crystal Ball'' is a four-disc set containing a three CD set of the same name featuring a much anticipated collection of &quot;previously [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]]&quot; material, with '''''The Truth''''', the twenty-first studio album by Prince which is a bonus disc of 12 new acoustic songs. [[Internet]] pre-orders included an [[instrumental]] studio album, '''''Kamasutra'''''.

Prince once planned to release a 3-[[Gramophone record|LP]] album around 1986, also called ''[[Crystal Ball (unreleased album)|Crystal Ball]]''. That album was edited down to a 2-LP and renamed ''[[Sign o' the Times (album)|Sign o' the Times]]''. Its title track became the title track for this compilation, 10 years later.

==Contents==
===Disc 1===
The set opens with &quot;'''Crystal Ball'''&quot;. The over 10-minute long number begins with 2-minutes of a lone drum machine and various sound effects before the vocals start. The experimental, suite-like song contains somewhat depressing lyrics and changes musical directions several times â touching on funk, rock, jazz and even classical strings (which were later sampled in &quot;[[The Future (song)|The Future]]&quot; from the ''[[Batman (album)|Batman]]'' soundtrack). The 1986 track was originally part of the ''[[Dream Factory (album)|Dream Factory]]'' project. Next up is the aforementioned &quot;'''Dream Factory'''&quot;. Like the previous track, Prince's voice is pitched up an octave in the vein of ''[[Unreleased Prince projects#Camille|Camille]]''. &quot;Dream Factory&quot; was reportedly written about [[Paul Peterson]] when he decided to leave [[The Family (band)|The Family]] project. The loud choruses of the song are alternated with jazzy subdued verses. Following &quot;Dream Factory&quot; are two tracks originally intended for ''[[The Gold Experience]]'': &quot;Acknowledge Me&quot; and &quot;Ripopgodazippa&quot;. &quot;'''Acknowledge Me'''&quot; opens with a shouted sample from former band member, [[Boni Boyer]].  The song has a [[New Jack Swing]] feel and Prince sings about a woman who &quot;gives her body to another&quot; while her mind is with him. In the song's coda, Prince delivers an extended rap. Interestingly, &quot;Acknowledge Me&quot; begins and ends with samples from 2 unreleased Prince songs: the opening sample is from &quot;The Line&quot;, a 1988 track while the end contains a slowed-down vocal originally from &quot;All My Dreams&quot;, a ''[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]'' leftover from 1985. &quot;Ripopgodazippa&quot; has a slinky reggae beat and describes a sexual encounter. Prince even tries to affect a Jamaican accent for the number. Mayte provides additional vocals. The &quot;'''Love Sign'''&quot; remix is a version of the duet with [[Nona Gaye]], originally on the ''[[1-800-NEW-FUNK]]'' compilation album; it samples Prince's 1983 track &quot;D.M.S.R.&quot; &quot;'''Hide the Bone'''&quot; is a funk-rock number originally intended for ''The Gold Experience''. A heavy drumbeat drives this sexual request for Prince to hide his &quot;bone&quot;. &quot;'''2morrow'''&quot; was written during the ''[[Emancipation (album)|Emancipation]]'' sessions and samples the chorus from &quot;[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]&quot;. The track takes advantage of Prince's multi-tracked vocals and piano work, recalling some of his jazz-inspired material. &quot;'''So Dark'''&quot; is a remix of &quot;Dark&quot; from the ''[[Come (album)|Come]]'' album, stripping out the horns, organ and live drums and laying the lyrics over a simple drum machine pattern. &quot;'''Movie Star'''&quot; was originally a ''Dream Factory'' track and according to liner notes, inspired by [[Morris Day]]. The jazzy number is filled with humor and pokes fun at Prince's celebrity. The first disc ends with &quot;'''Tell Me How U Wanna B Done'''&quot;, a remix of &quot;The Continental&quot; from 1992's ''[[Love Symbol Album]]''. Remixed by NPG band member Kirk Johnson in 1995, this version adds a repetitive keyboard riff and scratching to the original song's coda section.

===Disc 2===
Disc 2 comprises primarily rock and funk numbers. It opens with &quot;'''Interactive'''&quot;, originally written in 1993. The song was part of the first collection of new material after adopting the symbolic moniker and featured in the ''[[Glam Slam Ulysses]]'' project. It was also the only standalone audio track on Prince's ''[[Prince Interactive]]'' [[video game]] CD, and considered for multiple projects: ''[[Come (album)|Come]]'', ''The Gold Experience'' and ''The Dawn''. The song is propelled by live drums and a strong bassline. Sound effect contribute to the computer-based &quot;interactive theme&quot;, and Prince delivers a searing [[guitar solo]] at the end. &quot;Interactive&quot; is followed by another rock number called &quot;'''Da Bang'''&quot;. Recorded by Prince alone (and bored) in the studio, according to the liner notes, &quot;Da Bang&quot; alternates between laid-back bluesy verses and a frenzied instrumental rock chorus. Next is &quot;'''Calhoun Square'''&quot;, a 1993 song which is very similar in structure to &quot;Da Bang&quot;. The song appears to be a live take, with Prince giving the band instructions at the beginning. The title refers to a [[shopping mall]] in [[Minnesota]] (see [[Calhoun Square]]). Another similarly structured song from 1993 follows â &quot;'''What's My Name'''&quot;. This is the second track on the disc to have been part of the ''Glam Slam Ulysses'' project. Referring to Prince's stage name change to a symbol, the verses are little more than Prince speaking quietly over a synthesized bass and altered [[drum machine]]. The choruses break into an attack of pounding live drums and ferocious bass, being joined by [[scratching]] and a sampled police siren. The pace slows down for the ballad &quot;'''Crucial'''&quot;. Replaced by &quot;Adore&quot; on ''[[Sign o' the Times (album)|Sign o' the Times]]'', &quot;Crucial&quot; also features Prince falsetto vocals and an intricate drum machine pattern. The song fades out with a guitar solo. Outtakes of this song continue for several more minutes and one replaces the guitar solo with [[saxophone]] by [[Eric Leeds]]. &quot;'''An Honest Man'''&quot; existed as an instrumental in ''[[Under the Cherry Moon]]'' but a circulating rehearsal exists where Prince sings the lyrics to the tune as well. This version is totally different â it is a slow, 73-second mostly [[a cappella]] version with Prince's multi-layered vocals and a synth briefly appearing at the end.  Following is another song from the ''[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]'' era, &quot;'''Sexual Suicide'''&quot;. Featuring a similar synth sound as &quot;[[Girls &amp; Boys (Prince song)|Girls &amp; Boys]]&quot;, Prince sings about sexual suicide, or celibacy. A few differences exist between this version and the circulating outtake, indicating Prince may have made some additions to this song before adding to the collection. &quot;'''Cloreen Baconskin'''&quot; is the oldest and longest track on the album, being recorded in 1983 and clocking in at over 15 minutes. The song is a jam with [[Morris Day]] on drums and Prince providing the bass and vocals. The songs bears a strong resemblance to &quot;Tricky&quot;, a [[B-side]] from [[The Time (band)|The Time]], and likely cut at the same time. Prince ad-libs throughout the song in a raspy vocal about his ugly wife named Cloreen Baconskin. Like &quot;Tricky&quot;, the track seems to be a good-natured dig against funk legend [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]. Track 9 is &quot;'''Good Love'''&quot; â a ''Camille'' track that originally was released on the ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' soundtrack. The 1986 number is playful and upbeat, featuring interesting drum machines and synths throughout. Prince makes several references to [[Gustav Mahler]]. The disc closes with &quot;'''Strays of the World'''&quot;.  Like the opening track, &quot;Interactive&quot;, &quot;Strays of the World&quot; was featured in ''Glam Slam Ulysses'' and was later planned to be on the ''Come'' album. The generally positive track bears some resemblance to [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot; in combining rock with classical styles. The number was tailored for the ''Glam Slam Ulysses'' and appears operatic in parts. The song ends with a wild guitar solo and Prince whispering, &quot;Come&quot;.

===Disc 3===
The third disc opens with a live version of &quot;'''[[Days of Wild]]'''&quot;. Punchier than the unreleased studio recording, the funk song is extended by several minutes for instrumental jamming and audience participation. The NPG Operator speaks at the end to introduce the next song â &quot;Welcome to the dawn, you have just accessed...&quot; which is interrupted by &quot;'''Last Heart'''&quot;, a ''Dream Factory'' track from 1986. The experimental track combines funk and jazz and tells the tale of a man who tells his ex, &quot;If U break my heart one more time, it'll be the last heart U ever break&quot;. A scream of &quot;What am I gonna do?&quot; opens the next track â &quot;'''Poom Poom'''&quot;. The title refers to ass, which apparently Prince can't stop thinking about. The choruses contain a consistent repeat of &quot;poom poom poom...&quot; functioning as percussion. The song is an outtake from ''Emancipation'' and is a funk number driven by a pulsating drum machine pattern (recycled from the song &quot;Big Fun&quot; on NPG's &quot;Exodus&quot; album). The pace is slowed for &quot;'''She Gave Her Angels'''&quot;, a song Prince had previously performed on ''[[Muppets Tonight]]''. It begins with delicate piano, gradually adding more instruments. The songs somewhat recalls &quot;Friend, Lover, Sister, Mother/Wife&quot; from ''Emancipation''. Unlike the previously performed version, this one ends with a searing, lengthy guitar solo. Next is &quot;'''18 &amp; Over'''&quot;, which uses the music from the title track of ''[[Come (album)|Come]]'', but adds a hip hop-inspired high-pitched keyboard line. A raunchy ode to sex, an oft repeating line is &quot;18 &amp; over, I wants 2 bone ya&quot;. The rapped number makes several humorous references to &quot;boning&quot; (meaning sex) such as &quot;freak U 2 the marrow&quot; and &quot;the Bone Ranger&quot;. Prince even makes reference to the song's music, stating that he's &quot;all gone, like the horns in this song&quot; â &quot;Come&quot; was a highly horn-boosted number, but those were removed for &quot;18 &amp; Over&quot;. Following the rap is blues with &quot;'''The Ride'''&quot;. The song originates from 1993 and has been played many times over the years. This recording was from 1995 and gives Prince the chance to stretch out on a lengthy guitar solo. At the song's conclusion, it leads immediately into &quot;'''Get Loose'''&quot;, a mostly instrumental reworking of &quot;Loose&quot; from ''Come''. The only prominent line is &quot;Lemme see that body get loose!&quot; This reworking is more sinister than the original and ends with Prince throwing a barb at record company Warner Bros. Next up is a remix of &quot;'''P Control'''&quot;, with the original opening ''The Gold Experience''. &quot;'''Make Your Mama Happy'''&quot; is more interesting. The 1986 track was recorded with [[Susannah Melvoin]] (Wendy's twin sister &amp; ex-Prince fiancee) singing background vocals and has a positive message to do your best in life. The track's vocals are sung as a sort of homage to Sly &amp; The Family stone in its approach. The music is jazzy and playful with funky horns from [[Eric Leeds]] and [[Atlanta Bliss]]. The disc and the album end with &quot;'''Goodbye'''&quot;, a ballad originally intended for ''Emancipation''. Sung in falsetto, the song is musically very reminiscent of the other ''Emancipation'' ballads.

==Album controversy==
The album is a source of much [[controversy]] and a sore spot with many fans.  Initially promised to be released in early 1997, Prince later stated that he wouldn't even press the album until he received a minimum of 50,000 [[pre-order]]s. Even after pre-orders were received, it was nearly a year before fans started receiving their copies.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The shipping process was poorly managed, and some fans received their orders months later, if at all.  Fans were also promised a transparent package in the shape of an actual crystal ball; instead, when the album finally shipped, it appeared in a flat circular container that many fans dubbed &quot;Crystal [[Petri Dish]].&quot; Fans who pre-ordered the disc were directed to a [[website]] containing the liner notes and cover art for consumers to print, cut out, and place in their CD case.

The album was also made available in [[retail stores]], which questioned the need for pre-orders in the first place.  Furthermore, the album that appeared in stores contained an actual booklet with cover art liner notes, which the pre-ordered copies did not. As a peace-offering, Prince included a fifth disc, ''[[Kamasutra (Prince album)|Kamasutra]]'', which was not available in the version shipped to stores. Some customers also received a [[The New Power Generation|New Power Generation]] concert t-shirt or a [[cassette tape]] of the newly recorded &quot;[[The War (The New Power Generation song)|The War]]&quot; for free.

The contents were also a point of contention with fans. Although advertised as a [[decade]]s-spanning collection, most of the tracks were from the mid- to late-1990s. Also nearly a third of the tracks were [[remix]]es of previously released material. Some of the other tracks were unnecessarily edited; this was a particular problem since ''Crystal Ball'''s stated purpose was to eliminate the need for bootlegs, yet fans would still have to depend on said bootlegs to hear the full versions of the songs. Many consumers also complained that there was room for more material on the three discs, which ran about 45 minutes each. Indeed, the set could have easily fit 5 or more additional songs per disc. Others complained that the &quot;bonus&quot; albums ''The Truth'' and ''Kamasutra'' were filled with sub-par material.  All in all, the album was considered a debacle. Prince inadvertently alienated a large portion of his fan base due to his poor handling of the release&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/150038/03251998/prince.jhtml VH1.com : Prince : Fans Expose Crack In The Artist's Crystal Ball - Rhapsody Music Downloads&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, particularly in his sizable [[online]] fan community, where a number of [[anti-fan]] sites sprang up citing ''Crystal Ball'' as the catalyst.
