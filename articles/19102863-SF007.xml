'''Medibuntu''' ('''M'''ultimedia, '''E'''ntertainment &amp; '''D'''istractions '''I'''n U'''buntu''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu Medibuntu - Community Ubuntu Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; is a community-maintained repository of [[Debian]] [[Debian package|packages]] that cannot be included into the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] distribution for legal reasons.

Reasons for non-inclusion include copyright, license or patent restrictions, or geographical variations in legislation, such as:

* patentability of software, algorithms, formats and other abstract creation
* legal restrictions on freedom of speech or communication
* restrictions on the use of certain types of technology, such as cryptography
* legal restrictions on imports of software technology, requiring for example specific permissions
* offense which packages may cause to users that would make them unsuitable for Ubuntu's universe repository

Much free software and non-free software is affected by such restrictions somewhere in the world, thus preventing its inclusion into Ubuntu.

Medibuntu packages and distributes such software. Downloading, using, distributing or otherwise dealing with software from Medibuntu might be illegal depending on the user's jurisdiction/region.

Examples of software in Medibuntu are [[Acrobat Reader]], non-free codecs, [[Google Earth]], and [[RealPlayer]].
