'''Manukau''' is an industrial suburb of the city of [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The suburb is located 23 kilometres south of [[Auckland CBD]], and is in the Manukau ward, one of the thirteen electoral divisions of the [[Auckland Council]].

The name ''Manukau'', from the [[Manukau Harbour]] west of the city, is of [[MÄori language|MÄori]] origin, and means 'wading birds',{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} although it has been suggested that the name of the harbour was also sometimes rendered as ''MÄnuka'', meaning a marker post with which an early chief is said to have claimed the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Auckland/AucklandPlaces/16/en Manukau - Naming the harbour] (from [[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]. Accessed 2008-06-22.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Manukau was governed by the [[Manukau City|Manukau City Council]] until November 2010, when the entire Auckland region was amalgamated into a single Auckland city. The area still has a strong economic central business district, but is no longer an independent city. The area is now governed by the Auckland Council. The area immediately to the south of the [[Otahuhu, New Zealand|Otahuhu]] isthmus, as far east as [[Maraetai]] and [[Kawakawa Bay]] including [[Howick, New Zealand|Howick]] and [[Clevedon]], and as far south as [[Manurewa]], was previously known as [[Manukau City]], however it should not be confused with the suburb of Manukau. All former suburbs of Manukau City are now governed by the Auckland Council.
