'''Cagayan de Oro'''; {{IPA-en|kÉËÉ¡aÉªan dÉ Éµro|}} ([[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]: ''Dakbayan sa Cagayan de Oro''; [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Lungsod ng Cagayan de Oro''), officially the '''City of Cagayan de Oro''', is the provincial capital [[city]] of the province of [[Misamis Oriental]] in the [[Philippines]]. It lies along the northern coastline of the island of [[Mindanao]] in the country's southern portion.

Dubbed locally as the &quot;City of Golden Friendship&quot; (''Dakbayan sa Bulawanong Panaghigala-ay'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], as the phrase appears on the city's seal) for the camaraderie and hospitality that are inherent and traditional traits of its people.

Cagayan de Oro is considered as a melting pot in [[Mindanao]]. A growing metropolis to be classified as a first-class city. Cagayan de Oro serves as the regional center being the most populous highly-urbanized city in [[Northern Mindanao]] (Region X) noted for its accessibility, business growth and tourism attractions. According to the 2007 Census, the [[city]] has an estimated population of 553,996 inhabitants.

There are also other places in the [[Philippines]] with a '''CagayÃ¡n''' name. One must distinguish Cagayan de Oro from [[Cagayan]] province in Northern Luzon and the Cagayan Islands in the [[Sulu Sea]].

The name Cagayan de Oro is abbreviated as CdeO.

== Etymology ==

The name '''CagayÃ¡n de Oro''' can be traced back during the arrival of the Spanish Augustinian Recollect friars in 1622, the area around Himologan (now Huluga), was already known as &quot;Cagayan&quot;.

In fact, early Spanish documents in the 16th century already referred to the place as &quot;CagayÃ¡n&quot;. The area of [[Northern Mindanao]], which included CagayÃ¡n de Oro, was granted as ''Encomienda'' to a certain Juan Griego on January 25, 1571.

It was [[Emmanuel PelÃ¡ez]] who appended '''de Oro''' to '''CagayÃ¡n''' in recognition of the gold mining activities in the area, harking back to the Spanish colonization. Thus, the city's full name is a combination of the ancient [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and [[Spanish language]]s that translates to &quot;City of the River of Gold&quot;.

== History ==

{{See also|Battle of Cagayan de Misamis}}

[[Image:Americans attacking Macahambus Gorge probably Dec 18-21 1900.jpg|thumb|210px|left|The [[United States Army|American]] forces attacking [[Battle of Makahambus Hill|Makahambus]], circa 1900s.]]

The area was first inhabited around 377 C.E. (the late Neolithic period), island natives lived in a settlement then known as Himologan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage.elizaga.net/history/|title=History of Cagyan de Oro, with Update on Destruction of Ancestral Home|author=Antonio J. Montalvan II|publisher=Heritage Conservation Advocates, Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as Huluga), eight kilometers from present day CagayÃ¡n de Oro. The natives were polytheistic animists and paid tributes to [[Sultan Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat]], the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Sultan of Maguindanao]].

In 1622, two Spanish Augustinian Recollect missionaries came in contact with the natives of Himologan and in 1626, Fray AgustÃ­n de San Pedro persuaded the chief of Himologan, [[Datu]] Salangsang, to transfer his settlement down [[Cagayan River (Cagayan de Oro)|river]], to the present-day Gaston Park. De San Pedro later fortified the new settlement against Sultan Kudarat's raiders

In 1738, Spanish dominance was felt in CagayÃ¡n de Oro. When Misamis gained status of province in 1818, one of its four districts was the Partidos de Cagayan. In 1871, the &quot;Partidos&quot; became a town and was made a permanent capital of Misamis.

On February 27, 1872, Governor-General Carlos MarÃ­a de La Torre issued a decree declaring Cagayan the permanent capital of ''Segundo Distrito de Misamis''. During this era, the name of the town was known as '''CagayÃ¡n de Misamis'''.

In 1883, the town became a seat of the Spanish government in [[Mindanao]] for the Provinces of [[Misamis Oriental]], [[Misamis Occidental]], [[Bukidnon]] and [[Lanao del Norte]].

On January 10, 1899, CagayÃ¡n de Misamis joined the government of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and celebrated its independence from Spain. It was the second time the Aguinaldo government was declared and the new Philippine flag raised on the [[Mindanao]] island.

By virtue of the [[1898 Treaty of Paris]], Spain ceded the [[Philippines]] to the United States; this caused friction and resulted in the [[PhilippineâAmerican War]]. On March 31, 1900, Americans occupied CagayÃ¡n de Misamis and on April 7, 1900, battle erupted in the town center led by General Nicolas Capistrano&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/hero/ncr/page3.html|title=Central Luzon &amp; &amp; NCR, Philippines Unsung Heroes|publisher=MSC Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Filipino resistance fighters. This would later be known as the [[Battle of Cagayan de Misamis]]. The Americans won the war, and about forty years later, gave the [[Philippines]] its Independence July 4, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bibingka.com/phg/misc/july4not.htm|title=The Independence Day That Wasn't|author=Alan Berlow|date=1996-07-04|publisher=Philippine History Group of Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war years in Cagayan de Oro were prompted by the presence of the Americans in 1898. The Americans were initially and successfully repulsed by the Kagay-anons forces led by [[Mayor]] Don Apolinar VÃ©lez at the historic [[Battle of Makahambus Hill|Battle of Makahambus]] on June 4, 1900.

After the troubled years, peace finally brought back the economic activities to normalcy under the guidance of the [[United States]]. Consequently, from a purely farming-fishing area, Cagayan de Oro emerged into a booming commerce and trade center.

In 1948 the barrios of El Salvador and Molugan with their sitios known as Sala, Sambulawan, Sinaloc, Lagtang, Talaba, Kalabaylabay and Hinigdaan were separated from Cagayan de Oro to form the town of [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra268.html|title=An act creating the municipality of El Salvador, province of Misamis Oriental|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the barrios of Opol, Igpit, and Lower Iponan were separated from Cagayan de Oro to form the town of [[Opol, Misamis Oriental|Opol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra524.html|title=An act creating the municipality of Opol, province of Misamis Oriental|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 1950, President [[Elpidio Quirino]] signed Republic Act No. 521, which granted the status of a [[chartered city]] to the Municipality of Cagayan de Misamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra521-cagayan-de-oro-city-charter.html|title=An act creating the city of Cagayan de Oro|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible through the efforts of then Cagayan de Oro Congressman [[Emmanuel Pelaez]].

Cagayan de Oro was then declared a highly-urbanized city by the Ministry of Local Government on November 22, 1983.
