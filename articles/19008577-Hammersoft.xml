'''William Alan Shatner''' (born March 22, 1931) is a [[Canadian]] actor, musician, recording artist, and author. He gained worldwide fame and became a cultural icon for his portrayal of [[James T. Kirk]], captain of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']], in the science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' from 1966 to 1969, ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' from 1973 to 1974, and in seven of the subsequent [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' feature films]] from 1979 to 1994. He has written a series of books chronicling his experiences playing Captain Kirk and being a part of ''Star Trek'' and has co-written several novels set in the ''Star Trek'' universe. He has also authored a series of science fiction novels called ''[[TekWar]]'' that were adapted for television.

Shatner also played the [[eponymous]] veteran police sergeant in ''[[T. J. Hooker]]'' from 1982 to 1986.  Afterwards, he hosted the reality-based television series, ''[[Rescue 911]]'', from 1989 to 1996, which won a [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite New TV Dramatic Series.  He has since worked as a musician, author, producer, director, and [[Advertising media|celebrity pitchman]]. From 2004 to 2008, he starred as attorney [[Denny Crane]] in the television dramas ''[[The Practice]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Boston Legal]]'', for which he won two [[Emmy Award]]s and a [[Golden Globe Award]].

==Early life and education==
Shatner was born in [[CÃ´te Saint-Luc]], a neighbourhood in Montreal, [[Quebec]], the son of Anne (nÃ©e Garmaise) and Joseph Shatner, a clothing manufacturer.&lt;ref name=Telegraph20080628 &gt;{{Cite news|title=More William Shatner than Captain Kirk |date=June 28, 2008 |newspaper=The Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3555336/More-William-Shatner-than-Captain-Kirk.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;filmreference1931&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/59/William-Shatner.html |title=William Shatner Biography (1931-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landing.ancestry.com/famoustree/Tree.aspx?name=shatner&amp;sourceCode=6750 |title=Famous Family Tree: William Shatner |publisher=Landing.ancestry.com |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two sisters, Joy and Farla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiculturalcanada.ca/cdm_item/mcc_cjr/23489/100/14 |title=Multicultural Canada |publisher=Multiculturalcanada.ca |date=November 2, 1951 |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather, Wolf Schattner, anglicized the family name to &quot;Shatner&quot;.&lt;ref name=ref11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~pschattner/Schattner.html |title=Schattner Genealogy Page |publisher=Home.comcast.net |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner's grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Austria, Poland, Hungary, and Ukraine,&lt;ref name=jweek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c44_a11930/The_Arts/Books.html |title=Captain Of Industry |publisher=Thejewishweek.com |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=September 13, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Up Till Now: The Autobiography]]'', With David Fisher, 2008, ISBN 0-283-07058-7; page 7&lt;/ref&gt; and Shatner was raised in [[Conservative Judaism]].&lt;ref name=jweek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/35072/format/html/displaystory.html |title=Beam me up, Moses: William Shatner album tells Exodus story in spoken word, song &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jewishsf.com |date=April 18, 2008 |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Willingdon Elementary School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillel.org/about/news/2007/may/shatner_2007May15.htm |title=William Shatner: Horses Make Miracles |publisher=Hillel.org |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce]] (NDG-Montreal) and [[Baron Byng High School#Famous alumni|Baron Byng High School]], in [[Montreal]], as well as West Hill High School in NDG.

==Acting career==
===Early stage, film, and television work===
Trained as a classical [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor, Shatner performed at the Shakespearean [[Stratford Festival of Canada]] in [[Stratford, Ontario]]. He played a range of roles at the Stratford Festival in productions that included a minor role in the opening scene of a renowned and nationally televised production of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus the King|Oedipus Rex]]'' directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe's]] ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''. Shatner made his Broadway debut in the latter, in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;jordan20100903&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jordan|first=Pat|title=The Many Iterations of William Shatner|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05Shatner-t.html?_r=4&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2010-09-04|newspaper=The New York Times Magazine|date=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, he was cast as Ranger Bob on ''[[Howdy Doody#The Canadian Howdy Doody Show|The Canadian Howdy Doody Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Shatner |first= William |coauthors= David Fisher |title= ''Up Till Now'' |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |year= 2008 |page=41 |isbn= 9780312372651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner was understudy to [[Christopher Plummer]]; the two would later star as adversaries in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''.

Though his official movie debut was in the 1951 Canadian film entitled ''The Butler's Night Off'', Shatner's first feature role came in the 1958 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] film ''[[The Brothers Karamazov (1958 film)|The Brothers Karamazov]]'' with [[Yul Brynner]], in which he starred as the youngest of the Karamazov brothers, Alexei. In December of the same year, he appeared opposite [[Ralph Bellamy]] playing Roman tax collectors in [[Bethlehem]] on the day of [[Jesus]]' birth in a vignette of a [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] live television production entitled ''The Christmas Tree'' directed by [[Kirk Browning]], which featured in other vignettes such stars as [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Margaret Hamilton]], [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]], [[Cyril Ritchard]] and [[Carol Channing]]. Shatner had a leading role in an ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' third-season (1957â1958) episode titled &quot;The Glass Eye&quot;, one of his first appearances on American television. 

[[Image:NW-CBS-1959.jpg|right|thumb|300px|William Shatner ([[Archie Goodwin (fictional detective)|Archie Goodwin]]) and [[Kurt Kasznar]] ([[Nero Wolfe]]) in the aborted 1959 CBS television series ''[[Nero Wolfe#Nero Wolfe (CBS)|Nero Wolfe]]''&lt;!-- FAIR USE of NW-CBS-1959.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:NW-CBS-1959.jpg for rationale --&gt;]] 
In 1959, he received decent reviews when he took on the role of Lomax in the Broadway production of ''[[The World of Suzie Wong]]''. In March 1959, while performing on stage in ''Suzie Wong,'' Shatner was also playing detective [[Archie Goodwin (fictional detective)|Archie Goodwin]] in what would have been television's first ''[[Nero Wolfe#Nero Wolfe (CBS)|Nero Wolfe]]'' series had it not been aborted by CBS after shooting a pilot and a few episodes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Two Stage Actors Signed by CBS-TV; Kasznar and Shatner to Play in 'Nero Wolfe' Pilot Film&quot;; ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 14, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1960, he appeared twice as Wayne Gorham in [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Outlaws (1960 TV series)|The Outlaws]]'' Western series with [[Barton MacLane]], and then in another ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' fifth-season episode titled &quot;Mother, may I go out to swim?&quot;. In 1961, he starred in the Broadway play ''A Shot in the Dark'' with [[Julie Harris]] and directed by [[Harold Clurman]]. [[Walter Matthau]] (who won a [[Tony Award]] for his performance) and [[Gene Saks]] were also featured in this play. Shatner also starred in two episodes of the NBC television series ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'', &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; and &quot;The Hungry Glass&quot;.

Guthrie had called the young Shatner the Stratford Festival's most promising actor, and he was seen as a peer to contemporaries like [[Steve McQueen]], [[Paul Newman]], and [[Robert Redford]]. Shatner was not as successful as the others, however, and during the 1960s he &quot;became a working actor who showed up on time, knew his lines, worked cheap and always answered his phone.&quot; His motto was &quot;Work equals work&quot;, but Shatner's willingness to take any role, no matter how &quot;forgettable&quot;, likely hurt his career.{{r|jordan20100903}} In 1962, he starred in [[Roger Corman]]'s movie ''[[The Intruder (1962 film)|The Intruder]]''. He also appeared in the [[Stanley Kramer]] film ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' and two episodes, &quot;[[Nick of Time (The Twilight Zone)|Nick of Time]]&quot; and &quot;[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]&quot;, of the science fiction anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. In the 1963â1964 season, he appeared in episodes of two [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series, ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'' and ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' (&quot;[[Cold Hands, Warm Heart]]&quot;). In 1963, he starred in the ''[[Family Theater]]'' production called &quot;The Soldier&quot; and received credits in other programs of ''The Psalms'' series. That same year he guest starred in ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', in the episode, &quot;Build Your Houses with Their Backs to the Sea&quot;. In 1964, he guest starred in the episode &quot;He Stuck in His Thumb&quot; of the [[CBS]] drama ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]''.

In 1965 Shatner guest-starred as Major Curt Brown in second season episode 9, &quot;I Am The Enemy&quot; of ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|12 O-Clock High]]''. He guest-starred in ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' in an episode that also featured [[Leonard Nimoy]],&lt;ref name = Strigas&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; with whom Shatner would soon be paired in ''Star Trek''. He also starred in the critically acclaimed drama ''For the People'' in 1965 as an [[District attorney|assistant district attorney]], costarring with [[Jessica Walter]]. The program lasted for only thirteen episodes. Shatner starred in the 1966 [[Gothic fiction|gothic horror]] film ''[[Incubus (1966 film)|Incubus]]'', the second feature-length movie ever made with all dialogue spoken in [[Esperanto]]. He also starred in an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' in 1966 as the character Fred Bateman.

===''Star Trek'', the TV series===

Shatner was first cast as Captain [[James T. Kirk]] for the second pilot of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', entitled &quot;[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]&quot;. He was then contracted to play Kirk for the ''Star Trek'' series and held the role from 1966 to 1969. In 1973, he returned to the role of Captain Kirk, albeit only in voice, in the [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|animated ''Star Trek'' series]].

In his role as Kirk, Shatner famously kissed [[African American]] actress [[Nichelle Nichols]] (Lt. [[Uhura]]) in the November 22, 1968, ''Star Trek'' episode &quot;[[Plato's Stepchildren]]&quot;.  The episode is popularly cited as the first example of an inter-racial kiss on scripted television in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/shattered-tv-taboos-1005496.aspx |title=Shattered TV Taboos: How Bea Arthur and Others Broke Barriers |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/entertainment/060907_star_trek.html |title=After 40 Years, Star Trek 'Won't Die' |publisher=Space.com |date=2006-09-07 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian HÃ¶hne Sparborth |url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/050901_05.shtml |title=Nichols Talks First Inter-Racial Kiss |publisher=TrekToday |date=2001-09-05 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
Shatner's wife Gloria Rand divorced him in March 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap19690306&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m4EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rAEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5840,2054549 | title=TV Star Divorced After Absences | work=Toledo Blade | agency=Associated Press | date=1969-03-06 | accessdate=May 6, 2011 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Star Trek'' was cancelled that year, Shatner experienced difficulty in finding work in the early 1970s. With very little money and few acting prospects, he lived in a truck bed camper in the [[San Fernando Valley]]&lt;ref name=&quot;shatner20080511&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-565380/In-bed-Captain-Kirk--William-Shatner-tells-40-year-Star-Trek.html | title=In bed with Captain Kirk â¦ William Shatner tells of his 40-year Star Trek |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | date=2008-05-11 | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | author=Shatner, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; until small roles turned into higher-paying jobs. Shatner refers to this part of his life as &quot;that period&quot;, a humbling one during which he would take any odd job, including small party appearances, to support his family.

Shatner again appeared in &quot;schlock&quot; films, such as the horror film ''[[The Devil's Rain]]'', Corman's ''[[Big Bad Mama]]'',{{r|jordan20100903}} and the TV movie ''[[The Horror at 37,000 Feet]]'', which many fans believe is his worst work.{{r|shatner20080511}} Shatner received good reviews as the lead prosecutor in a 1971 PBS adaptation of Saul Levitt's play ''[[The Andersonville Trial]]''. Other television appearances included a starring role in the western-themed secret agent series ''[[Barbary Coast (TV series)|Barbary Coast]]'' during 1975 and 1976, and guest roles on many 1970s series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[The Rookies]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', and ''[[Mission: Impossible]]''.

Shatner was an occasional celebrity guest on ''[[The $20,000 Pyramid]]'' in the 1970s, once appearing opposite Nimoy in a matchup billed as &quot;Kirk vs. Spock&quot;. His appearances became far less frequent after a 1977 appearance in which, after giving an illegal clue (&quot;the ''blessed''&quot; for ''Things That Are Blessed'') at the top of the pyramid ($200) which deprived the contestant of a big money win, he threw his chair out of the Winner's Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UyxR9g7xi4&amp;NR|title=William Shatner blows $20K for a contestant|publisher=YouTube|format=.SWF|people=Dick Clark, William Shatner|medium=Video|accessdate=February 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other shows included ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Celebrity Bowling]]'',{{r|jordan20100903}}, ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', and ''[[Match Game]]''.

Shatner did a number of television commercials for [[Ontario]]-based [[Loblaws]] and [[British Columbia]]-based [[SuperValu (Canada)|SuperValu]] supermarket chains in the 1970s,&lt;ref name=&quot;hale19750426&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LnBkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nX0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2771,3366878 | title=Believing in Captain Kirk | work=Calgary Herald | date=1975-04-26 | accessdate=May 14, 2011 | author=Hale, Barrie | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished the Loblaws ad spots by saying, &quot;At Loblaws, more than the price is right. But, by Gosh, the price is right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/johnk.html |title=John K Interview |publisher=TVparty |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also did a number of television commercials for [[General Motors]], endorsing the [[Oldsmobile]] brand, and Promise margarine.

===A return to Kirk, and to work===
After its cancellation, ''Star Trek'' unexpectedly gained a [[cult following]] during the 1970s from [[syndicated rerun]]s, and Captain Kirk became a [[cultural icon]].{{r|jordan20100903}} Shatner began appearing at [[Star Trek convention|''Star Trek'' convention]]s organized by [[Trekkies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hern19750411&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dh5UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=04wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=shatner%20trek%20convention&amp;pg=6027%2C5877570 | title='Star Trek' fans still enthusiastic | accessdate=March 22, 2011 | author=Hern, Lee | date=1975-04-11 | publisher=King Features Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s Paramount began pre-production for a revised ''Star Trek'' television series, tentatively titled ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]''. However, the phenomenal success of ''[[Star Wars]]'' led the studio to instead consider developing a ''Star Trek'' motion picture. Shatner and the other original ''Star Trek'' cast members returned to their roles when [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] produced ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', released in 1979. It re-established Shatner as an actor, and he played Kirk in the next six ''Star Trek'' films, ending with the character's death in 1994's ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. His final appearances in the role are in the movie sequences of the video game ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (video game)|Starfleet Academy]]'' (1997), and briefly for a [[Lap giraffe|DirecTV advertisement]] using footage from ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|Star Trek VI]]'' running from late summer 2006.

He also has found an outlet in spoofing the cavalier, almost superhuman character persona of Captain Kirk, in films such as ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' (1982) and ''[[Loaded Weapon 1|National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon]]'' (1993).

[[Tim Allen]]'s role in ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'' as Captain Peter Quincy Taggart/Jason Nesmith is an analogue of James T. Kirk/William Shatner as seen by the public at large. Taggart has a reputation for taking off his shirt at the flimsiest excuse, rolling on the ground during combat, and making pithy speeches, while Nesmith is an egomaniac who regards himself as the core of ''Galaxy Quest'' and tells fans to &quot;get a life&quot;. Poking fun at himself, Shatner professed to have no idea whom Allen was parodying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/community/chat/archive/transcript/1086.html |title=Transcript |publisher=Startrek.com |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the ''Star Trek'' films, Shatner gained a new starring role on television as a [[police officer]] in ''[[T. J. Hooker]]'', which ran from 1982 to 1986. He then hosted the popular dramatic reenactment series ''[[Rescue 911]]'' from 1989 to 1996. During the 1980s Shatner also began directing film and television, directing numerous episodes of ''T. J. Hooker'' and the feature film ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]''.

===Subsequent acting career===
Shatner has appeared in advertisements for many companies and products, and in recent years he has done a series of commercials for the travel web site [[Priceline.com|Priceline]], in which Shatner plays a pompous, fictionalized version of himself.{{r|jordan20100903}} Although he received [[stock options]] for the commercials, reports that they are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars are exaggerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;berr20100505&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Berr|first=Jonathan|title= William Shatner Lives Long and Prospers â but Did He Really Make $600 Million?|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/media/william-shatner-lives-long-and-prospers-but-not-600-million/19464449/|publisher=DailyFinance|accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rose20100617&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rose|first=Charlie|title=Charlie Rose Talks to William Shatner|url=http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jun2010/pi20100617_663458.htm|accessdate=2010-09-04|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner was also the [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of the [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]], Ontario-based [[C.O.R.E.|C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures]], a special effects studio that operated from 1994 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jordan Timm |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/after_hours/opinions/article.jsp?content=20100426_10017_10017 |title=The Ode: Core Digital (1994Â2010) |publisher=Canadian Business Online |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shatner has enjoyed success with a series of science fiction novels published under his name, though most are widely believed to have been written by uncredited co-writers such as [[William T. Quick]] and [[Ron Goulart]].&lt;ref&gt;In an ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' article, Goulart described his role on the &quot;TekWar&quot; books as that of &quot;adviser,&quot; though Shatner also credits him with doing rewrites and generally playing a more active role. {{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20216787,00.html/ |title=I'm Typing as Fast as I Can |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 15, 1993 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, published in 1990, was ''TekWar''. This popular series of books led to a Marvel Comics series, to a number of television movies, in which Shatner played a role, and to a short-lived television series in which Shatner made several appearances; he also directed some episodes. In 1995, a [[first-person shooter]] game named ''William Shatner's TekWar'' was released, and was the first game to use the [[Build engine]]. He also played as a narrator in 1995 [[United States|American]] [[documentary film]] ''[[Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie]]'' directed by [[Peter Kuran]].

In the television series ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', Shatner appeared in several episodes as the &quot;[[Big Giant Head]]&quot;, a womanizing party-animal and high-ranking officer from the same alien planet as the Solomon family. The role earned Shatner a nomination for an Emmy. 

In 2001, Shatner starred in the animated film ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' as the character Mayor Phlegmming, the self-centered head of the &quot;City of Frank&quot;, a community comprising all the cells and microorganisms of a man's body. In the movie, the pompous Phlegmming is constantly preoccupied with his reelection and his own convenience, even to the detriment of his &quot;city&quot; and constituents.

In 2003, Shatner appeared in [[Brad Paisley]]'s &quot;[[Celebrity (Brad Paisley song)|Celebrity]]&quot; and &quot;[[Online (song)|Online]]&quot; music videos along with [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Jason Alexander]], and [[Trista Rehn]].

''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' producer [[Manny Coto]] stated in ''Star Trek Communicator'''s October 2004 issue that he was preparing a three-episode story arc for Shatner. Shortly thereafter, ''Enterprise'' was cancelled.

After [[David E. Kelley]] saw Shatner's commercials,{{r|jordan20100903}} he joined the final season of the legal drama ''[[The Practice]]''. His Emmy-award winning role, the eccentric but highly capable attorney [[Denny Crane]], was essentially &quot;William Shatner the man...playing William Shatner the character playing the character Denny Crane, who was playing the character William Shatner.&quot;{{r|jordan20100903}} Shatner took the Crane role to ''Boston Legal'', and won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]], an Emmy in 2005, and was nominated again in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 for his work. With the 2005 Emmy win, Shatner became one of the few actors (along with co-star [[James Spader]] as [[Alan Shore]]) to win an Emmy award while playing the same character in two different series. Even rarer, Shatner and Spader each won a second consecutive Emmy while playing the same character in two different series. Shatner remained with the series until its end in 2008.

Shatner made several guest appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', including cameos reciting [[Resignation of Sarah Palin|Sarah Palin's resignation speech]], [[Twitter]] posts, and [[Going Rogue: An American Life|autobiography]]. He has also recited Twitter posts by Levi Johnston, father of Palin's grandson. He also appears in the opening graphics of the occasional feature &quot;[[In the Year 2000|In The Year 3000]],&quot; with his disembodied head floating through space, announcing, &quot;And so we take a cosmic ride into that new millennium; that far off reality that is the year 3000,&quot; followed by the tag line, &quot;It's the future, man.&quot;

Shatner also played the voice of Ozzie the opossum in DreamWorks' 2006 feature ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]''.

At a convention held in 2010, Shatner commented on the film by saying &quot;I've seen that wonderful film.&quot; Shatner had invented his own idea about the beginning of ''Star Trek'' with his latest novel, ''Star Trek: Academy&amp;nbsp;â Collision Course.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trekweb.com/articles/2008/01/03/William-Shatner-on-His-Vision-of-Young-Kirk-and-Young-Spock-in-Collision-Course.shtml|publisher=TrekWeb.com|title=William Shatner on His Vision of Young Kirk and Young Spock|author=GustavoLeao|date=January 3, 2008|accessdate = January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shatner's autobiography ''[[Up Till Now]]'' was released in 2008. He was assisted in writing it by [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]]. Shatner has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (for Television work) at 6901 [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. He also has a star on the [[Canada's Walk of Fame|Canadian Walk of Fame]]. Shatner was the first Canadian actor to star in three successful TV series on three different major networks ([[NBC]], [[CBS]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]).

Shatner starred in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[$h*! My Dad Says|$#*! My Dad Says]]'', which is based on the [[Twitter]] feed [[Shit My Dad Says]] created by [[Justin Halpern]]. The series premiered in late 2010 and was canceled May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=25083 |title= CBS Announces 2010-2011 Primetime Schedule|publisher=CBS Television Network|date=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner is also the host of the interview show ''[[Shatner's Raw Nerve]]'' on [[The Biography Channel]], and the [[Discovery Channel]] television series ''[[Weird or What?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/story.html?id=3459687 |title=Is William Shatner Weird or What? |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Shatner starred in ''[[The Captains: A Film by William Shatner|The Captains]]'', a feature length documentary which he also wrote and directed. The film follows Shatner as he interviews the other actors who have portrayed starship captains within the Star Trek franchise. Shatner's interviewees included [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Kate Mulgrew]], [[Scott Bakula]], and [[Chris Pine]]. In the film Shatner also interviews [[Christopher Plummer]], who is an old friend and colleague from Shatner's days with the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/william-shatner-documentary-the-captains-gonzo-ballet-ben-folds/32224/ |title=William Shatner Directing THE CAPTAINS, a Documentary About Himself |publisher=Collider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and spoken-word work==
{{Main|William Shatner's musical career}}
Shatner began his musical career with the [[spoken-word]] 1968 album ''[[The Transformed Man]]'', delivering exaggerated, interpretive recitations of &quot;[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]&quot; and &quot;[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]&quot;. He performed a reading of the [[Elton John]] song &quot;[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]&quot; during the 1978 Science Fiction Film Awards that has been widely parodied. [[Ben Folds]], who has worked with him several times, produced and co-wrote Shatner's well-received second studio album, ''[[Has Been]]'', in 2004. His third studio album, ''[[Seeking Major Tom]]'', was released October 11, 2011.

===Space Shuttle Discovery===
Shatner recorded a wake-up call that was played for the crew of [[STS-133]] in the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] on 7 March 2011, its final day docked to the [[International Space Station]]. Backed by the [[Theme from Star Trek|musical theme]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', it featured a voice-over based on his spoken introduction from the series' opening credits: &quot;Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Star_Trek_moment_for_Earth-bound_shuttle_Discovery_999.html 'Star Trek' moment for Earth-bound shuttle Discovery]. space-travel.com, 7 March 2011, accessed 9 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:BrentSpinerWilliamShatnerLevarBurtonJuly2010.jpg|thumb|right|Shatner with [[Brent Spiner]] and [[LeVar Burton]] in July 2010]]
Shatner dislikes watching himself perform, and claims that he has &quot;never watched Star Trek ... not even any of the Star Trek movies&quot;&amp;mdash;except the [[dailies]] from ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', which he directed&amp;mdash;or ''Boston Legal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;adams20080208&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/search?q=william%20shatner%20never%20watched%20star%20trek | title=William Shatner 'never watched Star Trek' | work=The Telegraph | date=2008-02-08 | accessdate=August 9, 2011 | author=Adams, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Shatner has been married four times. His first marriage was to Gloria Rand, from 1956 to 1969. His second marriage lasted 21 years and was to Marcy Lafferty; the couple was married in 1973 and divorced in 1994. 

His third marriage was to Nerine Kidd-Shatner, from 1997 until her death in 1999. On August 9, 1999, Shatner returned home around 10 p.m. to discover Nerine's body at the bottom of their back yard swimming pool. She was 40 years old. An [[autopsy]] detected alcohol and [[Diazepam|Valium]] in her blood, but the coroner ruled the cause of her death as an accidental drowning. The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] ruled out foul play and the case was closed. Speaking to the press shortly after his wife's death, a clearly shaken and emotional Shatner said that she &quot;meant everything&quot; to him and called her his &quot;beautiful soulmate.&quot; &lt;ref name=quirk&gt;{{cite web|author=AAP |url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333 |title=William Shatner: Captain Quirk |publisher=Bulletin.ninemsn.com.au |date=January 24, 2008 |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner urged the public to support Friendly House, a non-profit organization that helps women re-establish themselves in the community after suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html Science Fiction News of the Week]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told [[Larry King]] in an interview that &quot;...my wife, whom I loved dearly and who loved me, was suffering with a disease that we donât like to talk about, alcoholism. And she met a tragic ending because of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=quirk/&gt; In his 2008 book ''Up Till Now: The Autobiography'', Shatner discusses how [[Leonard Nimoy]] helped take Nerine for treatment of her alcoholism. Shatner writes in an excerpt from his book:
{{bquote|Leonard Nimoy's personal experience of alcoholism now came to play a central role in my life and it helped us bond together in a way I never could have imagined in the early days of ''Star Trek''. After Nerine [Kidd] and I had been to dinner with Leonard and Susan Nimoy one evening, Leonard called and said: &quot;Bill, you know she's an alcoholic?&quot; I said I did. I married Nerine in 1997, against the advice of many and my own good sense. But I thought she would give up alcohol for me. We had a celebration in Pasadena, and Leonard was my best man. I woke up about eight o'clock the next morning and Nerine was drunk. She was in rehab for 30 days three different times. Twice she almost drank herself to death. Leonard took Nerine to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but she did not want to quit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-565380/In-bed-Captain-Kirk--William-Shatner-tells-40-year-Star-Trek.html The Daily Mail] May 11, 2008 (scroll two-thirds down the webpage for the article on Nerine)&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In 2000, a [[Reuters]] story reported that Shatner was planning to write and direct ''The Shiva Club'', a dark comedy about the grieving process inspired by his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Shatner takes inspiration from tragedy |publisher=Seattle Times |date=July 4, 2000 |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |author=[[Reuters]] |page=E2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner's 2004 album ''[[Has Been]]'' included a spoken word piece titled &quot;What Have You Done&quot; that describes his anguish upon discovering his wife's body in the pool.  &quot;What Have You Done&quot; was also sampled in the [[Concord Dawn]] and [[Chris Su]] [[Drum and Bass]] track &quot;Scream to the Stars&quot;.

Since 2001, Shatner has been married to Elizabeth Martin. In 2004, she co-wrote the song &quot;Together&quot; on Shatner's album ''Has Been''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/together-t7265302 |title=Together |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships with other actors===
Shatner first appeared on screen with [[Leonard Nimoy]] in 1964, when both actors guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', entitled: &quot;The Project Strigas Affair&quot;. However, Shatner states in his autobiography that he does not recall meeting Nimoy at that time. As co-stars on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', they interacted socially both on and off the set. After ''[[Star Trek]]'''s cancellation in 1969, Shatner and Nimoy reunited in the production of ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', as well as ''[[The $20,000 Pyramid]]'', where &quot;Kirk vs. Spock&quot; appeared on two different tables. Nimoy also guest-starred on ''[[T. J. Hooker]]'' for a few episodes. Shatner starred in the title role of the show.

The 1999 death of Shatner's third wife, Nerine, served to strengthen the friendship of Shatner and Nimoy, as Nimoy had mourned over the loss of his best friend's wife. Nimoy also appeared alongside Shatner at the [[TV Land Awards]] (hosted by [[John Ritter]]) and was one of the many people to serve as a celebrity &quot;roaster&quot; of Shatner. Nimoy summarized his four decade friendship with Shatner by remarking, &quot;Bill's energy was good for my performance, 'cause Spock could be the cool individual, our chemistry was successful, right from the start.&quot; Nimoy has spoken about their mutual rivalry during the ''Star Trek'' years: &quot;Very competitive, sibling rivalry up to here. After the show had been on the air a few weeks and they started getting so much mail for Spock, then the dictum came down from [[NBC]]: 'Give us more of that guy, they love that guy, you know?' Well, that can be ... that can be a problem for the leading man who was hired as the star of the show; and suddenly, here's this guy with ears -- 'What's this, you know?'&quot; said Nimoy. Shatner has similarly described their ''Star Trek'' relationship, stating that they only became close friends while attending fan conventions together.{{r|shatner20080511}} On an episode of the [[A&amp;E Network]] series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', Nimoy remarked, &quot;Bill Shatner hogging the stage? No. Not the Bill Shatner I know.&quot;

Shatner has been friends with [[Heather Locklear]] since 1982, when Locklear began co-starring with him on ''[[T. J. Hooker]]'' as Officer Stacy Sheridan. Locklear was asked by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' whether it was hard to work on two weekly TV shows at the same time. (During the four years Locklear was in ''Hooker'', she was also appearing in a semi-regular role in a fellow [[Aaron Spelling]] production, ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]''). She replied &quot;...I'd get really nervous and want to be prepared...&quot; for Shatner and for the experienced cast of ''Dynasty''. After ''Hooker'' ended Shatner helped Locklear get other roles. Locklear supported a grieving Shatner in 1999 when he was mourning the death of his wife, Nerine. In 2005, Locklear appeared in two episodes of Shatner's ''[[Boston Legal]]'' as Kelly Nolan, an attractive, youthful woman being tried for killing her much older, wealthy husband. Shatner plays Denny Crane, a founding partner of a large law firm, and a legendary litigator. Crane is attracted to Nolan and tries to insert himself into her defense. He is about the same age as Nolan's deceased husband, so Crane courts death by pursuing her. Locklear was asked how she came to appear on ''Boston Legal''. She explained &quot;I love the show, it's my favorite show; and I sorta kind of said, 'Shouldn't I be William Shatner's illegitimate daughter, or his love interest?'&quot;

For years, Shatner was accused of being difficult to work with by some of his ''Star Trek'' co-stars, most notably [[James Doohan]] and [[George Takei]]. In the 2004 ''Star Trek'' DVD sets, Shatner seemed to have made up with Takei, but their differences continue to resurface. In the 1990s, Shatner made numerous attempts to patch things up with Doohan, but was unsuccessful for some time; however, an [[Associated Press]] article published at the time of Doohan's final convention appearance in late August 2004 stated that Doohan had forgiven his fellow Canadian Shatner and they had mended their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/eo/20040702/en_celeb_eo/14442 Yahoo News]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Takei continues to speak negatively about Shatner. In a 2008 television interview, he stated &quot;he has a big, shiny, demanding ego.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMfwTrc2EfgET] ET Tonight Interview Fall 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner, in turn, recorded videos for YouTube, saying that Takei had some sort of &quot;psychosis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popeater.com/2008/11/11/william-shatner-cant-let-go-of-his-george-takei-grudge/] Popeater.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Takei has repeatedly asserted (most recently on the December 26, 2009, episode of the [[National Public Radio|NPR]] radio program ''[[Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me]]'') that he invited Shatner (along with other Star Trek cast members) to his 2008 wedding to Brad Altman, but Shatner never responded to the invitation. Shatner has repeatedly counter-asserted (most recently in the January 2010 issue of ''[[GQ]]'') that he never received an invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-10-22-shatner-takei_N.htm|title= Shatner upset Takei didn't invite him to wedding|work=USA Today |date=October 22, 2008|accessdate = September 30, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2008/10/23/shat-slinging/ [[Peter David]]. &quot;Shat Slinging&quot; peterdavid.net; October 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, when Shatner interviewed his ''Star Trek'' costars for his memoir ''Star Trek Movie Memories,'' [[Nichelle Nichols]] (who played [[Uhura]] on the show) told him, &quot;Now let me tell you why I hate you,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.startreknewvoyages.com/index.php?topic=3290.0 |title=William Shatner's Memories |publisher=Forums.startreknewvoyages.com |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that, despite the few lines she had in the show, he would sometimes argue with the director that an Uhura dialog line was unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.randi.org/archive/index.php/t-198082.html |title=MLK convinced Nichelle Nichols to stay on Star Trek |publisher=Forums.randi.org |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then &quot;gave Shatner an earful about how she and the rest of the other four felt, which prompted Shatner to wake up and set about making things right with his former costars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://materialgirl.grandtheftrob.com/2005/07/godspeed-mr-scott.html |title=Sta Passando Novembre |publisher=Materialgirl.grandtheftrob.com |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Nichols patched up their differences sufficiently that she appeared on his 20 August 2006 [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] roast, telling the [[Comedy Central]] audience, &quot;Bill Shatner would crap on the last piece of pizza just so no one else could enjoy it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=73186&amp;title=nichelle-nichols-on-shatner |title=Nichelle Nichols on Shatner - The Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner - Video Clip |publisher=Comedy Central |date=2006-08-20 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health problems===
Shatner suffers from [[tinnitus]] as a result of an accident on the set while shooting the ''Star Trek'' episode &quot;[[Arena (Star Trek)|Arena]]&quot; and is involved in the [[American Tinnitus Association]]. His treatment for this condition involved wearing a small electronic device that generated a low-level, broadband sound ([[white noise]]) that &quot;helped his brain put the tinnitus in the background&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Thomas |first=Nick |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003760030_tinnitus25.html |title=Health &amp;#124; Easing the torment of tinnitus &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date= June 25, 2007|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity work===
In 2006, Shatner sold his [[kidney stone]] for US$25,000 to [[GoldenPalace.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.goldenpalaceevents.com/auctions/shatnerstone01.php |title= William Shatner Passes Kidney Stone To GoldenPalace.com!|publisher=GoldenPalace.com |author=GoldenPalace.com|date=January 18, 2006|accessdate = February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an appearance on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' on May 16, 2006, Shatner said the $25,000 and an additional $20,000 raised from the cast and crew of ''Boston Legal'' paid for the building of a house by [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]].

In his spare time, Shatner enjoys breeding and [[Horse show|showing]] [[American Saddlebred]]s{{r|jordan20100903}} and [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]]s. Shatner has a 150 [[hectare]] (360 [[acre]]) farm near [[Versailles, Kentucky|Versailles]], Kentucky, named Belle Reve ([[Canadian French]] for âBeautiful Dreamâ), where he raises American Saddlebreds. His champion American Saddlebreds include Call Me Ringo, Revival, and Sultan's Great Day. The farm's activities help benefit the [http://www.ckrh.org/ Central Kentucky Riding for Hope] &quot;Horses For Heroes&quot; program.

Shatner also plays on the [[World Poker Tour]] in the [http://www.worldpokertour.com/Shared/Tournaments/Seasons/WPT_Specials/Hollywood_Home_Game_V.aspx Hollywood Home Games], where celebrities play for their favorite charities. Since 1990, he has been a leading force behind the [http://www.horseshow.org/ Hollywood Charity Horse Show], which raises money for childrenâs charities.

==Nominations and awards==
