'''cdrkit''' is a collection of computer programs for [[CD]] and [[DVD]] authoring that work on [[Unix-like]] systems.
cdrkit is released under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2.
[[ArchLinux]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Gentoo Linux]], [[Mandriva Linux]], [[openSUSE]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] all include cdrkit.
Joerg Jaspert is cdrkit's leader and release manager.

It was created in 2006 by [[Debian]] developers as a fork of [[cdrtools]] based on the last GPL-licensed version when cdrtools licensing changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdrkit uploaded&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== Components ==
Major components include:
* ''wodim'' (an acronym for write optical disk media), which was forked from the ''cdrecord'' program in cdrtools.
*''icedax'' (an acronym for incredible digital audio extractor), which was forked from the ''cdda2wav'' program in cdrtools.
* ''genisoimage'' (short for generate [[ISO image]]), which was forked from the ''mkisofs'' program in cdrtools.

== Front-ends ==

Other software can use cdrkit tools in the back-end. cdrkit tools will maintain interface compatibility with cdrtools 2.01.01a08 at least for the near future.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdrkit uploaded&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=cdrkit - portable command-line CD/DVD recorder software
|accessdate=2008-09-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous programs can therefore use it, including [[Brasero (software)|Brasero]] (the default [[GNOME]] Desktop CD/DVD application), [[K3b]] (the default [[KDE]] desktop application), and [[X-CD-Roast]] ([[desktop environment]] independent).

==History==

A license dispute arose between the Debian maintainers and cdrtools author JÃ¶rg Schilling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debian Bug report logs - #377109&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=377109 | title=Debian Bug report logs - #377109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Debian developers assert that the [[General Public License|GPL]] license is not compatible with the [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]] license that covers part of the cdrtools code.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debian Bug report logs - #377109&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=377109 | title=Debian Bug report logs - #377109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, cdrtools maintainer JÃ¶rg Schilling states that there is no problem with the license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/linux-dist.html#legal|title=There is no license problem in the original cdrtools|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and also asserts that the Debian fork is not legally redistributable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/linux-dist.html#violations
|title=The Debian fork violates the GPL and the Urheberrecht
|accessdate=16 August 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling has also claimed that the cdrkit fork reintroduced various bugs from the first versions of cdrtools, which were already fixed in later cdrtools versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/linux-dist.html#problems|title=What are the problems when running programs from the broken fork?|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
