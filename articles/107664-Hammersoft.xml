== History ==
[[File:1890 Norwalk Grammar School.jpg|thumb|right|This is the Norwalk Grammar School in 1890 before 1900 in Norwalk, California. The picture is with teacher Cora Hargitt Johnson with her class. Hargitt School is named after her.]]
[[File:1920 Norwalk Grammar School.jpg|thumb|right|The Norwalk Grammar School on Walnut Avenue in Norwalk, California in the 1920s.]]
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Norwalk1957.jpg|thumb|Norwalk in 1957]] --&gt;

The area known as &quot;Norwalk&quot; was first home to the [[Shoshonean]] Native American tribe. They survived primarily on [[honey]], an array of berries, acorns, sage, squirrels, rabbits and birds. Their huts were part of the Sejat Indian village.

In the late 1760s, settlers and missions flourished under Spanish rule with the famous [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] trail traversing the area. [[Rancho Los Nietos|Manuel Nieto]], a Spanish soldier, received a [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant ([[Rancho Los Nietos]]) in 1784 that included Norwalk.

After the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1848, the Rancho and mining days ended. Portions of the land were subdivided and made available for sale when [[California]] was admitted into the union of the United States. Word of this land development reached the Sproul Brothers in Oregon. They recalled the fertile land and huge sycamore trees they saw during an earlier visit to the Southern California area. In 1869, Atwood Sproul, on behalf of his brother, Gilbert, purchased {{convert|463|acre|km2}} of land at $11 an acre ($2700/kmÂ²) in an area known as Corazon de los Valles, or &quot;Heart of the Valleys.&quot;

By 1873, railroads were being built in the area and the Sprouls deeded 23 acres (93,000 mÂ²) stipulating a &quot;passenger stop&quot; clause in the deed. Three days after the Anaheim Branch Railroad crossed the &quot;North-walk&quot; for the first time, Gilbert Sproul surveyed a town site. In 1874, the name was recorded officially as Norwalk.  While a majority of the Norwalk countryside remained undeveloped during the 1880s, the Norwalk Station allowed potential residents the opportunity to visit the &quot;country&quot; from across the nation.

What are known as the &quot;first families&quot; to Norwalk (including the Sprouls, the Dewitts, the Settles, and the Orrs) settled in the area in the years before 1900.  D.D. Johnston pioneered the first school system in Norwalk in 1880. Johnston was also responsible for the first real industry in town, a cheese factory, by furnishing Tom Lumbard with the money in 1882. Norwalk's prosperity was evident in the 1890s with the construction of a number of fine homes that were located in the middle of orchards, farms and dairies.  Headstones for these families can be found at Little Lake Cemetery, which was founded in 1843 on the border between Norwalk and [[Santa Fe Springs]] at Lakeland Road.

At the turn of the 19th century, Norwalk had become established as a dairy center. Of the 50 local families reported in the 1900 census, most were associated with farming or with the dairy industry. Norwalk was also the home of some of the largest sugar beet farms in all of Southern California during this era. Many of the dairy farmers who settled in Norwalk during the early part of the 20th century were Dutch.

After the 1950s, the Hispanic population in Norwalk grew significantly as the area became increasingly residential. In the 1990s, Norwalk gained a significant Asian population from families priced out of wealthier neighboring [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]] and communities in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].

===Airplane disaster===

In February 1958, two military aircraft, a Douglas [[C-118]] A military transport and a U.S. Navy [[P-2 Neptune|P2V]]-5F Neptune patrol bomber, collided over Norwalk at night. 47 servicemen were killed as well as a civilian 23-year-old woman on the ground who was hit by falling debris. A plaque commemorating the disaster erected by the American Legion in 1961 marks the spot of the accident, today a mini-mall at the corner of Firestone Boulevard and Pioneer Boulevard.

=== The Hargitt House ===
Built in 1891 by the D. D. Johnston family, the Hargitt House was built in the architectural style of Victorian Eastlake. The Hargitt House Museum, located at 12426 Mapledale, was donated to the people of Norwalk by Charles (&quot;Chun&quot;) and Ida Hargitt. The Museum is open on the first and third Saturday of the month from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.

==Emergency services==
