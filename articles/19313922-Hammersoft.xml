'''Camastianavaig''' (also English spelling: '''''Camustinivaig''''') is a crofting township on the island of [[Skye]] in Scotland. It is located on the shores of the [[Sound of Raasay]] {{convert|5|km|mi}} south east of [[Portree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst2335.html &quot;Camastianavaig (Camustinivaig) Highland&quot;] Gazetteer for Scotland.

The name is from both Gaelic and [[Old Norse|Norse]],  ''Camas DÃ¬onabhaig''. &quot;Camas&quot; means &quot;bay&quot; in the former and the Norse element may be from &quot;dyn&quot; meaning &quot;noisy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/pdfs/placenamesC-E.pdf| title=Placenames| author=Iain Mac an Tailleir| publisher=PÃ rlamaid na h-Alba|format=pdf| accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourist Activities==
Camastianavaig has a rocky shore with views of the [[Cuillins]] and [[Raasay]] and is situated at the bottom of  Ben Tianavaig, where there is a [[White-tailed Eagle|Sea Eagle]] colony. Other local wildlife includes [[Bottlenose Dolphin]] in the summer months, and seals, otters and ducks on a regular basis. The area is popular with mountain bikers. 

==Agriculture==
The land is used for mainly crofting, with the majority of the livestock being sheep and a few cows. The land is slightly to acidic for arable farming although the addition of lime is used to compensate for this. The soil is also low in potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen, which are essential elements required for plant growth.  The high levels of rainfall and steep slopes also cause soil erosion, creating further difficulties for crop growing. 

==Battle of the Braes==
The township is near the scene of the '''Battle of the Braes''' in 1882. Local crofting tenants facing [[Highland Clearances|eviction from the land]] withheld rent and released sheep onto a forbidden area on the shores of [[Ben Lee]]. Sent to evict them, the Sheriff Officer from Portree was met by an angry mob, who forced him to burn the eviction notices. Subsequently 50 Glasgow policemen, sent to quell the rebellion, faced 100 men, women and children, armed with sticks and stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://highlandclearances.info/clearances/clearances_battleofthebrae.htm| title=Battle of the Braes| publisher=Highland Clearances| accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.isbuc.co.uk/Places/Braes.php| title=Braes| publisher=Isle of Skye Business Community| accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small fines were imposed in court, but it was clear that law and order could only be enforced with military assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pages.eidosnet.co.uk/~skye/crofting.html| title=A Short History of Crofting in Skye| author=Jonathan MacDonald| year=1998| publisher=| accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Battle of the Braes, the unrest spread to [[Glendale, Skye]]. The rebellion led to the [[Napier Commission]] and ultimately the [[Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886|Crofters Act]] of 1886. which brought security of tenure and the right to hand a croft on to their heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/info/History/TheCroftersStruggle| title=The Crofters Struggle| publisher=walkhighlands.co.uk| accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle of the Braes is celebrated with a monument and through a folk song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/songs/blsongs_battle.htm| title=Traditional Scottish Songs - The Battle of the Braes| publisher=Rampant Scotland| accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
