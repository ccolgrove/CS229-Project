'''Transmission''' is a [[BitTorrent client]] which features a simple interface on top of a [[cross-platform]] back-end. Transmission is [[free software]]&lt;ref name=&quot;trans-about&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Transmission&amp;nbsp;â About |url=https://www.transmissionbt.com/about.php |year=2009 |publisher=www.transmissionbt.com |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), with parts under the [[MIT License]].

==Features==
{{Prose|date=April 2011}}
Transmission allows users to download files from the Internet and upload their own files or torrents.  By grabbing items and adding them to the interface, users can create queues of files to be downloaded and uploaded. Within the file selection menus, users can customise their downloads down to components of individual files. Transmission also seedsâthat is, it can re-upload downloaded content.
*Low resource usage: During testing, Transmission used less than a quarter of the memory required by other BitTorrent clients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webpaste.net/e6a2b9c93b9f&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prioritization to select which torrents, and which files inside those torrents, to download first
*[[Magnet URI scheme|Magnet links]] support introduced in 1.80&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2096&lt;/ref&gt;
*Selective downloading
*Optionally move torrents to a different folder when they finish downloading
*[[BitTorrent protocol encryption|Encrypted peer connections]]
*Torrent file creation
*[[Peer exchange]] (compatible with [[Vuze]] and [[Î¼Torrent]])
*A built-in web server so that users can control Transmission remotely via the web (using RPC or WebUI)

*Fast Resume&amp;nbsp;â with peer caching
*[[Blacklist (computing)|Blocklists for bad peers]], periodically updated with the same bluetack peer list used by [[PeerGuardian]] and [[PeerBlock]]
*Single listening port for all torrents
*Scheduled bandwidth limits
*Global and per-torrent bandwidth caps
*Sorting/filtering options
*[[HTTPS]] tracker support
*IPv6 support (partial&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/1731&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced in 1.50

*Multiple line tracker list manipulation&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/1699&lt;/ref&gt;
*The usages of multiple trackers simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2713&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Local Peer Discovery]] support introduced in 2.00&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/3060&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Transmission torrent details.png|200px|right|thumb|Transmission allows users to monitor a torrent's activity.]]

Transmission 1.60 and later removed support for [[Mac OS X v10.4]]. Currently, Transmission 1.54 is the last version that runs on Mac OS X 10.4. Starting with Transmission 2.30&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/Changes#version-2.30
 | title = Transmission ChangeLog
}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Apple Mac with an [[Intel]] CPU is needed; [[PowerPC]]-based systems are no longer supported natively.

The Transmission back-end (libTransmission) also serves as the basis of the Transmission [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]. The daemon supports a web [[front-end]] called Clutch. Older versions have been ported to form the basis of the update system for the video game [[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Online]] on [[PS3]],&lt;ref&gt;https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?p=22905#22905&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the backend for [[ImageShack]]'s BitTorrent service.

==Ports==
There are several transmission clients for different operating systems including [[Linux]] and [[Unix-like]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[BeOS]]/[[Magnussoft ZETA|ZETA]]; each operating system front-end is built using native [[widget toolkit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans-about&quot; /&gt;

An unofficial [[porting|port]] of Transmission using a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) on the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] was accomplished on March 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://wickedpsyched.net/iphone/torrent&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, iTransmission, another unofficial port, was released for jailbroken iPhones sporting a [[GUI]] that is capable of downloading directly to the device over WiFi or 3G.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/itransmission/&lt;/ref&gt; A Transmission remote was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], with the name of ''Transdroid'' but does not currently support downloading directly to devices.

On [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], Transmission-Qt can be built with MinGW,&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/BuildingTransmissionQtWindows&lt;/ref&gt; the daemon and console tools can be built with Cygwin,&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/Building&lt;/ref&gt; also there are two third-party [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]s: Transmission Remote Dot Net&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/transmission-remote-dotnet/&lt;/ref&gt; and transmission-remote-gui,&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/transmisson-remote-gui/&lt;/ref&gt; as well as unofficial full builds of Transmission's Qt Client.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sb-innovation.de/f93/transmission-1-76-windows-17975/&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/trqtw/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also ported to the [[Maemo]] OS of the [[Nokia]] [[N810]] and [[N900]] Internet tablets on which it does download the torrents to the device.

==Reception==
Transmission is the default BitTorrent client of many [[Unix]] and [[Linux distribution]]s, including [[OpenSolaris|Solaris]],&lt;ref name=&quot;solaris pkginfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pkg.oracle.com/solaris/release/info/0/desktop%2Ftorrent%2Ftransmission%400.5.11%2C5.11-0.151.0.1%3A20101105T053642Z|title=Solaris Transmission package description}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ubuntu Changelog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/u/ubuntu-meta/ubuntu-meta_1.87/changelog|title=Ubuntu Changelog|last=Pitt|first=Martin|date=2008-01-14|language=en|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mandriva Linux|Mandriva]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandriva Spring 2008 Release Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/2008.1_RC_1#New_default_applications_for_GNOME|title=New default applications for GNOME}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linux Mint|Mint]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Elyssa Release Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_elyssa.php|title=Elyssa Release Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Distribution/Download/BitTorrent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Distribution/Download/BitTorrent|title=Distribution/Download/BitTorrent|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puppy Linux|Puppy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Puppy Linux 4.2 Release Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puppylinux.org/wiki/development/puppy-4-series/puppy-linux-42-release-notes|title=Puppy Linux 4.2 Release Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CrunchBang Linux|CrunchBang]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes - Crunchbang Linux&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crunchbanglinux.org/wiki/release-notes/9.04.01|title=Release Notes - CrunchBang Linux 9.04.01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zenwalk Linux|Zenwalk]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Zenwalk Package List&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://packages.zenwalk.org/?b=/xap&amp;zversion=snapshot|title=Zenwalk Package List}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[GNOME]] flavor of [[openSUSE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Make Transmission the default BitTorrent client in 11.2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=530416|title=Make Transmission the default BitTorrent client in 11.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Mac OS X]], it is the most popular BitTorrent client downloaded from Mac software websites [[MacUpdate]] and [[VersionTracker]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

[[Fonera]] ships its routers with Transmission pre-installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fonera 2.0n&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shareconnector.com/fon-starts-selling-fonera-20n-router-with-transmission-rapidshare-support|title=FON Starts Selling Fonera 2.0n Router with Transmission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNET editor Paul Huges praised Transmission for its &quot;simplicity, lightweight, as well as being feature-packed&quot; and the software is currently ranked second in P2P downloads for Mac on CNET.&lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/Transmission/3000-2196_4-79101.html&lt;/ref&gt;
