'''Winetricks''' is a [[script (computing)|script]] to install some basic components (typically Microsoft [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]] and fonts) and tweak settings required for some applications to run correctly under [[Wine (software)|Wine]].
It can fully automate the install of a number of apps and games, including applying any needed workarounds.
