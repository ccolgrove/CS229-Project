[[File:Escape_From_Planet_Monday2.jpg|thumb|'Escape from Planet Monday' (2006)]]
Along with the three other members of Bad Company, Fresh founded the [[record label]] BC Recordings, as well as the website [[Dogs On Acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.illegalparty.com%2Farticle13614.html&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0= ''FRESH (Bad Company, Breakbeat Kaos, Dogs on Acid, UK) !'] Illegal party: Accessed 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bad Company are heralded as one of the finest drum &amp; bass acts ever, having produced numerous genre-defining tracks. Undoubtedly their most renowned track is &quot;The Nine&quot;, a track released in 1998 when Fresh was just 19 years old. &quot;The Nine&quot; was later voted the greatest drum &amp; bass track of all time by readers of Knowledge Magazine &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatportal.com/feed/item/kmag-announces-the-top-100-drum-bass-tracks-of-all-time/ 'Kmag Announces the Top 100 Drum &amp; Bass Tracks of All Time']&lt;/ref&gt;

Resuming his solo career in 2002, Fresh founded Breakbeat Punk, which merged with [[Adam F]]'s Kaos Recordings to become [[Breakbeat Kaos]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/include/print.asp?newsIdx=21743 ''World's Top DJs Coming to Seoul] Korea Yimes: Accessed 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 ''Dogs on Acid'' was given its own [[imprint]].

Fresh has worked with artists ranging from [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[DJ Shadow]], [[Apollo 440]] to [[Andy C]] and [[Grooverider]], and has also held a working relationship with the drum and bass trio [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]], whom he signed to Breakbeat Kaos in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dogs_On_Acid#Junglesound_Gold|Junglesound Gold]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh has had his own tracks included on a number of [[remix]] [[Compact disc|CDs]], including the 2006 release ''Jungle Sound: The Bassline Strikes Back!'', Andy C's ''Nightlife'' series, [[DJ Hype]]'s ''Drum and Bass Warfare'', and [[Goldie]]'s ''Drum and Bass Classics''.

In 2006, Fresh released his first studio album, ''[[Escape from Planet Monday]]'', featuring &quot;The Immortal&quot;, &quot;X Project&quot;, &quot;Nervous&quot; and &quot;All that Jazz&quot; on Breakbeat Kaos.

==='Kryptonite' and Mainstream Success (2009-Present)===
[[File:Kryptonite.jpg|thumb|'Kryptonite' (2010)]]
In 2009 Fresh released a 12&quot; of &quot;Heavyweight&quot; (with Fantasia on the B side) on the [[Digital Soundboy]] label. &quot;Heavyweight&quot; had a different style from Fresh's usual output, and gained positive reviews and a general positive response through the underground scene and within various [[radio station]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.last.fm/event/1176048+DJ+Fresh+Live  &quot;DJ Fresh Live&quot;] Last Fm: Accessed 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh subsequently released &quot;Hypercaine&quot; (including a remix from Nero) in September 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBK&quot;&gt;[http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=640142&amp;cache=33  &quot;BBK - DJ Fresh News // Hypercaine, Heavyweight, Kryptonite&quot;] Dogsonacid.com: Accessed 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and made [[BBC Radio 1]]'s daytime playlist. 

On the 1 August 2010, he re-released his song [[Gold Dust (song)|Gold Dust]] Featuring vocals from Ce'cile, Where it peaked 24 in the UK and 39 in Ireland, it marked his first Top 40 hit in both countries. Drum &amp; Bass producer Finka remixed Gold Dust in early 2011.  On 16 August, he released his second studio album, &quot;[[Kryptonite (album)|Kryptonite]]&quot; where it peaked 4 on the [[UK Dance Chart]].

He then released his follow-up single, called &quot;Lassitude&quot; with Sigma and Vocals from Koko. It managed to peak 98 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and 11 on the [[UK Dance Chart]].

===Third Album and Commercial Breakthrough (2011 - Present)===
The first single from his Third Album, &quot;[[Louder (DJ Fresh song)|Louder]]&quot; was released on July 3, 2011. The song is being used as part of a [[Lucozade]] Lite advertising campaign the UK and Ireland. The song features vocals from [[Wales|Welsh]] singer [[Sian Evans]] from the band [[Kosheen]], It peaked number 4 on the [[International Recording Media Association|Irish Singles Chart]] and Number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It marked his first top five hit in both countries and first to reach number 1. It is also the first ever song of the [[dubstep]] genre to reach number 1 in the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dirtysmart.co.uk/news_article.php?id=320&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh has a number of tracks in the pipeline for 2012, including the next single 'Hot Right Now' featuring [[Rita_Ora|Rita Ora]] (who is signed to [[Roc_Nation|Roc Nation]]).

==='FRESH/LIVE'(November-December 2011)===
[[File:FreshLivePoster.jpg|thumb|The FRESH/LIVE tour of Nov/Dec 2011]]
In late 2011, DJ Fresh began a new aspect of his career by launching the unique concept show 'FRESH/LIVE'. This live show was the first of its kind in the drum &amp; bass/dubstep world, incorporating a drummer, guitarist, vocalist and Fresh himself on keys to perform identical renditions of his studio-produced hits in live settings. 

Fresh handpicked the musicians that made up the band, calling on people he had encountered at various stages of his career. On the drums was Kodish, a man with over ten years experience as a drummer in the drum &amp; bass scene, having performed with such eminent acts as [[Moving Fusion]], [[Bad Company]], and [[Pendulum]]. Guitarist Richard de Rosa founded the Ska/Swing band Scubaroots, with whom he has performed to 1000s of people at countless festivals. Seemingly a master of all trades, he also produced the band's album, was nominated for producer of the year at the 2011 South West Music Awards, and had previously performed on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge with [[Example_(musician)|Example]] and Fresh. Vocalist Fleur exploded onto the scene after performing on X Factor to 9 million TV viewers in 2005 and had also previously performed with Fresh on Live Lounge, and with [[Ms._Dynamite|Ms Dynamite]] on 1Xtra. 

The UK-wide tour completely sold out, taking in seven prestigious venues: The Arches in Glasgow, Alexandra Palace in London, The Big Reunion in Skegness, Manchester Club Academy, Waterfront in Norwich, Concorde 2 in Brighton, and the Student Union in Leeds. FRESH/LIVE is set to return bigger and better in Spring 2012.
