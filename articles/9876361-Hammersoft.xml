'''Melinda Lou &quot;Wendy&quot; Morse''' ([[Married and maiden names|nee]] Thomas, born September 14, 1961) is the daughter and fourth child of American businessman [[Dave Thomas (American businessman)|Dave Thomas]], the founder of the restaurant [[Wendy's]].

==Life==
===Early life===
Melinda Lou Thomas was born on September 14, 1961, in the United States of America, the fourth child of [[Dave Thomas (American businessman)|Dave Thomas]].

===Importance to Wendy's===
{{Main|Wendy's}}

As a child, Morse was unable to pronounce the L in her name Melinda and so she became known by her nickname ''Wenda'' (with the [[pen-pin merger]]). Then 8-year old Wenda would eventually become the namesake behind the name of her father's restaurant [[Wendy's|Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers]], or just &quot;Wendy's&quot; for short.&lt;ref name=&quot;pe990115&quot;/&gt; In addition to being the namesake, her likeness was used as Wendy's [[logo]] in the form of a young girl with red braids.&lt;ref name=&quot;mj890924&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnbc&quot;/&gt;

===Later life===
As an adult, Morse owned several Wendy's restaurants near [[Dallas, Texas]] until 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;capchi&quot;/&gt;  After the death of her father Dave Thomas in 2002, Morse and her siblings bought restaurants in the [[Columbus, Ohio]] area. {{As of|2010|09}}, Morse herself owned or co-owned more than 30 Wendy's stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;md101109&quot;/&gt; In November 2010, she began appearing in Wendy's ads on camera for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad101112&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lv101105&quot;/&gt; (Her voice was featured in a 1989 ad giving her father advice from off-camera.)&lt;ref name=&quot;pe990115&quot;/&gt; The 2010 ads aired first in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[Mobile, Alabama]], and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], test markets before being rolled out nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;aa101113&quot;/&gt;

Morse currently serves on the board of trustees of the [[Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cscene1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dtffa&quot;/&gt;
