'''[[UNIT]]''' stands for '''UN'''ified '''I'''ntelligence '''T'''askforce, (formerly it stood for '''U'''nited '''N'''ations '''I'''ntelligence '''T'''askforce), a fictional entity in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Whoniverse|universe]].

UNIT first appeared in the [[Second Doctor]] serial ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'',  (1968), although [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart]] had appeared earlier in ''[[The Web of Fear]]'' (1968), as a military [[Colonel]]. UNIT went on to feature in many [[Third Doctor]] stories, as the Doctor was exiled to [[List of Doctor Who planets#E|Earth]] in ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' (1970), and became UNIT's Scientific Advisor following the [[Auton]] attack. The Doctor would maintain this post in subsequent incarnations. UNIT is a large organisation and many '''personnel''' have featured in ''Doctor Who'' over the years. Some lead, supporting and recurring characters have worked for or have been affiliated with the organisation.

Bambera is shown able to fight with weapons and in hand-to-hand combat. She took a no-nonsense, by-the-book approach to command that warranted the respect of those under her. [[#Major Husak|Major Husak]] and [[#Sergeant Zbrigniev|Sergeant Zbrigniev]] reported directly to her. She uses the word &quot;shame&quot; as an expletive.

She was killed alongside her colleagues, fellow experts, by the [[Slitheen]], electrocuted by devices planted on their name tags. Only the Doctor survives. Her name, 'Frost', is only given on her name tag and it has led to fan speculation that it is derived from character [[Muriel Frost]], featured in the comic strip in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]''. This argument is fuelled by earlier drafts of the episode's script that had the Doctor refer to her directly as &quot;Muriel Frost&quot;. However, in this episode, she is dressed in US [[military uniform]].

She reported that the Sycorax signal came from 5000 miles above the [[List of Doctor Who planets#E|Earth]], not from [[Malcassario|Mars]], which led to the realisation that there was a [[List of Doctor Who vehicles#Sycorax ship|ship]] in [[orbit]]. She had [[Blood type|A+ blood]] which meant she succumbed to the Sycorax [[mind control]]. As a result of this, she stood poised to jump off the roof of the Tower of London.

'''Colonel Mace''' is the commanding officer of a large contingent of UNIT (the Unified Intelligence Taskforce) in 2009. Mace first appeared in &quot;[[The Sontaran Stratagem]]&quot; / &quot;[[The Poison Sky]]&quot; (2008). He originally seemed to view the Doctor as a superior officer, saluting him and taking his orders; however, the two clashed and Mace began to be irritated by the Doctor's manner and repeated casual dismissals of him and UNIT, while simultaneously irritating the Doctor through his overtly militaristic manner and insistence on a combat solution to the situation brought on by the Sontarans (Although both agreed that the presence of '[[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|Sir Alistair]]' would be of great assistance at this time).

Despite repeatedly being told UNIT could not face the [[Sontaran]]s, he organised the troops for an assault on a Sontaran position, telling the Doctor he wasn't listening any more, and rallied the troops with a speech about how they would show &quot;every passing alien with an axe to grind&quot; to not mock them and see &quot;what the human race is capable of&quot;. He even manages to impress the Doctor by having the ''[[Valiant (Doctor Who)|Valiant]]'' clear away the poison gas surrounding the factory. He then successfully leads the recapture of the area, managing to personally kill the Sontaran second-in-command, Commander Skorr.

Although Colonel Mace's first name was never mentioned on screen, the letter initial of '''A''' can be seen on the [[Identity document|I.D. Card]] displayed on his uniform. On Page 129 of the reference book ''The Time Traveller's Almanac'', it says that the '''A''' stands for '''Alan'''.

In the ''[[Torchwood]]'' serial ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'', [[John Frobisher]] and [[#Colonel Oduya|Colonel Oduya]] discuss Mace's posting in [[Vancouver]]. However, as this conversation is a swift change of subject to avoid classified information being heard by [[List of Torchwood characters#Lois Habiba|Lois Habiba]], it is not clear if there is any truth in it.

Malcolm refused to shut the wormhole without the Doctor coming back through and resisted even under the threat of Magambo shooting him. Yet the Doctor was able to come back through with the aid of the modified 200 Bus and Magambo led her troops in destroying the three Swarm aliens that came through the wormhole before its closure. After thanking the Doctor and bringing his TARDIS back to him (apparently it had been found in the gardens of [[Buckingham Palace]]), she commented on having to clear up the mess, to which the Doctor refused to help in the paperwork.
