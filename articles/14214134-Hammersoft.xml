'''Tommy Cole''' (born December 20, 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[make-up artist]], a former [[actor]] and [[singer]] who is still best known for having been a [[Mickey Mouse Club|Mouseketeer]].

==Early life==
Although born in [[Burbank, California]], Tommy Cole grew up in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[La CaÃ±ada Flintridge, California|La CaÃ±ada]]. He was self-motivated toward performing from an early age, despite the disapproval of some of his more strict Lutheran relatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Hold Your Banner High'', by Jerry Bowles, 1976, pp. 52, ISBN 0-385-11622-5&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was an editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]''; his mother later worked part-time at movie studios as a welfare guardian for minor children. He has one older brother, John Cole.

== Career ==
=== Performer ===
Tommy Cole started as a musician, playing the [[accordion]] as a young teenager with three other kids in a [[western swing]] band. The band played in amateur contests and small clubs, and even managed to get a one-time gig on [[Ray Bolger|Ray Bolger's]] mid-1950s television show ''[[Where's Raymond?]]''  Besides playing the accordion, he was also the band's singer. When the ensemble auditioned together at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney Studio]] for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' in spring 1955, he was the only one selected to join the cast of Mouseketeers.

Though he started on the second-string Blue Team, Tommy Cole's singing ability earned him a transfer to ''The Mickey Mouse Club's'' first-string Red Team midway through the 1955â56 season. He remained with the show for its final two seasons (1956â1958) of original programming and, after filming stopped, attended [[Hollywood Professional School]] and went on live-performance tours with other Mouseketeers to [[Australia]] in 1959 and 1960.    

For the next several years Tommy Cole's career was based on live-singing at teenage clubs, public events, and as an opening act for other performers. He attended [[Pasadena City College]], did a hitch in the [[USAF|Air Force]], and had guest star parts on a few television shows. By 1964, he had realized that his days as a performer were ending, and so looked around for some other way to stay in [[show business]].

=== Make-up artist ===
While acting in an episode of ''[[My Three Sons]]'' in 1963, Tommy Cole had started learning make-up technique from one of the show's regular artists.  He soon joined the craft as an apprentice, working first for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], then later in the sixties for [[NBC]].  He began freelancing as a make-up artist in the early seventies, gathering [[Emmy]] nominations in 1975 for ''[[Masquerade Party]]'' and 1978 for ''[[Once Upon a Brothers Grimm]]'', before winning, along with Mark Bussan and Ron Walters, in 1979 for ''[[Backstairs at the White House]]''.

Tommy has since been nominated for Emmy awards for the miniseries ''[[Right to Die (film)|Right to Die]]'' (1988), the television series ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' (1996), and most recently for the TV special ''[[Geppetto (TV musical)|Gepetto]]'' (2000), for which he shared in winning the Hollywood Makeup Artists and Hairstylist Guild Award.  He has long been active in his craft's union, serving in 2003 as business representative for Local 706 of the Makeup Artists and Hairstylist Guild.  He currently represents his guild on the Governor's Board of the [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]].

==Personal life==
Tommy's wife Aileen is a former dancer. They met in [[Korea]], on a [[USO]] tour in the mid-sixties, and were married when they had both returned stateside.  They have two children, now adults.
