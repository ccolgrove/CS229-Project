The '''[[South Carolina Gamecocks]] football''' team represents the [[University of South Carolina]] in [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college football]].  The Gamecocks have been a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] since 1992.  [[Steve Spurrier]] is the current head coach, and the team plays its home games at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]], also known as &quot;The Cockpit&quot;.  Currently, it is the [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|20th largest stadium in college football]].

South Carolina's SEC tenure has been highlighted by an SEC East title in 2010, Final Top-25 rankings in 2000, 2001, and 2010 (AP #19, #13, and #22), and two wins over Top-5 SEC opponents (#4 [[Ole Miss Rebels|Ole Miss]] in 2009 and #1 [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]] in 2010).

From 1953 through 1970, the Gamecocks played in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], winning the 1969 [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] championship and finishing #15 in the 1958 final AP poll.  From 1971 through 1991, they competed as a major independent, producing 1980 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[George Rogers (American football)|George Rogers]], six bowl appearances, and Final Top-25 rankings in 1984 and 1987 (AP #11 and #15).

The Gamecocks have produced a National Coach of the Year in [[Joe Morrison]], three SEC coaches of the year in [[Lou Holtz]] (2000) and [[Steve Spurrier]] (2005, 2010), and one ACC coach of the year in [[Paul Dietzel]] (1969).  They also have two members of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in Rogers and Holtz.  Carolina has 16 bowl appearances all-time, including four [[Gator Bowl]] and three [[Outback Bowl]] berths.

==Program History==
===Early Days of Carolina Football===
Carolina fielded its first football team in 1892 to play against [[Furman University|Furman]] on [[Christmas Eve]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The football team was not sanctioned by the University and had to pay its own train fare as well as buy its own uniforms. They were nicknamed the &quot;College Boys&quot; by ''[[The Post and Courier|The News and Courier]]'' and their supporters wore garnet and black. The team lost the game because of their inexperience and lack of training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | pages = 189â190 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USC won its first game during the third season of the sport on November 2, 1895 against Columbia AA. The football team got its first head coach, W.H. &quot;Dixie&quot; Whaley, the following year, and the 1896 season also saw the inaugural game against archrival [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] on November 12, which Carolina won 12&amp;ndash;6.  From 1902-03, coach [[C. R. Williams]] led the Gamecocks to an impressive 14-3 record, which included the program's first 8-win season.  The [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] banned participation in football for the 1906 season after the faculty complained about the coarseness of chants yelled by the students at football games.  However, the board was so harassed by petitions from the students and alumni that it voted to allow the resumption of the sport in 1907. A hastily assembled football team, coached by Board of Trustees member Douglas McKay, competed in an abbreviated season and won all three games it played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | pages = 229â230 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1928-1934, coach [[Billy Laval]] led the Gamecocks to seven consecutive winning seasons and a 39-26-6 overall record, which included a perfect 3-0 [[Southern Conference]] campaign in 1933.  Under coach [[Rex Enright]], the Gamecocks produced another undefeated Southern Conference season, going 4-0-1 in 1941.  Enright gave up coaching duties in 1955 due to health reasons, but remained as [[Athletic Director]].  He retired with the distinction of being both the winningest and losingest coach in school history (64-69-7).  [[Warren Giese]] was hired as head coach in 1956, and he led the Gamecocks to a 28-21-1 overall record in his 5-year tenure.  The Giese era included two 7-3 campaigns (1956 and 1958), an 18-15-1 ACC record, and a 27-21 victory over [[Darrell Royal|Darrell Royal's]] [[1957 Texas Longhorns football team|1957 Texas squad]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].  [[Marvin Bass]] was named head coach in 1961, and his 5-year tenure produced a 17-29-4 overall record.

===Paul Dietzel Era (1966-1974)===
[[Paul Dietzel]] arrived in Columbia prior to the 1966 season, having previously coached at [[LSU Tigers|LSU]] and [[Army Black Knights|Army]].  In 1969, he led the Gamecocks to an ACC championship and an appearance in the [[Peach Bowl]].  As a result, Dietzel was named ACC Coach of the Year that season.  Soon after, South Carolina left the ACC and became an Independent program prior to the 1971 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthCarolina&quot;&gt;[http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/10-scar-media-guide.html  South Carolina Gamecocks 2010 Football Media Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dietzel finished his USC tenure with a 42-53-1 overall record (18-10-1 ACC).  In addition to the 1969 ACC title, Dietzel's legacies at Carolina include his improvement of athletic facilities and his penning of a new fight song, which is still used to this day ([[The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way]]).

===Jim Carlen Era (1975-1981)===
[[Jim Carlen]] took over as coach in 1975, and under his leadership the program achieved a measure of national prominence.  Carlen led the Gamecocks to three bowl games, coached 1980 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[George Rogers (American football)|George Rogers]], and produced a 45-36-1 record during his tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthCarolina&quot; /&gt;  The Carlen Era included consecutive 8-4 finishes (1979â1980) and only one losing season in seven years.  In addition, the 1980 Gamecocks defeated a heavily favored [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] squad coached by the legendary [[Bo Schembechler]].  The 17-14 victory in [[Michigan Stadium|Ann Arbor]], which made Rogers a household name, was one of the biggest wins in both the Carlen Era and the program's history.

===Joe Morrison Era (1983-1988)===
[[Joe Morrison]] was hired in 1983 following a one-year stint by Richard Bell.  After a 5-6 mark in his first year, the &quot;Man in Black&quot; led South Carolina to a 10-2 record, #11 final [[AP Poll]] ranking, and a [[Gator Bowl]] appearance in 1984.  The 1984 season included victories over [[1984 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], [[1984 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh]], [[1984 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]].  In 1987, the Gamecocks posted an 8-4 record, #15 Final [[AP Poll]] ranking, and another Gator Bowl trip.  The 1987 Gamecocks were led by the &quot;Fire Ant&quot; defense, which held seven opponents to 10 or fewer points and yielded just 141 points in 12 games played.  Morrison coached his last game in the 1988 [[Liberty Bowl]], as he died on February 5, 1989 at the age of 51.  He finished his USC tenure with a 39-28-2 overall record, three bowl games, and three seasons with 8 or more wins.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthCarolina&quot; /&gt;  Due to his on-field success and &quot;Man in Black&quot; image, Morrison remains a popular figure in Gamecock lore.

===Woods and Scott Eras (1989-1993, 1994-1998)===
Following Morrison's death, [[Sparky Woods]] was hired as head coach in 1989 and coached the Gamecocks until the end of the 1993 season.  He posted winning seasons in 1989 and 1990, but could not produce another winning campaign during his tenure.  Woods has the distinction of being South Carolina's first head coach in SEC play, as the Gamecocks entered the conference in 1992.  [[Brad Scott (American football)|Brad Scott]] took over as head coach in 1994 and led USC to a 7-5 record and a [[Carquest Bowl]] victory in his first season.  The bowl win was the first post-season victory in the program's history.  Scott was unable to capitalize on his early success, however, as USC won only six games during his final two seasons in Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthCarolina&quot; /&gt;

===Lou Holtz Era (1999-2004)===
[[Lou Holtz]] was hired as South Carolina's head coach in 1999.  He inherited a relatively young SEC program (joined in 1992) that posted only three winning seasons from 1990-1998.  USC won just a single game the year before Holtz's arrival and, subsequently, went 0-11 in his inaugural campaign.  It didn't take long for Holtz to improve the Gamecocks' fortunes, however, as he engineered 8-4 and 9-3 records in the 2000 and 2001 seasons.  In addition, South Carolina won consecutive [[Outback Bowl]]s over Ohio State and produced the most successful two-year run in program history, going 17-7 overall and 10-6 in SEC play.  The 2000 and 2001 campaigns also saw USC's return to the polls, as the Gamecocks turned in #19 and #13 rankings in the Final AP ballotings for those years.  After consecutive 5-7 finishes in 2002 and 2003 (during which the team was ranked in the Top 25 during the season both years), Holtz ended his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6-5 record in 2004.  Holtz finished with a 33-37 overall record at South Carolina, but went 33-26 after his first season.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthCarolina&quot; /&gt;

===Steve Spurrier Era (2005-Present)===
[[Steve Spurrier]] was hired in 2005 to replace the departing Holtz, and he led the Gamecocks to a 7-5 record and [[2005 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]] appearance in his first season.  As a result, Spurrier was named the 2005 SEC Coach of the Year.  The 2006 season saw continued success under Spurrier, as the Gamecocks posted an 8-5 record and a victory over [[2006 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]] in the [[2006 Liberty Bowl|Liberty Bowl]].  South Carolina posted consecutive 7-6 records in 2008 and 2009, returning to postseason play with appearances in the [[Outback Bowl]] and [[PapaJohns.com Bowl]].  No other coach in the program's history has led the program to four bowl games as coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthCarolina&quot; /&gt; In 2010, Spurrier scored another first with the first SEC Eastern Division Championship in school history.
On November 13, 2010, the Gamecocks defeated Florida 36-14, clinching the Eastern Division of the SEC. Prior to this contest, South Carolina had an all-time record of 0-12 at The Swamp.  Freshman RB Marcus Lattimore rushed for 212 yards and 3 touchdowns in the game.  Spurrier got his first win in Gainesville as a Gamecock, received a &quot;Gatorade Bath&quot; from his players, and became the first coach to win the SEC East with two different teams. Earlier in the season, the Gamecocks posted the first win over a #1 team in program history, with a 35-21 victory over top-ranked, defending national champion [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]].

===Year-by-year results===
{{main|List of South Carolina Gamecocks football seasons}}

==Primary Rivalries==
*'''Clemson &amp;ndash;''' The [[Carolina-Clemson Rivalry]] is the largest sporting event in the state of South Carolina.  Clemson holds a 65-40-4 lead in the series, which dates back to 1896, but many of the contests have gone down to the wire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=721 South Carolina vs Clemson]&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1896-1959, the Carolina-Clemson game was played in Columbia and referred to as &quot;Big Thursday.&quot;  Since 1960, the game has alternated between both teams' home stadiums and has become known as the &quot;Palmetto Bowl.&quot;  The last 6 match-ups between the schools have been nationally televised (3 on ESPN, 3 on ESPN2).

*'''Georgia &amp;ndash;''' South Carolina's &quot;border rivalry&quot; with [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] dates back to 1894.  While the Bulldogs got off to a fast start in the series and hold a 46-15-2 lead, the Gamecocks have kept the series interesting recently with hotly contested games (4 out of the last 6 match-ups have been decided by a touchdown or less).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=1265 South Carolina vs Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most memorable games was the 1980 matchup between Heisman Trophy hopefuls George Rogers and [[Herschel Walker]].  Led by Walker's 219 rushing yards, Georgia won 13-10 and would go on to capture the National Championship.  Rogers turned in 168 rushing yards in the contest, setting the stage for a successful finish to his Heisman Trophy campaign.  The last 14 match-ups between the schools have been nationally televised, dating back to 1997 (6 on ESPN2, 4 on ESPN and 4 on CBS).

==Secondary Rivalries==
*'''Arkansas &amp;ndash;''' The annual meeting with the Razorbacks began in 1992 when both programs entered the SEC.  Despite playing in different divisions (East and West), South Carolina and Arkansas are permanent opponents under the conference's scheduling structure.  The rivalry started when former Clemson head coach [[Danny Ford]] took over as Arkansas head coach in 1993.  It has continued since the annual contest is usually crucial in terms of bowl aspirations.  The rivalry became more intense when [[Lou Holtz]] took over at USC in 1999, as he had formerly been the head coach for Arkansas.  Arkansas holds a 13-7 lead in the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=175 South Carolina vs Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Florida &amp;ndash;''' The USC-Florida rivalry (along with the UK-USC and UT-USC rivalries) is the most recent addition to Carolina's rivalries.  However, this rivalry is considered more intense than USC-UK or UT-USC because Steve Spurrier was UF's first national championship coach but turned down an opportunity to interview for the job when it became open again in 2005. Also, that year, USC spoiled Florida's SEC championship hopes by upsetting them in Columbia, adding fuel to the fire.  In 2010, Carolina clinched the SEC Eastern Division title with a 36-14 win in Gainesville.  Florida holds a 23-6-3 lead in the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=1113 South Carolina vs Florida]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Tennessee &amp;ndash;''' The USC-UT rivalry also stems from Spurrier's arrival at USC.  Spurrier made many detrimental comments about UT's football program while head coach at Florida, and Tennessee fans have not forgotten.  3 of the 6 UT-USC matchups during Spurrier's tenure at USC have been decided by a touchdown or less.  The all-time record in the series is 22-6-2 in favor of Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=3180 South Carolina vs Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt;  Three of USC's wins have come from Spurrier-coached teams.  The last five match-ups have been broadcast on national television (3 on ESPN, 2 on ESPN2) and 4 out of the last 5 times, one team has been ranked in the Top 25 at the time of the game (#17 and #21 for USC, #25 and #8 for UT).

*'''Kentucky &amp;ndash;''' As members of the SEC's Eastern division, South Carolina plays Kentucky on a yearly basis.  The rivalry stems from Steve Spurrier's arrival as head coach at USC.  Spurrier never lost to the Wildcats while at Florida, much to the detriment of UK fans.  The Gamecocks own a 15-7-1 series lead and won 10 straight games from 2000-2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=1628 South Carolina vs Kentucky]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite South Carolinaâs recent dominance, the matchup with Kentucky has been highlighted by numerous close games.  4 of the 6 USC-UK matchups during Spurrier's tenure at USC have been decided by a touchdown or less.

==Intermittent Rivalries==
*'''NC State &amp;ndash;''' The NC State game was the season finale until the Clemson game was moved from &quot;Big Thursday&quot; after 1959.  The series dates back to 1900, with the Gamecocks holding a slight 27-26-4 edge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=2287 South Carolina vs North Carolina St.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s were the most heated of the rivalry with the series tied at 4-4-1 during that decade.  These programs continued to meet annually from 1968 through 1991.  However, there have been only three meetings since South Carolina joined the SEC in 1992, all of which have been televised on ESPN.  The Gamecocks lost 10-0 in Raleigh in 1999, but got revenge with a 34-0 home victory in 2008.  The most recent matchup in 2009 was competitive, with South Carolina winning 7-3 in Raleigh.

*'''North Carolina &amp;ndash;''' South Carolina's rivalry with its old ACC foe North Carolina dates back to 1903.  The Tar Heels hold a 34-17-4 lead in the series, but the Gamecocks have won ten out of their last fifteen games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/south_carolina/opponents_records.php?teamid=2279 South Carolina vs North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; The two programs have met eleven times since South Carolina left the ACC in 1971, with the Gamecocks holding a 6-5 lead in those games.  Their most recent meeting was a 21-15 victory for the Gamecocks televised on ABC in 2007, which is the only time they have met since South Carolina joined the SEC in 1992.  The intensity of the rivalry comes from South Carolina's frustration with the &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; schools which caused South Carolina's departure from the ACC in 1971.  This is why the rivalry maintains its intensity, particularly with older fans of the two Carolinas, despite the teams rarely meeting on the field.

==George Rogers Wins the Heisman==
{{main|George Rogers (American football)}}
South Carolina's 1980 season was headlined by senior [[running back]] George Rogers (&quot;Big George&quot;), who led the nation in rushing with 1,894 yards.  For his efforts, the [[Downtown Athletic Club]] named Rogers the winner of the 1980 [[Heisman Trophy]] award.  Rogers beat out an impressive group of players, including Georgia running back [[Herschel Walker]].  Rogers also earned spots on eight All-American teams, all First-team honors.  Behind the Rogers-led rushing attack, the Gamecocks went 8-4 overall and earned an appearance in the Gator Bowl.  Rogers is also the recipient of the 1980 [[Chic Harley Award]], the 2004 [[Walter Camp Alumni of the Year]] award, a Pro-Bowl selection, an [[SEC Football Legends|SEC Football Legend]], a Super Bowl champion and an NFL Rookie of the Year.

==Syvelle Newton Joins the &quot;600 Club&quot;==
{{main|Syvelle Newton}}
From 2003 to 2006, Syvelle Newton played multiple positions for the Gamecocks and left his mark on the national record books in the process.  He became one of only four players in college football history to record 600+ yards passing, rushing, and receiving (each) in a collegiate career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.scnow.com/sports/2011/may/23/newton-putting-numbers-afl-eyes-shot-nfl-ar-1880792/ Newton putting up numbers in AFL, eyes shot in NFL]&lt;/ref&gt; In Newton's four seasons, he posted 2,474 passing yards (20 TD, 13 INT), 786 rushing yards (10 TD), and 673 receiving yards (3 TD).  He also returned 6 kickoffs for 115 yards (19.2 average) and posted 18 tackles and an assisted sack in limited defensive action.

==Gamecock Traditions==
*'''&quot;Block C&quot; Helmet Logo &amp;ndash;''' South Carolina's helmet, regardless of color, has featured the &quot;Block C&quot; logo since 1975.  The logo consists of a garnet Gamecock inside a black letter &quot;C,&quot; which stands for Carolina.  This logo, which is used throughout the athletic department, is one of the most unique and recognizable in all of college sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalchamps.net/Helmet_Project/sec.htm Helmet Project - Southeastern Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''&quot;2001&quot; Entrance &amp;ndash;''' The Gamecocks' enter Williams-Brice Stadium to the introduction of &quot;[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]&quot;, which is popularly known for the inclusion of its introduction in the Stanley Kubrick film, &quot;[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]&quot;. This tradition began, on a consistent basis, in 1983.  It was an immediate hit with South Carolina fans and has long been considered one of the most exciting, and loudest, entrances in college football.  [[Sporting News]] has called it &quot;the most exciting pre-game entry in college football.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/trads/scar-trads.html#2001 Gamecock Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''&quot;Carolina&quot; and &quot;Gamecocks&quot; on Jersey &amp;ndash;''' South Carolina has featured the script &quot;Carolina&quot; and &quot;Gamecocks&quot; on the front of its jersey, intermittently, since coach Jim Carlen's arrival in 1975.  While it used &quot;Gamecocks&quot; for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, it has solely used &quot;Carolina&quot; on its jersey since the late 1990s.

*'''Cockaboose Railroad &amp;ndash;''' In 1990, cabooses renovated in Gamecock colors and decor became part of the already famous South Carolina tailgate scene.  They sit on a dormant railroad track just yards from Williams-Brice Stadium and have taken on a life of their own, in terms of parties on game days.  The Cockaboose Railroad has contributed to Carolina's gameday atmosphere being named &quot;Best in the SEC&quot; twice by SECsports.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/trads/scar-trads.html#Cockaboose%20Railroad Gamecock Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''S.C. Flag and Palmetto Tree/Crescent &amp;ndash;''' Due to being South Carolina's flagship university, USC prominently displays the state flag and Palmetto Tree/Crescent logo on game days.  In addition to players entering the field with the state flag during &quot;2001,&quot; the stadium's playing surface often displays garnet and white Palmetto Tree/Crescent logos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/trads/scar-trads.html#The%20South%20Carolina%20State%20Flag Gamecock Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''&quot;If It Ain't Swayin', Then We Ain't Playin&quot; &amp;ndash;''' Originating from a [[Joe Morrison]] comment about the reported &quot;swaying&quot; of the [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] upper deck during a 38-14 win over Southern California, this has become a slogan for Carolina fans, who (according to ESPN) have become some of the loudest fans in college football.  &quot;The Cockpit&quot; has been named by ESPN as the #25 toughest place to play in college football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/658867-the-50-greatest-traditions-in-college-football/page/16 The 50 Greatest Traditions in College Football]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Sir Big Spur &amp;ndash;''' Sir Big Spur (originally called Cocky Doodle Lou), the university's official live gamecock, attends USC football and baseball games. Sir Big Spur is a college football celebrity: in the last 5 years alone, he has appeared on national television 15 times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wltx.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=110565 Who Takes Care of Sir Big Spur?]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Cocky &amp;ndash;''' Cocky, celebrating his USC 30th homecoming in 2010, is the four-time &quot;national champion&quot; and five-time &quot;All-American&quot;  mascot of the Gamecocks.  The &quot;son&quot; of Carolina's original mascot Big Spur, Cocky appears at every USC home football contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/ot/spirit/scar-spirit-cockys-corner.html History and Biography of Cocky]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*'''Sandstorm &amp;ndash;''' The most recent tradition involves the [[Sandstorm (song)|song ''Sandstorm'']] by [[Darude]], which began to be played in October 2006.  The song is played mostly when USC is the defending team, especially when they have just scored and are kicking the ball to the other team; in this case, the song is stopped when the kicker makes contact with the football.  As the song is played, fans wave over their heads either their shirt or a &quot;Gamecock Spirit Rag.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13583752 USC students, fans make &quot;Sandstorm&quot; their unofficial anthem]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos and uniforms==
In the 2009 season, South Carolina wore a special uniform against Florida in support of the [[Wounded Warrior Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/29126/gamecocks-support-wounded-warriors/ Gamecocks support wounded warriors]&lt;/ref&gt;
