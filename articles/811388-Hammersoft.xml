'''William Eggleston''' (born July 27, 1939), is an American [[photographer]]. He is widely credited with increasing recognition for [[color photography]] as a legitimate [[art]]istic medium to display in art galleriesâwhich, until the 1970s, often tended to privilege work by photographers making black-and-white prints.

== Early years ==
William Eggleston was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and raised in [[Sumner, Mississippi]]. His father was an engineer who had failed as a cotton farmer, and his mother was the daughter of a prominent local judge. As a boy, Eggleston was introverted; he enjoyed playing the piano, drawing, and working with electronics. From an early age, he was also drawn to visual media, and reportedly enjoyed buying postcards and cutting out pictures from magazines. As a child, Eggleston was also interested in audio technology.

At the age of fifteen, Eggleston was sent to the [[Webb School (Bell Buckle, Tennessee)|Webb School]], a boarding establishment In [[Bell Buckle, Tennessee]]. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, &quot;It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was the kind of place where it was considered effeminate to like music and painting.&quot; Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world around him. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted in retrospect that he never felt like an outsider. &quot;I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in,&quot; he told a reporter, &quot;But probably I didn't.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BelcoveW&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title= William Eggleston | author= Julie Belcove | journal=W  | date= November 2008| url= http://www.wmagazine.com/artdesign/2008/11/william_eggleston?currentPage=1| accessdate=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggleston attended [[Vanderbilt University]] for a year, [[Delta State University|Delta State College]] for a semester, and the [[University of Mississippi]] (Ole Miss) for approximately five years, none of these experiences resulting in a college degree. However, it was during these university years that his interest in photography took root: a friend at Vanderbilt gave Eggleston a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] camera. Eggleston studied art at Ole Miss and was introduced to [[abstract expressionism]] by a visiting painter from New York named Tom Young.

== Artistic development ==
Eggleston's early photographic efforts were inspired by the work of Swiss-born photographer [[Robert Frank]], and by French photographer [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]]'s book, ''[[The Decisive Moment]].'' Eggleston later recalled that the book was &quot;the first serious book I found, from many awful books...I didn't understand it a bit, and then it sank in, and I realized, my God, this is a great one.â&lt;ref name=&quot;BelcoveW&quot;/&gt; First photographing in black-and-white, Eggleston began experimenting with color in 1965 and 1966; color transparency film became his dominant medium in the later sixties. Eggleston's development as a photographer seems to have taken place in relative isolation from other artists, although he was introduced to color photography by then Memphis College of Art professor [[William Christenberry]]. In an interview, [[John Szarkowski]] of New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) describes his first, 1969 encounter with the young Eggleston as being &quot;absolutely out of the blue&quot;. After reviewing Eggleston's work (which he recalled as a suitcase full of &quot;drugstore&quot; color prints) Szarkowski prevailed upon the Photography Committee of MoMA to buy one of Eggleston's photographs.

In 1970, Eggleston's friend [[William Christenberry]] introduced him to [[Walter Hopps]], director of Washington, D.C.'s [[Corcoran Gallery]]. Hopps later reported being &quot;stunned&quot; by Eggleston's work: &quot;I had never seen anything like it.&quot;

Eggleston taught at [[Harvard]] in 1973 and 1974, and it was during these years that he discovered [[Dye-transfer process|dye-transfer printing]]; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: &quot;It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation and the quality of the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one.&quot; The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled ''[[The Red Ceiling]]'', of which Eggleston said, &quot;''The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge.''&quot;

At Harvard, Eggleston prepared his first portfolio, entitled ''14 Pictures'' (1974), which consisted of fourteen dye-transfer prints. Eggleston's work was featured in an exhibition at MoMA in 1976, which was accompanied by the volume ''William Eggleston's Guide''. The MoMA show is regarded as a watershed moment in the history of photography, by marking &quot;the acceptance of colour photography by the highest validating institution&quot; (in the words of Mark Holborn). 

Around the time of his 1976 MoMA exhibition, Eggleston was introduced to [[Viva (Warhol superstar)|Viva]], the [[Andy Warhol]] &quot;superstar&quot;, with whom he began a long relationship. During this period Eggleston became familiar with Andy Warhol's circle, a connection that may have helped foster Eggleston's idea of the &quot;democratic camera&quot;, Mark Holborn suggests. Also in the seventies, Eggleston experimented with video, producing several hours of roughly edited footage Eggleston calls ''Stranded in Canton''. Writer Richard Woodward, who has viewed the footage, likens it to a &quot;demented home movie&quot;, mixing tender shots of his children at home with shots of drunken parties, public urination and a man biting off a chicken's head before a cheering crowd in New Orleans. Woodward suggests that the film is reflective of Eggleston's &quot;fearless naturalism&amp;mdash;a belief that by looking patiently at what others ignore or look away from, interesting things can be seen.&quot;

''William Eggleston's Guide'' was followed by other books and portfolios, including ''Los Alamos'' (actually completed in 1974, before the publication of the ''Guide'') the massive ''Election Eve'' (1976; a portfolio of photographs taken around [[Plains, Georgia]] before that year's presidential election); ''The Morals of Vision'' (1978); ''Flowers'' (1978); ''Wedgwood Blue'' (1979); ''Seven'' (1979); ''Troubled Waters'' (1980); ''The Louisiana Project'' (1980); ''William Eggleston's Graceland'' (1984) ''The Democratic Forest'' (1989); ''Faulkner's Mississippi'' (1990), and ''Ancient and Modern'' (1992). Eggleston also worked with filmmakers, photographing the set of [[John Huston]]'s film ''Annie'' (1982) and documenting the making of [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]]'s film ''True Stories'' (1986). He is the subject of [[Michael Almereyda]]'s recent documentary portrait ''[[William Eggleston in the Real World]]'' (2005). In 2008, the [[Whitney Museum]] of American Art in New York co-organized with Haus der Kunst in Munich, the retrospective exhibition [http://whitney.org/www/eggleston/index.jsp William Eggleston: Democratic Camera, Photographs and Video, 1961-2008]

== Eggleston's aesthetic ==
Eggleston's mature work is characterized by its ordinary subject-matter. As [[Eudora Welty]] noted in her introduction to ''The Democratic Forest'', an Eggleston photograph might include &quot;old tyres, Dr Pepper machines, discarded air-conditioners, vending machines, empty and dirty Coca-Cola bottles, torn posters, power poles and power wires, street barricades, one-way signs, detour signs, No Parking signs, parking meters and palm trees crowding the same curb.&quot;

Eggleston has a unique ability {{editorializing?|date=May 2011}} to find beauty, and striking displays of color, in ordinary scenes. A dog trotting toward the camera; a Moose lodge; a woman standing by a rural road; a row of country mailboxes; a convenience store; the lobby of a Krystal fast-food restaurantâall of these ordinary scenes take on new significance{{POV-statement|date=May 2011}} in the rich colors of Eggleston's photographs. Eudora Welty suggests that Eggleston sees the complexity and beauty of the mundane world: &quot;The extraordinary, compelling, honest, beautiful and unsparing photographs all have to do with the quality of our lives in the ongoing world: they succeed in showing us the grain of the present, like the cross-section of a tree.... They focus on the mundane world. But ''no'' subject is fuller of implications than the mundane world!&quot; Mark Holborn, in his introduction to ''Ancient and Modern'' writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston's lens: &quot;[Eggleston's] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi--friends, family, barbecues, back yards, a tricycle and the clutter of the mundane. The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images there is a sense of lurking danger.&quot; American artist Edward Ruscha said of Eggleston's work, &quot;When you see a picture heâs taken, youâre stepping into some kind of jagged world that seems like Eggleston World.â&lt;ref name=&quot;BelcoveW&quot;/&gt;

It may help{{whom?|date=May 2011}} to compare Eggleston's work to the work of another illustrious Mississippian, [[William Faulkner]], who also drew subject matter from the [[Mississippi Delta]] region that is the subject matter of much of Eggleston's art. Both Eggleston and Faulkner drew upon insights of the European and American [[avant-garde]]s to help them explore their Southern environs in new and surprising ways. As the writer [[Willie Morris]] wrote, Eggleston's &quot;depiction of the rural Southern countryside speaks eloquently of the fictional world of Faulkner and, not coincidentally, the shared experience of almost every Southerner. Often lurid, always lyrical, his stark realism resonates with the language and tone of Faulkner's greatest mythic cosmos of [[Yoknapatawpha County]] .... The work of William Eggleston would have pleased Bill Faulkner ... immensely.&quot; Eggleston seemed to acknowledge the affinity between himself and Faulkner with the publication of his book, ''Faulkner's Mississippi'', in 1990.

According to Philip Gefter from ''[[Art &amp; Auction]]'', &quot;It is worth noting that Stephen Shore and William Eggleston, pioneers of color photography in the early 1970s, borrowed, consciously or not, from the photorealists. Their photographic interpretation of the American vernacularâgas stations, diners, parking lotsâis foretold in photorealist paintings that preceded their pictures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Keeping It Real | author= Philip Gefter | journal=ARTINFO  | date= January 9, 2008 | url= http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26416/keeping-it-real/ | accessdate=2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable publications ==
The earliest commercial use of Eggleston's art was in the album covers for the Memphis group [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], with whom Eggleston recorded for the album [[Third/Sister Lovers]] and who used the famous Red Ceiling image on their album ''[[Radio City (album)|Radio City]].'' Later records also had other Eggleston images, including the dolls on a Cadillac hood featured on the cover of the classic [[Alex Chilton]] album ''[[Like Flies on Sherbert]].'' The [[Primal Scream]] album ''[[Give out But Don't Give Up]]'' features a cropped photograph of a neon confederate flag and a palm tree by Eggleston. In 1994, Eggleston allowed his long-time friend and fellow photographer [[Terry Manning]] to use two Eggleston photographs for the front and back covers of the CD release of ''Christopher Idylls'', an album of ethereal acoustic guitar music produced by Manning and performed by another Eggleston friend, Gimmer Nicholson.

In 2006, a William Eggleston image was coincidentally used as both the cover to [[Primal Scream]]'s single &quot;[[Country Girl (Primal Scream song)|Country Girl]]&quot; and the paperback edition of [[Ali Smith]]'s novel ''[[The Accidental]]''. The same picture had already been used on the cover of [[Chuck Prophet]]'s ''Age of Miracles'' album in 2004.

In 2001, William Eggleston's photograph &quot;Memphis (1968)&quot; was used as the cover of [[Jimmy Eat World]]'s top-selling album ''[[Bleed American]]''.  Eggleston's photos also appear on ''[[Tanglewood Numbers]]'' by the [[Silver Jews]], ''[[Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band]]'' by [[Joanna Newsom]] and ''[[Transference (album)|Transference]]'' by [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]].
