It has nearly 4,000,000 active torrents and about 4,200 torrents added daily (compared to runner-up Torrent Portal with 1,500), making it the largest torrent site indexer on the web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comparebt.blogspot.com Ten Most Used BitTorrent Sites Compared (stats from Alexa)]&lt;/ref&gt; Btjunkie is the 5th most popular bittorrent site as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2011-110105/ Top 10 Most Popular Torrent Sites of 2011 (stats from Alexa and Compete)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
BTJunkie indexes both private and public [[BitTorrent_tracker|trackers]] using an automatic web crawler that scans the Internet for torrent files. Cookies are used to track what one downloads  so that the person doesn't need to register in order to rate the torrent. The ratings and feedback given by the person are used to help properly filter and flag malicious torrents uploaded onto the website.
