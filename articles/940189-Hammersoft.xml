<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="940189" ns="0" title="International Nuclear Event Scale"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale''' ('''INES''') was introduced in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Event_scale_revised_for_further_clarity_0510081.html |title=Event scale revised for further clarity |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=6 October 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in order to enable prompt communication of [[nuclear safety|safety]] significance information in case of [[nuclear accident]]s.

The scale is intended to be [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], similar to the [[moment magnitude scale]] that is used to describe the comparative magnitude of earthquakes. Each increasing level represents an accident approximately ten times more severe than the previous level. Compared to earthquakes, where the event intensity can be quantitatively evaluated, the level of severity of a [[man-made disaster]], such as a nuclear accident, is more subject to interpretation.  Because of the difficulty of interpreting, the INES level of an incident is assigned well after the incident occurs. Therefore, the scale has a very limited ability to assist in disaster-aid deployment.

As INES ratings are not assigned by a central body, high-profile nuclear incidents are sometimes assigned INES ratings by the operator, by the formal body of the country, but also by scientific institutes, international authorities or other experts which may lead to confusion as to the actual severity.

==Details==
[[File:INES en.svg|415px|right]]
A number of criteria and indicators are defined to assure coherent reporting of [[nuclear accident|nuclear events]] by different official authorities. There are seven nonzero levels on the INES scale: three ''[[List of civilian nuclear incidents|incident]]''-levels and four ''[[List of civilian nuclear incidents|accident]]''-levels. There is also a level 0.

The level on the scale is determined by the highest of three scores: off-site effects, on-site effects, and [[defence in depth]] degradation.

=== Level 7: Major accident ===
; Impact on people and environment: Major release of radioÂ­active Â­material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended Â­countermeasures

:There have been two such events to date:
:* [[Chernobyl disaster]], 26 April 1986. A power surge during a test procedure resulted in a [[criticality accident]], leading to a powerful steam explosion and fire that released a significant fraction of core material into the environment, resulting in a death toll of 56 as well as estimated 4,000 additional cancer fatalities (official WHO estimate) among people exposed to elevated doses of radiation. As a result, the city of [[Chernobyl (city)|Chernobyl]] (pop. 14,000) was largely abandoned, the larger city of [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]] (pop. 49,400) was completely abandoned, and a 30&amp;nbsp;km [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone|exclusion zone]] was established.

:* [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], a series of events beginning on 11 March 2011. Rated level 7 on 11 April 2011 by the Japanese government's nuclear safety agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/12_05.html | title=Japan to raise Fukushima crisis level to worst | accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/12/us-japan-idUSTRE72A0SS20110412 | title=Japan raises nuclear crisis to same level as Chernobyl | work=Reuters | date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major damage to the backup power and containment systems caused by the [[2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami]] resulted in overheating and leaking from some of the Fukushima I nuclear plant's reactors. Each reactor accident was rated separately; out of the six reactors, three were rated level 5, one was rated at a level 3, and the situation as a whole was rated level 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13045341 | title=Japan: Nuclear crisis raised to Chernobyl level | accessdate=12 April 2011 | work=BBC News | date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exclusion zone of 20&amp;nbsp;km was established around the plant as well as a 30 km voluntary evacuation zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan's government downgrades its outlook for growth|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13058743|accessdate=13 April 2011 | work=BBC News|date=13 April 2011}} The death toll rose to over 15,000 with 8,206  missing and 5,363 injured the numbers are still rising.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]].

{{see also|Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents}}

=== Level 6: Serious accident ===

; Impact on people and environment: Significant release of radioactive material likely to require implementation of planned countermeasures.

:There has been only one such event to date:
:* [[Kyshtym disaster]] at [[Mayak]], Soviet Union, 29 September 1957. A failed cooling system at a military nuclear waste reprocessing facility caused a steam explosion that released 70â80 tons of highly radioactive material into the environment. Impact on local population is not fully known. This is the only accident to go over 5 on the scale besides Chernobyl and Fukushima.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/ines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level 5: Accident with wider consequences ===
; Impact on people and environment: Limited release of radioactive Â­material likely to require iÂ­mplementation of some plannedÂ­ countermeasures.
: Several deaths from Â­radiation.

; Impact on radiological barriers and control: Severe damage to reactor core.
: Release of large quantities of radioactive material within an  installation with a high probability of significant public exposure. This could arise from a major criticality accident or fire.

:Examples:
:* [[Windscale fire]] (United Kingdom), 10 October 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12789749 |title=Fukushima - disaster or distraction? |author=Richard Black |date=18 March 2011 |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] of graphite moderator at a military air-cooled reactor caused the graphite and the metallic uranium fuel to catch fire, releasing radioactive pile material as dust into the environment.
:* [[Three Mile Island accident]] near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] (United States), 28 March 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spiegelberg-Planer|first=Rejane|title=A Matter of Degree|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull511/51102744649.html|work=IAEA Bulletin|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A combination of design and operator errors caused a gradual loss of coolant, leading to a partial [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]. Radioactive gases were released into the atmosphere although no deaths have been attributed to this accident.
:* [[List of civilian nuclear accidents#1950s|First Chalk River accident]],&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Nuclear Society'' (1989) [http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/nrx.html The NRX Incident by Peter Jedicke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNF1952&quot;&gt;''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRX reactor in 1952?]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=for the &quot;Level 5&quot; claim|date=March 2011}} Chalk River, Ontario (Canada), 12 December 1952. Reactor core damaged.
:* [[Lucens reactor|Lucens partial core meltdown]] ([[Switzerland]]), 21 January 1969. A test reactor built in an underground cavern suffered a [[loss-of-coolant accident]] during a startup, leading to a partial [[core meltdown]] and massive [[radioactive contamination]] of the cavern, which was then sealed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
:* [[GoiÃ¢nia accident]] ([[Brazil]]), 13 September 1987. An unsecured [[caesium chloride]] radiation source left in an abandoned hospital was recovered by scavenger thieves unaware of its nature and sold at a scrapyard. 300 people were contaminated and 11 died.

=== Level 4: Accident with local consequences ===

; Impact on people and environment: Minor release of radioactive material unlikely to result in implementation of planned countermeasures other than local food controls.
: At least one death from radiation.

; Impact on radiological barriers and control: Fuel melt or damage to fuel Â­resulting in more than 0.1% release of core inventory.
: Release of significant quantities of radioactive material within an installation with a high Â­probability of significant public exposure.

:Examples:
:* [[Sellafield]] (United Kingdom) â five incidents 1955 to 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=G A M Webb ''et al.'' | title=Classification of events with an off-site radiological impact at the Sellafield site between 1950 and 2000, using the International Nuclear Event Scale | journal=Journal of Radiological Protection | volume=26 | month=March | year=2006 | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0952-4746/26/1/002 | doi=10.1088/0952-4746/26/1/002 | page=33 | pmid=16522943 | issue=1 | bibcode=2006JRP....26...33W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Arrangements for reporting minor events to the public differ from country to country. It is difficult to ensure precise consistency in rating events between INES Level-1 and Below scale/Level-0)

:Examples:
:* [[Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant|Gravelines]] ([[Nord (department)|Nord]], France), 8 August 2009; during the annual [[Nuclear fuel rod|fuel bundle]] exchange in reactor #1, a fuel bundle snagged on to the internal structure.  Operations were stopped, the reactor building was evacuated and isolated in accordance with operating procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) â 10 aoÃ»t 2009 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jDlQI2MpwzTvWT166NetwyFGPyiA |title=AFP: Incident &quot;significatif&quot; Ã  la centrale nuclÃ©aire de Gravelines, dans le Nord |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Tricastin Nuclear Power Center|TNPC]] ([[DrÃ´me]], France), July 2008; leak of {{convert|6000|L}} of water containing {{convert|75|kg}} of [[uranium]] into the environment.
