'''Franck Jurietti'''  (born on 30 March 1975 in [[Valence, DrÃ´me]]) is a former [[France|French]] [[Football (soccer)|football]] defender, who spent most of his career in [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]].

==Career==
===Club career===
Jurietti's professional career started at [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], having already been part of their youth team. However, he did not get to play a single game and was transferred to [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] at the end of the season. There he achieved promotion to [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] for his first year at the club, and on 19 July 1995, he played his first Ligue 1 match against [[FC Metz|Metz]]. At the end of the season, Gueugnon were again relegated, and, after one more year in Ligue 2 where they were unable to achieve back promotion, Jurietti left the club to [[SC Bastia]], where he stayed for three years. 

In 2000, he was transferred to [[AS Monaco|Monaco]] where he was never quite able to settle and after 6 months, he was loaned for the rest of the season to rivals [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. He returned to Monaco for one more season but was then quickly transferred to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], the club in which he has been the most successful so far, winning the championship once (after finishing twice runner-up) and the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] twice. He was the captain during the [[Coupe de la Ligue Final 2009|final]] against [[Vannes OC|Vannes]] that Bordeaux won 4â0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigueFinale2009/|title=Coupe de la Ligue Final 2009|language=French|date=2009-04-25|accessdate=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contract expired in 2010, and he was notified by manager [[Laurent Blanc]] that it would not be renewed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofoot.com/bordeaux-lateraux-en-peril-129349-news.html|title=Bordeaux, latÃ©raux en pÃ©ril|language=French|date=2010-07-19|accessdate=2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively putting an end to his playing career.

===International career===
In 2005, after an excellent start of season with Bordeaux, Jurietti was called up by [[Raymond Domenech]] for the [[France national football team|French national team]] for the final two [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 4|qualifying]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lematin.ma/Actualite/Express/ArticlePrint.asp?id=54845|title=Franck Jurietti, joueur de devoir|language=French|date=2005-10-07|accessdate=2009-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After remaining an unused substitute against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], Jurietti made his international debut on 12 October 2005 during the 4â0 victory against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], but only came on for the last five seconds in what was to remain his sole international appearance. This makes him the French player with the shortest international career ever, ahead of [[Bernard Boissier]], who had played two minutes for France in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foot-news.com/index.php?2006/03/10/150-equipe-de-france-les-records|title=Ãquipe de France : Les records !|language=French|date=2006-03-10|accessdate=2009-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Jurietti can play on both sides of the defence, and has also been known to fill in as a midfielder when called upon. He has developed a reputation for being one of the most Â« dangerous Â» players in the French league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chezlesgirondins.com/effectif/grands-mystere-de-la-science-jurietti/20060923191.html|title=Les grands mystÃ¨res de la Science : Franck Jurietti|language=French|date=2006-09-23|accessdate=2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
