'''Physical attractiveness''' refers to a person's physical traits which are perceived to be [[aesthetic]]ally pleasing or [[beauty|beautiful]]. The term often implies [[sexual attraction|sexual attractiveness]] or desirability, but can also be distinct from the two; for example, humans may regard the young as attractive for various reasons, but without sexual attraction. There are many factors which influence one person's attraction to another, with physical aspects being one of them. In many cases, humans attribute positive characteristics, such as intelligence and honesty, to physically attractive people without consciously realizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dion K, Berscheid E, Walster E |title=What is beautiful is good |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=285â90 |year=1972 |month=December |pmid=4655540 |doi=10.1037/h0033731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, physical attraction can be studied from a number of perspectives, including universal perceptions common to all human [[culture]]s, cultural and [[society|social]] aspects, and individual subjective preferences. Additionally, the perception of attractiveness can have a significant effect on how people are judged in terms of employment or social opportunities, friendship, sexual behavior, and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Kate.

===Youth===
For the Romans especially, &quot;beardlessness&quot; and &quot;smooth young bodies&quot; were considered beautiful to both men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, C. A. (1999). Roman homosexuality: ideologies of masculinity in classical antiquity. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; For Greek and Roman men, the most desirable traits of boys were their &quot;youth&quot; and &quot;hairlessness&quot;. Pubescent boys were considered a socially appropriate object of male desire, while post-pubescent boys were considered to be &quot;á¼Î¾ÏÏÎ¿Î¹&quot; or &quot;past the prime&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt; This was largely in the context of [[pederastry]] (adult male interest in adolescent boys).

Today, men and women's attitudes towards male beauty has changed. For example, body hair on men may even be preferred (see below).

===Waist-to-chest ratio===
The [[mesomorphic]] physique of a slim waist, broad shoulders and muscular chest are often found to be attractive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horvath T |title=Physical attractiveness: the influence of selected torso parameters |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21â4 |year=1981 |month=February |pmid=7212994 | doi=10.1007/BF01542671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to rate other men, both heterosexual and homosexual men found low waist-to-chest ratios (WCR) to be more attractive on other men with the gay men showing a preference for lower WCR (more V-shaped) than the straight men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swami V, TovÃ©e MJ |title=The Muscular Male: A Comparison of the Physical Attractiveness Preferences of Gay and Heterosexual Men |journal=International Journal of Men's Health |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=59â71 |year=2008 |doi=10.3149/jmh.0701.59 |url=http://mensstudies.metapress.com/content/82q0r82475q38h50/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genitalia===
Studies based in China, England, the United States, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, Spain, and France have suggested that women consider men more attractive whose erect [[penis]] is longer and thicker.&lt;ref name=MPaley&gt;{{Cite book |last=Paley |first=Maggie |title=The Book of the Penis |origyear=2000 |edition=first |year=2000 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |pages=232, 16â19 |isbn= 0802116485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height and erect posture===
Females' sexual attraction towards males may be determined by the [[Human height|height]] of the man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;&gt;Pierce, C.A. 1996; Cunningham, M.R. 1990; Pawlowski B, Dunbar RI, Lipowicz A 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Height in men is associated with status or wealth in many cultures (in particular those where malnutrition is common),&lt;ref name=&quot;height&quot;/&gt; which is beneficial to women romantically involved with them. One study conducted of women's personal ads support the existence of this preference; the study found that in ads requesting height in a mate, 80% requested a height of {{convert|6.00|ft|m}}  or taller.&lt;ref name=&quot;height&quot;/&gt; However, this percentage was only of ads specifying height, and therefore possibly self-selected and/or biased by a third factor such as female height. Recent studies have shown that heterosexual women often prefer men taller than they are, rather than a man with above average height. While women usually desire men to be at least the same height as themselves or taller, several other factors also determine male attractiveness, and the male-taller norm is not universal.&lt;ref name=Sear09&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sear R, Marlowe FW |title=How universal are human mate choices?

Additionally, women seem more receptive to an erect posture than men, though both prefer it as an element of [[beauty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;height&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Buss |first=David |title=The Evolution of Desire |origyear=1994 |edition=second |year=2003 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |pages=38â40 |isbn=0465077501}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study (Yee N., 2002), gay men who identify as &quot;Only [[Top, bottom and versatile#Top|Tops]]&quot; tend to prefer shorter men, while gay men who identify as &quot;Only [[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|Bottoms]]&quot; tend to prefer taller men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yee&quot;&gt;Yee, N.

Michael R.

The females judged to be most attractive may have such similar facial features that they were hard to distinguish one from another (Light, Hollander, &amp; Kayra-Stuart, 1981). Cross-cultural investigations on the judgment of facial attractiveness tended to highlight societal differences, but rough agreements in facial aesthetic preferences were shown by Asian-American and Caucasian females (Wagatsuma &amp; Kleinke, 1979), Chinese, Indian, and English females judging Greek males (Thakerar &amp; Iwawaki, 1979), South African and American males and females (Morse, Gruzen, &amp; Reis, 1976), and blacks and whites judging males and females from both races (Cross &amp; Cross, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast symmetry may be particularly sensitive to developmental disturbances and the symmetry differences for breasts are large compared to other body parts. Women who have more symmetrical breasts tend to have more children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.3390/sym2021081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buttocks===
Biological anthropologist, [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen B. Fisher]] of the Center for Human Evolution Studies in the Department of Anthropology of [[Rutgers University]], said that, &quot;perhaps&quot;, &quot;the fleshy, rounded [[buttocks]]... attracted males during [[Sex positions#Penetrating from behind|rear-entry intercourse]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, H.B. (1982). The Sex Contract - The Evolution of Human Behavior. New York: William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbi S. Low et al. of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the [[University of Michigan]], said the female &quot;buttocks evolved in the context of females competing for the attention and parental commitment of powerful resource-controlling males&quot; as an &quot;honest display of fat reserves&quot; that could not be confused with another type of tissue,&lt;ref name=&quot;Caro&quot; /&gt; although T. M. Caro, professor in the Center for Population Biology and the Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology, at [[University of California, Davis]], rejected that as being a necessary conclusion, stating that female fatty deposits on the hips improve &quot;individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the female&quot;, regardless of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caro&quot;&gt;Caro, T.M. &amp; D.

In the United States, women overestimate men's preferences for thinness in a mate. In one study, American women were asked to choose what their ideal build was and what they thought the build most attractive to men was. Women chose slimmer than average figures for both choices. When American men were independently asked to choose the female build most attractive to them, the men chose figures of average build. This indicates that women may be misled as to how thin men prefer women to be.&lt;ref name=&quot;build&quot;/&gt; Some speculate that thinness as a beauty standard is one way in which women judge each other.&lt;ref name=tws6nov09&gt;{{Cite news

===Height===

Most men tend to be taller than their female partner.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/procroysoc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that, in Western societies, most men prefer shorter women, tend to view taller women as less attractive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scar&quot;&gt;Scar, R. Height and Reproductive Success: How a Gambian Population Compares to the West. Human Nature Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and people view couples where the woman is taller to be less ideal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scar&quot;/&gt; Women who are 0.7 to 1.7 [[standard deviations]] below the mean female height have been reported to be the most reproductively successful,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2190461.stm ''BBC News'': &quot;Tall men 'top husband stakes{{'&quot;}}]&lt;/ref&gt; since fewer tall women get married compared to shorter women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scar&quot; /&gt;

However, in some non-Western cultures, height is irrelevant in choosing a mate, which suggests that the preference among Western men for women shorter than themselves may be sociocultural in nature.&lt;ref name=Sear09/&gt;

===Leg-to-body ratio===

A study using Polish participants by Sorokowski found 5% longer legs than an individual used as a reference was considered most attractive.&lt;ref name=tws19jan&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sorokowskia P, Pawlowskib B |title=Adaptive preferences for leg length in a potential partner |journal=Evol Hum Behav |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=86â91 |date=March 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.09.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513807000906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded this preference might stem from the influence of leggy runway models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorokowski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sorokowski P |title=Attractiveness of Legs Length in Poland and Great Britain |journal=J Hum Ecol |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=148 |year=2010 |url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JHE/JHE-31-0-000-10-Web/JHE-31-3-000-10-Abst-PDF/JHE-31-3-145-10-1996-Sorokowski-P/JHE-31-3-145-10-1996-Sorokowski-P-Tt.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sorokowski study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Dr. Marco Bertamini felt were unrealistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertamini&quot; /&gt;

===Skin tone and skin radiance===
{{main|Human skin color#Social status and racism}} 
A preference for lighter-skinned women has remained prevalent over time, even in cultures without European contact, though exceptions have been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost&quot;&gt;Peter Frost &quot;Fair Women, Dark Men: The Forgotten Roots of Color Prejudice,&quot; (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Peter Frost stated that since higher-ranking men were allowed to marry the perceived more attractive women, who tended to have fair skin, the upper classes of a society generally tended to develop a lighter complexion than the lower classes by [[sexual selection]] (see also [[Fisherian runaway]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sailer&quot;&gt;see Steve Sailer, [http://vdare.com/sailer/050612_blondes.htm Blondes Have Deeper Roots] (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dixson&gt;Dixson, Barnaby.

Some evolutionary psychologists, including David Buss, have argued that this long-term relationship difference may be consequence of ancestral humans who selected partners based on [[secondary sexual characteristics]], as well as general indicators of fitness which allowed for greater reproductive success as a result of higher fertility in those partners,&lt;ref&gt;Symons D. 1995.

According to strategic pluralism theory, men may have correspondingly evolved to pursue reproductive strategies that are contingent on their own physical attractiveness. More physically attractive men accrue reproductive benefits from spending more time seeking multiple mating partners and relatively less time investing in offspring. In contrast, the reproductive effort of physically less attractive men, who therefore will not have the same mating opportunities, is better allocated either to investing heavily in accruing resources, or investing in their mates and offspring and spending relatively less time seeking additional mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1177/0146167207303022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have suggested that people are generally attracted to people who [[Interpersonal attraction#Similarity (like-attracts-like)|look like them]]&lt;ref&gt;(Locke &amp; Horowitz, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and they generally evaluate faces that exhibit features of their own ethnic or racial group as being more attractive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bereczkei&quot; /&gt; Although both men and women use children's &quot;facial resemblance&quot; to themselves in &quot;attractiveness judgments,&quot; a greater percentage of women in one study (37% n=30) found hypothetical children whose faces were &quot;self-morphs&quot; of themselves as most attractive when compared to men (30% n=23).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=DeBruine LM |title=Resemblance to self increases the appeal of child faces to both men and women |journal=Evol Hum Behav |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=142â154 |date=May 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2004.03.003 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513804000194}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested there was a &quot;Caucasian beauty standard&quot; spreading worldwide because of the proliferation of the Western entertainment industry.&lt;ref name=twsO66f2/&gt;

The more similar a judged person is toward the judging person, the more the former is liked. However, this effect can be reversed. This might depend on how attractivity is conceptualized: similar members (compared to dissimilar ones) of the opposite sex are judged as more likeable in a prosocial sense. Again, findings are more ambiguous when looking for the desiring, pleasure related component of attractivness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.3003 | last1 = DeBruine | first1 = L.M. |year = 2005 | title = Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: context-specific effects of facial resemblance | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society.

==Social effects==
Perceptions of physical attractiveness contribute to generalized assumptions based on those attractions. Across cultures, what is beautiful is assumed to be good; attractive people are assumed to be more extroverted, popular, and happy. This could lead to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], as from a young age, attractive people receive more attention that helps them develop these characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cash&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cash TF, Gillen B, Burns DS |title=Sexism and beautyism in personnel consultant decision making |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=301â310 |date=June 1977 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.62.3.301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, M.S.; &amp; Mills, J. (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, beautiful people were found to be generally happier than less beautiful or plain people, perhaps because beauty led to increased economic benefits which partially explained the increased happiness.&lt;ref name=twsO66f4a/&gt;

However, attractiveness varies by society; in ancient China, a small foot was considered attractive, so [[foot binding]] was practiced by confining young girls' feet in tightly bound shoes to prevent the feet from growing to normal size.&lt;ref name=tws6nov02&gt;{{Cite news |author=Jonathan E. Berman (letter to the editor) |title= Understand Female Genital Mutilation, Yes, but Don't Condone It |quote=The desired mark of beauty, put in plain language, was a set of withered or amputated toes at the end of crippled feet, which were jammed into the smallest possible slipper. |work=New York Times |date=November 30, 1993 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/30/opinion/l-understand-female-genital-mutilation-yes-but-don-t-condone-it-015393.html |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, women used to wear corsets that severely constricted their breathing and damaged vital internal organs, in order to achieve a visual effect of an exaggeratedly low Waist-to-Hip ratio.

People make judgments of physical attractiveness based on what they see, but also on what they know about the person. Specifically, perceptions of beauty are malleable such that information about the person's personality traits can influence one's assessment of another person's physical beauty. A 2007 study had participants first rate pictures for attractiveness. After doing distracting math problems, participants saw the pictures again, but with information about the person's personality. When participants learned that a person had positive personality characteristics (e.g., smart, funny, kind), that person was seen as more physically attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Personality goes a long way: The malleability of opposite-sex physical attractiveness |first=Gary |last=Lewandowski |first2=Art |last2=Aron |first3=Julie |last3=Gee |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=14 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=571â585 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.2007.00172.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a person with negative personality characteristics (e.g., materialistic, rude, untrustworthy) was seen as less physically attractive. This was true for both females and males.

Physical attractiveness can have various effects. A survey conducted by [[London Guildhall University]] of 11,000 people showed that those who subjectively describe themselves as physically attractive earn more income than others who would describe themselves as less attractive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/07/08/looks/ Do Pretty People Earn More from cnn.com&lt;/ref&gt; People who described themselves as less attractive earned, on average, 13% less than those who described themselves as more attractive, while the penalty for being overweight was around 5%. It is important to note that other factors such as self-confidence may explain or influence these findings as they are based on self-reported attractiveness as opposed to any sort of objective criteria; however, as one's self-confidence and [[self-esteem]] are largely learned from how one is regarded by his/her peers while maturing, even these considerations would suggest a significant role for physical appearance. One writer speculated that &quot;the distress created in women by the spread of unattainable ideals of female beauty&quot; might possibly be linked to increasing incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=tws6nov18&gt;{{Cite news |author=Daniel Goleman |title=A Rising Cost Of Modernity: Depression |quote=Competing explanations range from a loss of beliefs in God or an afterlife that can buffer people against life's setbacks, to the stresses of industrialization, to the distress created in women by the spread of unattainable ideals of female beauty, to exposure to toxic substances. |work=New York Times |date=December 8, 1992 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/08/science/a-rising-cost-of-modernity-depression.html |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have asserted that certain advantages tend to come to those who are perceived as being more attractive, including the ability to get better jobs and promotions; receiving better treatment from authorities and the [[legal system]]; having more choices in romantic partners and, therefore, more power in relationships; and marrying into families with more money.&lt;ref name=twsO66e/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsO66f4a&gt;{{cite news

Concern for improving physical attractiveness has led many persons to consider alternatives such as [[cosmetic surgery]]. It has led scientists working with related disciplines such as [[computer imaging]] and [[mathematics]] to conduct research to suggest ways to surgically alter a face in terms of distances between facial features, to make it closer to an ideal face with &quot;agreed-upon standards of attractiveness&quot;, by using algorithms to suggest an alternative which still resembles the current face.&lt;ref name=twsO52&gt;{{cite news
