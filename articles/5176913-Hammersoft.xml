'''[[French American]]s''' are [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]] or [[nationality|nationals]] of [[French people|French descent]] and heritage. The majority of Franco-American families did not arrive directly from France, but rather settled French territories in the New World (primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries) before moving to the United States later on (see [[Quebec diaspora]] and [[Great Upheaval]]). About thirteen million U.S. residents are of French descent, and about 1.5 million of them speak the French language at home. Being isolated, mixed with different cultures, or ignored, the French-Americans developed particular cultures that reflect varying degrees of adaptation of their environments. This gave birth to streams of French-Americans like the Acadians, the Cajuns (literally ''Acadian'' pronounced with a southern accent), Louisiana CrÃ©oles and many others.

The following is a list of '''notable French Americans''', including both original immigrants who obtained American citizenship and their American descendants.

If so, how? John Dufresne: It is this primal landscape that shapes us as it shapes the characters in our stories. &quot;You write from where you are,&quot; William Stafford said. I write from being a French Canadian/American who grew up on what had been called French Hill until the Irish and Italians muscled us out. And then it was Grafton Hill. Novelist David Plante, author of novels about growing up French Canadian not far from my home, says: &quot;Franco-American culture is gone, and perhaps the only way to have written about it was to believe it was over even while it was being written about. Les vrais paradis sont les paradis perdus might have been said by Proust about an entirely different world, but it appliesâwith the difference that the Franco past was never a paradise.&quot; Grafton Hill was in the fifties and sixties as exclusively Catholic and blue collar as neighborhoods get. Jobs ran to the trades, factories, and public service. There were no dancers or brain surgeons, actors, or professors among the French Canadians on the Hill.&quot; {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
