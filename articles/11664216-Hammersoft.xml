'''Mark Umbers''' (born 17 June 1973) is an English actor known for his work in theatre, films, and television.

Born in [[Harrogate]], Yorkshire, Umbers was brought up in [[Wetherby]]. In 1991 he enrolled at [[Oxford University]] to study Latin and Greek Literature and Philosophy. He appeared in many student [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] productions, as well as in George Bernard Shaw's ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', in which he played Freddy, a role he would reprise a decade later in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London.

Umbers' first professional theatre engagement was in [[Joseph Papp]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. Director [[Trevor Nunn]] included him in the ensemble of the 1999 season at the Royal National Theatre, where he appeared in ''[[Candide]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', which was filmed for broadcast by the BBC. Various television roles followed, including a lead in the BBC period drama ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' opposite [[Richard E. Grant]].

Following ''My Fair Lady'', Umbers appeared in Noel Coward's ''The Vortex'', directed by [[Michael Grandage]] at the [[Donmar Warehouse]]. The high-profile production led him to be cast in his first leading film role by [[Mike Barker]], opposite [[Helen Hunt]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]] in ''[[A Good Woman (film)|A Good Woman]]'', an adaptation of Oscar Wilde's ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]''. After playing opposite [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Terence Stamp]] and [[Lauren Bacall]] in the British independent film ''[[These Foolish Things]]'' and with [[John Malkovich]] in ''[[Colour Me Kubrick]]'', he played the lead role of [[Perkin Warbeck]] in [[Channel 4]]'s historical drama ''Princes in the Tower''.

A brief cameo in Woody Allen's ''[[Cassandra's Dream]]'' followed, after which director [[Rupert Goold]] cast Umbers as Jim O' Connor in Tennessee Williams' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' in the [[West End theatre|West End]] opposite [[Jessica Lange]]. He was longlisted for the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Award]] Best Actor Award for his performance.  Later that year [[Steven Soderbergh]] cast Umbers as British journalist George Roth in ''[[Che: Part Two]]''.

The following year Umbers starred in [[Chichester Festival Theatre]]'s 2008 revival of ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'', playing [[Nick Arnstein]] opposite [[Samantha Spiro]] as [[Fanny Brice]].  Soon afterwards he played heart surgeon Dan Tate opposite [[Sarah Parish]] in the second series of the [[BBC1]] drama ''[[Mistresses (TV series)|Mistresses]]'' and The Master in the BBC1 2009 reworking of Henry James' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.

Umbers starred opposite [[Tamzin Outhwaite]] in the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]]'s revival of ''[[Sweet Charity]]'', playing Charlie, Vittorio Vidal and Oscar Lindquist: the first production to have cast the same actor in all the love-interest roles.  The production opened on 2 December 2009 and transferred to the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] on 3 May 2010 where it ran for six months, closing on 6 November 2010.
