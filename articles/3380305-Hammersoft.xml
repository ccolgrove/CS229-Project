'''WNIN''' is a public [[television station]] in [[Evansville, Indiana]], broadcasting locally on channel 9 as a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station. The station is owned by WNIN Tri-State Public Media, who also owns [[sister station]] [[WNIN-FM]], the local [[National Public Radio|NPR]] member station.

WNIN signed on for the first time on [[1970 in television|March 5, 1970]].  After a few months as a member of [[National Educational Television]], it joined PBS in October.

WNIN also programs and transmits two local cable channels: WNIN Learn (Cable 12) and WNIN Create (Cable 13). These channels are available on two local [[cable TV]] operators (Insight and WOW - Wide Open West).  WNIN Learn airs local [[Government-access television]] (GATV) for Vanderburgh County and Evansville City government meetings produced off-site inside the Carpenter House via remote-controlled cameras located in the Vanderburgh County Civic Center. WNIN Learn also airs repeats of some [[PBS Kids]] programs. WNIN Create simulcasts the national PBS [[Create_(TV_network)|Create]] channel which features how-to, creative and cooking programs.

Local programs produced by WNIN include &quot;Lawmakers&quot; and &quot;Newsmakers&quot; (hosted by [[Evansville Courier &amp; Press]] editor Mizell Stewart III), &quot;Tri-State FOCUS&quot; (hosted by Cameron Kinzer), as well as various live debates and local documentaries. As of 2010, all local programming is available online via the station's implementation of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] COVE platform.

The station broadcasts from The Carpenter House in downtown Evansville, which is on the [[United States]] [[National Register of Historic Places]].

David Dial is the general manager for WNIN.
