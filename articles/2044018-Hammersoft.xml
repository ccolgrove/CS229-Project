The '''''Aerotrain''''' was a streamlined trainset introduced by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1193407177 Magazine advertisement introducing the Aerotrain], Saturday Evening Post, December 10, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all of GM's body designs of this mid-century era, this train was first brought to life in GM's Styling Section. [[Chuck Jordan]] was in charge of designing the Aerotrain as Chief Designer of Special Projects. It utilized the experimental [[EMD LWT12]] locomotive ({{US Patent|D177814}}), coupled to a set of modified [[GMC (General Motors division)|GM Truck &amp; Coach Division]] 40-seat intercity [[bus]] coach bodies ({{US Patent|D179006}}). The cars each rode on two axles with an [[air suspension]] system, which was intended to give a smooth ride but had the opposite effect.

The two ''Aerotrain'' demonstrator sets logged over {{convert|600000|mi|km}} and saw service on the following railroads:
*the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]];
*the [[New York Central Railroad]];
*the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]; and
*the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].

In February 1956, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] introduced the ''Pennsy Aerotrain'' between [[New York City]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], operating it for nine months.  Pennsylvania Railroad's schedule was timed so that westbound passengers traversed [[Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)|Horseshoe Curve]] at lunchtime, while eastbound passengers traversed the curve at dinner time.&lt;ref name=Wayner /&gt;

The same year, ''Aerotrain'' No. 2 was leased as a demonstrator to the New York Central, and operated between [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].  

In March 1956, the Aerotrain made a series of experimental runs for the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] in [[California]] as a ''[[San Diegan]]'' consist, running between [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]].  Thoughts of placing it in permanent service were subsequently abandoned, however, because the entire trainset had to be turned around at each end of the line, and the train required helper locomotives on the ATSF's Sorrento Grade north of San Diego.

In the summer of 1957 the Aerotrain was operated by the Union Pacific as the ''[[City of Las Vegas]]'', running between [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  The train eventually found itself relegated to Chicago commuter service on the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]].

GM's &quot;lightweight with a heavyweight future&quot; was introduced at a time when U.S. passenger train revenues were steadily declining due to competition from airlines and private automobile travel. Although it featured an eye-catching, streamlined design, the ''Aerotrain'' failed to capture the imagination of the [[United States|American]] public. The cars, based on GM bus designs and using an air cushioning system, were rough riding and not very comfortable for the passengers. The design of the locomotive section rendered even routine maintenance extremely difficult and time-consuming. The locomotive unit was also underpowered. Eventually, both trainsets were retired in 1966 after only a decade's use.  The [[Museum of Transportation]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and the [[National Railroad Museum]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] each have one of the locomotives, and two of the cars.

[[Disneyland]] operated a scale version of the ''Aerotrain'', known as the ''Viewliner'', from 1957 to 1959 (see below). Since 1958, the [[Washington Park and Zoo Railway]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] has operated a scale, diesel-powered replica of the ''Aerotrain'' (dubbed the ''Zooliner'') to transport zoo patrons along the railroad.

==The ''Viewliner''==
{{Main|Disneyland Railroad}}

On June 26, 1957, the narrow-gauge '''Santa Fe and Disneyland ''Viewliner''''' (billed by Disneyland as &quot;the fastest miniature train in the world&quot;) commenced operation. Two separate trains, designed and built as scale replicas of the futuristic ''Aerotrain'', traveled along a figure-eight track through parts of [[Tomorrowland]] and [[Fantasyland]] parallel to a portion of the DLRR main line. The Tomorrowland train featured cars that were named for the [[planet]]s, while the cars of the Fantasyland train were named after various Disney characters.

The modern, streamlined trains were placed into service to represent the future of rail travel, in contrast to the steam-powered DLRR which represented its past. Motive power for each train consisted of an integral head-end unit driven by an [[Oldsmobile]] [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|&quot;Rocket&quot; V8]] gasoline engine. Oldsmobile also furnished the windscreen, doors and instrument console for each of the two 5,000&amp;nbsp;lb (2,300&amp;nbsp;kg) locomotives. The attraction operated until September 15, 1958, when construction began on the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds|Matterhorn]] and [[Submarine Voyage]]; the [[Disneyland Monorail System]] ultimately took the place of the ''Viewliner'' in June of the following year.

==The ''Zooliner''==
The Zooliner, one of three trains on the [[Washington Park and Zoo Railway]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], is a scale replica of Aerotrain. Zooliner was placed in service in 1958. On June 14, 2008, the Oregon Zoo held a &quot;50th Birthday&quot; celebration for the locomotive and it remains the primary train for the zoo.
