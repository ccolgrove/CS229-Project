===Softball===
{{Main|Arizona State Sun Devils Softball}}

One of the nation's founding programs, the two-time NCAA national champion Sun Devils are in their 45th season on the diamond. ASU has recorded twenty-seven seasons of 30 or more wins and twelve with 40 or more, including an all-time high of 66 wins in 2008. The Sun Devils have appeared in 23 NCAA tournaments (33 postseason bids overall) and have made nine trips to the [[Women's College World Series]]. Prior to the current NCAA format, ASU went to seven WCWS, claiming back-to-back national tiles in 1972 and 1973. Arizona State's storied tradition of softball excellence continues to flourish under head coach Clint Myers, who has led the Sun Devils to two NCAA national championships. Myers joined Linda Vollstedt (womenâs golf â 7), Greg Kraft (womenâs track &amp; field indoor â 2, womenâs track &amp; field outdoor â 1, menâs indoor track &amp; field â 1), [[Bobby Winkles]] (baseball â 3) and [[Jim Brock]] (baseball â 2) as Sun Devil coaches with more than one NCAA title. 

The Sun Devils capped off the 2008 season with their first WCWS NCAA national championship on June 3, 2008. [[Kaitlin Cochran]] hit a three-run home run, [[Katie Burkhart]] pitched a four-hitter and Arizona State routed Texas A&amp;M 11â0 to win the title. Cochran slammed the first pitch from Megan Gibson over the left field fence in the fifth inning to give the sixth-seeded Sun Devils a 4â0 lead in the fifth inning. The margin ended up matching the second-most lopsided game in Women's College World Series history.

On June 7, 2011, the Sun Devils captured their second NCAA national championship by defeating the Florida Gators. ASU pitcher, Dallas Escobedo, became the first freshman pitcher to lead a team to the NCAA title since 1990.

===Wrestling===
ASU has had a very successful wrestling team. The Sun Devils have captured one NCAA team national championship (1988), eight individual championships, and 100 total All American honors.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrestlinginfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-wrestl/stats/082904aaf.html|title=ASU wrestling championships}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable alumni include several MMA stars, such as [[Dan Severn]], [[Cain Velasquez]], [[Ryan Bader]], [[Aaron Simpson]], [[Dan Henderson]], [[Clifford Starks]] and [[C.B. Dollaway]].

On May 13, 2008, the university announced it will drop the sport of Wrestling as well as Men's Tennis and Men's Swimming to save more than $1 million in operational costs. Just 10 days after the announcement to drop three sports, Arizona State announced it was reinstating the varsity wrestling program. The announcement came as local and civic sponsorship was announced as the reason to bring the sport back.

As of May 2010, the schools have met 432 times on the baseball diamond, dating back over 100 years to the first contest in 1907. Arizona, recognizing victories against club teams (ASU did not adopt varsity baseball until 1959)&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asunews.asu.edu/20100510_Baseball_vsBYU_UA |title=Baseball hosts BYU before facing UA &amp;#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims the all-time series 233â198â1.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArizonaASUBaseball&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arizonawildcats.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/031808aaa.html|title=Arizona vs. ASU Baseball Record }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASU, recognizing only varsity baseball competition (beginning in 1959), claims a 179â115 edge in the all-time series (as of May 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

The annual football rivalry game between the two schools is known as &quot;The Duel in the Desert.&quot; It is one of the most heated rivalries in college football.

The school adopted the moniker, the Sun Devils, on November 20, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesundevils.cstv.com/trads/asu-trads-sparky.html |title=Arizona State Official Athletic Site â Traditions |publisher=Thesundevils.cstv.com |date=November 8, 1946 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Arizona State became a university in 1958, the Sun Devils lead the rivalry series over the [[University of Arizona Wildcats]] by a record of 29â23â1.
