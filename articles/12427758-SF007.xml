[[Image:Joe Biden official portrait crop.jpg|thumb|Joe Biden]]

[[Joe Biden]] is the  Vice President of the United States and former [[United States Senate|senator]] from the US state of [[Delaware]]. He served in the Senate from 1973 until 2009 and made his [[Joe Biden presidential campaign, 2008|second run]] for President of the United States in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Biden was announced as Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]'s [[running mate]] on August 23, 2008, and was elected Vice President on November 4, 2008.

The following are the '''political positions of Joe Biden''' on an assortment of issues.

==Social issues==
===Abortion, stem cell research, cloning===
Joe Biden believes that the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision should remain intact. He is quoted as saying, &quot;The best policy for our country on the question of abortion is a policy of Government neutrality. Put another way: I do not believe that the government should be involved in making judgments on whether a woman can, or should have an abortion, or â if she chooses to do so â in paying for that abortion.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In September 2008, Biden was barred, by [[Joseph Francis Martino]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton|bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania]], from receiving [[Holy Communion]] in the [[diocese]] because of his support for [[abortion rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Kirkpatrick |title=Abortion Issue Again Dividing Catholic Votes  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/us/politics/17catholics.html?bl&amp;ex=1221883200&amp;en=1e3acb5115249581&amp;ei=5087%0A |work=The New York Times |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Senator Joe Biden addresses SEIU.jpg|thumb|Joe Biden at Gallaudet University in Washington DC, USA]]
He has joined with Democrats in voting against [[parental notification]] and a ban on abortions on military bases. Biden's record on abortion includes receiving a 100% rating from [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] in four of the last five years, although he received a 36% as recently as 2003. Biden pledged that he would appoint [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] justices that share his beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;prochoiceamerica&quot;/&gt; He has also stated his opposition to the [[Mexico City Policy]], and voted in favor of the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]] in 1994. Biden supports federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]] and voted to expand development and voted against a 1998 ban on [[human cloning]].

===Capital punishment===
Biden supports capital punishment. He authored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which expanded the number of crimes subject to the federal death penalty. However, he voted against limiting appeals in capital cases and also opposed the rejection of racial statistics in death penalty appeals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Crime===
Joe Biden has been given a 71% approval rating from [[Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education]] (CURE) indicating a pro-rehab record on [[Crime in the United States|crime]]. He voted in support of funding for the [[Community Oriented Policing Services]] (COPS) program. He voted for the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], which greatly increased the number of federal crimes punishable by the death penalty and [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act#Elimination of inmate education|abolished education grants for prisoners]]. Biden also voted against limiting death penalty appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Joe_Biden_Crime.htm |title=Joe Biden on Crime |publisher=Ontheissues.org |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voted for expanding the definition of [[hate crimes]] and also imposing heavier punishments. Biden supports a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] registry for [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glassbooth.org/explore/index/joe-biden/2/crime-and-punishment/3/ |title=Joe Biden on Crime and Punishment |accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug law===
[[Image:Senator Joe Biden.jpg|thumb|Joe Biden in [[New Hampshire]]]]

Biden favors diverting drug offenders out of the nation's [[Incarceration in the United States|prison system]]. He is ostensibly against making stricter laws for drug offenses, but helped in the creation of a [[Drug Czar]], a government official overseeing all [[War on Drugs|anti-drug operations]]. According to his campaign website, he is for increased penalties against those caught selling drugs within 1000&amp;nbsp;feet of schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Joe_Biden_Drugs.htm | title=Joe Biden on Drugs }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the drafter and chief sponsor of the [[RAVE Act]], a law that aimed to crack down on [[MDMA]]-fueled raves, but which critics called too broad in scope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foxnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,58663,00.html | publisher=Fox News |title=Raving Lunacy|date=July 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law, which was later renamed the [[Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act]] of 2003, was additionally controversial because it was passed without public hearing or debate in Congress, attached to an unrelated child protection bill. Critics of the law assert that it has since been used by agents of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] to intimidate those organizing rallies and fund-raisers to support drug-law reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voted in favor of Educational Savings Accounts. In regard to the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], Biden stated,
{{quote|Classrooms are too big; we need smaller classrooms, period.
A lot of teachers are going to be retiring. We need a program where we attract the best and brightest students coming out of our colleges to be teachers, and pay them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that the program is underfunding the education system.

===Environment===
He co-sponsored the &quot;Sense of the Senate&quot; resolution calling on the United States to be a part of the United Nations climate negotiations and the &quot;[[Barbara Boxer|Boxer]]-[[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act&quot;, the most stringent climate bill in the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Grist Jan 3, 2008 retrieved May 4, 2008 http://www.grist.org/feature/2007/08/29/biden_factsheet/&lt;/ref&gt; He voted &quot;Yes&quot; on a $3.1B for emergency oil assistance for [[hurricane]]-hit areas and &quot;No&quot; for drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] on national security grounds and defunding renewable and solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;On the Issues retrieved May 4, 2008 http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Joe_Biden.htm#Energy_+_Oil&lt;/ref&gt;

Biden supports the creation of a new treaty on [[climate change]] that would require emissions reductions from developing countries such as [[Brazil]], India, China, and [[Mexico]]. He has also stated his support for investment in technologies to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, as well as the creation of a [[Emissions trading|&quot;cap and trade&quot; system]]. Biden supports the promotion of [[renewable energy]], including [[biodiesel]] fuels but not [[ethanol]].

===Gun issues===
Biden was given an &quot;F&quot; by the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) showing an anti-[[gun ownership]] voting record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrapvf.org/News/Article.aspx?ID=229|title=Unleashed: 20/20 hindsight|date=January 11, 2007|accessdate=August 25, 2008|publisher=National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports reinstating a Federal ban on various [[assault weapons|semi-automatic rifles]] and voted against prohibition of lawsuits against gun manufacturers. He has also voted to end what gun-control activists call the &quot;[[Gun show#The &quot;Gun Show Loophole&quot;|gun show loophole]]&quot;, stating that no one should be able to walk into a gun show and buy a gun more easily than they could at a normal store.

===Health===
Biden was given a 100% approval rating from the [[American Public Health Association]] (APHA). He supports funding for [[Health care in the United States|health care]] to allow all people access. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Homeland security===
After the April 19, 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], a domestic terrorist bomb attack that destroyed the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]], Biden drafted anti-terrorist legislation, which was ultimately defeated. He later claimed publicly on several occasions that the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] â which eased restrictions on the [[Executive branch]] in the surveillance and detention of those suspected of terrorism or facilitating it â was essentially a duplicate of the anti-terrorist legislation he had drafted years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/rhetorical-question | title = Rhetorical Question | author=Michael Crowley | publisher=The New Republic | date = October 22, 2001 | accessdate =August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biden supported the [[PATRIOT Act]] but voted to limit [[wiretapping]] on the bill. He supports implementing the [[9/11 Commission]]'s recommendations to fight terrorists but voted to preserve [[habeas corpus]] rights to the alleged terror suspects serving in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]]. In the 1990s he voted in favor of 36 vetoed military projects and supports efforts to prevent [[nuclear proliferation]]. He was given a 60% approval rating from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] reflecting a mixed voting record on [[civil rights]] issues. During a debate on November 15, 2007 Biden clarified the effect of the PATRIOT Act and his continued support for it and his opposition to [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/14820/democratic_debate_transcript_las_vegas_nevada.html?breadcrumb=%2Fbios%2F1451%2Fjoseph_r_biden_jr |title=Democratic Debate Transcript, Las Vegas, Nevada â Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
Biden supported the 2007 [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007|Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill]]. He supports [[Guest worker program|guest-worker visas]], and the building of a wall along the border as a deterrent to drug trafficking. He voted to provide [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to [[illegal immigrants]] and supports a path to citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00130#name | title = U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records | accessdate =July 26, 2010 | quote = Biden (D-DE), Yea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet privacy and file sharing===
[[CNET.com]] gave Biden a 37.5% in its Technology Issues Voter's Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2009-1040-6130830.html?hhTest=1|title=Technology voter guide 2006 â Mapping Congress' voting records | CNET News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to Biden as &quot;Pro-[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]&quot; and &quot;Pro-[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]&quot; in his [[file sharing]] and privacy stances. Biden sponsored a bill that would make it a [[felony]] to record [[internet radio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Senators-aim-to-restrict-Net,-satellite-radio-recording/2100-1028_3-6149915.html?hhTest=1|title=Senators aim to restrict Net, satellite radio recording - CNET News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2009}} and signed a letter that urged the [[United States Department of Justice]] to prosecute file sharers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politechbot.com/docs/congress.p2p.letter.081002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Biden also sponsored two bills, the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:s.00266: Comprehensive Counter Terrorism Act] (SB 266) and the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:s.00618: Violent Crime Control Act] (SB 618), both of which contained language seen as effectively banning [[encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/cnet/20080824/tc_cnet/83011357831002416338 |title=Joe Biden&amp;#39;s pro-RIAA, pro-FBI tech voting record â Yahoo!

===LGBT issues===
Biden voted in favor of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=104&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00280 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but against the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00163 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports states rights to establish [[civil unions]].

Biden voted in favor of &quot;[[Don't Ask Don't Tell]]&quot;, but more recently said that it would soon be repealed, adding that &quot;no one asks if you're gay in a [[defensive fighting position|foxhole]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Joe_Biden.htm |title=Joe Biden on the Issues |publisher=Ontheissues.org |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Mormonism]]===
[[Joe Biden]] said; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision,&quot; Biden told an audience at the University of Pittsburgh. &quot;It is not. It is embarrassing and we should be ashamed, anyone who thinks that way,&quot; he said in a long response to a student's question about how his own religious faith affected his philosophy of government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/04/us-usa-campaign-biden-romney-idUSTRE7A371Q20111104 Biden defends Romney's Mormon faith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Welfare===
Biden is opposed to the privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and was given an 89% approval rating from the [[Alliance for Retired Americans]] (ARA), reflecting a pro-[[senior citizen]] voting record. He voted in support of welfare [[block grant]]s and supports [[welfare reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Economic/Joe_Biden_Welfare_+_Poverty.htm |title=Joe Biden on Welfare &amp; Poverty |publisher=Ontheissues.org |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
In 1994, Biden drafted the [[Violence Against Women Act]], which was signed into law.  It provided $1.6 billion to enhance investigation and prosecution of the violent crime perpetrated against women, increased pre-trial detention of the accused, provided for automatic and mandatory restitution of those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave unprosecuted.

The [[United States Supreme Court]] struck down portions of the VAWA on Constitutional grounds in ''[[United States v. Morrison]]''.

Biden has said: &quot;I consider the Violence Against Women Act the single most significant legislation that Iâve crafted during my 35-year tenure in the Senate. Indeed, the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was the beginning of a historic commitment to women and children victimized by [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual assault]]. Our nation has been rewarded for this commitment. Since the Actâs passage in 1994, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50%.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Economic issues==
[[Image:Joe Biden - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2005 Portrait.jpg|thumb|Joe Biden at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos, Switzerland]]]]
===Agriculture===
&quot;Senator Biden supported the [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008|Farm Bill]] and believes that it is a responsible compromise. It is not perfect, but it was the product of lengthy negotiations and passage was essential to our farm economy. For Delaware and the rest of the nation, this bill contains funding and programs that are critical to the future of the family farmer, stewardship of our environment and meeting nutritional needs at a time when food prices are rising.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&quot;Senator Biden has been a strong supporter of efforts to combat the problem of [[invasive species]] â plants and animals improperly brought to U.S. shores. Senator Biden feels that these non-native species have the potential to be one of the largest economic and environmental threats in the 21st century. Non-native species alter vegetation, compete with native species, introduce new diseases and interfere with maritime commerce. Conscious of these dangers, Senator Biden continues to support programs aimed at preventing the importation of non-native plants and animals to the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&quot;After learning that Russia will start banning chicken imports from 19 plants in the United States&quot; Senator Biden &quot;issued the following statement:&quot;

&quot;Russia is once again using [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]] as an excuse to close its markets to American poultry.  I am concerned about the effect of this action on Mountaire, a major employer and integral part of our state's agricultural production.  Other local poultry processing plants may be targeted.

&quot;Russia has repeatedly shown that it is not ready to abide by the rules of international trade.  Let's not forget this is part of a bigger picture in which Russia has failed to behave as a responsible member in the international community.  Until Russia reverses their recent actionsâboth big and small â its application to join the [[World Trade Organization]] should remain on hold.

&quot;The United States must take immediate and necessary steps â just like we did in 2002 -to restore access to this market, which is critical to Delaware's farmers, Delaware's poultry industry and Delaware's economy, which relies heavily on the agricultural industry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Energy===
Biden opposes drilling for [[Petroleum|oil]] in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] and supports governmental funding to find new [[World energy resources and consumption|energy sources]] as well as upping funding for alternative transportation like [[Amtrak]] and [[mass transit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anwr.org/Politics/Presidential-Candidates-views-on-ANWR-The-Democrats.php |title=Arctic Power â Arctic National Wildlife Refuge â Presidential Candidates views on ANWR, The Democrats |accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While campaigning for president in 2007, Biden said that, if elected, his top priority would be &quot;[[energy security]].&quot; He has also been quoted as saying &quot;If I could wave a wand, and the Lord said I could solve one problem, I would solve the [[energy crisis]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grist Jan 3, 2008 Retrieved May 4, 2008 http://www.grist.org/feature/2007/08/29/biden/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Senator Joe Biden speaks to SEIU 2.jpg|thumb|Joe Biden speaking]]

In 1990, Joe Biden voted against the first [[Gulf War]] after [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] invaded [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB122049148440397625.html }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Biden expressed support for the use of force against [[Iraq]], and urged a sustained effort to &quot;dethrone&quot; [[Saddam Hussein]] over the long haul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/stories/iraq111398a.htm | title=Support for U.S. Stance on Iraq Grows | author=Thomas W. Lippman and Bradley Graham |work=Washington Post | date=November 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, as Chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], he stated that Saddam Hussein was &quot;a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security&quot; and that United States has &quot;no choice but to eliminate the threat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTP04292007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18381961/page/2 | title=MTP Transcript for April 29, 2007 | author=[[Tim Russert]] | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=April 29, 2007 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, &quot;I think Saddam either has to be separated from his weapons or taken out of power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meet the Press August 2002 interview with Tim Russert http://www.michaelmoore.com/mustread/index.php?id=1040&lt;/ref&gt; Biden also supported a failed resolution authorizing military action in Iraq only after the exhaustion of diplomatic efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/us/politics/24policy.html|title=New York Times â A Democratic Leader on Foreign Policy, In Iraq and the Balkans | work=The New York Times | first=Michael R. | last=Gordon | date=August 24, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biden argued that Saddam Hussein possesses [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[Biological warfare|biological weapons]] and is seeking [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear weapons]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2002_record&amp;docid=cr10oc02-70 AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AGAINST IRAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; he subsequently voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. Biden has since said that he believes it was a mistake to support the [[Iraq War]] because it has been mismanaged by the Bush Administration. In 2005, Biden said, &quot;We can call it quits and withdraw from Iraq (but) I think that would be a gigantic mistake, or we can set a deadline for pulling out, which I fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out â equally a mistake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Biden on Meet the Press 2007 http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/2007_Meet_the_Press_Joe_Biden.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his belief that Iraq maintained stockpiles of [[weapons of mass destruction]], Biden stated in 2007 that inspectors had seen and cataloged the existence of the materials required to make such weapons prior to their expulsion from Iraq and pondered why [[Saddam Hussein]] didn't tell the international community that he had disposed of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTP04292007&quot;/&gt; [[Scott Ritter]], the chief [[United Nations weapons inspector]] in Iraq, stated in July 2002 that most chemical and biological agents produced by Iraq would have been neutralized or degraded in storage, encouraging the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee to convene hearings to reassess the threat.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ritter: [http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0721-02.htm Is Iraq a True Threat to the US?]&lt;/ref&gt; When the committee scheduled hearings in the beginning of August 2002, Ritter stated that &quot;Sen. Joe Biden is running a sham hearing. It is clear that Biden and most of the Congressional leadership have pre-ordained a conclusion that seeks to remove Saddam Hussein from power regardless of the facts, and are using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=633 Ritter and Von Sponeck on Iraq: Interviews Available]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biden supports a &quot;five-step plan&quot; towards [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|removing troops from Iraq]]. In November 2006, Biden and [[Leslie Gelb]], President Emeritus of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], released a comprehensive strategy to end [[sectarian violence in Iraq]]. Rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing, the plan calls for [[federalism|federalizing]] Iraq with separate regions for [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Shia Islam|Shiites]], and [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT01102007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/01/world/fg-iraq1 | author=Ned Parker and Raheem Salman | title=U.S. vote unites Iraqis in anger |work=Los Angeles Times | date=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key points include:
#Giving Iraq's major groups a measure of [[autonomy]] in their own regions. A central government would be left in charge of interests such as defending the borders and distributing [[Iraq oil law (2007)|oil revenues]].
#Guaranteeing [[Sunni]]s â who have no oil rights â a proportionate share of oil revenue and reintegrating those who have not fought against Coalition forces.
#Increase, not end, reconstruction assistance but insist that [[Arab]] [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] states fund it and tie it to the creation of a jobs program and to the protection of [[ethnic minority|minority]] rights.
#Initiate a diplomatic offensive to enlist the support of the major powers and neighboring countries for a political settlement in Iraq and create an Oversight Contact Group to enforce regional commitments.
#Begin the phased redeployment of U.S. forces in 2007 and withdraw most of them by 2008, leaving a small follow-on force for security and policing actions.

The plan, named ''The Biden-[[Sam Brownback|Brownback]] Resolution'', passed the Senate 75-23 in a nonbinding vote on September 25, 2007, including 26 Republican votes. Iraqâs political leadership united in denouncing the resolution, while the [[Embassy of the United States in Baghdad]] issued a statement distancing itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT01102007&quot;/&gt;

===Africa===
Biden favors an American deployment of troops to [[Darfur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt; In support of this, Biden said senior U.S. military officials in Europe told him that 2,500 U.S. troops could &quot;radically change the situation on the ground now&quot; (see [[War in Darfur]].)

Biden is opposed to American financing of [[abstinence]]-only programs to combat HIV-AIDS in Africa. In 2007, he cosponsored the HIV Prevention Act which would end President [[George W. Bush]]'s mandate that one third of all funds be earmarked to abstinence only programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt;

===Israel===
Biden is a self-described [[Zionist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt; During the interview conducted by the U.S. Jewish television cable network [[Shalom TV]], Biden said, &quot;I am a Zionist. You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3586542,00.html |title=Biden in 2007 interview: I am a Zionist â Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=June 20, 1995 |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is highly supportive of the state of [[Israel]] and views Israel as a strategic ally in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;NuclearIran&quot;&gt;[http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Middle_East/10241824.html Israel must come to terms with nuclear Iran]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that &quot;the Arab nations have known that there is no daylight between us and Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Siegel: [http://www.forward.com/articles/presidential-hopeful-slams-bush-for-stance-on-syri/ Presidential Hopeful Slams Bush for Stance on Syria] [[The Jewish Daily Forward]], March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding support for Israel within the Democratic Party, Biden has stated that the Democrats' support for Israel &quot;comes from our gut, moves through our heart, and ends up in our head. It's almost genetic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=755798 Joseph Biden, Democrat], profile at [[Haaretz]], October 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, Biden stated &quot;A strong America is a strong Israel.

In a speech to several hundred older [[American Jews]] at a Florida retirement community, Biden stressed that he and Barack Obama are strongly pro-Israel. Biden stated &quot;I am chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I give you my word as a Biden, I would not have given up that job to be Barack Obama's vice president if I didn't in my gut and in my heart and in my head know that Barack Obama is exactly where I am on Israel. And he is...I promise you ... we will make [Israel] more secure.&quot; Biden also criticized the presidency of [[George W. Bush]], stating that &quot;By any objective fact, Israel is less secure today in the world than it was eight years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110185.html Biden reassures Florida Jews on Israel], Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), September 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/palmbeach/sfl-flpbiden0903pnsep03,0,5617985.story Sen. Joe Biden reiterates support for Israel at two South Florida rallies] by Mark Hollis and Juan Ortega, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, September 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a conference call to members of the Jewish media on September 3, 2008, Biden stated, in regard to a potential [[IranâIsrael relations|Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities]], that it âis not a question for us to tell the Israelis what they can and cannot do, I have faith in the democracy of Israel. They will arrive at the right decision that they view as being in their own interests.â However, Biden stated that additional diplomatic efforts should be made to help avert the potential need for military action.&lt;ref name=JTA932008&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110212.html Biden: AIPAC doesn't speak for all Jews], Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), September 3, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Biden spoke at the Washington Conference of the [[National Jewish Democratic Council]] (NJDC). Biden stated that âIâve spent 35 years of my career dealing with issues relating to Israel. My support for Israel begins in my stomach, goes to my heart and ends up in my head.&quot; Regarding Barack Obama's stance on Israel, Biden stated that âI guarantee you, I would not have joined Barack Obama as his vice president if I had any doubt, even the slightest doubt, that he shares the same commitment to Israel I share.â Biden also harshly denied a claim by the [[Republican Jewish Coalition]] (RJC) that he once attempted to cut off aid to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110520.html Biden at NJDC: Obama supports Israel], Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), September 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; NJDC director [[Ira Forman]] has praised Biden, stating that âThere is no one you could possibly pick who knows the issues, who is committed to Israelâs security and knows Israeli leaders, as much as Joe Biden.â&lt;ref name=jsf1/&gt;

During the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2008|2008 Vice-Presidential debate]], Biden stated &quot;no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend to Israel than Joe Biden. I would have never, ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion.&quot;&lt;ref name=transcript1&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/index.html Transcript of Palin, Biden debate], [[CNN]], October 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Biden served as the keynote speaker at the General Assembly (GA) of [[Jewish Federations of North America]], where he stated that âThis government will stand with Israel. Itâs in our own self-interest, beyond it being an absolute moral necessity.â He also renewed his support for peace talks with the Palestinians, stating that âThere is no substitute for direct face-to-face negotiations leading eventually to states for two people secured â the Jewish State of Israel and the viable independent state of Palestine. That is the only path to the Israeli peopleâs decades-long quest for security, and the only path to the Palestinian peopleâs legitimate aspirations for nationhood.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20247&amp;Itemid=86 U.S. VP stresses countryâs support for Israel] by Frances Kraft, Staff Reporter, Canadian Jewish News, November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alleged Statement on Nuclearization of Iran====
In early September 2008, ''[[Haaretz]]'' quoting an un-sourced report from [[Israel Army Radio]] which stated that Biden had reportedly told Israeli officials in private that Israel &quot;will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of Iran.&quot; Biden denied he had ever made this statement or any similar statements. David Wade, a Biden spokesman, stated that âThis is a lie peddled by partisan opponents of Senators Obama and Biden and we will not tolerate anyone questioning Senator Bidenâs 35-year record of standing up for the security of Israel.â Wade also stated that Biden' views a nuclear Iran as âgrave threat to Israel and the United States.â Israeli officials later reported that the original story appeared âdubious.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/01/biden-denies-saying-israel-will-have-to-reconcile-with-nuclear-iran/ Biden Denies Saying Israel will have to Reconcile with Nuclear Iran], Fox News (with contributions from Reena Ninan), September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1017129.html Obama camp denies report Biden said Israel will have to reconcile to nuclear Iran], Haaretz Service, September 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)====
Regarding the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC), Biden defended his right to oppose some AIPAC-backed measures. Biden stated that &quot;AIPAC does not speak for the entire American Jewish community. Thereâs other organizations as strong and as consequential.â Biden further stated that AIPAC does not speak for Israel. However, Biden added that âIâve never disagreed with AIPAC on the objective. Whenever Iâve had disagreement with AIPAC it has always been a tactical disagreement, not a substantive disagreement.â Following this interview, an AIPAC spokesman praised Biden's leadership efforts on several fronts and stated that &quot;We look forward to continuing to work with him in the Senate or in the White House.&quot;
&lt;ref name=JTA932008/&gt;

In September 2008, Biden spoke with AIPAC leaders in a conference call. Following the meeting, an AIPAC spokesman stated that &quot;We had a very warm conversation with Senator Biden today, as we have many times throughout the years, about the importance of the U.S-Israel relationship, and we look forward to continuing to work with him in the future. We had an opportunity to express our appreciation for his strong leadership in support of the U.S.-Israel relationship, and we were pleased to hear Senator Biden reaffirm his desire to maintain his close relationship with AIPAC as we work together to strengthen the special friendship between the two democracies over many years to come.&quot; An adviser to the presidential campaign of Barack Obama stated that &quot;Senator Biden expressed his appreciation for AIPAC's important work supporting Israel's security and the U.S.-Israel relationship, and that he looks forward to continuing to work with them as partners on these issues in the future as he has in the past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110442.html Biden, AIPAC clear the air], Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), September 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israeli-Palestinian Conflict====
Biden has stated he supports a [[two-state solution]] to the [[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict]]. Biden cosponsored the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 which expressed U.S. support for a two-state solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=109-20060623-38#sMonofilemx003Ammx002Fmmx002Fmmx002Fmhomemx002Fmgovtrackmx002Fmdatamx002Fmusmx002Fm109mx002Fmcrmx002Fms20060623-38.xmlElementm4m0m0m âMr. President, I support the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006...â] ''govtrack.us''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2008|2008 Vice-Presidential debate]], Biden stated that the Bush administration's policy with regard to the Middle East has been &quot;an abject failure&quot; and pledged that, if elected, Barack Obama and himself &quot;will change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has.&quot;&lt;ref name=transcript1/&gt;

In a March 2007 interview, Biden was asked about the failure to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Biden stated that &quot;Israelâs a democracy and they make mistakes. But the notion that somehow if Israel just did the right thing, [the peace process] would work ... give me a break.â He also stated that âThe responsibility rests on those who will not acknowledge the right of Israel to exist, will not play fair, will not deal, will not renounce terror.â&lt;ref name=jsf1&gt;[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/35942/format/html/displaystory.html Joe Biden and Israel are friends who fight] by Eric Fingerhut and Ron Kampeas, Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA) (reprinted by the Jewish Weekly News of Northern California), August 29, 2008 (retrieved on November 1, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Biden spoke at an AIPAC conference where he stated that Israel &quot;has to work towards a two-state solution&quot; and called on Israel to &quot;dismantle existing outposts and allow Palestinians freedom of movement.&quot; He also called on the Palestinians to &quot;combat terror and incitement against Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/world/story.html?id=1566212 U.S. presses Israel on two-state solution, settlements] by Matt Spetalnick and David Alexander, Reuters (reprinted by the National Post), May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
Biden favors open dialogue with [[North Korea]] and describes them as a &quot;paper tiger&quot;, unable to directly cause harm to America. However, in June 2007 Democratic debate, he called the situation one of &quot;the three most important things that the next president is going to have to deal with&quot;, along with [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt;

===Iran===
As chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], Sen. Biden has been a prominent voice calling for &quot;hard-headed diplomacy&quot; with [[Iran]]. In July 2008, Biden should first engage directly with Iran in the context of talks with the Permanent Five Members of the UN Security Council and Germany, and &quot;ultimately country-to-country, just as we did with [[North Korea]].&quot; He also has called for the implementation of &quot;coordinated [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanction]]s&quot; on Iran, adding &quot;we should complement this pressure by presenting a detailed, positive vision for [[IranâUnited States relations|U.S.-Iran relations]] if Iran does the right thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/bios/1451/joseph_r_biden_jr.html Biden's 's position on top foreign policy issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Biden voted against a measure to declare the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps]] a terrorist organization. He wrote in December 2007 that &quot;War with Iran is not just a bad option. It would be a [[disaster]].&quot; Biden has threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Bush if he starts a war with Iran without Congressional approval.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt; In an interview with members of the Jewish media in September 2008, Biden stated that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is a terrorist organization and that the Bush administration already had the power to designate it as one. He stated that he voted against the measure out of concern that the Bush administration would misuse the measure to justify a military attack against Iran.&lt;ref name=JTA932008/&gt;

In early April 2009, Biden told [[CNN]] that he believed that [[Israel]] would not launch a unilateral strike against [[Iran]]'s nuclear facilities. Biden stated that &quot;I think (Israel) would be ill-advised to do that. And so my level of concern is no different than it was a year ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/04/07/1004327/biden-israel-wont-hit-iran Biden: Israel wonât hit Iran] by Ron Kampeas, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), April 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba===
Biden strongly opposes the [[Fidel Castro]] regime in [[Cuba]] and supports the continuation of the [[trade embargo]] as well as the democratization of the island in post-Castro era. In 2006, Biden stated, &quot;We should be putting together a plan as to how we are going to play a positive role in moving that country, after the Castros are gone, toâmore toward democratization and liberalization in their society.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt;

===Russia===
In 1999, Biden cosponsored a draft resolution condemning Russia's [[Second Chechen War|1999 Invasion of Chechnya]], the use of indiscriminate force by the Russian army against civilians and violations of the [[Geneva Convention]], and urged a peaceful resolution of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000003-000133ã=1 Obama is a pragmatic idealist (interview with Brian Whitmore)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=sr106-223 S. Res. 223 [106th&amp;#93;: A resolution condemning the violence in Chechnya]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Biden cosponsored a Senate resolution criticizing Russia for failing to uphold its commitments at the 1999 [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) Summit, which included agreements on a completed [[14th Army involvement in Transnistria|Russian military withdrawal]] from [[Moldova]]. That resolution also expressed disapproval of Russiaâs demand for the closure of the OSCE Border Monitoring Operation (BMO), which served to observe border crossings between Georgia and the Russian republics of [[Chechnya]], [[Dagestan]], and [[Ingushetia]]. That bill passed in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt;

Biden introduced legislation in July 2008 urging members of the Group of Eight to &quot;work toward a more constructive relationship with Russia,&quot; and encouraging Russia to behave according to the [[Group of Eight|G-8]]âs &quot;objectives of protecting global security, economic stability, and democracy.&quot; The resolution also called on Russian and U.S. leaders to increase cooperation and funding for the [[Nunn-Lugar program]] and other nonproliferation initiatives. It also emphasized the need for a successor to the [[START I|1991 Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty]]. The resolution passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt;

Biden has voiced concerns about Russia alleged backsliding on democratic reforms. In August 2008, Biden criticized Russiaâs [[2008 South Ossetia war|military action in Georgia]]. &quot;By acting disproportionately with a full scale attack on [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and seeking the ouster of Georgiaâs democratically elected President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], Moscow is jeopardizing its standing in Europe and the broader international community â and risking very real practical and political consequences,&quot; Biden wrote in a Financial Times op-ed. Biden urged Russia to abide by the negotiated cease fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFR&quot;/&gt;
