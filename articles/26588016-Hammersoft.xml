The '''2010â11 Magners League''' was the tenth [[Magners League|Celtic League]] season and the fifth with [[Magners]] as title sponsor. The regular season began on 3 September 2010 and finished on the weekend of 6â8 May 2011. During these stages, each team played every other team both home and away and were awarded points according to the standard [[rugby union bonus points system|bonus point system]]. This was the second season to follow the play-off structure to determine the Magners League champion, with the top four teams qualifying for the semi-finals. The winner of each semi final advanced to the [[2011 Magners League Grand Final|Grand Final]], which took place 28 May and was hosted by the team that finished highest in the table following the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/leinster/8054405.stm BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/7341673.stm BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; The title was won by Munster who defeated Leinster by 19-9 at [[Thomond Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/may/30/munster-magners-league-final-leinster|title=Munster win Magners League final to lay ghost of Leinster double|date=30 May 2011|work=Guardian|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/13565913.stm|title=Munster 19-9 Leinster|date=30 May 2011|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the final season of the Celtic League sponsored by Magners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/13127244.stm BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt;

The twelve teams competing were the four Irish provinces, [[Munster Rugby|Munster]], [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]] and [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]]; two Scottish regions, [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and [[Glasgow Warriors]]; four Welsh regions, [[Cardiff Blues]], [[Newport Gwent Dragons]], [[Ospreys (rugby team)|Ospreys]] and [[Scarlets]]; and two new Italian entries [[Aironi]] and [[Benetton Rugby Treviso|Benetton Treviso]] 

In May 2010, the Ospreys were fined Â£100,000 and docked 4 points from the 2010-11 season following their postponement of the away fixture at Ulster in the [[2009â10 Magners League|2009-10]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/ospreys/8606012.stm Ospreys punished for Ulster postponement - BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2010, following an appeal by the Ospreys, the four point deduction for the 2010-11 season was overturned, although the Â£100,000 fine was upheld. Instead, the four point deduction is to be suspended for two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/ospreys/8971683.stm BBC Sport - Ospreys Magners League point deduction suspended ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A new broadcast deal seen games broadcast live on terrestrial television channels in Scotland and Ireland in addition to the established terrestrial coverage in Wales. The deal is in place until the 2013-14 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnersleague.com/news/5365.php Magners League]&lt;/ref&gt;
