The '''Kansas State Wildcats football''' program (variously &quot;Kansas State&quot;, &quot;K-State&quot; or &quot;KSU&quot;) is the [[college football|intercollegiate football]] program of the [[Kansas State University]] [[Kansas State Wildcats|Wildcats]].  The program is classified in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Bowl Subdivision, and the team competes in the [[Big 12 Conference]].  The team had an all-time record of 466&amp;ndash;610&amp;ndash;41 as of the conclusion of the [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2010 season]].

The team plays in [[Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas]].  The [[KSU Marching Band]], also known as the Pride of Wildcat Land, performs at all home games and bowl games.

==History==
{{See also|List of Kansas State Wildcats football seasons}}
 
According to some sources, Kansas State's football team began play on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 1893.&lt;ref name=Stallard&gt;{{Cite book| last = Stallard | first = Mark | title = Wildcats to Powercats: K-State Football Facts and Trivia | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-58497-004-9 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kansas State University: A Pictorial History, 1863-1963'' (Manhattan, KS: Kansas State University), 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  A team from Kansas State defeated St. Mary's Academy 18-10 on that date.  Other sources name Kansas State's first game as a 24-0 victory over a team from [[Abilene, Kansas]], on November 3, 1894.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Evans | first = Harold | title = College Football in Kansas | journal = Kansas Historical Quarterly | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 285â311 | date = 1940 | url = http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1940/40_3_evans.htm | accessdate = 2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Willard&gt;{{Cite book| last = Willard | first = Julius | title = History of Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science | publisher = Kansas State College Press | date = 1940 | url = http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=hearth;cc=hearth;rgn=full%20text;idno=5725255;didno=5725255;view=image;seq=0003;node=5725255%3A3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the first official game recorded in the team's history is a 14-0 loss to Fort Riley on November 28, 1896.&lt;ref name=results&gt;{{Cite web| title = Year-by-Year Results for Kansas State | url = http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3069&amp;SPID=212&amp;DB_OEM_ID=400&amp;ATCLID=814587 | format = English  | accessdate = 2009-08-31}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its earliest years, the program had a different coach every year â generally a former college football player who had just graduated from college.  Often, the coaches also played with the team during the games.&lt;ref name=Willard/&gt;  Some of the coaches during this era include [[Fay Moulton]], who went on to win Olympic medals as a sprinter; [[Cyrus E. Dietz]], who became a justice on the Illinois Supreme Court; and [[Wade Moore]], who later was a successful minor league baseball manager.  The pattern changed when [[Mike Ahearn]] became the first long-term coach in 1905.  Ahearn coached for six seasons, leading the team to winning records each year, and concluding in the 1910 season with a 10-1 mark.  Ahearn also won two conference championships in the [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference|Kansas Intercollegiate Athletic Association]], in 1909 and 1910.&lt;ref name=cfdb&gt;{{Cite web| title = College Football Data Warehouse | url = http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/kansas_state/championships.php | format = English | accessdate = 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahearn was followed by [[Guy Lowman]], who led Kansas State to another conference championship in 1912.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;&lt;ref name=cfdb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Aggie Championship | newspaper = The Daily (Manhattan) Nationalist | date = November 29, 1912 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early success===
The team experienced sustained success in the 1920s and 1930s.  [[Elden Auker]] was part of a group of excellent athletes that attended Kansas State around the time of the [[Great Depression]], which also included [[Ralph Graham]], Henry Cronkite, George Maddox and [[Elmer Hackney]].  These athletes were coupled with a series of [[College Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coaches.  The first of these coaches was [[Z.G. Clevenger]], who arrived in 1916, when Kansas State essentially swapped head coaches with the [[University of Tennessee]].  Clevenger is in the College Football Hall of Fame for his playing abilities, but he was also recognized as a brilliant coach and administrator.  Clevenger was followed as football coach in 1920 by [[Charlie Bachman]], who stayed until 1927, and earned his way into the College Football Hall of Fame with his coaching prowess.  Bachman was also responsible for permanently endowing Kansas State's sports teams with the nickname of &quot;Wildcats.&quot;  His successor, [[Bo McMillin|Alvin &quot;Bo&quot; McMillin]], the coach from 1928&amp;ndash;33, is also in the College Football Hall of Fame as a player, but he too was a successful coach who, after leaving Kansas State, was recognized as national collegiate coach of the year and then served as head coach for two NFL teams.  After McMillin left, Kansas State hired [[Pappy Waldorf|Lynn &quot;Pappy&quot; Waldorf]], who was also later enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach.

With this combination, Kansas State found a rare sustained stretch of success on the football field.  In 1931 the football team was on track for a potential bid to the Rose Bowl, the sole bowl game in the country at the time, until Ralph Graham was injured.  In [[1934 Kansas State Wildcats football team|1934]], Kansas State won its first major [[Big Six Conference|conference]] football championship.  That same year, the ''[[New York Times]]'' referred to Kansas State as &quot;an established Middle Western leader.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Manhattan In Tie With Kansas State | work = The New York Times | date = October 7, 1934 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70717F63B58177A93C5A9178BD95F408385F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22established%20Middle%20Western%20leader%22&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; But then coach Waldorf abruptly left, and the winning stopped.

On October 28, 1939, Kansas State hosted the [[1939 Nebraska vs. Kansas State football game|second televised college football game]] (and the first televised [[homecoming]] game),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Televised Game | newspaper = ''Morning Chronicle'' | location = Manhattan, Kansas | date = October 28, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ksu-neb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kstatesports.com/blog/2010/10/purple-pride-vs-big-red---4-0-vs-4-0.html|publisher=[[Kansas State Wildcats]]|title=Purple Pride vs. Big Red - 4-0 vs. 4-0|date=October 7, 2010|first=Mark|last=Janssen|accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; losing to Nebraska 25&amp;ndash;9.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFDW Fry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=820&amp;year=1939|publisher=[[College Football Data Warehouse]]|first=David|last=DeLassus|accessdate=April 3, 2011|title=Coach: Wesley L. Fry-Coaching Records Game-by-Game (1939)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-century===
Over the next sixty years, Kansas State would experience very little success on the football field.  From 1935 to 1990, Kansas State would have only four winning seasons.  According to longtime Wildcat radio announcer Dev Nelson, part of the problem was that Kansas State was one of the few major schools that didn't make a significant investment into its football program after World War II.  Indeed, for many years the Wildcats spent far less on football than any Big Eight school; in 1987-88, Oklahoma (the conference's second smallest school) spent half a million more dollars on football than did Kansas State.&lt;ref name=FutilityU/&gt;  Typical of this era was a 28-game losing streak from 1945&amp;ndash;1948 (second longest in NCAA Bowl Subdivision history), additional losing streaks of 18 and 17 games in the 1960s, and being outscored 188-0 by Kansas from 1960 to 1965.

However, there were a few shining moments during these decades.  In the mid-1950s, coach [[Bill Meek]] started to rebuild the program.  In 1953, Kansas State posted a 5&amp;ndash;3&amp;ndash;1 record, the first winning season at the school since [[Wes Fry]]'s 1936 team.  Upon starting that season 5&amp;ndash;1, K-State also made the school's first appearance in the top 20 polls for college football, at #18 in the [[Coaches Poll]] on October 28, 1953.  The following year was even better, with Kansas State posting a 7&amp;ndash;3 record and playing for an [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] berth in their final game.  But Meek left Kansas State following the 1954 season, when the school refused to give raises to his assistants.&lt;ref name=Fitz&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fitzgerald | first = Tim | title = Wildcat Gridiron Guide: Past &amp; Present Stories About K-State Football | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-9703458-0-1 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, coach [[Vince Gibson]] also briefly started to turn the program around.  Behind sophomore quarterback [[Lynn Dickey]], the 1968 squad earned the school's first ranking in the [[AP Poll]] and shut out the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] in Lincoln for the school's first victory over NU in a decade.  That same season, Kansas State also moved into newly built KSU Stadium.  The [[1969 Kansas State Wildcats football team|1969 season]] was even better.  The team started 2&amp;ndash;0 before second-ranked [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State University]] arrived to play in [[Manhattan, Kansas]].  Penn State would ultimately finish the [[1969 NCAA Division I-A football season|1969 season]] undefeated, but Kansas State provided them with one of their toughest tests in a 17&amp;ndash;14 game.  Following the loss to Penn State, Kansas State reeled off three straight victories, including a win over defending conference champion [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] in the first [[Governor's Cup (Kansas)|Governor's Cup]] game, and a 59&amp;ndash;21 blowout of eleventh-ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], which was Kansas State's first win over OU since [[1934 college football season|1934]]. (It was also the largest loss in Oklahoma's history.)  After the Oklahoma game, Kansas State sported a 5&amp;ndash;1 record and a #12 national ranking in the AP Poll.  This was the high-point of the season, as the team lost its last four games to finish 5&amp;ndash;5. Nevertheless, in only his third season, Gibson had dramatically improved the program.

Prior to the [[1970 Kansas State Wildcats football team|1970 season]], Gibson was named the pre-season national coach of the year by [[Playboy Magazine]].  The season that followed was up-and-down but ultimately disappointing despite a winning record and a second-place finish in the [[Big Eight Conference]].  Kansas State won at Oklahoma and defeated eighth-ranked [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]], but the season was soured by nonconference defeats and a blow-out loss to Nebraska in the final conference game of the year with the conference title on the line.  The worst news of the season came on October 7, 1970, when the conference issued penalties against Kansas State for recruiting violations.  The Wildcats were placed on three years' probation, including a one-year ban from bowl games and live television.  Gibson would never have another winning season, and left the school in 1974.  He later said that the sanctions--the product of what he called an immature quarrel between himself and Jayhawk coach [[Pepper Rodgers]]--destroyed everything he'd built over his first four years.&lt;ref name=reference1&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sanctions Still Trouble Cats' Gibson | newspaper = The Topeka Capital-Journal | date = October 14, 2000 | url = http://cjonline.com/stories/101400/spo_ksuhof.shtml | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these fleeting moments of glory, by 1989 the school was statistically the worst program in Division I-A with an overall record of 299-509-41.&lt;ref name=FutilityU&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Looney | first = Douglas | title = Futility U | journal = Sports Illustrated | date = September 4, 1989 | url = http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068750/index.htm | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kansas State had become the first NCAA team to lose 500 games in 1988.  Things changed in 1989, when the athletic department hired [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa's]] offensive coordinator, [[Bill Snyder]], to replace [[Stan Parrish]] as head coach.

===First Bill Snyder era===
[[Bill Snyder]] took over a program that had the worst record in Division I-A and had gone winless in its prior 27 consecutive games.&lt;ref name=FutilityU/&gt;  Snyder then presided over one of the most successful rebuilding projects in the history of college athletics.

In [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991]], Snyder's Wildcats finished 7&amp;ndash;4 and narrowly missed receiving the school's second bowl bid ever.  The team also finished with a winning record in conference play for only the third time since winning the conference title in [[1934 college football season|1934]].

In Snyder's fifth season in [[1993 Division 1A Football Season|1993]], Kansas State posted the first victory in a [[bowl game]] in school history.  Success and high rankings continued over the next decade, including six top-ten finishes in the [[AP Poll]] and a perfect (11&amp;ndash;0) regular season in [[1998 Division 1A Football Season|1998]] (before stumbling in the [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]] against [[1998 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|Texas A&amp;M]]).  As the team improved, recruiting also improved, and Snyder was able to bring in athletes such as quarterback [[Michael Bishop (football player)|Michael Bishop]], the runner-up for the [[Heisman Trophy]] in [[1998 Division 1A Football Season|1998]], and running back [[Darren Sproles]], who led the nation in rushing in [[2003 Division 1A Football Season|2003]] and holds the Big 12 record for all-purpose yards in a career. The run of success culminated in a [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003 with a 35&amp;ndash;7 victory over the #1 ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]. (The 69 years since the last conference title in 1934 was the longest span between football titles in Division I history.)

In his first 17 years as head coach at K-State, Snyder won 136 games â as many as his predecessors had won from 1935 to 1988 â and led Kansas State to eleven consecutive bowl games (1993â2003), including six wins. Snyder's legacy at K-State also includes winning or sharing four Big 12 North titles ([[1998 Kansas State Wildcats football team|1998]], [[1999 Kansas State Wildcats football team|1999]] (Tie), [[2000 Kansas State Wildcats football team|2000]], [[2003 Kansas State Wildcats football team|2003]]).  Snyder also led the Wildcats to a 44&amp;ndash;7 record from 1997 to 2000, and six 11-win seasons overall.

In 1998, Snyder was recognized as the National Coach of the Year by the [[Associated Press]] and the [[Walter Camp Football Foundation]], and was awarded the [[Bear Bryant Award]] and the [[Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award]].  Coach Snyder was also selected [[Big Eight Conference]] Coach of the Year by the Associated Press three times (1990, 1991 and 1993), joining [[Bob Devaney]] as the only two men in [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] history to be named Coach of the Year three times in a four-year period. Snyder was named [[Big 12 Conference]] Coach of the Year twice, in 1998 (Associated Press, coaches) and 2002 (coaches).

The winning attitude under Snyder was represented by a stylized wildcat, called the &quot;Powercat&quot; (shown at top), that was added to the football team's uniforms in 1989.  The emblem became so popular that by the late 1990s it had essentially replaced &quot;[[Willie the Wildcat (Kansas State)|Willie the Wildcat]],&quot; a character designed by art department students in the late 1950s.

Snyder retired following the [[2005 Division 1A Football Season|2005 season]], and on December 5, 2005, [[Ron Prince]] was named the new head coach.

===Ron Prince era===
On December 5, 2005, [[Ron Prince]] was hired as the 33rd head football coach of the Kansas State Wildcats.  Prince was formerly an assistant coach and offensive line coach at the [[University of Virginia]].

In [[2006 Kansas State Wildcats football team|2006]], Prince's first year at the helm of the Wildcats, he led Kansas State to a 7&amp;ndash;6 record and the team's first winning season since [[2003 Division 1A Football Season|2003]].  The signature win of the regular season was a 45-42 upset victory over [[2006 Texas Longhorn football team|#4-ranked University of Texas]] on November 11, 2006.  Kansas State finished the season with a 37&amp;ndash;10 loss to the [[Athletics at Rutgers University|Scarlet Knights]] of [[Rutgers University]] in the inaugural [[Texas Bowl]] on December 28, [[NCAA football bowl games, 2006-07|2006]].

[[Image:KSU on offense at Texas 2007 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Josh Freeman]] uses all of his 6'6 frame to pass over the [[2006 Texas Longhorn football team|Texas]] line in a 45&amp;ndash;42 victory in 2006.]]
The Wildcats compiled a 5&amp;ndash;7 record in the [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007 season]].  Coach Prince got the [[2007 Kansas State Wildcats football team|2007 team]] off to a quick start, with a 3&amp;ndash;1 record and a #24 ranking in the [[AP Poll]] after four weeks â the first ranking for Kansas State since the 2004 season.  This start included another victory against a [[2007 Texas Longhorn football team|top 10-ranked Texas team]], this time by 20 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = K-State upends No. 7 Texas, 41&amp;ndash;21 | date = September 29, 2007  | url = http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3061&amp;SPID=212&amp;DB_OEM_ID=400&amp;ATCLID=1252087 | format = English | accessdate = 2008-11-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the next five games, the team alternated wins and losses.  In the fifth game of the season, the Wildcat team was upset 30-24 by its cross-state opponents, the University of Kansas, and fell from the Top 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kusports.com/news/2007/oct/07/big_win_little_apple/?football KUsports.com - Big win in Little Apple!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, Kansas State defeated the University of Colorado 47&amp;ndash;20 and reentered the poll at number 25.  K-State fell from the Top 25 permanently the next week after a 41&amp;ndash;39 loss to the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]], despite quarterback Josh Freeman having a career day, throwing for 404 yards and three [[touchdown]] passes to [[Jordy Nelson]].  A win against the [[Baylor Bears]] and four losses followed to close out the season.

The [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008 season]] was Ron Prince's third at [[Kansas State]].  Coach Prince led the [[2008 Kansas State Wildcats football team|2008 team]] to another 5&amp;ndash;7 record.  With three games remaining in the season, on November 5, 2008, the school announced that Ron Prince would not return as Kansas State head coach in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ron Prince Will Not Return for 2009 | date = November 5, 2008  | url = http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3065&amp;SPID=212&amp;DB_OEM_ID=400&amp;ATCLID=1618716 | format = English | accessdate = 2008-11-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill Snyder returns===
On November 23, 2008 Kansas State University announced that [[Bill Snyder]] was hired to replace the recently fired [[Ron Prince]].  Snyder received a 5-year, $1.8 million per season contract.

On September 19, 2009, Kansas State became the third FBS teams to lose 600 games in its history after a loss to [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]].  K-State joined [[Northwestern Wildcats|Northwestern]] and [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/misc/div_ia_points_against.php College football losses fact]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2009, Snyder lead the team to a 6-6 record, going 4-4 in Big 12 play, and falling one game short of winning the Big 12 North.  The team failed to make a bowl game for the third consecutive season.

Snyder led the 2010 team to a 7-6 record, with a 3-5 record in conference play, good for third in the North division.  The season ended with a loss to [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] in the [[2010 Pinstripe Bowl]].  It was K-State's first bowl appearance since [[Ron Prince]] lead the team to the [[2006 Texas Bowl]].

==Home stadiums==
Kansas State's first playing field was called [[Ahearn Field]], and it was used from 1897 to 1921.&lt;ref name=Stallard/&gt;  The first permanent addition to the field was apparently a roofed grandstand, built in 1901.&lt;ref name=Stallard/&gt;  In 1922, Kansas State opened [[Memorial Stadium (Kansas State)|Memorial Stadium]], at a cost of $500,000 [[United States dollar|USD]].  Its name was a tribute to Kansas State students who died in [[World War I]].  The capacity was 20,000.  By 1967, the school's allegiance outgrew the old stadium, and the team moved to [[Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium|KSU Stadium]] in 1968.

===Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium===
{{Main|Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium}}
KSU Stadium opened its doors September 21, 1968.  The original seating capacity was 35,000.  An expansion in the summer of 1970 added 4,000 permanent bleachers on the east side and 3,000 temporary bleachers on the west side.  Following the 1998 season, the addition of a deck and sky suites on the east side of the stadium increased capacity to more than 50,000.

In the 1990s, Kansas State was dominant at home, posting a 26-game winning streak from 1996 to 2000.  On November 11, 2000, 53,811 fans witnessed Kansas State's 29-28 win over Nebraska; this remains the largest crowd in the stadium's history and also the largest attendance for a collegiate sporting event in the state of Kansas.

KSU Stadium was renamed &quot;Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium&quot; after head coach [[Bill Snyder]] retired at the end of the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005 season]].

==Bowl games==
Kansas State has participated in fourteen [[bowl game]]s, with an overall record of 6&amp;ndash;8.  Kansas State had a streak of eleven straight bowl appearances that lasted from the [[1993 Division 1A Football Season|1993 season]] to the [[2003 Division 1A Football Season|2003 season]].

Not included in this tally of bowl games is Kansas State's first &quot;post-season&quot; game, played in 1931 against [[Wichita State University|Wichita State]] as a fundraiser during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;  Kansas State won that game 20&amp;ndash;6.  Also not included is the 1992 &quot;[[Coca-Cola Classic (college football)|Coca-Cola Bowl]]&quot; played in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], against [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], which was a regular season game.&lt;ref name=results/&gt;

==Pageantry and traditions==

|}
The [[School colors|official color]] of the University is Royal Purple, as highlighted in the official fight song, [[Wildcat Victory]].  The athletic department commonly uses white or silver as complementary colors.

===Ring of Honor===
In 2002, the athletic department inducted the first class into its Ring of Honor.  The first class consisted of [[Sean Snyder]], [[Lynn Dickey]], [[Steve Grogan]], [[Jaime Mendez]], [[Gary Spani]] and [[Veryl Switzer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20020807/ai_n11784549 2002 Ring of Honor]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, a second class was inducted, consisting of [[Terence Newman]], [[MartÃ­n GramÃ¡tica]], [[David Allen (American football)|David Allen]], and [[Mark Simoneau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksnt.com/sports/local/27679034.html 2008 Ring of Honor]&lt;/ref&gt;  The honored players' names and jersey numbers are on the facade of the east side of the stadium.

===Uniforms===
K-State's home jersey is purple with white lettering, two white stripes around the sleeves, TV numbers on the shoulders and a white powercat under the collar. K-State's away jersey is white with purple lettering, two purple stripes around the sleeves, TV numbers on the shoulders and a purple powercat under the collar. K-State's pants are silver with white stripe and purple trim going down the sides of each leg, and a purple powercat on the front left side of the pants. K-State uses the same pants for both home and away games. K-State's helmets are silver with a dark purple powercat on each side, with a white stripe and purple trim from the top of the face mask to the rear of the helmet.  On each side of the helmet's stripe is the number of the player wearing the helmet; if the player has a number between 1 and 9 there is a zero on the left side. Also, the word &quot;Wildcats&quot; is written on the back of the helmet at the very bottom.  K-State uses the same helmets for both home and away games.

The tea has worn these uniforms from 2010 to present, and previously from 1989 to 2007.

In 2008, the Wildcats introduced purple pants while playing road games.  These debuted in the first road game of the season at Louisville.  The team wore purple pants every road game in 2008 until the final road game of the season at Missouri, when the Wildcats wore gray pants.  On November 15, 2008, Kansas State wore purple pants with purple jerseys at home against Nebraska, marking the first time since 1988 that the team wore all-purple uniforms.  The Wildcats warmed up for the Nebraska game with their traditional purple jerseys with gray pants, but came out for the game wearing purple pants.

===Mascot===
The official mascot for the Kansas State Wildcats is [[Willie the Wildcat (Kansas State)|Willie the Wildcat]].  Willie the Wildcat appears at every football game, home and away, as well as every home men's and women's basketball games, volleyball games, and select baseball games.  Willie does one push-up for each point the football team scores, followed by the traditional &quot;K!-S!-U! Wildcats!&quot; cheer.

===Fort Riley day===
Once a year (usually on the second non-conference home game of the season) soldiers from nearby [[Fort Riley]] are given free tickets to the game.  During the game they receive special recognition.  Since 2008 Willie has donned digital US Army [[Battledress|fatigues]] in place of his usual football pants and jersey.  The Fort Riley game often has high attendance numbers.

===Good for a &quot;first down&quot;===
Whenever the Wildcats gain a [[Down (gridiron football)|first down]], the PA announcer will say &quot;good for a Wildcat&quot; to which the fans respond &quot;first down&quot; while making the arm signal for a first down.  This tradition is also followed for touchdowns.  This practice, which originated at Kansas State, has been adopted in several other college and NFL stadiums.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

===EMAW===
EMAW stands for &quot;Every Man a Wildcat,&quot; dates back decades of history, and symbolizes that one is a part of the Wildcat nation.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kstatesports.com/trads/traditions.html EMAW orignation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harley Day===
During Harley Day, Willie wears a leather vest or jacket with leather chaps on top of his usual football jersey and pants and rides into Bill Snyder Family Stadium on a Harley Davidson motorcycle, followed by around 50 other K-State fans on motorcycles.

==Rivalries==

===Kansas State vs. Kansas (Sunflower Showdown)===
{{See also|Governor's Cup (Kansas)}}
{{See also|Kansas â Kansas State football all-time results}}

Kansas State and Kansas first played in 1902 and have faced each other every season since [[1911 in sports|1911]], making this the third-longest uninterrupted series in [[college football]] history.  The two rivals compete annually for the [[Governor's Cup (Kansas)|Governor's Cup]] trophy.

Dating back to the beginnings of Kansas State and Kansas football, neither school had sustained excellence consistently.  The first time both schools met as ranked teams was not until 1995, when the University of Kansas came into the game 7-0 and ranked #6 in the [[AP Poll]], while Kansas State University was 5-1 and ranked #14.  Kansas State beat KU decisively 41-7 in that game.  KU leads the all-time series 64&amp;ndash;40&amp;ndash;5 after the [[2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2011]] game, but the rivalry has been very even since the Governor's Cup series began in 1969, with Kansas State holding a 23-19-1 lead.  The University of Kansas disputes the series record because it does not acknowledge its forfeit of a 1980 victory.&lt;ref name=forfeit&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sports People  | publisher = New York Times | date = August 27, 1982  | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503EEDE1738F934A1575BC0A964948260 | accessdate =2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas State vs. Iowa State===
{{See also|Farmageddon (football)}}

Kansas State has played Iowa State every year since 1917.  The series record is the closest for Kansas State against any of its old Big Eight Conference rivals, with Iowa State holding a 49-41-4 lead following the [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2010]] game.

In 2009, the two schools began playing a series of neutral site games in [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and fans and media adopted the name &quot;[[Farmageddon (football)|Farmageddon]]&quot; for the series.  Kansas State University won the first &quot;Farmageddon&quot; game in Kansas City by the score of 24-23, on October 3, 2009.  K-State also won the 2010 match-up, 27-20.

===Kansas State vs. Nebraska===
Kansas State and Nebraska were conference rivals for decades, from 1913 to 2010.  With only 115 miles separating the two schools, they were the closest cross-border rivals in the Big 8 and Big 12 conferences.  The two schools played for the first time in 1911, and then played every year from 1922, making it one of the longest uninterrupted series in college football, until Nebraska moved to the Big Ten Conference in 2011.

However, Nebraska long held a commanding lead in the series, keeping the rivalry limited.  All-time, Nebraska leads the series 78&amp;ndash;15&amp;ndash;2.  Kansas State lost 29 consecutive games to Nebraska until November 14, 1998, when #1 Kansas State beat #11 Nebraska 40&amp;ndash;30.  The record between the two schools after that game was much more even, with Kansas State again beating Nebraska in 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  During that era, the Wildcats and Cornhuskers consistently competed for the Big 12 North championship.

The [[1939 Nebraska vs. Kansas State football game|1939 contest]] between the two teams was televised locally in Manhattan, becoming only the second [[College football on television|televised college football game]].  The 1992 contest was played in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], as the [[Coca-Cola Classic (college football)|Coca-Cola Classic]].
