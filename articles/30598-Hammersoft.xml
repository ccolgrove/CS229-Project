{{train topics}}

A '''train''' is a connected series of vehicles for [[rail transport]] that move along a [[Rail tracks|track]] ([[permanent way]]) to transport [[cargo]] or [[passenger]]s from one place to another place. The track usually consists of two [[Rail profile|rails]], but might also be a [[monorail]] or [[magnetic levitation train|maglev]] guideway.

Propulsion for the train is provided by a separate [[locomotive]], or from individual motors in self-propelled [[multiple unit]]s. Most modern trains are powered by [[diesel locomotive]]s or by [[Electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[Overhead lines|overhead wires]] or [[Third rail|additional rails]], although historically (from the early 19th century to the mid-20th century) the [[steam locomotive]] was the dominant form of locomotive power. Other sources of power (such as [[Horsecar|horses]], [[Cable railway|rope or wire]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and [[gas turbine]]s) are possible.

The word 'train' comes from the [[Old French]] ''trahiner'', itself from the [[Latin]] ''trahere'' 'pull, draw'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Train (noun) | work = (definition â Compact OED) | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of trains==
[[File:SiemensVelaroD-InnoTrans2010.jpg|thumb|German [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] high speed passenger train (a form of [[multiple unit]])]]

There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train can consist of a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and attached [[railroad car]]s, or a self-propelled [[multiple unit]] (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a [[railcar]]). Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity.

Special kinds of trains running on corresponding special 'railways' are [[atmospheric railway]]s, [[monorail]]s, [[high-speed rail]]ways, [[Maglev train|maglev]], [[Rubber-tyred metro|rubber-tired underground]], [[funicular]] and [[Rack railway|cog railways]].

A passenger train may consist of one or several locomotives and coaches. Alternatively, a train may consist entirely of passenger carrying coaches, some or all of which are powered as a &quot;[[multiple unit]]&quot;. In many parts of the world, particularly the [[Far East]] and [[Europe]], [[high-speed rail]] is used extensively for passenger travel.

Freight trains comprise of wagons or trucks rather than carriages, though some parcel and mail trains (especially [[Travelling Post Office]]s) are outwardly more like passenger trains.

Trains can also be 'mixed', comprising both passenger accommodation and freight vehicles. Such mixed trains are most likely to occur where services are infrequent, and running separate passenger and freight trains is not cost-effective, though the differing needs of passengers and freight usually means this is avoided where possible.

Special trains are also used for [[Rail tracks#Track maintenance|track maintenance]]; in some places, this is called maintenance of way.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a train hauled by two locomotives is said to be &quot;double-headed&quot;, and in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] it is quite common for a long freight train to be headed by three or more locomotives. A train with a locomotive attached at each end is described as 'top and tailed', this practice typically being used when there are no reversing facilities available. Where a second locomotive is attached temporarily to assist a train up steep banks or grades (or down them by providing braking power) it is referred to as '[[bank engine|banking]]' in the UK, or 'helper service' in North America. Recently, many loaded trains in the US have been made up with one or more locomotives in the middle or at the rear of the train, operated remotely from the lead cab. This is referred to as &quot;DP&quot; or &quot;Distributed Power.&quot;

===Terminology===
The [[railway terminology]] that is used to describe a 'train' varies between countries.
;United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, the interchangeable terms '''set''' and '''unit''' are used to refer to a group of permanently or semi-permanently coupled vehicles, such as those of a [[multiple unit]]. While when referring to a train made up of a variety of vehicles, or of several sets/units, the term '''formation''' is used. (Although the UK public and media often forgo 'formation', for simply 'train'.) The word '''rake''' is also used for a group of coaches or wagons.

In the United Kingdom Section 83(1) of the [[Railways Act 1993]] defines &quot;train&quot; as follows:
:a) two or more items of rolling stock coupled together, at least one of which is a locomotive; or
:b) a locomotive not coupled to any other rolling stock.

;United States
In the United States, the term '''consist''' is used to describe the group of rail vehicles which make up a train. When referring to [[motive power]], '''consist''' refers to the group of [[locomotive]]s powering the train. Similarly, the term '''trainset''' refers to a group of [[rolling stock]] that is permanently or semi-permanently coupled together to form a unified set of equipment (the term is most often applied to [[passenger train]] configurations).

There are three types of trains: Electric, Diesel and Steam. 

The [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]'s 1948 operating rules define a train as: &quot;An engine or more than one engine coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway| title=Rules: Operating Department| year=1948| pages=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bogies==
[[Image:Railroad truck,FM55-20.Fig8-8.png|thumb|US-style railroad truck (bogie) with [[journal bearing]]s]]
{{Main|Bogie}}
A '''bogie''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|b|oÊ|É¡|i}} {{USdict|bÅâ²Â·gÄ}}) is a [[wheel]]ed wagon or trolley. In [[Machine|mechanics]] terms, a bogie is a [[chassis]] or framework carrying wheels, attached to a vehicle. It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar [[tracked vehicle]].

==Motive power==
{{Main|Locomotive}}
The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by [[steam locomotive]]s. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labour intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s, while at about the same time self-propelled [[multiple unit]] vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service. In most countries [[dieselisation]] of locomotives in day-to-day use was completed by the 1970s. A few countries, most notably the [[People's Republic of China]], where [[coal]] and labour are cheap, still use a few steam locomotives, but most have been phased out. [[Heritage railway|Historic steam trains]] still run in many other countries, for the leisure and enthusiast market.

Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Since the cost per mile of construction is much higher, electric traction is less viable for long-distance lines with the exception of long-distance high speed lines. Electric trains receive their current via [[overhead lines]] or through a [[Third rail|third rail electric system]].

A recent variation of the electric locomotive is the [[fuel cell locomotive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/blog2/index.php/hydrogen-vehicles/i-hear-the-hydrogen-train-a-comin-its-rolling-round-the-bend/ Hydrogen trains]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnsf.com/media/news/articles/2008/01/2008-01-09a.html Vehicle Projects Inc. Fuel cell locomotive]&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel cell locomotives combine the advantage of not needing an electrical system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation. However, the initial cost of such [[fuel cell vehicle]]s is still substantial at the moment.

==Passenger trains==
[[File:323godley.jpg|thumb|Class 323 at Godley]]
[[Image:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] in a long-distance train in [[Finland]]]]

A passenger train is one which includes passenger-carrying vehicles. It may be a self-powered [[multiple unit]] or [[railcar]], or else a combination of one or more [[locomotive]]s and one or more unpowered trailers known as [[passenger car (rail)|coaches, cars or carriages]]. Passenger trains travel between [[train station|stations]] or [[train station|depot]]s, at which passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed [[Public transport timetable|schedule]] and have superior track occupancy rights over [[freight train]]s.

Oversight of a passenger train is the responsibility of the [[conductor (transportation)|conductor]]. He or she is usually assisted by other crew members, such as service attendants or [[porter (railroad)|porters]]. During the heyday of [[North America]]n passenger rail travel, long distance trains carried two conductors: the aforementioned train conductor, and a [[Pullman Company|Pullman conductor]], the latter being in charge of [[sleeping car]] personnel.

Many [[Luxury Trains|prestigious passenger train services]] have been given a [[List of named passenger trains|specific name]], some of which have become [[Famous trains|famous]] in literature and fiction. In past years, railroaders often referred to passenger trains as the &quot;varnish&quot;, alluding to the bygone days of wooden-bodied coaches with their lustrous exterior finishes and fancy [[livery]]. &quot;Blocking the varnish&quot; meant a slow-moving freight train was obstructing a fast passenger train, causing delays.

Some passenger trains, both long distance and short distanced, may use [[Bilevel car|bi-level (double-decker)]] cars to carry more passengers per train. Car design and the general safety of passenger trains have dramatically evolved over time, making travel by rail remarkably safe.

====High-speed rail====
[[Image:Shinkansen 500 Kyoto 2005-03-19.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[Shinkansen]] [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 Series]] ([[High-speed rail]])]]
{{Main|High-speed rail}}

One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. Generally, high speed rail runs at speeds above {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and often operates on dedicated track that is surveyed and prepared to accommodate high speeds. [[Japan]]'s [[Shinkansen]] (&quot;bullet-train&quot;) commenced operation in 1964, and was the first successful example of a high speed passenger rail system.

The fastest wheeled train running on rails is [[France]]'s [[TGV]] (Train Ã  Grande Vitesse, literally &quot;high speed train&quot;), which achieved a speed of {{convert|574.8|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, twice the takeoff speed of a [[Boeing 727]] [[jetliner]], under test conditions in 2007. The highest speed currently attained in scheduled revenue operation is {{convert|350|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} on the [[BeijingâTianjin Intercity Rail]] and [[WuhanâGuangzhou High-Speed Railway]] systems in China. The TGV runs at a maximum revenue speed of {{convert|300|-|320|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, as does [[Germany]]'s [[InterCityExpress|Inter-City Express]].

In most cases, high-speed rail travel is time- and cost-competitive with air travel when distances do not exceed {{convert|500|to|600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, as [[airport]] [[check-in]] and boarding procedures may add as many as two hours to the actual transit time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Central Japan Railway| title=Central Japan Railway Data Book 2006| year=2006| pages=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, rail operating costs over these distances may be lower when the amount of [[jet fuel|fuel]] consumed by an [[airliner]] during [[takeoff|takeoff and climbout]] is considered. As travel distance increases, the latter consideration becomes less of the total cost of operating an airliner and air travel becomes more cost-competitive.

Some high speed rail equipment employs [[tilting train|tilting technology]] to improve stability in curves. Examples of such equipment are the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), the [[Pendolino]], the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], [[Amtrak]]'s [[Acela Express]] and the [[Talgo]]. Tilting is a dynamic form of [[superelevation]], allowing both low- and high-speed traffic to use the same trackage (though not simultaneously, of course), as well as producing a more comfortable ride for passengers.

====Maglev====
{{Main|Maglev (transport) }}
In order to achieve much faster operation over {{convert|500|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, innovative [[Maglev train|Maglev]] technology has been researched for years. The [[Shanghai Maglev Train]], opened in 2003, is the fastest commercial train service of any kind, operating at speeds of up to {{convert|430|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. So far, however, Maglev has not been used for inter-city [[Public transport|mass transit]] routes.

===Inter-city trains===

{{Main|Inter-city rail}}

[[Passenger trains]] can be divided into three major groups:
* [[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains: connecting cities in the fastest time possible, by passing all [[intermediate]] stations
* [[Fast]] trains: calling at larger intermediate stations between cities, serving large [[Urban area|urban]] [[communities]]
* [[Regional]] trains: calling at all intermediate stations between cities, serving all lineside [[communities]]

The distinction between the types can be thin or even non-existent. Trains can run as Intercity services between major cities, then revert to a fast or even regional train service to serve communities at the [[extremity]] of their journey. This practice allows [[marginalization|marginal]] communities remaining to be served while saving [[money]] at the expense of a longer journey time for those wishing to travel to the [[Train_station#Terminus|terminus]] station.

====Regional trains====
{{Main|Regional rail}}
Regional trains usually connect between towns and cities,  rather than purely linking major population hubs like inter-city train, and serve local traffic demand in relatively [[Rural|rural area]].

===Short-distance trains===
====Commuter trains====
[[File:Mumbai Train.JPG|thumb|[[Mumbai Suburban Railway|Mumbai's suburban trains]] handle 6.3 million commuters daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm|work=Official webpage of Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation|title=Overview Of the existing Mumbai Suburban Railway|accessdate=2008-12-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080620033027/http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Jr t204standing.jpg|thumb|Interior of a 6-door passenger car in Japan, when the bench seats are folded]]
[[File:Trendecosta.jpg|thumb|&quot;Tren de la costa&quot; Train in Argentina]]
{{Main|Commuter rail|Commuter rail in North America}}
For shorter distances many cities have networks of [[commuter train]]s, serving the city and its suburbs. Trains are a very efficient [[mode of transport]]ation to cope with large traffic demand in a [[metropolis]]. Compared with road transport, it carries many people with much smaller land area and little air pollution.

Some carriages may be laid out to have more standing room than seats, or to facilitate the carrying of [[Baby transport#Pushable vehicles|prams]], [[bicycle|cycles]] or [[wheelchair]]s. Some countries have [[Bilevel car|double-decked passenger trains]] for use in conurbations. Double deck high speed and sleeper trains are becoming more common in mainland Europe.

Sometimes extreme congestion of commuter trains becomes a problem. For example, an estimated 3.5 million passengers ride every day on [[Yamanote Line]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan, with its 29 stations. For comparison, the New York City Subway carries 4.8 million passengers per day on 24 services serving 468 stations. To cope with large traffic, special cars in which the bench seats fold up to provide standing room only during the morning rush hour (until 10 a.m.) are operated in Tokyo ([[E231 series]] train). In the past this train has included 2 cars with six doors on each side to shorten the time for passengers to get on and off at station.

Passenger trains usually have [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] handles (or a &quot;communication cord&quot;) that the public can operate. Misuse is punished by a heavy [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].

===Long-distance trains===
Long-distance trains travel between many cities and/or regions of a country, and sometimes cross several countries. They often have a [[dining car]] or restaurant car to allow passengers to have a meal during the course of their journey. Trains travelling overnight may also have [[sleeping car]]s. Currently much of travel on these distances of over 500 miles is done by air on many countries but on many others long-distance travel by rail is popular or only cheap way to cross vast distances.


===Within cities===
====Rapid transit====
{{Main|Commuter rail in North America|Commuter rail|Rapid transit|Urban rail in the United Kingdom}}
Large cities often have a [[rapid transit|metro]] system, also called underground, subway or tube. The trains are electrically powered, usually by [[third rail]], and their railroads are separate from other traffic, usually without [[level crossing]]s. Usually they run in tunnels in the city centre and sometimes on elevated structures in the outer parts of the city. They can accelerate and decelerate faster than heavier, long-distance trains.

The term '''[[rapid transit]]''' is used for public transport such as commuter trains, metro and light rail. However, in New York City, services on the [[New York City Subway]] have been referred to as &quot;trains&quot;.

====Tram====
{{Main|Tram}}
In most countries, such as the United Kingdom, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law. In the US and Canada such street railways are mostly referred to as [[tram|trolleys]]. The key difference between a railroad and a trolley system is the latter running primarily on public streets, whereas trains have a [[Right of way (public throughway)|right of way]] separated from the public. Often the US style [[interurban]] and modern [[light rail]] are confused with a trolley system, as it too may run on on the street for short or medium long sections. In some languages the word tram also refers to interurban and light rail -style networks, in particular [[Netherlands|Dutch]].

The length of a tram or trolley may be determined by national regulations. Germany has the so-called [[Bo-Strab]] standard, restricting the length of a tram to 75 metres, while in the US, vehicle length is normally restricted by local authorities, often allowing only a single type of vehicle to operate on the network.

====Light rail====
{{Main|Light rail}}
The term [[light rail]] is sometimes used for a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a [[Rapid transit|subway]] except that it may have level crossings. These are then usually protected with crossing gates. In US terminology these systems are often referred to as [[interurban]], as they connect larger urban areas in the vicinity of a major city to that city. Modern light rail systems often use abandoned heavy rail [[Right of way (public throughway)|rights of way]] (e.g. former railway lines) to revitalize deprived areas and [[redevelopment]] sites in and around large [[agglomerations]].

====Monorail ====
{{Main|Monorail}}
[[Monorail]] was developed to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, but represents a relatively small part of the overall railway field.

===Named trains===
{{See also|Lists of named passenger trains}}
Railway companies often give a name to a train service as a marketing exercise, to raise the profile of the service and hence attract more passengers (and also to gain [[Praise|kudos]] for the company). Usually, naming is reserved for the most prestigious trains: the high-speed express trains between major cities, stopping at few intermediate stations. The names of services such as the [[Orient Express]], the [[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]], the [[FlÃ¨che d'Or]] and the [[Royal Scot (train)|Royal Scot]] have passed into popular culture.

A somewhat less common practice is the naming of freight trains, for the same commercial reasons. The &quot;Condor&quot; was an overnight [[London]]-[[Glasgow]] express goods train, in the 1960s, hauled by pairs of [[British Rail Class 28|&quot;Metrovick&quot;]] diesel locomotives. In the mid-1960s, [[British Rail]] introduced the [[Freightliner (UK)|&quot;Freightliner&quot;]] brand, for the new train services carrying [[containerization|containers]] between dedicated terminals around the rail network. The [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] also named freight trains, coining the term ''[[The Flying Kipper]]'' for the overnight express fish train that appeared in his stories in [[The Railway Series]] books.

===Other types===
;Heritage trains
{{Main|Heritage railway}}
Heritage trains are operated by volunteers, often [[railfans]], as a tourist attraction. Usually trains are formed from historic vehicles retired from national commercial operation.

;Airport trains
Airport trains transport people between terminals within an airport complex.

;Mine trains
Mine trains are operated in large mines and carry both workers and goods.
;Overland trains
[[Overland train]]s are used to carry cargo over rough terrain.

==Freight trains==

A [[freight train]] (also known as goods train) uses '''[[Railroad car#Freight cars|freight cars]]''' (also known as wagons or trucks) to transport goods or materials ([[cargo]])&amp;nbsp;â essentially any train that is not used for carrying passengers. Much of the world's freight is transported by train, and in the [[United States]] the rail system is used more for transporting freight than passengers.

Under the right circumstances, transporting freight by train is highly economic, and also more energy efficient than transporting freight by road. Rail freight is most economic when freight is being carried in bulk and over long distances, but is less suited to short distances and small loads. Bulk aggregate movements of a mere twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) can be cost effective even allowing for [[Transshipment|trans-shipment]] costs. These trans-shipment costs dominate in many cases and many modern practices such as [[Intermodal container]] freight are aimed at minimizing these.

The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility. For this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to [[road transport|road competition]]. Many governments are now trying to encourage more freight onto trains, because of the benefits that it would bring.

There are many different types of freight trains, which are used to carry many different kinds of freight, with many different types of [[Railroad car#Freight cars|wagons]]. One of the most common types on modern railways are container trains, where containers can be lifted on and off the train by [[crane (machine)|crane]]s and loaded off or onto [[truck]]s or [[ship]]s.

In the U.S. this type of freight train has largely superseded the traditional [[boxcar]] (wagon-load) type of freight train, with which the cargo has to be loaded or unloaded manually. In Europe the [[Covered goods wagon#Sliding wall wagons|sliding wall wagon]] has taken over from the ordinary [[covered goods wagon]].

In some countries &quot;[[Piggy-back (transportation)#Rail|piggy-back]]&quot; trains or [[rolling highway]]s are used: In the latter case [[truck]]s can drive straight onto the train and drive off again when the end destination is reached. A system like this is used through the [[Channel Tunnel]] between [[England]] and [[France]], and for the trans-Alpine service between France and [[Italy]] (this service uses [[Gondola (rail)#Modalohr road trailer carriers|Modalohr road trailer carriers]]). &quot;Piggy-back&quot; trains are the fastest growing type of freight trains in the United States, where they are also known as &quot;[[Semi-trailer|trailer]] on [[flatcar]]&quot; or TOFC trains. Piggy-back trains require no special modifications to the vehicles being carried. An alternative type of &quot;inter-modal&quot; vehicle, known as a [[roadrailer]], is designed to be physically attached to the train. The original trailers were fitted with two sets of wheels&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; one set flanged, for the trailer to run connected to other such trailers as a rail vehicle in a train; and one set tyred, for use as the [[semi-trailer]] of a road vehicle. More modern trailers have only road wheels and are designed to be carried on specially adapted [[bogie]]s (trucks) when moving on rails.

There are also many other types of [[Railroad car#Freight cars|wagons]], such as &quot;low loader&quot; wagons for transporting road vehicles. There are [[refrigerator car]]s for transporting [[food]]s such as ice cream. There are simple types of [[Gondola (rail)|open-topped wagons]] for transporting [[mineral]]s and bulk material such as [[coal]], and [[tank car|tankers]] for transporting liquids and gases. Today, however, most coal and aggregates are moved in [[hopper car|hopper wagons]] that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials.

Freight trains are sometimes illegally boarded by passengers who do not wish to pay money, or do not have the money to travel by ordinary means. This is referred to as &quot;[[freighthopping]]&quot; and is considered by some communities{{who|date=March 2011}} to be a viable form of transport. A common way of boarding the train illegally is by sneaking into a train yard and stowing away in an unattended boxcar; a more dangerous practice is trying to catch a train &quot;on the fly&quot;, that is, as it is moving, leading to occasional fatalities. Railroads treat it as trespassing and may prosecute it as such.
