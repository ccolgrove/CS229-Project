{{Clint Eastwood sidebar}}
'''[[Clint Eastwood]]''' was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a steelworker and migrant worker, and Margaret Ruth (Runner) Eastwood, a factory worker.

==Early life==
He was a large baby (11 pounds and 6 ounces) and was named &quot;Samson&quot; by the nurses in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama guardian.co.uk Gentle man Clint, November 2, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Paul|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Clint Eastwood a Cultural Production|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1993|location=Minnesota|pages=|month=|url=|isbn=0816619581}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised in a &quot;middle class [[Protestant]] home&quot; along with his younger sister Jean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/people/pe/Clint_Eastwood.html adherents.com The Religious Affiliation of actor/director Clint Eastwood].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved often, as his father worked at different jobs along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/03/Sunday/main671541.shtml CBS Evening News interview, February 6, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; The family settled in [[Piedmont, California]], where Eastwood attended Piedmont Junior High School and Piedmont Senior High School.

Eastwood was a bored student and records indicate he had to attend summer school.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillaganp34&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his athletic and musical talents, Eastwood shunned school teams and the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillaganp34&quot;/&gt; He was told he would make a good basketball player, but he was interested in individual pursuits like tennis and golf, a passion he retains today.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillaganp34&quot;/&gt; He transferred to [[Oakland Technical High School]], where the drama teachers encouraged him to take part in school plays, but was not interested. According to Eastwood,  all he had on his mind were &quot;fast cars and easy women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan37&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.37&lt;/ref&gt;  He took auto mechanic courses and studied aircraft maintenance, rebuilding both aircraft and car engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan37&quot;/&gt; Eastwood also became a pianist; according to a friend, he &quot;would actually play the piano until his fingers were bleeding&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan37&quot;/&gt;

By early 1949, his father moved to a plant in [[Seattle]]. Eastwood had to move in with a friend, Harry Pendleton, to finish high school in Oakland. He was invited to a house party in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where he met the film director [[Howard Hawks]], who with [[John Ford]] would influence his career.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood rejoined his family in Seattle when he was 19 and he worked at the Weyerhaeuser Company pulp mill in [[Springfield, Oregon]] with his father.&lt;ref&gt;The King of Western Swing - Bob Wills Remembered. Rosetta Wills. 1998. p. 165 ISBN 0-8230-7744-6.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked briefly as a [[lifeguard]] after obtaining a certificate from a [[Red Cross]] course,&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.43&lt;/ref&gt; and played [[ragtime]] piano at a bar in [[Oakland, Oregon|Oakland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Career&quot;&gt;[http://www.vault.com/nr/main_article_detail.jsp?article_id=19109&amp;cat_id=0&amp;ht_type=2 Career].&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood intended to enter [[Seattle University]] and major in music, but in 1950, during the [[Korean War]], he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. He was stationed at [[Fort Ord]] where his certificate as a lifeguard got him appointed as a life-saving and swimming instructor. Eastwood excelled as an instructor and was promoted to corporal. To supplement his $67 a month Army salary, he held a part-time job on a loading dock for the Spreckles Sugar Refining Company. When discovered by the Army, he was required to quit the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z16&quot;&gt;Zmijewsky (1982), p.16&lt;/ref&gt; He visited [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] for the first time and remarked that &quot;someday I'd like to live here&quot;, although he confessed he had gained unwanted attention from a 23-year-old school teacher, after a one night stand, who stalked him and threatened to kill herself.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wpdms usgs photo point reyes large.jpg|thumb|left|[[Point Reyes]] where Eastwood survived a plane crash in October 1951]]
In October 1951, Eastwood was aboard a [[A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD-1]] military aircraft that crashed into the [[Pacific Ocean]] north of San Francisco's Drake's Bay. The aircraft had departed from Seattle, bound for [[Mather Air Force Base]] at [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. When the intercommunications system failed, the aircraft was forced to [[water landing|ditch]] in the sea two miles off [[Point Reyes]]. Eastwood escaped serious injury, and using an inflatable raft, he swam to shore. The crash was headline news on October 1, 1951 in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.50&lt;/ref&gt; He later reflected on his thoughts during the crash, &quot;I thought I might die. But then I thought, Other people have made it through these things before. I kept my eyes on the lights on shore and kept swimming.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z16&quot;/&gt; Eastwood testified at an investigating hearing, and this kept him from going to [[Korea]] with the rest of his unit.&lt;ref name=sammon&gt;[http://sammonsays.com/artman/publish/clint-eastwood-column.shtml sammonsays.com John Sammon interview of Eastwood].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; During his military service, Eastwood became friends with future successful TV actors [[Martin Milner]] and [[David Janssen]].

Eastwood left Fort Ord in the spring of 1951 and moved back up to Seattle where he worked as a lifeguard for some time. However, as he had little money and few friends in Seattle, he moved down to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood began a romance with a girl named Maggie Johnson and during this time he worked managing an apartment house in [[Beverly Hills]] by day (into which he then moved) and worked at a Signal Oil gas station by night.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan55&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Z17&quot;&gt;Zmijewsky (1982), p.17&lt;/ref&gt; He signed up to study at [[Los Angeles City College]] and quickly became engaged to Maggie; they married shortly before Christmas 1953 in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]] with friend Harry Pendleton as his best man, and honeymooned in Carmel.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan55&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.56&lt;/ref&gt; After concluding his part-time work, he held several jobs digging foundations for residential swimming pools,&lt;ref name=&quot;Z17&quot;/&gt;  which he continued in between his early films.&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky (1982), p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work:1950s==
===Becoming an actor===
According to the CBS press release for ''Rawhide'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]] (known then as Universal-International) film company happened to be shooting in Fort Ord and an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan52&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.52&lt;/ref&gt; However, the key figure, according to his official biography was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan52&quot;/&gt; While in Los Angeles, Hill had reacquainted with Eastwood and with the help of an attractive telephone operator who took a shining to him, managed to succeed in sneaking Eastwood into a Universal studio and showed him to cameraman [[Irving Glassberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan52&quot;/&gt; Glassberg was impressed with his appearance and stature and believed him to be, &quot;the sort of good looking young man that has traditionally done well in the movies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan52&quot;/&gt;

Glassberg arranged for director [[Arthur Lubin]] to meet Eastwood at the gas station where he was working in the evenings in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan52&quot;/&gt; Lubin, like Glassberg was highly impressed, remarking, &quot;so tall and slim and very handsome looking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan60&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.60&lt;/ref&gt; He swiftly arranged for Eastwood's first audition but was rather less enthusiastic, remarking, &quot;He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan60&quot;/&gt; Neverless, he told Eastwood not to give up, and suggested he attend drama classes, and later arranged for an initial contract for Eastwood in April 1954 at $100 a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan60&quot;/&gt; Some people in Hollywood, including his wife Maggie, were suspicious of Lubin's intentions towards Eastwood; he was homosexual and maintained a close friendship with Eastwood in the years that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan84&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.84&lt;/ref&gt;  After signing, Eastwood was required to perform in front of staff members, including actress [[Myrna Hansen]]. He played Alan Squier, a disillusioned English intellectual from ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' and in one scene was required to strip in front of the Universal staff.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.61&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially criticised for his speech and awkward manner; he was soft-spoken and in performing in front of people was cold, stiff and awkward.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow talent school actor [[John Saxon (actor)|John Saxon]], described Eastwood as, &quot;being like a kind of hayseed.. Thin, rural, with a prominent [[Adam's Apple]], very laconic and slow speechwise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan63&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The new trainee was certainly not naturally disposed to being a leading man. He lacked creative imagination in the improvisations and although he had a sense of humor and was successful with women offscreen, it didn't transcend into his early acting.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan63&quot;/&gt;

===Universal Studios: Training and development===

In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition, trying out for a part in ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'', a film about the [[The Great Brinks Robbery|Brinks robbery]] that would mark the debut of actor [[Sal Mineo]]. Director [[Joseph Pevney]] was not impressed by his acting and rejected him for any role.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan63&quot;/&gt;  Later he tried out for ''[[Brigadoon]]'', ''[[The Constant Nymph (1954 film)|The Constant Nymph]]'', ''[[Bengal Brigade]]'' and ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' in May 1954, ''[[Sign of the Pagan]]'' (June), ''[[Smoke Signal]]'' (August) and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops]]'' (September), all without success.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan63&quot;/&gt; Eastwood was eventually given a minor role by director [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]] in the film ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'', a film set in the Amazon jungle, which was the sequel to ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' which had been released just months earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan64&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood played the role of Jennings, a white-coated lab technician who assists the doctor ([[John Agar]]) in researching the &quot;creature&quot; and has a liking to white rats used in testing, keeping one in his pocket. His scene was shot in one day on Friday, July 30, 1954 at Stage No. 16 in Universal, although much of the rest of the film was shot at Marineland [[south of St Augustine, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;www.marineland.net/history/php&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, the young Eastwood and his wife Maggie moved into an apartment at [[Villa Sands]] at 4040 Arch Drive off [[Ventura Boulevard]] to be closer to the Universal lot, also occupied by fellow Universal actresses [[Gia Scala]] and [[Lili Kardell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan65-6&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; It also gave Eastwood an opportunity to continue his swimming as it had notable swimming facilities, and the apartment block became a venue for many swimsuit photoshoots, including a memorable one of [[Anita Ekberg]] in a leopard skin bikini.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan65-6&quot;/&gt; Maggie helped supplement the income by working as a model, and toyed with the idea of acting.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.68&lt;/ref&gt; In Christmas 1954, he agreed to play the part of a scarecrow in the annual musical given to the children of the employees of the Universal studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan72&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.72&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Eastwood was coached by Jess Kimmel and Jack Kosslyn, and UCLA professor, Dr. [[Daniel Vandraegen]] who specialized in correcting bad speech. Eastwood had an early tendency to speak almost in a sibilant whisper and was advised to project his voice. These traits never fully went away, but actually worked in his favor in his later films, especially as the Man with No Name in which he often hissed his lines through clenched teeth.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan72&quot;/&gt; Although Clint was self-conscious on camera, he demonstrated a strength in displaying anger onscreen, and in one improvised scene during training with [[Betty Jane Howarth]], it left her in tears.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Eastwood was likened to [[Gary Cooper]] and that he resembled a tall, rangy version of [[James Dean]] with his high forehead and unruly quiff.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan73&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was a great admirer of Dean and his rebel image.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan73&quot;/&gt; However, one day he was introduced to James Dean at Lili Kardell's apartment and Dean showed little enthusiasm, prompting Eastwood to yank him to his feet and chort, &quot;Goddamn it, fellow, stand up when I speak to you&quot;, although he was apparently kidding.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan73&quot;/&gt; Eastwood also met [[Charlton Heston]] for the first time at a gym, mistaking him for [[Chuck Connors]].&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's ''[[Lady Godiva of Coventry]]'' in which he donned a medieval costume, and then in February 1955, won a role playing &quot;Jonesy&quot;, a sailor in ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' and his salary was raised to $300 a week for the four weeks of shooting.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.79&lt;/ref&gt;  He again appeared in a Jack Arnold film,  ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', with a small role as a squadron pilot, again uncredited.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.80&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours work into the film ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'', in which he again plays a white coated technician uttering a single line and again had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with ''Law Man'', also known as ''[[Stars in the Dust]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan81&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.81&lt;/ref&gt; He gained experience behind the set, watching productions  and dubbing and editing sessions of other films at Universal Studios, notably the [[Montgomery Clift]] film ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan81&quot;/&gt; Universal presented him with his first TV role with a small television debut on [[NBC]]'s ''Allen in Movieland'' on July 2, 1955, starring actors such as [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Benny Goodman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan86&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.86&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his records at Universal revealed his development, Universal along with Miss El Salvador and Miss Ceylon, terminated his contract on October 25, 1955, leaving Eastwood gutted and blaming casting director [[Robert Palmer (casting director)|Robert Palmer]], on whom he would exact revenge years later when Palmer came looking for employment at his [[Malpaso Company]]. Eastwood rejected him.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.82-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===''No Man's Land'': 1956&amp;ndash;1958===
On the recommendation of Betty Jane Howarth, Eastwood soon joined new publicity representatives, the Marsh Agency, who had represented actors such as [[Adam West]] and [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan84&quot;/&gt; Although Eastwood's contract with Lubin had ended, he was important in landing Eastwood his biggest role to date; a featured role in the [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Carol Channing]] western comedy, ''[[The First Traveling Saleslady]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan85&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood played a recruitment officer for [[Teddy Roosevelt]]'s Rough Riders. He would also play a pilot in another of Lubin's productions, ''[[Escapade in Japan]]'' and would make several TV appearances under Lubin even into the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan85&quot;/&gt; As Eastwood grew in success, he never spoke to Lubin again until 1992, shortly after winning his Oscar for ''[[Unforgiven]]'', when Eastwood promised a lunch that never happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan85&quot;/&gt;

Without the contract of Lubin in the meantime, however, Eastwood was struggling.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan85&quot;/&gt; He was advised by [[Irving Leonard (accountant)|Irving Leonard]] financially and under his influence changed talent agencies in rapid succession, the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956, and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed a small role as temperamental army officer for a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Reader's Digest'' series, broadcast in January 1956, and later that year, a motorcycle gang member on a ''Highway Patrol'' episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan85&quot;/&gt;
In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet who becomes involved in a skiing search and rescue in the 'White Fury' installment of the ''[[West Point]]'' series. He also appeared in an episode of the prime time series ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and a suicidal gold prospector in ''[[Death Valley Days]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan87&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.87&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of ''[[Navy Log]]'' and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance as a cowardly villain, intent on marrying a rich girl for money, in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan87&quot;/&gt;

During this period, Eastwood applied for assorted day jobs, dug pools and began working out hard in the gym.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan87&quot;/&gt; He attended further acting classes held by Jack Kosslyn whose students also included people like [[Nick Adams (actor)|Nick Adams]], [[Irish McCalla]], [[Jamie Farr]] and [[Jeanne Baird]] and other developing actors. Eastwood also displayed an early toughness in real life when on one evening Eastwood, his wife, Floyd Simmons and another couple had gone to dinner at Trader Vic's and were theatened at gunpoint before entering the restaurant by a gang of Latin thugs. Although his friends turned to flee, Clint stood his ground and growled, &quot;Go on and pull that trigger, you little son of a bitch, and I'll kill you before I hit the ground&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan90&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.90&lt;/ref&gt; The thugs ran off.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan90&quot;/&gt; On another occasion, Clint and friend Fritz Manes were at a bar on Highland Avenue where Clint's long, wavy hair caught the attention of a group of sailors who taunted him and called him a &quot;Hollywood faggot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan90&quot;/&gt; One of them landed a punch to Eastwood's face, but Eastwood surprised them, putting two of the men in hospital and injuring the others.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood was credited for his roles in several more films. He auditioned for the film ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The Spirit of St. Louis]]'', a [[Billy Wilder]] biopic about aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]]. He was rejected and the role in the end went to [[Jimmy Stewart]] who just put on makeup to make him look younger. He did however have a small part as an aviator in the French picture ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'', and played an ex-renegade in the Confederacy in ''[[Ambush at Cimarron Pass]]'', his biggest screen role to date opposite [[Scott Brady]]. His part was shot in nine days for Regal Films Inc. Out of frustration, he dismissed the film as &quot;probably the lousiest Western ever made&quot;, and said, &quot;It was sooo bad. I just kept sinking lower and lower in my seat and just wanted to quit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan93&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time the film was released Eastwood described himself as feeling &quot;really depressed&quot; and regards it as the lowest point in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan93&quot;/&gt; He seriously considered quitting the acting profession and returning to school to start doing something with his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan93&quot;/&gt;

===''Rawhide'' (1959â1964)===
Floyd Simmons recommended that Eastwood sign with his agent Bill Shiffrin, a hard man, noted for his work with other young, muscular actors. Shiffrin informed Clint that CBS were casting an hour-long Western series and urged him to attend the studio. There he met up with [[Sonia Chernus]], a story editor now working for NBC and while conversing with her, an executive, [[Robert Sparks]], spotted Eastwood in the canteen. The first thing he said was, &quot;How tall are you exactly&quot;? Clint replied, &quot;6'4&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan94&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.94&lt;/ref&gt; The executive invited him into his office and later arranged for a screen test with [[Charles Marquis Warren]] overlooking, in which Eastwood had to recite one of [[Henry Fonda]]'s monologues from the [[William Wellman]] western, ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan95&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.95&lt;/ref&gt;  A week later, Shiffrin rang Eastwood and informed him he had won the part of Rowdy Yates in ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''. He had successfully beaten competition such as [[Bing Russell]] and had got the break he had been looking for.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan95&quot;/&gt;

Filming began in [[Arizona]] in the summer of 1958. His rivalry onscreen with [[Eric Fleming]]'s character, Gil Favor, was reportedly initially echoed offscreen between the two actors. However, Eastwood has denied that the two ever had a scuffle and especially after Fleming's death by drowning in [[Peru]] some years later, has revealed he had much respect for his co-star.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The writer, Charles Marquis Warren, however, described Eastwood's co-star as, &quot;a miserable human being, not only a lousy performer but a colossal egotist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Although Eastwood was finally pleased with the direction of his career, he was not especially happy with the nature of his Rowdy Yates character. At this time, Eastwood was 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part. Although boyishness was a key element in his casting, Eastwood disliked the juvenile overtones of the character and privately described Yates as &quot;the idiot of the plains&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readersdigest.com.au/content/rd-face-to-face-clint-eastwood/ Reader's Digest Australia: RD Face to Face: Clint Eastwood&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; According to co-star [[Paul Brinegar]], who played Wishbone, Eastwood was, &quot;very unhappy about playing a teenager type&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood soon ended his contract with Bill Shiffrin and hired Lester Salkow as his talent agent between 1961 and 1963. In regards to his contracts though, it was Irving Leonard and the attorney [[Frank Wells]] who played an important role. They structured Eastwood's earnings, (now at $750 per episode) to avoid paying undue taxes and guaranteed the paychecks from CBS well into the future.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard in particular tightly controlled his finances to the extent that when he wanted to buy a car he had to request permission.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.105&lt;/ref&gt; He and Maggie continued to live inexpensively but bought a home in [[Sherman Oaks]] off [[Beverly Glen]], a modest hillside ranch. His first interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'' for ''Rawhide'' came in August 1959 in which they concentrated on his physical fitness, taking photographs of him doing pushups at home as Eastwood advised readers to keep in shape, warned against carbohydrates and recommended skipping beverages loaded with sugar and eating plenty of fruit and vegetables and vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

It took just three weeks for ''Rawhide'' to reach the top 20 in the TV ratings and soon rescheduled the timeslot half an hour earlier from 7.30 -8.30 pm every Friday, guaranteeing more of a family audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan110&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.110&lt;/ref&gt; For several years it was a major success, and reached its peak as number 6 in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan110&quot;/&gt; However, success was not without its price. The ''Rawhide'' years were undoubtedly the most gruelling of his life, and at first, from July until April, they filmed six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan110&quot;/&gt; Although it never won [[Emmy]] stature, ''Rawhide'' earned critical acclaim and won the [[American Heritage Award]] as the best Western series on TV and it was nominated several times for best episode by the Writer's and Director's Guilds.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan110&quot;/&gt; However, the quality of the storylines in each episode ranged dramatically from the brutal and subjects such as gypsy curses to predictable, silly comedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan110&quot;/&gt; Eastwood during this period received some criticism and was considered too laidback by some directors who believed he relied on his looks and just didn't work hard enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan111&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.111&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Fowler Jr.]] described Clint as &quot;lackadaisical&quot; in his attitude, whilst one of the series' most prolific crewmen, [[Tommy Carr]] described him as, &quot;lazy, and would cost you a morning. I never started a day with Clint Eastwood in the first scene, because you knew he was gonna be late, at least a half hour or an hour.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan111&quot;/&gt; Laziness, ironically, would later work in his favor and attract the attention of Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] and launch Eastwood's successful career in film. [[Karen Sharpe]], an actress, explained the laziness might have been because of his womanizing and would often disappear into his trailer with a lady friend (despite being married) and after having sex, he'd be too tired to do his afternoon scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan111&quot;/&gt; Although Eastwood did demonstrate growing abilities as an actor, developing on ability to demonstrate surprising authority and balancing humor with emotional nuance, he was not much noticed for his acting abilities at the time.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his busy schedule, soon after singing ''[[A Drover's Life]]'' on ''Rawhide'' and later ''[[Beyond the Sun]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}'', Eastwood would have a strong desire to pursue his major passion, music. Although [[jazz]] was his main interest, he was also a country and western enthusiast.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan114&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; He went into the studio and by late 1959 had produced the album ''[[Cowboy Favorites]]'' which was released on the Cameo label.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan114&quot;/&gt; The album included some classics such as [[Bob Wills]]'s ''[[San Antonio Rose]]'' and [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]'' and despite his attempts to plug the album by going on a tour, it never reached the [[Billboard Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan114&quot;/&gt; Later in 1963, Cameo producer [[Kal Mann]] would bluntly tell him that &quot;he would never make it big as a singer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan115&quot;&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Neverless, during the off season of filming ''Rawhide'', Eastwood and Brinegar, sometimes joined by [[Sheb Wooley]] would go on touring rodeos, state fairs and festivals and in 1962 their act entitled ''Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs'' earned them as much as $15,000 a performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGillagan115&quot;/&gt; Brinegar also accompanied Eastwood on his first trip outside the country in early 1962 to [[Japan]] to increase their publicity, leaving his wife at home.

By the third season of  ''Rawhide'', the Hollywood press began to speculate on Eastwood tiring of the series and that he was anxious to move on. A July 1961 article by [[Hank Grant]] in the ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' described him as , &quot;Calm on the outside and boiling on the inside&quot; and played upon Eastwood's apparent frustration that he hadn't been able to accept a single feature since joing the CBS series because of his contract, and he had said, &quot;Maybe they really figure me as the sheepish, nice guy I portray in the series, but even a worm has to turn sometime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood did, however, make several guest appearance in the meantime on TV, including a cameo in ''[[Mr Ed]]'' poking fun at himself as a neighbor of Mr. Ed in an episode directed by his old mentor Arthur Lubin and the western comedy series ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', in which he fought [[James Garner]] in the &quot;[[Duel at Sundown (Maverick)|Duel at Sundown]]&quot; [[List of Maverick episodes|episode]]. Although ''Rawhide'' continued to attract notable actors such as [[Lon Chaney Jr]], [[Mary Astor]], [[Ralph Bellamy]], [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Dean Martin]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]], by late 1963 ''Rawhide'' was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script.&lt;ref&gt;McGillagan (1999), p.125&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the character of Rowdy Yates, he had evolved to upstage that of Gil Favor and became increasingly tough like him, not a trait in which his character had begun. ''Rawhide'' would last until 1966, but a change of direction in Eastwood's career would occur in late 1963.
