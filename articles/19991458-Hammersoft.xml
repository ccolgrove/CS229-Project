The '''Obama logo''' was the flagship symbol of [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]].  The design became one of the most recognized political [[brand]] [[logo]]s during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential election]], and is being used again for Obama's [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|re-election campaign]].

==Process==

The logo was designed by Chicago-based Sender LLC (a brand development and design company) on assignment from Chicago-based mo/de (a motion design studio). The latter had been brought on board early on by [[David Axelrod]], Obamaâs chief campaign strategist, although it had never done a political [[Corporate identity|identity]] before. Creative director [[Sol Sender]], now an associate partner at [[VSA Partners]], led the design team of three which included Amanda Gentry and Andy Keene. Project managers at mo/de were Colin Carter and Steve Juras.&lt;ref name=&quot;vsapartners.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vsapartners.com/news.asp?article=70 | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-01-18 | title=Sol Sender Interview on the Obama Logo | last= | first= }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;We were looking at the âoâ of his name and had the idea of a [[Sunrise|rising sun]] and a new day,â according to Sender. âThe sun rising over the horizon evoked a new sense of hope.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CCB-Designers&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The design expression was so constrained and so bland for so many years in politics,&quot; Sender says. &quot;I think we had a fresh approach because weâd never worked on a campaign beforeâ â and, of course, the power of the logo had a lot to do with âthe power of the candidateâs message.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The final design was decided among [http://www.logodesignlove.com/obama-08-logo-design-options  seven or eight options] in the first round. &quot;In terms of our internal process, though, I believe the logo â as we now know it â came out of a second round of design explorations. At any rate, it happened quite quickly, all things considered. The entire undertaking took less than two weeks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The design began late in 2006 and the finished logo made its debut when Obama officially announced his candidacy for president February 10, 2007 in Springfield, Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;vsapartners.com&quot;/&gt;

[[John Slabyk]] and Scott Thomas, designers with the Obama campaign oversaw the customization of the logo for 12 different identity groups as well as for each state with 50 additional versions. There was also identity for Republicans and Independents supporting Barack Obama.&lt;ref name=&quot;vsapartners.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oberholtzer-creative.com/visualculture/2008/11/the-obama-brand-a-retrospective | publisher=Visual Culture | date=2009-07-11 | accessdate=2009-01-18 | title=The Obama Brand: A Retrospective | last= | first= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The reception of Obama's logo was generally positive, and in some circles, highly praised. The Boston Globe beamed that &quot;the ever-present rising sun logo has the feeling of a hot new Internet company.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&quot;It begins to break with tradition while also rooting itself in tradition,&quot; said Peter Krivkovich, CEO of [[Cramer-Krasselt]] advertising agency in Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCB-Designers&quot;/&gt;  &quot;Patriotism is the foundation, but above that is hope, opportunity, newness.&quot;
David Morrison, president of Philadelphia-based market research firm Twentysomething Inc., said the logo has &quot;a nice, contemporary, dynamic, youthful vibe about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CCB-Designers&quot;/&gt;  Designer [[Michael Bierut]] called Obama's branding &quot;just as good or better&quot;  as the best commercial brand designs. &quot;Every time you look, all those signs are perfect,&quot; Beirut said. &quot;Graphic designers like me don't understand how it's happening. It's unprecedented and inconceivable to us. The people in the know are flabbergasted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On the other hand, cartoonist [[Ward Sutton]] asked, &quot;is it a zero and a sunset over a deserted highway?&quot; &quot;Too many type styles and colors. The look is left undefined. The designer may have been too inexperienced,&quot; he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Some have noted the similarity of Obama's campaign logo to others, namely those of the [[Chandler,_Arizona|City of Chandler, Arizona]], the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some similarity to the European Union's [[Protected Designation of Origin]] and Protected Geographical Indication logos. The official logo of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance party]] of [[South Africa]] models their logo after Obama's campaign logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=nw20081115132702381C435948| title=DA relaunches as 'party of government' | publisher=IOL|date =15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
