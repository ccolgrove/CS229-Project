'''Visqueen''' is a [[power pop]]/[[punk music|punk rock]] band from [[Seattle, Washington]],  formed in 2001. It is named after a brand of [[polyethylene]] film that [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Tom Ridge]] once recommended as a defense against [[bioterrorism]].

The band's original members were [[singer]]-[[songwriter]]-[[guitarist]] [[Rachel Flotard]] and [[drummer]] Ben Hooker, both formerly of Hafacat; Allan Ross (guitar; left in November 2001), and Kim Warnick, formerly of the [[Fastbacks]].  Warnick retired at the end of 2004, but [[Muffs]] co-founder Ronnie Barnett signed on to play the bass during the band's 2005 tour.  Early in 2006, Bill Coury, formerly of Once For Kicks &amp; Sourmash, joined the band as [[bassist]], and later Tom Cummings, formerly of Once For Kicks &amp; Sourmash, joined the band as a second [[guitarist]].  Late in 2006, Bill Coury left the band and by spring 2007, Barrett Jones, producer ([[Foo Fighters]], [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]), joined Visqueen as [[bassist]].

Their current bassist is Cristina Bautista. Bautista also played bass in Connecticut Four, from Bellingham, Washington, and in 2006 put out a solo EP, ''This Is the Team''.

Recently Flotard has performed as backup singer in support of [[Neko Case]] and [[Jon Rauhouse]], a [[pedal steel guitar]] player and multi-instrumentalist who often tours with Case.

Visqueen's third album, ''Message to Garcia'', was released in 2009 on Flotard's own label, Local 638 Records, named for the labor union that Flotard's late father belonged to.&lt;ref&gt;Telford, Shawn. (10-22-2009). Visqueen's Flotard has new album, new perspective. http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/411325_flotard20.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Flotard used to write an [[advice column]] for Seattle-based online publication [[Three Imaginary Girls]] called &quot;Love Is Hard with Rachel Flotard.&quot;

Flotard was featured on [[Minus the Bear]]'s song &quot;Into the Mirror&quot; from their album ''[[Omni (album)|Omni]]''.

Rachel and Ben Hooker recently (August, 2011) announced that Visqueen will be playing their final shows in Seattle sometime this year.
