==Highways==
{{seealso|List of state routes in Arizona}}

Main interstate routes include [[Interstate 17 (Arizona)|I-17]], and [[Interstate 19 (Arizona)|I-19]] running north-south, [[Interstate 40 (Arizona)|I-40]], [[Interstate 8 (Arizona)|I-8]], and [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]] running east-west, and a short stretch of [[Interstate 15 (Arizona)|I-15]] running northeast/southwest through the extreme northwestern corner of the state.

===Phoenix===

{{main|Roads and freeways in metropolitan Phoenix}}

[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is served by a combination of [[Interstate Highway System|interstates]], [[U.S. Highways]], and [[List of Arizona State Routes|state routes]], many of which were funded by a Â½ cent general sales tax measure approved by [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] voters in 1985. New [[freeway]]s are constantly being added to the [[Valley of the Sun|area]], such as [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]], [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]], and eventually [[Arizona State Route 24|SR 24]] and [[Arizona State Route 30|SR 30]]. Currently, two major interstates serve the area, [[Interstate 10 (Arizona)|Interstate 10]] and [[Interstate 17 (Arizona)|Interstate 17]]. In the past decade, more than 100 miles of new freeway have been constructed in the metro-Phoenix region by ADOT.

===Tucson===
The [[Tucson]] metropolitan area is primarily served by [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]], [[Interstate 19 (Arizona)|I-19]] and [[Arizona State Route 77|State Route 77]]. I-19 departs from I-10 in the southern part of Tucson, runs through southern Tucson (including an exit serving the historic [[Mission San Xavier del Bac|Mission San Xavier]]) and the retirement community of [[Green Valley, Arizona|Green Valley]] and terminates in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]], in [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz County]], at the international border with [[Mexico]]. Destination signs on I-19 have [[metric system|metric]] distance figures in kilometers instead of standard miles.  [[Arizona State Route 77|State Route 77]] serves North Tucson and Tucson's northern suburbs including [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]], [[Catalina Foothills, Arizona|Catalina Foothills]], [[Oro Valley, Arizona|Oro Valley]], and [[Catalina, Arizona|Catalina]].  State Route 77 continues northward until it terminates at the [[Navajo Indian Reservation]] in northeastern Arizona.

[[Arizona State Route 210|State Route 210]] (Barraza-Aviation Parkway) is a limited-access parkway built in the early 1990s to connect downtown Tucson to the southeastern portion of the city. Few new limited-access roads are in the plans in Tucson due to strong community opposition to freeways. However, a large-scale reconstruction and expansion of Interstate 10 was supported and completed in mid-2009.

===Yuma, Flagstaff &amp; Casa Grande=== 
[[Image:Rte66btwnOatmanAndKingman.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Route 66 between [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]] and [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]].]]
[[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] is served by I-8, while [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]] served by I-8 and I-10; [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] is served by I-17 and I-40.  [[U.S. Route 95 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 95]] parallels the Colorado River, from [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border near Yuma.

Historic [[U.S. Route 66 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 66]], a major route for Midwestern emigrants prior to the advent of the interstate highway system, traversed the northern part of the state, passing through Flagstaff and Kingman. Route 66 in Arizona closely followed the route of what is now [[Interstate 40 (Arizona)|Interstate 40]] except for an 88 mile stretch between [[Seligman, Arizona|Seligman]] and [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]] now known as [[Arizona State Route 66|State Route 66]], where the route veered to the north passing through [[Peach Springs, Arizona|Peach Springs]].

==Public transportation and intercity bus==
The Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas are served by public bus transit systems. Yuma and Flagstaff also have public bus systems. [[Greyhound Lines]] serves Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, and several smaller communities statewide.

[[Amtrak]] operates the ''[[Southwest Chief (Amtrak)|Southwest Chief]]'', ''[[Sunset Limited (Amtrak)|Sunset Limited]]'', and ''[[Texas Eagle (Amtrak)|Texas Eagle]]'' through Arizona.

A light rail system called [[Valley Metro Rail (Phoenix)|METRO]] opened in  December 2008, connecting Phoenix with the nearby cities of [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] and [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], with plans for expansion in the future. 

In May 2006, voters in Tucson approved a Regional Transportation Plan (a comprehensive bus transit/streetcar/roadway improvement program), and its funding via a new half-cent sales tax increment. The centerpiece of the plan is a light rail streetcar system (possibly similar to the [[Portland Streetcar]] in Oregon) that will travel through the downtown area, connecting the main [[University of Arizona]] campus with the Rio Nuevo master plan area on the western edge of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_tuc_2006-05b.htm Tucson: Streetcar Plan Wins With 60% of Vote]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation==
Airports with regularly scheduled commercial flights include: [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]] (IATA: PHX, ICAO: KPHX) in Phoenix (the largest airport and the major international airport in the state); [[Tucson International Airport]] (IATA: TUS, ICAO: KTUS) in Tucson; [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]] (IATA: AZA, ICAO: KIWA) in Mesa; [[Yuma International Airport]] (IATA: YUM, ICAO: KYUM) in Yuma;  [[Prescott Municipal Airport]] (PRC) in Prescott; [[Flagstaff Pulliam Airport]] (IATA: FLG, ICAO: KFLG) in Flagstaff, and [[Grand Canyon National Park Airport]] (GCP), a small, but busy, single-runway facility providing tourist flights, mostly from Las Vegas.  Phoenix Sky Harbor is the 7th busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movements, and regularly in the top 15 for passengers.

Other significant airports without regularly scheduled commercial flights include [[Scottsdale Municipal Airport]] (IATA: SCF, ICAO: KSDL) in Scottsdale.

==Passenger Rail==

Two [[Amtrak]] routes serve Arizona communities: the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' passes through [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]], Flagstaff,  and [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]], while the ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' passes through [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]], Tucson, [[Maricopa, Arizona|Maricopa]] and Yuma.  Although the ''Texas Eagle'' passes much closer to Phoenix than the ''Southwest Chief'' does, Phoenix is linked to the Amtrak system via [[motorcoach]] from Flagstaff.
