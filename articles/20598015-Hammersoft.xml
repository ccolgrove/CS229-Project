'''''Brachiosaurus''''' {{IPA-en|ËbrÃ¦kiÉËsÉrÉs|}} is a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Jurassic]] [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]]. It was first described by [[Elmer S. Riggs]] in 1903 from fossils found in the Grand River Canyon (now [[Colorado River]]) of western [[Colorado]], in the [[United States]]. Riggs named the dinosaur ''Brachiosaurus altithorax'', declaring it &quot;the largest known dinosaur&quot;. ''Brachiosaurus''  had a proportionally long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. However, the proportions of ''Brachiosaurus'' are unlike most sauropods. The forelimbs were longer than the hindlimbs, which result in a steeply inclined trunk, making the overall body shape reminiscent of a modern [[giraffe]]. Also, while the tail is a typical long dinosaur tail, it was relatively short for a sauropod.

''Brachiosaurus'' is the namesake genus of the family [[Brachiosauridae]], which includes a handful of other similar sauropods. Much of what is known by laypeople about ''Brachiosaurus'' is in fact based on ''[[Giraffatitan|Giraffatitan brancai]]'', a species of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the [[Tendaguru]] Formation of [[Tanzania]] that was originally described by German paleontologist [[Werner Janensch]] as a species of ''Brachiosaurus''. Recent research shows that the differences between the type species of ''Brachiosaurus'' and the Tendaguru material are significant enough that the African material should be placed in a separate genus. Several other potential species of ''Brachiosaurus'' have been described from [[Africa]] and [[Europe]], but none of them are thought to belong to ''Brachiosaurus'' at this time.

''Brachiosaurus'' is one of the rarer sauropods of the Morrison Formation.  The [[holotype|type specimen]] of ''B. altithorax'' is still the most complete specimen, and only a relative handful of other specimens are thought to belong to the genus. It is regarded as a high [[browsing (predation)|browser]], probably cropping or nipping vegetation as high as possibly {{convert|9|m|ft}} off of the ground. Unlike other sauropods, and its depiction in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', it was unsuited for rearing on its hindlimbs.  It has been used an example of a dinosaur that was most likely [[ectothermic]] due to its large size and the corresponding need for [[forage]], but more recent research finds it to have been [[warm-blooded]].

==Description==
[[Image:Brachiosaurus DB.jpg|thumb|left|Life restoration]] 
Like all sauropod dinosaurs, ''Brachiosaurus'' was a quadrupedal animal with a small skull, a long neck, a large trunk with a high-ellipsoid cross section, a long, muscular tail and slender, columnar limbs.&lt;ref name=upchurch&amp;al2004&gt;Upchurch, P., Barrett, P.M. &amp; Dodson, P.

ISBN 9780520242098&lt;/ref&gt; The skull had a robust, wide muzzle and thick jaw bones, with spoonâshaped teeth.  As in ''Giraffatitan'', there was an arch of bone over the snout and in front of the eyes that encircled the nasal opening, although this arch was not as large as in its relative.&lt;ref name=foster2007b&gt;Foster, J.

===Size===
[[Image:Brachiosaurus scale.png|thumb|Size compared to a human]] 
Because &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; ''brancai'' (''Giraffatitan'') is known from much more complete material than ''B. altithorax'', most size estimates for ''Brachiosaurus'' are actually for the African form.

The Fruita skeleton was not the first discovery of ''Brachiosaurus'' bones, although it was the first to be recognized as belonging to a new and distinct animal.  In 1883, a sauropod skull was found near [[Garden Park, Colorado|Garden Park]], Colorado, at Felch Quarry 1, and was sent to [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] (of &quot;[[Bone Wars]]&quot; fame).&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt; Marsh incorporated the skull into his skeletal restoration of &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; (now ''[[Apatosaurus]]'').&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=marsh1891&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsh |first=O.C. |year=1891 |title=Restoration of ''Triceratops'' |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=41 |issue=244 |pages=339â342 |url=http://marsh.dinodb.com/marsh/Marsh%201891%20-%20Restoration%20of%20Triceratops%20%28and%20Brontosaurus%29.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually became part of the collections of the [[National Museum of Natural History]], as USNM&amp;nbsp;5730.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt; In the 1970s, when Jack McIntosh and David Berman were working on the issue of the true skull of ''Apatosaurus'', they reevaluated the Garden Park skull as more similar to ''[[Camarasaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=mcintosh&amp;berman1975&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIntosh |first=J.S. |coauthors=and Berman, D.S. |year=1975 |title=Description of the palate and lower jaw of the sauropod dinosaur ''Diplodocus'' (Reptilia: Saurischia) with remarks on the nature of the skull of ''Apatosaurus'' |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=187â199}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described and recognized as a ''Brachiosaurus'' skull in 1998 by [[Kenneth Carpenter]] and Virginia Tidwell, intermediate in [[morphology (biology)|form]] between ''Camarasaurus'' and ''Giraffatitan brancai'' (then still considered to be ''B. brancai'').&lt;ref name=carp&amp;tid1998&gt;Carpenter, K. and Tidwell, V.

===Etymology===
Riggs derived the genus name from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''brachion''/Î²ÏÎ±ÏÎ¹ÏÎ½ meaning &quot;arm&quot; and ''sauros''/ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï meaning &quot;lizard&quot;, because he realized that the length of the arms was unusual for a sauropod.&lt;ref name=riggs1903/&gt; The species epithet &quot;altithorax&quot; was chosen because of the unusually deep and wide chest cavity, from [[Latin]] ''altus'' meaning &quot;deep&quot; and Greek ''thorax''/Î¸ÏÏÎ±Î¾ (Latin ''thorax''), meaning &quot;breastplate, cuirass, corslet&quot;.&lt;ref name=thoraxdict&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dqw%2Frac Î¸ÏÏÎ±Î¾], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

===Referred material===
[[Image:Brachiosaurus leg bone.jpg|thumb|Front limb bone (humerus) from Potter Creek, USNM 21903]]
Taylor (2009) lists a number of specimens referred to ''Brachiosaurus''. These include some material, e.g., a humerus from Potter Creek and some Dry Mesa material (the latter partly described as ''[[Ultrasauros]]'' by Jensen), that are either clearly not brachiosaurid in origin, or at least not clearly referable to ''Brachiosaurus''.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt; In contrast, a cervical (neck) vertebra and the skull mentioned above may belong to either ''B. altithorax'' or an as-yet unknown brachiosaurid from North America.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt; The cervical was found near Jensen, Utah, by Jensen,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jjenson1987&quot;/&gt; and â if it belongs to ''Brachiosaurus'' â is one of a handful of neck vertebrae known for American brachiosaurids.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt;  There is no unambiguous material of the skull, neck, [[anatomical terms of location|anterior]] dorsal (forward trunk) region, [[anatomical terms of location|distal]] (lower) limbs or feet.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt;

There was ample material referred to ''&quot;B.&quot; brancai'' in the collections of the [[Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde]] Berlin, some of which was destroyed during [[World War II]]. Other material was transferred to other institution throughout Germany, some of which was also destroyed. Additional specimens are likely among the material collected by the [[British Museum of Natural History]]'s Tendaguru expedition.&lt;ref name=maier2003&gt;Maier, G. (2003). ''African dinosaurs unearthed. The Tendaguru Expeditions.&quot; Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Much or all of this material probably belongs to ''Giraffatitan'', although some may represent a new brachiosaurid.&lt;ref name=SVPOW2009-11-18&gt;Taylor, M.

===Separation from ''Giraffatitan''===
When describing the brachiosaurid material from Tendaguru in 1914, Janensch listed a number of differences and commonalities between them and ''B. altithorax''.&lt;ref name=janensch1914/&gt; In three further publications in 1929,&lt;ref name=janensch1929/&gt; 1950
&lt;ref name=janensch1950a&gt;Janensch, W. (1950). &quot;Die WirbelsÃ¤ule von ''Brachiosaurus brancai''.&quot; ''Palaeontographica'' '''(Suppl. 7) 3''':27â93.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1961&lt;ref name=janensch1961&gt;Janensch, W. (1961). &quot;Die GliedmaÃen und GliedmaÃengÃ¼rtel der Sauropoden der Tendaguru-Schichten.&quot; '''Palaeontographica (Suppl. 7) 3''':177â235.&lt;/ref&gt; Janensch compared the two species in more detail, listing 13 putative shared characters.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt; Of these, however, only four appear to be valid, while six pertain to more inclusive groups than Brachiosauridae, and the rest are either difficult to assess or refer to material that is not ''Brachiosaurus''.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt;

In 1988, [[Gregory Paul]] published a new reconstruction of the skeleton of ''&quot;B.&quot; brancai'', highlighting a number of differences in proportion between it and ''B. altithorax''. Chief among them is a difference in the way the trunk vertebrae vary: they are fairly uniform in ''B. altithorax'', but vary widely in the African material. Paul believed that the limb and girdle elements of both species were very similar, and therefore suggested to separate them not at [[genus]], but only at [[subgenus]] level.&lt;ref name=paul1988/&gt;

''Giraffatitan'' was raised to genus level by Olshevsky without comment.&lt;ref name=olshevsky1991/&gt; A detailed study of all material, including the limb and girdle bones, by Michael Taylor in 2009 found that there are significant differences between ''Brachiosaurus altithorax'' and the Tendaguru material in all elements known from both species. Taylor found 26 distinct osteological (bone-based) characters, a larger difference than that between, e.g., ''[[Diplodocus]]'' and ''[[Barosaurus]]'', and therefore argued that the African material should be placed in its own genus, ''Giraffatitan'', as ''G. brancai''.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt; An important difference between the two genera is the overall body shape, with ''Brachiosaurus'' having a 23% longer dorsal (trunk) vertebrate series and a 20 to 25% longer and also taller tail.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt;

==Paleoecology==
With the removal of the East African ''Giraffatitan'', ''Brachiosaurus'' is known only from the [[Morrison Formation]] of western North America.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt;  The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a [[semiarid]] environment with distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s,&lt;ref name=russell1989&gt;{{Cite book|last=Russell |first=D.

==Paleobiology==
===Neck position===
In contrast to most other sauropods, brachiosaurids had an inclined back, due to their long forelimbs. Therefore, if the neck exited the body in a straight line, it already pointed upwards.&lt;ref name=taylor2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=stevensparrish1999&gt;Stevens, K. A. and Parrish, M. J.

(2007). &quot;Flexibility along the neck of the ostrich (''Struthio camelus'') and consequences for the reconstruction of dinosaurs with extreme neck length.&quot; ''Journal of Morphology'' '''268''':701-714.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Nostril placement===
[[File:Brachiosaurus nostrils placement.PNG|thumb|left|alt=Various Brachiosaurus nostrils placement.|Digital reconstructions showing three of the most likely placements of the fleshy nostrils in ''Brachiosaurus'', '''C''' being currently regarded as the most likely option.&lt;ref name=Naish2009&gt;{{cite web | last = Naish | first = D. |title=Junk in the trunk: why sauropod dinosaurs did not possess trunks |url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/03/junk_in_the_trunk.php |publisher=ScienceBlogs |date=March 20, 2009 |pages= |isbn= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The placement of ''Brachiosaurus'' nostrils has been the source of much debate with Witmer (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Witmer | first = L.M.|title=Nostril position in dinosaurs and other vertebrates and its significance for nasal function |journal=Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5531 | pages = 850â853 |year=2001 |doi= 10.1126/science.1062681 |accessdate= | url=http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/vertebrate%20evolution/DinosaurNoses.pdf | pmid=11486085}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' the hypothesized position of the fleshy nostrils in ''Brachiosaurus'' in as many as five possible locations.

There has also been the hypothesis of various sauropods, such as ''Brachiosaurus'', possessing a trunk. The fact that there were no narrow-snouted sauropods (''Brachiosaurus'' included) tends to discredit such a hypothesis. Stronger evidence for the absence of a trunk is found in the teeth wear of ''Brachiosaurus'', which shows the kind of wear that would result from biting and tearing off of plant matter rather than purely grinding, which would be the result of having already ripped the leaves and branches off with its trunk.&lt;ref name=Naish2009 /&gt;

===Feeding ecology===
''Brachiosaurus'' is thought to have been a high [[browsing (predation)|browser]], feeding on foliage well above the ground.  Even if it did not hold its neck near vertical, and instead had a straighter neck, its head height may still have been over {{convert|9|m|ft}} above the ground.&lt;ref name=foster2007b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Foster2003/&gt; It probably fed mostly on foliage above {{convert|5|m|ft}}. This does not preclude the possibility that it also fed lower at times, between {{convert|3|to|5|m|ft}} up.&lt;ref name=foster2007b/&gt; Its diet likely consisted of ginkgoes, conifers, tree ferns, and large cycads, with intake estimated at {{convert|200|to|400|kg|lb}} of plant matter daily.&lt;ref name=foster2007b/&gt; However, more recent studies estimate that ~{{convert|240|kg|lb}} of plant matter would have been sufficient to feed a {{convert|70|MT|ST}} sauropod,&lt;ref name=hummel&amp;al2008&gt;Hummel, J., Gee, C.T., SÃ¼dekum, K.-H., Sander, P.M., Nogge, G. and Clauss, M. (2008). &quot;In vitro digestibility of fern and gymnosperm foliage: implications for sauropod feeding ecology and diet selection&quot;. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''275''':1015-1021. doi:10.1098/rspb.2007.1728&lt;/ref&gt; so ''Brachiosaurus'' may have required only about {{convert|120|kg|lb}} of fodder a day. Brachiosaur feeding involved simple upâandâdown jaw motion. The teeth were arranged to shear material as they closed, and were probably used to crop and/or nip vegetation.&lt;ref name=bar&amp;up05&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barrett |first=Paul M. |coauthors=and Upchurch, Paul |year=2005 |chapter=Sauropodomorph diversity through time |title=The Sauropods: Evolution and Paleobiology |editors=Curry Rogers, Kristina A.; and Wilson, Jeffrey A. |pages=125â156 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, CA |isbn=0-520-24623-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has repeatedly been suggested, e.g. in the movie ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', that ''Brachiosaurus'' could rear into a bipedal or tripodal (with tail support) pose to feed. However, a detailed physical modelling-based analysis of sauropod rearing capabilities by Heinrich Mallison showed that while many sauropods could rear, the unusual brachiosaurid body shape and limb length ratio made them exceptionally ill suited for rearing. The forward position of the center of mass would have led to problems with stability, and required unreasonably large forces in the hips to obtain an upright posture. ''Brachiosaurus'' would also have gained relatively little from rearing (only 33% more feeding height), compared to other sauropods, for which a bipedal pose may have tripled the feeding height.&lt;ref name=mallisonsaubook2&gt;Mallison, H. (2011). &quot;Rearing Giants â kinetic-dynamic modeling of sauropod bipedal and tripodal poses.&quot; In Klein, N., Remes, K., Gee, C. &amp; Sander M. (eds): ''Biology of the Sauropod Dinosaurs: Understanding the life of giants.'' Life of the Past (series ed. Farlow, J.). Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolism===
Like all sauropods, ''Brachiosaurus'' was [[warm-blooded|homeothermic]] (maintaining a stable internal temperature) and [[endothermic]] (controlling body temperature through internal means), meaning that it was able to actively control its body temperature, producing the necessary heat through a high [[basal metabolic rate|basic metabolic rate]] of its cells.&lt;ref name=sander&amp;al2010&gt;Sander, P.M., Christian, A., Clauss, M., Fechner, R., Gee, C.T., Griebeler, E.-M., Gunga, H.-C., Hummel, J., Mallison, H., Perry, S.F., Preuschoft, H., Rauhut, O.W.M., Remes, K., TÃ¼tken, T., Wings, O. &amp; Witzel, U. (2010). Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism. ''Biology Reviews'' online first publication, doi:10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00137.x http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123397084/HTMLSTART&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, ''Brachiosaurus'' has been used an example of a dinosaur for which endothermy is unlikely, because of the combination of great size (leading to overheating) and great [[calorie|caloric]] needs to fuel endothermy.&lt;ref name=russell1989b&gt;{{Cite book|last=Russell |first=D. A. |authorlink=Dale Russell |title=An Odyssey in Time: Dinosaurs of North America |year=1989 |publisher=NorthWord  Press |location=Minocqua, Wisconsin |isbn=1-55971-038-1 |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these calculations were based on incorrect assumptions about the available cooling surfaces (the large air sacs were not known), and a grossly inflated body mass. These inaccuracies resulted in overestimation of heat production and underestimation of heat loss.&lt;ref name=sander&amp;al2010/&gt; The large nasal arch has been postulated as an adaptation for cooling the brain, as a surface for evaporative cooling of the blood.&lt;ref name=russell1989b/&gt; Again, when this was proposed, cooling via the air sacs was not known, and thus not taken into account. Furthermore, other similar sized sauropods had no comparable structure. Additionally, in proportion to the entire animal, the nasal arch is very small, and would thus have made only an insignificant contribution to heat loss.
