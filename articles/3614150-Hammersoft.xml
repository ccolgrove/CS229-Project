==Unauthorised matches allegation==
In October 2010 Henrietta Rushwaya, the chief executive of the Zifa, was sacked after being found guilty by the association's disciplinary body on charges of &quot;conduct inconsistent with her duties, mismanagement and insubordination&quot;.&lt;ref name='The Guardian'&gt; {{cite news | title = Zimbabwe FA chief executive sacked over unauthorised matches | date = 26 October | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushwaya was found guilty of sending the national team to play unauthorised matches in Asia in 2009. Her sacking followed her suspension in July 2010 on suspicion of fixing matches in a Malaysian tournament.&lt;ref name='The Guardian'/&gt;

She was also found guilty of requesting a loan of $103,000 from Zimbabwe's sports commission, an amount that is now unaccounted for.&lt;ref name='The Guardian'/&gt;

The national teams matches against Thailand, Syria and a Malaysian club were accepted without the permission of Zifa's board or Zimbabwe's sports commission, which must authorise foreign trips by Zimbabwe teams. Rushwaya also allowed the former Zimbabwe champions Monomotapa to go to Malaysia in 2009 masquerading as the national team of Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name='The Guardian'/&gt;

Both tours are suspected of being set up by betting syndicates, a report by the Forum for African Investigative Reporters stated in September 2010.&lt;ref name='The Guardian'/&gt;
