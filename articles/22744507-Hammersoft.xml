The '''Florida Atlantic Owls''' are the [[college softball]] team of [[Florida Atlantic University]]. 

For the relatively young program (first fielding a team in [[1995]]), the Florida Atlantic University softball team has been overwhelmingly successful under the leadership of legendary coach, [[Joan Joyce]].  In twelve seasons of competition in the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] (from 1995-2006), the Lady Owls won the conference championship nine times, including eight consecutive championships from 1997 through 2004.  The Owls added their tenth conference championship in their first season in the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in 2007.
