}}'''Jackson State University''' ('''Jackson State''' or '''JSU''') is a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black university]] founded in 1877 in [[Natchez,_Mississippi|Natchez]], MS by the [[American Baptist Home Mission Society]] of New York. The Society moved the school to Jackson in 1882, renaming it '''Jackson College''', and developed its present campus in 1902. It became a state supported public institution in 1940. A member of the [[Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund]], JSU holds an important place in the history of US civil rights.

==History==
Jackson State University started as Natchez Seminary, a private school, under the auspices of the [[American Baptist Home Mission Society]] of New York, to educate Mississippiâs newly freed and underprivileged blacks. 

* 1877: Operated for 63 years as a private church school beginning with only twenty students. Inman Edward Page was the only black member of the original faculty.
* 1882: , the decision was made to purchase the fifty-two-acre J.A.P. Campbell estate in North Jackson, Mississippi. In 1883, the Society moved the school to Jackson, to the site where [[Millsaps College]] now stands. A part of this transition was the renaming of the school to Jackson College in recognition of the institutionâs new, central location in the City of Jackson. Natchez Seminary soon relocated from its site in north Jackson to a tract of land in the southwest section of the city.

* In 1902, construction on the present campus' site began.

* In 1924, the first bachelorâs degree was awarded. During this period, the major educational activities were directed toward teacher education for in-service teachers.

* When the American Baptist Home Mission Society withdrew its support from the institution in 1934, A new board of trustees was organized that kept the school open. On May 30, 1938, control of the Board of Trustees was transferred to Jackson College, Incorporated.

* In 1940, the school was transferred from the private control of the church to the state education system and renamed Mississippi Negro Training School. Initially, the school had been specifically designated by the state to train rural and elementary teachers. In 1942, the Board of Trustees expanded the curriculum to a full four-year teacher education program, culminating in the Bachelor of Science Degree in Education. In May 1944, the first four-year graduating class under state support received their degrees.  In 1944, Mississippi Negro Training School was renamed Jackson College for Negro Teachers

* In 1953, the Division of Graduate Studies was organized during the Summer and the program of Liberal Arts started in the fall of that year. In 1956, Jackson College for Negro Teachers was renamed Jackson State College.

* During the late 1960s, the entire curriculum was reorganized and the following schools were established: the Schools of Liberal Studies, Education, Science and Technology, Business and Economics and the Graduate School.

* On 14 May 1970, two black students were shot and killed (and 12 wounded) by state police during [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protests]] in the [[Jackson State killings]]. Four hundred pieces of buckshot had struck the woman's dormatory. Howard Zinn reports a local grand jury found the attack justified. On March 15, 1974, Jackson State College was designated Jackson State University. Jackson State College gained university status in accordance with the expanded breadth and quality of its faculty and academic programs. From 1967-1977, the faculty tripled in size and the number of faculty members with graduate degrees increased eightfold. In 1979, the University was officially designated the stateâs Urban University by the Board of Trustees, State Institutions of Higher Learning.

* In the late 1980s, the University and its surrounding community was enriched through the expansion of the Universities Center; the establishment of the West Jackson Community Development Corporation to improve blighted housing around the campus; the organization of a Staff Senate; and the creation of a Center for Professional Development and the Center for Technology Transfer.

* In the 1990s, a Campus Master Plan that projected the growth of the University into the 21st Century was developed. Fifteen new graduate and undergraduate programs evolved. These academic achievements were bolstered by the establishment of the School of Social Work, the formation of the School of Engineering, and the fall 1998 opening of the School of Allied Health Sciences, the School of Business received accreditation of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), a $13.5 million expansion of the H. T. Sampson Library, which doubled the capacity of the original structure, was completed, and the $17.2 million School of Liberal Arts building was occupied in 2001.

* In Fall 2000, the University received doctoral research intensive status with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. This prestigious designation was based on the awarding of more than 20 doctoral degrees from the Division of Graduate Studies and the $40 million in federally funded research contracts secured through the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs.

* In 2002, the University celebrated its 125th anniversary. It developed and implemented its strategic planâBeyond Survival: The Millennium Agenda for Jackson State University. The five-point strategic plan is moving Jackson State University to a new academic excellence. Thus, Vision 2020 was created to fulfill the first strategyâRemodel the Learning System at JSU. In 2002, the University was reorganized into six colleges: College of Business; College of Public Service; College of Liberal Arts; College of Science, Engineering and Technology; College of Lifelong Learning; and College of Education and Human Development.

* In 2004, a $20 million College of Business building was completed.

* In 2006, a new {{convert|91000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} student health wellness center opened. For the first time in the Universityâs history, private bond financing was secured to renovate some facilities on campus and to build new facilities, including a new Campus Union, a new presidentâs house, new student apartments, and dormitories which opened in 2006. The campus transformation and wide array of academic programs enhanced Jackson Stateâs presence.

Today, JSU provides traditional and non-traditional students of diverse backgrounds academic opportunities to develop knowledge and skills that will empower them to succeed in an increasingly complex and technologically advanced world. JSU has expanded online course offerings, and students are also afforded the opportunity to excel in areas beyond academic disciplines including art, culture, music and numerous intercollegiate sports and championship competitions. Jackson Stateâs long-term cooperative projects, corporate partnerships, its increasing presence among top universities for the amount of research dollars awarded to the University, and community initiatives strengthen the Universityâs commitment to its students, faculty, staff and alumni as well as to the West Jackson Community, the city, the state, the nation and several international countries.

==Campus==
Jackson State University is located in Jackson, the capital city and the cultural, political, geographic and business center of Mississippi. The campus is a {{convert|245|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus with 51 academic and administrative buildings. It is less than five minutes from downtown and less than twenty minutes from Jackson-Evers International Airport. The main campus is located on JR Lynch St between Prentiss and Dalton St. The United States Postal Service has assigned Jackson State ZIP code 39217 for P.O. box mail.

===Sonic Boom of the South===
The Jackson State University Marching Band, âThe Sonic Boom of the Southâ is a very diverse, competent, and a flexible musical group.

The band was first organized in the early 1940s. As early as the mid-1920s, the University had a well-organized orchestra. The group was given the nickname, âThe Sonic Boom of the Southâ by band director Harold J. Haughton, Sr. in 1971. In 1971, the majorettes abandoned their batons and became a dance team known as the Prancing J-Settes, also named by Haughton. In 1974, âGet Ready,â an old Motown favorite was selected as the bandâs theme song. Also, during the mid 1970s, the âTiger Run-Onâ was perfected. Created by Haughton, the âTiger Run-Onâ is a fast, eye-catching shuffle step that blends an adagio step with an up-tempo shuffle (200 steps per minute), then back to adagioâa âSonic Boomâ trademark that brings fans to their feet during halftime performances. Oct 1990, Under the direction of Dowell Taylor and staff. The JSU Sonic Boom of the South performed in Los Angeles, California for Motown 30-What's Going on. This was the event that set the wheels in motion for the NATION attention of the Sonic Boom. In 2003 the marching band was in enshrined in the NCAA Hall of Champions. Also, the marching band was filmed by Electronic Art Sports (EA Sports) for inclusion in the 2005 vision of the video game &quot;EA Sports NCAA Football 2005.&quot;

The band has performed at halftime for the Atlanta Falcons, the Detroit Lions, the New Orleans Saints, the New York Jets, the Houston Oilers, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Indianapolis Colts It also performed at the 1991 NBA All-Star game, Motownâs 30th Anniversary television special, the NAACP 34th Image Awards television special, and the Honda Battle of The Bands 2006, 2009, 2011.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

===The J-Settes===
The Prancing J-Settes is the official name of the Jackson State University dance line, an auxiliary group of the Jackson State University Marching Band that began in 1971.The thrill of a thousand eyes,â were the words spoken by Dr. Jimmie James, Jr. at the onset of the âPrancing Jaycettesâ in 1971.  Shirley Middleton, a former majorette,  initiated the concept of the majorettes abandoning their batons and dancing to popular musical selections.  As the majorette sponsor, Shirley Middleton and the majorettes met with Dr. John A. Peoples, the Universityâs sixth president, and requested that they be permitted to âput down their batons.âDr. Peoples agreed and thus legends were born.  In 1970, Middleton assembled 18 majorettes, and their notoriety immediately began to soar in rapid proportions.  Their beauty, grace, and poise were astounding and their dance routines to songs such as âKool-Aid,â James Brownâs âMake it Funky,â and âHot Pants,â were magnificent, unmatched by any other competing groups.

The group was initially named the âPrancing Jaycettes.â  The groupâs name became official in 1971.  However, in 1982, the Prancing Jaycette organization officially changed its name to Prancing J-Settes, because of a name conflict with a local organization known as the Jackson Jaycees/Jaycettes.

Shirley Middleton served as sponsor of the J-Settes from 1970-1975.  In 1975, Narah Oatis was appointed the sponsor of the J-Settes.  Under her leadership, the Prancing J-Settes became nationally renowned.  During her reign, J-Sette marching technics such as the âSalt and Pepper,â âJ-Sette Walk,â âStrut,â and âTip Toeâ were perfected.  The J-Settes consisted of lines of 12-16 young ladies who marched in rows affectionately named âShort and Sassy,â âMagnificent Middle,â or a âTall and Tough.â  Mrs. Oatis tenure is best remembered by many for the J-Settesâs stellar performance at the 30th Anniversary of Motown in 1990,  the  âComing to America routine,â âProud Mary,â and the âLiturgical dance routine.â  (âComing to Americaâ and the âProud Maryâ routines were both originally performed in 1995.  The âLiturgical dance routineâ was first performed in 1996.)  Narah Oatis served as director (sponsor) of the Prancing J-Settes for 21 years.   She resigned as sponsor of the J-Settes in February 1997.

In the Spring of 1997, a former J-Sette captain, Mrs. Kathy Pinkston-Worthy was appointed director (sponsor) of the Prancing J-Settes.  Under her direction, the J-Settes have become nationally known for their rapid fire highly technical dance routines to selections such as âI Go to Workâ and âSwoop.â  Perhaps, the most celebrated marque performance by the Prancing J-Settes was rendered at the 34th NAACP Image Awards in Hollywood, California in 2003 where the J-Settes performed on National Television with âCedric the Entertainerâ and âSugar Bear of E.U.â  Both routines were choreographed by Mrs. Worthy.
