'''WBTB''' FM 90.3 is a [[construction permit]] for a new [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[Public radio]] station for [[Georgia Public Broadcasting#Radio|Georgia Public Broadcasting]].  The 97-watt station is to be constructed atop [[Brasstown Bald]], the highest point in the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] at {{convert|4784|ft|m|sp=us}}, making it equivalent to several hundred watts at a more typical [[elevation]].  This point now also holds GPB's five-watt [[low power television]] [[broadcast translator]] W12DK-D, a [[digital television]] [[television station|station]] which took the license of analog W04BJ.  Both have [[Young Harris, Georgia]] as their [[city of license]].

As of April 2011, the [[Radio station]] has yet to sign on.
