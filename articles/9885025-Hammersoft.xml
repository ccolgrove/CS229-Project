The '''[[2007 NFL season|2007]] [[Miami Dolphins]] season''' was the 38th season for the team in the [[National Football League]] and 42nd season overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Miami Dolphins History | work = NFL-History.com | url = http://www.nfl-history.com/dolphins.php | accessdate =  24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team nearly went winless for the season, but on December 16, the third to last game of the regular season, they beat the [[Baltimore Ravens]], giving them a final record of 1â15 . The [[Detroit Lions]] became the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|first team to go 0â16]] the [[2008 NFL season|following season.]] Their only win of the season gave them the first pick in the 2008 NFL draft. They also failed to improve upon a 6â10 season in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Miami Dolphins 2006 Schedule | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/teams/schedule/MIA/2006 | accessdate =  24 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070522172426/http://www.nfl.com/teams/schedule/MIA/2006 |archivedate = May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under former head coach [[Nick Saban]] in a year that began with high hopes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Saban, Dolphins Set Sights on Overtaking Pats | work = WashingtonPost.com | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/05/26/BL2006052600920.html | accessdate =  24 June 2007 | first=Mark | last=Maske | date=2006-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saban resigned from the Dolphins to become the head coach at the [[University of Alabama]], after repeatedly saying he would stay with the Dolphins.&lt;ref name=&quot;SabanLeaves&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = After repeated denials, Saban takes Bama job | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2718488 | accessdate =  15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dolphins entered 2007 in the process of rebuilding under new head coach Cam Cameron, the former [[offensive coordinator]] for the [[San Diego Chargers]]. The coaching staff underwent significant changes, with approximately twelve coaches newly hired or re-assigned. Cameron also made various changes to the team's roster, with a more than a dozen players being added or re-signed and just as many being released, traded or allowed to sign elsewhere. Six of the team's losses in 2007 were by margins of three points or less.

==Notable offseason events==
===Resignation of Nick Saban===
During the 2006 season, rumors persisted of then-Dolphins head coach Nick Saban leaving for the [[University of Alabama]] at season's end. Saban denied these rumors throughout the season, to the point where on December 21 he told the South Florida media &quot;I'm not going to be the Alabama coach.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SabanLeaves&quot;/&gt; Whether or not he meant it at the time is unknown, but Saban's stance softened after the season, and on January 3, 2007 Saban resigned from the Dolphins to become the new head coach of the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SabanLeaves&quot;/&gt;

===Historic game in London===
On February 2, 2007, NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] announced that the Dolphins and [[New York Giants]] would play a game at [[London]], [[England]]'s [[Wembley Stadium]]. The game â- the second regular season NFL game to take place outside of the [[United States]] and first to take place outside of North America -â counted as a home game for the Dolphins. It took place Sunday, October 28 (Week 8) with kick off at 1:00 PM ET (6:00 PM local London time). It was broadcast on [[NFL on Fox|Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins Will Host Giants In London On October 28 | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5028&amp;lid=5028 | accessdate =  15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dolphins lost the game to the Giants by a score of 13â10.

In the 72 hours following the announcement, over half a million ticket requests were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Half A Million Ticket Requests In 72-Hour Span | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5036&amp;lid=5036 | accessdate =  15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, 40,000 tickets were made available to people randomly selected from the initial requests. The tickets sold in 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 40,000 Tickets For London Game Sell In 90 Minutes | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5181&amp;lid=5181 | accessdate =  15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed trade of Dan Wilkinson===
On March 2, the [[Denver Broncos]] acquired [[defensive tackle]] [[Dan Wilkinson]] from the Dolphins in exchange for a sixth-round draft choice in the [[2007 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Broncos give up draft pick to get Wilkinson from Fins | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2786760 | accessdate =  24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A condition of the trade was that Wilkinson report to the Broncos for a physical by Friday, March 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wilkinson trade could be in jeopardy | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2799298 | accessdate =  24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not report for the physical, and although neither team was able to reach Wilkinson by phone the deadline for him to report was extended in hopes of eventually closing the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins, Broncos extend deadline on 'Big Daddy' | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2800652 | accessdate =  24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, the deal between the Broncos and Dolphins was finally voided.&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeVoided&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Wilkinson trade voided, Dolphins retain rights | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2820565 | accessdate =  24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth-round pick reverted back to the Broncos, and Wilkinson's rights were once again held by the Dolphins.&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeVoided&quot;/&gt; After failing to attend offseason workouts with the Dolphins in the months that followed, the Dolphins finally terminated Wilkinson's contract on June 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilkinsonRelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = After failing to trade him, Dolphins cut Wilkinson | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2908447 | accessdate = 24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal troubles===
====Joey Porter-Levi Jones altercation====
After five seasons as [[AFC North]] rivals, former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] linebacker [[Joey Porter]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]] [[offensive tackle]] [[Levi Jones]] were involved in an altercation in a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] casino on March 18.

====Arrest and release of Fred Evans====
In the early morning of 2007-06-23, 23-year-old Dolphins defensive tackle [[Fred Evans (American football)|Fred Evans]] was arrested in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EvansArrest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =

Evans reportedly engaged in a physical struggle with the officers when they tried to handcuff him, with one officer being bitten on his left wrist.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvansArrest&quot;/&gt; The officers then used tasers to subdue Evans. He was charged with battery on a police officer, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and trespassing.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvansArrest&quot;/&gt; Complicating matters could be the fact that Evans is already on probation in [[Colorado County, Texas]] for possession of [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EvansProbation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =

In a team-released statement, Dolphins head coach Cam Cameron said: &quot;We are aware that Fred Evans was arrested this morning. We will not condone this type of behavior. I assure everyone it will be dealt with seriously&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =

On September 25, it was reported that Chambers would enter a plea deal in which he would plead guilty to speeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChambersPlea2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =

==Offseason personnel moves==
===Front office===
On June 26, general manager [[Randy Mueller]] signed a contract extension that is expected to keep him with the team through at least 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerExtension&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins extend GM Randy Mueller's contract | work = Sun-Sentinel.com | url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/football/pro/dolphins/sfl-dolgm062807,0,6074423.story?coll=sfla-dolphins-front | accessdate = 26 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mueller will also receive a salary adjustment, however financial details were unavailable.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerExtension&quot;/&gt; After Nick Saban left following the 2006 season, Mueller's role was altered to give him control of personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerExtension&quot;/&gt;

===Coaches===
After the departure of Nick Saban, Dolphins owner [[H. Wayne Huizenga]] went on a nationwide search for his next head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;CameronHired&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins, Cameron strike four-year deal | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2736313 | accessdate =  15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a dozen candidates were interviewed,&lt;ref name=&quot;CameronHired&quot;/&gt; and on January 19 Cam Cameron agreed to become the seventh head coach in franchise history.&lt;ref name=&quot;CameronHired&quot;/&gt; Cameron had previously served as offensive coordinator for the [[San Diego Chargers]] from 2002 to 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;CameronHired&quot;/&gt; He received a four-year contract worth $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = It's official: Tomlin is Steelers' new coach | work = FoxSports.com | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/6391772 | accessdate =  15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Cameron's arrival, multiple changes were made to the coaching staff.

=====Draft pick signings=====
The Dolphins got a handful of their draft picks signed within a month of the draft, inking four-year deals with running back Lorenzo Booker, punter Brandon Fields, fullback Reagan Mauia, linebacker Kelvin Smith and linebacker Abraham Wright between May 23â25. The Dolphins signed one draft pick in June â defensive tackle Paul Soliai, who also received a four-year deal. Offensive lineman Samson Satele signed a for four years on July 18, while quarterback John Beck and center Dew Mormino signed four-year contracts on July 23. At that time, first-round pick Ted Ginn, Jr. was the only unsigned draft pick. However, on the same day that second-round pick Beck was signed, it was reported that the Dolphins and Ginn were close to contract agreement.

====Undrafted free agents====
Between May 4â17, the Dolphins signed 16 [[undrafted free agent (football)|undrafted free agents]] following the draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;UDFAs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins Open Mini-Camp II; Team Signs Fourteen College Free Agents | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5167&amp;lid=5167 | accessdate = 24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LoftonMalone&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins Sign Two College Free Agents | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5183 | accessdate = 24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were:

*While the team still has an all-aqua alternate scheme and an alternate orange jersey, they wore neither in the two years under head coach Nick Saban.
*Beginning in 2007, the Dolphins' practice jerseys now have last names on the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;PracticeJerseys&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Minicamp stuff | work = Sun-Sentinel.com | url = http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/sports_football_dolphins/2007/05/minicamp_stuff.html | accessdate = 3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quarterback competition===
During training camp, Cameron held a battle for the starting quarterback job between [[Trent Green]] and [[Cleo Lemon]]. Green started the team's first two preseason games and completed 45 percent of his passes for 101 yards with one interception. Lemon was the second quarterback to play in each contest and completed 76 percent of his passes for 108 yards. Nevertheless, Cameron announced that Green would be the team's starting quarterback in 2007. The announcement came on August 20 with two preseason games left to be played. Lemon, who had primarily been no higher than third string in his NFL career, is slated to be the backup to Green in 2007.

===Cutdown to 75===
With NFL rules mandating team rosters must be cut down to 75 players by August 28, the Dolphins released nine players the day before to reach the limit. Those released were: placekicker [[Matt Prater]], punter [[Ryan Flinn]], wide receiver [[David Sutton (American football)|David Sutton]], tight end [[Jason Rader]], cornerback [[Shirdonya Mitchell]], safeties [[Chris Harrell]] and [[Christopher Vedder]], running back [[Ray Perkins (running back)|Ray Perkins]] and defensive tackle [[Kevin Vickerson]].

The team made two extra roster moves on the cutdown day. Offensive guard/tackle [[Joe Toledo]] was moved to the Reserve/Physically Unable to Perform list, meaning he would be eligible to return Week 7 of the regular season. Free agent linebacker/defensive end [[Jorge Cordova]] was added to the roster. Cordova had been released by the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], with which he had spent the previous three seasons.

===Cutdown to 53 and subsequent moves===
On September 1, the Dolphins were required to trim the roster to 53 for the regular season. With 22 roster moves needed in all, the Dolphins waived 16 players, waived/injured four and terminated the contracts of two.

The two veterans that had their contracts terminated were fullback [[Cory Schlesinger]] and wide receiver [[Az-Zahir Hakim]]. The four waived/injured players were guard [[Dan Stevenson]], wide receiver [[P. K. Sam]] and linebackers [[Jim Maxwell (American football)|Jim Maxwell]] and [[Robert McCune]]. In addition, the 16 players that were waived outright were:

* G [[Stephen Parker (American football)|Stephen Parker]]
* CB [[Geoffrey Pope (American football)|Geoff Pope]]
* DT [[Brian Soi]]
* OT [[Julius Wilson]]
|}

The Dolphins' roster was not finalized immediately after cuts, however. Three players were claimed off waivers by the Dolphins from other teams, requiring an additional three roster moves. On September 2, wide receiver [[Kerry Reed]] and center [[Johnathan Ingram]] were waived, while rookie center/guard [[Drew Mormino]] was played in season-ending [[Injured Reserve]] with a shoulder injury. The Dolphins claimed two players off waivers from the [[San Diego Chargers]] â wide receiver [[Greg Camarillo]] and offensive tackle [[Cory Lekkerkerker]]. Meanwhile, offensive lineman [[Gene Mruczkowski]] was claimed off waivers from the [[New England Patriots]].

Five days later, defensive end [[Rob Ninkovich]] was claimed off waivers from the [[New Orleans Saints]]. To make room for him, rookie linebacker [[Kelvin Smith]] was waived.

Two Dolphins players changed their jersey numbers following the preseason. Long snapper [[John Denney]], who wore No. 97 the first two years of his career, switched to No. 92. Undrafted rookie linebacker [[Edmond Miles]] switched from No. 48 to 50 to comply with NFL rules.

===Practice squad===
On September 2 the Dolphins made five additions to their practice squad, all of which among the players cut by the team the day before. Those players were tight end [[Aaron Halterman]], safety [[Tuff Harris]], guard [[Marquay Love]] and offensive tackle [[Julius Wilson]] and wide receiver [[Marvin Allen]]. As the international practice squad player, Allen must remain on the team's practice squad all year and does not count toward the eight-man limit.

Two days later, the Dolphins signed three more players â guard [[Tala Esera]], wide receiver [[Kerry Reed]] and wide receiver [[Chandler Williams]] â to their practice squad. Esera and Reed were with the Dolphins in preseason and released earlier in the month. Chandler, meanwhile, was a seventh-round pick by the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the [[2007 NFL Draft]] out of [[FIU Golden Panthers Football|Florida International University]]. He was waived by the team during final cuts on September 1.

The Dolphins began their 2007 campaign on the road against the [[Washington Redskins]]. After a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins made the first move with kicker [[Shaun Suisham]] getting a 31-yard field goal three minutes into the second quarter. Miami would take the lead before the end of the half with a one-yard touchdown pass from [[Trent Green]] to [[tight end]] [[Justin Peelle]] as time expired.

Washington took a 10â7 lead on a 19-yard [[Clinton Portis]] touchdown run with just under 12 minutes remaining in the third quarter.  Dolphins kicker Jay Feely tied the game at 10 later in the quarter on a 20-yard field goal, and each team notched another field goal in the fourth quarter. With four seconds remaining and the ball on the Washington 43-yard line, Redskins quarterback [[Jason Campbell]] launched a last-second [[Hail Mary pass]] that was batted by Dolphins defensive end [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] in the end zone. Redskins wide receiver [[Antwaan Randle El]] caught the ball at the six but was tackled at the three-yard line before he could score the winning touchdown.

The Redskins won the coin toss to begin overtime and promptly mounted a 10-play, 62-yard drive that included just two passes. Suisham made his third field goal of the game, this time from 39 yards out, to win the game 16â13 and hand Miami their first loss of the season as they started out 0â1 and 0-1 against NFC Opponents.

In the fourth quarter, Dallas extended the lead with Folk's 47-yard field goal and Romo's 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]]. The Dolphins tried to come back as Green completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Derek Hagan]], but the Cowboys managed to put the game away with Barber's 40-yard touchdown run as Miami fell to 0â2 and 0-2 against NFC Opponents.

Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Dolphins flew to [[Giants Stadium|The Meadowlands]] for Week 3 in an AFC East duel against the [[New York Jets]] (who were also 0â2 heading into the game).  In the first quarter, the Jets flew out first with QB [[Chad Pennington]] completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR [[Laveranues Coles]] for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Miami took the lead with RB [[Ronnie Brown]]'s 1-yard TD run.  However, it was short lived as on the ensuing kickoff, RB [[Leon Washington]] returned the kick 98 yards for a touchdown.  The Dolphins drew closer with kicker [[Jay Feely]]'s 31-yard and 39-yard field goal.  However, New York responded with Pennington completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE [[Chris Baker (tight end)|Chris Baker]].

In the third quarter, the Jets increased their lead with kicker [[Mike Nugent]]'s 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period.

Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins went home for a Week 4 duel with the [[Oakland Raiders]], featuring former teammate [[Daunte Culpepper]].  The game was delayed for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms in the area.

In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Culpepper completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR [[Jerry Porter (American football)|Jerry Porter]].  He even got a 2-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins managed to get on the board with RB [[Ronnie Brown]] getting a 9-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, the 'Fins managed to get closer with kicker [[Jay Feely]] getting a 29-yard field goal, yet Oakland answered with Culpepper getting a 5-yard TD run.  Miami would end the period with QB [[Trent Green]] completing a 3-yard TD pass to TE [[Justin Peelle]].  In the fourth quarter however, Culpepper delivered the final blows by hooking up with Porter again on a 27-yard TD pass and getting a 3-yard TD run.

With their fourth-straight loss, the Dolphins fell to 0â4.

Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to [[Reliant Stadium]] for a Week 5 showdown with the [[Houston Texans]].  In the first quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Texans RB [[Ron Dayne]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  Fortunately, the 'Fins answered with kicker [[Jay Feely]] getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, with less than 4 minutes to go in the period, history came back to haunt QB [[Trent Green]].  During an offensive play, WR [[Ted Ginn, Jr.]] was running with the ball and Green went low to block DT [[Travis Johnson]].  Trent would end up getting hit in the head with Johnson's knee, knocking him unconscious with a concussion.  Johnson would then get flagged for taunting the uncoscious Trent Green.

However, the Texans would pull out the win with Brown getting not only a 20-yard field goal, but a gut-punching 57-yard field goal.

With their fifth-straight loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0â5, but they also suffered their first 8-straight losing streak since 1967.

As a result, he was placed on season-ending [[Injured Reserve]] on September 11. The team also waived backup [[defensive end]] [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]], who did not play in the season opener. With two open spots on the 53-man roster, the team signed contracts with veteran safeties and [[Donovin Darius]] and [[Lamont Thompson]]. They were waived by the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Tennessee Titans]], respectively, at the end of the preseason. The same day, rookie linebacker [[Kelvin Smith]], who was waived four days earlier, was re-signed to the team's practice squad.

====October====
On the first day of the month, linebacker [[Robert McCune]] was waived from injured reserve. Linebacker Jim Maxwell suffered the same fate eight days later.

The Dolphins' active roster remained unchanged for nearly a month after the season opener. The first transactions since came on October 10, when defensive tackle [[Sam Rayburn (American football)|Sam Rayburn]] was signed and safety [[Lamont Thompson]] was released. Thompson appeared in one game for the Dolphins after being signed on September 11 and made one tackle. Rayburn went to training camp with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 2007 after spending the first four years of his career with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].

On October 16, Miami traded their No. 1 receiver, seven-year veteran [[Chris Chambers]], to the [[San Diego Chargers]] in exchange for a second-round pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]]. In 100 games with the Dolphins since being drafted in the second round of the [[2001 NFL Draft]], Chambers caught 405 passes for 5,688 yards and 43 touchdowns. He earned his first [[Pro Bowl]] selection in 2005. In the team's first six games of the 2007 season, he caught 31 passes for 415 yards with no touchdowns. On the same day, the team also released safety [[Donovin Darius]] and placed defensive tackle [[Chase Page]] on injured reserve.

To fill the three roster spots vacated by Chambers, Darius and Page, the Dolphins signed three defensive linemen â tackles [[Anthony Bryant (American football)|Anthony Bryant]] and [[Jesse Mahelona]] and end [[Derreck Robinson]]. Bryant was on the practice squad of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] prior to his signing. Mahelona and Robinson had been released by the [[Tennessee Titans]] and [[San Diego Chargers]], respectively, in September.

After suffering a concussion in the team's Week 5 game against the [[Houston Texans]], starting quarterback [[Trent Green]] was placed on injured reserve on October 20. Wide receiver [[Kerry Reed]] â an undrafted free agent from Michigan State â was promoted to the active roster from the practice squad. 

Three days later, defensive tackle Jesse Mahelona was waived after being inactive for one game with the team. Starting running back [[Ronnie Brown]] and starting free safety [[Renaldo Hill]] were both placed on injured reserve with torn ACLs suffered in the team's Week 7 game against the [[New England Patriots]]. Brown was leading the NFL in offensive yards at the time of the injury.

On October 24, two of the three roster spots were filled from outside the organization as the Dolphins signed defensive end [[Quentin Moses]] and safety [[Lance Schulters]]. Moses was originally drafted by the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the third round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]] and was claimed off waivers by the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on September 2. He was inactive for six games before being waived. Schulters spent the latter part of the 2006 season with the Atlanta Falcons after starting for the Dolphins in 2005. Tight end [[Aaron Halterman]] was also promoted from the practice squad.

Additionally, running back [[Samkon Gado]] was claimed off waivers from the [[Houston Texans]]. The team was granted a one-game roster exemption, as Gado was unable to meet the Dolphins in time for their October 28 game in [[London]].

The following day, defensive back [[Jereme Perry]] was signed to the active roster an undrafted free agent wide receiver [[Stefan Logan]] ([[University of South Dakota|South Dakota]]) was signed to the practice squad. Perry had spent the 2006 season and 2007 training camp with the [[Cleveland Browns]].

On November 14, safety [[Travares Tillman]] was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury. [[Tuff Harris]] â an undrafted defensive back from [[Montana Grizzlies|Montana]] â was promoted from the practice squad to the active roster.

Prater briefly held the kicking job for the Atlanta Falcons, but was waived on September 19 after going 1-for-4 on field goal in two games.

On November 19, running back [[Ricky Williams]] was reinstated by the NFL. Williams had been suspended since the 2006 offseason for his fourth violation of the league substance abuse policy. The team was granted a one-week roster exemption for Williams.

Williams' return to the Dolphins did not last long, however. After being activated by the Dolphins when running back [[Samkon Gado]] was waived on November 26, Williams suffered a torn pectoral muscle against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. He was placed on injured reserve on November 28 and Gado was re-signed.

Despite returning to practice on November 6, offensive lineman [[Joe Toledo]] â on the physically-unable-to-perform list since training camp â was unable to return to the active roster for the 2007 season.
