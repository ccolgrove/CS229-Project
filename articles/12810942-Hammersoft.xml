'''Neelam Kapoor''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Jamila Massey]].

Neelam and her husband built themselves a profitable clothing business, but left it in the hands of their son, Sanjay, in the late 1980s and emigrated to their native [[India]]. However Sanjay proved to be a poor businessman and after some bad monetary investments, his business went [[bankrupt]]. Sanjay kept this from his parents and moved to Walford to open a clothing stall in 1993.

In February 1997 Sanjay heard news that his father had died. He travelled to India for the [[funeral]] and returned early in March with his mother in tow. Gita was horrified. She had always had a tempestuous relationship with Sanjay's interfering mother and she was furious that he'd brought her to live with them without her consent. Neelam, sensing Gita's disapproval, went out of her way to be as obliging as possible and she was even understanding upon hearing the clothing business had floundered. Gita begrudgingly began to accept Neelam's presence but found her domineering mannerisms a little irksome.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://archives.walford.net/1420.htm ''EastEnders'' TUE 04-MAR-97  episode description]&quot;, ''Walford.net''. URL last accessed on 2007-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neelam pitched in with the running of the Kapoor's market stall before buying the First Til Last grocery store in August 1997. Neelam was adamant that the shop should be run as a family business, so she fired the resident shop assistant, [[Carol Jackson]], which didn't go down well. Neelam continued to irritate Gita as the year wore on by instructing her on the upbringing of her daughter, Sharmilla, and accusing her of being a bad wife to Sanjay. Sanjay allowed Neelam to pamper him and cater to his every whim, which infuriated Gita further. By October Gita could take no more so she decided to leave Walford for a holiday with her sister, but not before telling Neelam a few home truths about Sanjay's adultery before departing. Neelam was appalled, but she was only to happy to believe her precious son when he claimed Gita was merely lying.

Gita was due to return in January 1998, but she went missing in suspicious circumstances and the police suspected foul play. It transpired that Gita had merely run away after falling [[pregnant]] with another man's baby. Sanjay tracked her down and Gita was persuaded to return to Walford with her new baby. Neelam was furious about Gita's immoral behaviour and would not condone Sanjay taking on another man's child as his own. She tried to convince him to divorce Gita and fight for custody of Sharmilla. Sanjay defiantly refused to do this, so Neelam sold her shop to [[Terry Raymond]] and left Walford to live with her extended family in [[Bristol]], disowning her son on the way out. Her last appearance was in July 1998.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://archives.walford.net/1651.htm ''EastEnders'' TUE 28-JUL-98 episode description]&quot;, ''Walford.net''.

'''Jessie Moore''' had been put into [[foster care]] when her drug addict mother was imprisoned on remand for various offences. In October 1997 Jessie was housed with [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] and [[Ruth Fowler]] in Walford. Six year old Jessie was a deeply troubled child, who was extremely shy and refused to speak initially. She was also a bedwetter and Mark and Ruth seemed unable to get her to open up to them, but they eventually managed to make progress and they became extremely attached to her.

In 1998, Jessie's mother, Nicole, telephoned the Fowlers and asked Jessie to visit her in prison. Mark refused to allow this, but the [[social worker]] assured him that Nicole had completed her [[Drug detoxification|de-tox]] programme and that contact between her and Jessie was particularly important. Jessie visited and became excited to learn that Nicole would soon be released from prison. 

Nicole paid Jessie an impromptu visit on the day of her 7th birthday in February 1998. Nicole had found herself a bedsit and wanted to take Jessie back. Mark and Ruth tried to contest Nicole's decision, but they were told that reuniting children with their parents was what fostering was all about. 

Nicole spent several weeks visiting Jessie to rebuild their relationship and eventually Ruth and Mark realised how close they were. They retracted their opposition and Nicole was given custody of Jessie in March 1998. Ruth was particularly saddened by Jessie's departure and she bought her a necklace to remind her of the time they had spent together.

'''Ros Thorne''' was a Scottish private detective who [[Ian Beale]] hired to trace his two sons, [[Steven Beale|Steven]] and [[Peter Beale|Peter]]. Steven and Peter had been taken by their mother, [[Cindy Beale|Cindy]], following her failed attempt to have Ian killed by a professional hitman in 1996.

Ian and Ros discovered that Cindy was residing in [[Italy]] and followed her there in November 1997. While hunting for Cindy, Ian and Ros became attracted to each other. They had a brief sexual encounter, though their relationship never progressed into anything serious as Ian was preoccupied with his children. After days of searching, Ros eventually found Cindy working in an Italian bar and she and Ian concocted a plan to abscond with Ian's children. They lured Cindy into a trap, while [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] kidnapped Steven and Peter and brought them to the airport to reunite with their father. Despite a few hitches, Ian managed to bring the children safely back to Walford, with Cindy in pursuit. 

Cindy threatened to take Ian to court for custody of the children. Ian continued to use Ros to investigate Cindy and her new partner, [[#Nick Holland|Nick Holland]]âa rich businessman who was funding the custody case. Ros also began investigating Ian's hitman, [[John Valecue]], who was now being held in prison for an unrelated murder. Valecue was unwilling to admit that Cindy hired him to kill Ian, as his sentence would likely increase if he admitted to his involvement. However, after [[Annie Palmer]] threatened him with severe repercussions from her associates within the prison, Valecue eventually confessed. Cindy was arrested and imprisoned, and Ian was given custody of his children. Ros was not seen again following the completion of the case.

Josh was introduced as part of a storyline to aid the departure of the long-running characters, [[Nigel Bates|Nigel]] and [[Clare Bates]] (played by [[Paul Bradley (actor)|Paul Bradley]] and [[Gemma Bissix]]). Actor Paul Bradley had decided to leave the serial, reportedly for fear of being typecast.&lt;ref name=&quot;nerd&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19971116/ai_n14470623 |title= LOVE AT LAST FOR NIGEL THE NERD|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' | date = 1997-11-16| accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers of ''EastEnders'' wanted to give Nigel a happy ending, so a character named [[Julie Haye]] ([[Karen Henthorn]]) was invented to be a love interest for Nigel, whilst her son, Josh, was invented to be a love interest for Nigel's daughter, Clare.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.wgazette.com/wint04-henthorn.html |title= Interview with Karen Henthorn|publisher=''Walford Gazette'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
Josh Saunders was first seen as a pupil rescuing [[Clare Bates]] from a gang of bulliesâher former friends who became her enemies after she refused to socialise with them. Clare developed an instant crush on Josh, and she spent the following few weeks trying to impress him. They started dating, despite initial objections from Clare's father. It transpired that Josh was actually the son of Clare's teacher, [[Julie Haye]]. Clare was mortified by this initially, and she refused to speak to Josh for a brief period. She soon came to accept the situation, and was even pleased when her father, [[Nigel Bates|Nigel]], began dating Josh's mother.

Josh found himself caught in the middle of his warring parentsâhis father, [[List of EastEnders characters (1998)#Eliot Saunders|Eliot]], had been furious when Julie announced that she was planning to move to Scotland with Josh in 1998. Josh's father was Jewish, and Josh was obliged to have a [[Bar Mitzvah]] to appease his father before he left for Scotland. Josh was initially opposed to this, as he was not remotely interested in religion. He started missing his Bar Mitzvah tutorials, which did not please his father; he was told that performing the ceremony was ultimately his choice, but if he did not do it before he left, his family would not be present to support him. Josh decided to go ahead with the Bar Mitzvah. It took place in March 1998 and Clare was present as his guest.

Nigel and Julie's relationship ended when Nigel began to have second thoughtsâhe felt that he was betraying his deceased wife. Julie and Josh left Walford for Scotland in April 1998. Clare was upset to see Josh go, they said their goodbyes, but just at the last minute, Nigel changed his mind again, and asked Julie if he and Clare could move to Scotland with her and Josh. Clare was overjoyed and Josh and Julie returned to collect the Bateses a few weeks later.

Following Clare's return to Walford a decade later, in 2008, she revealed that as she had aged, Josh had taken her place in Nigel's affections.
