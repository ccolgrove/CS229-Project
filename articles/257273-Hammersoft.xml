==History==
[[File:Crispus Attucks.jpg|thumb|right|[[Crispus Attucks]], from Framingham, was the first person to be killed in the fight for American independence.]]

Framingham, sited on the ancient trail known as the [[Old Connecticut Path]], was first settled when John Stone settled on the west bank of the [[Sudbury River]] in 1647. In 1660, [[Thomas Danforth]], an official of the Bay Colony, formerly of [[Framlingham|Framlingham, Suffolk]], received a grant of land at &quot;Danforth's Farms&quot; and began to accumulate over {{convert|15000|acre|km2}}. He strenuously resisted petitions for incorporation of the town, which was officially incorporated in 1700, following his death the previous year. Why the &quot;L&quot; was dropped from the new town's name is not known. The first church was organized in 1701, the first teacher was hired in 1706, and the first permanent schoolhouse in 1716.

On February 22, 1775, the British general sent two officers and an enlisted man out of Boston to survey the route to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. In Framingham those spies stopped at Buckminster's Tavern. They watched the town militia muster outside the building, impressed with the men's numbers but not their discipline. Though &quot;the whole company&quot; came into the tavern after their drill, the officers managed to remain undetected and continued on their mission the next day.&lt;ref&gt;''General Gage's Instructions'', Boston: John Gill, 1779.&lt;/ref&gt; Gage did not order a march along that route, instead ordering troops to [[Concord, Massachusetts]] on April 18â19. Framingham sent two militia companies totaling about 130 men into the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] that followed; one of those men was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Adams Drake, ''History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts'' (Boston: Estes &amp; Lauriat, 1880), vol. 1, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years prior to the [[American Civil War]], Framingham was an annual gathering-spot for members of the [[Abolitionist]] movement. Each [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] from 1854 to 1865, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society held a rally in a picnic area called Harmony Grove near what is now downtown Framingham. At the 1854 rally, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] burned copies of the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] of 1850, judicial decisions enforcing it, and the [[United States Constitution]]. Other prominent Abolitionists present that day included [[William Cooper Nell]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Yacovone, &quot;A Covenant with Death and an Agreement with Hell,&quot; at http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[postâWorld War II baby boom]], Framingham, like many other suburban areas, experienced a large increase in population and housing. Much of the housing constructed during that time consisted of [[split-level house|split-level]] and ranch-style houses.

Framingham is known for the [[Framingham Heart Study]], as well as for the Dennison Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1844 as a [[jewelry]] and [[watch]] box manufacturing company by [[Aaron Lufkin Dennison]], who became the pioneer of the [[American System of Watch Manufacturing]] at the nearby [[Waltham Watch Company]]. His brother, Eliphalet Whorf Dennison, developed the company into a sizable industrial complex, which merged in 1990 into [[Avery Dennison]], with headquarters in [[Pasadena, California]], and active corporate offices in the town.

In the year 2000, Framingham celebrated its [[Tercentennial]].

===Housing===
Framingham is one of the few towns in Massachusetts that has met its legal requirement of 10% for [[Massachusetts Chapter 40B]] Affordable housing which mostly targets people with income levels in the 70% of median income. In addition to its 40B Affordable component, Framingham has a large percentage of rental units which target people in the 30% of median income bracket. Framingham has a much larger percentage of rental households than any of the surrounding towns. Statewide, the median income of rental households is 47% of the median for homeowners, and in Middlesex County it is slightly more than 50%. In Framingham, the median renter income of $33,626 is 45% of the median homeowner income of $75,040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamma.gov/web/pages/Framingham%20Housing%20Plan_Chapter%202_Population%20Profile.pdf|title=Framingham Housing Plan Population Profile|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing in South Framingham is mainly single family houses on lots of less than {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamma.gov/web/pages/Housing_Plan.htm|title=Framingham Housing Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; multi-family homes or apartments. Additionally much of the town's affordable housing is located south of Route 9. However there a large number of large, single family homes around Salem End Road on the West Side of South Framingham. This region is often overlooked as being in South Framingham because the area is physically separated from most of the South Side due to a series of reservoirs and the [[Sudbury River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/sudbury.htm|title=Sudbury Reservoirs on the DCR web site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there are many large [[Victorian house]]s located along the shores of Learned and Gleason Ponds, and along Concord St. and Union Ave. near Downtown Framingham. Additionally, the West Side of South Framingham along Route 9 has several large tracts of multi story apartment buildings that comprise a major part of the town's apartment stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyaptmapped.com/apartments/framingham,massachusetts,ma/edgewater+hills.html|title=Edgewater Hills on EveryAptMapped.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyaptmapped.com/apartments/framingham,massachusetts,ma/edgewater+village.html|title=Edgewater Village on EveryAptMapped.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonapartments.com/edgewaterterrace.htm|title=Edgewater Terrace on BostonApartments.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Framingham was originally mostly farmland and gave way to large tracts of single family housing on lots of over {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}} after World War II. The village of Saxonville on the east side is an old mill area that consists of many Victorian homes, and is undergoing a large expansion of over six hundred new homes on a former [[gravel pit]]. The village of Nobscot on the western side has many homes that are valued above mean housing prices for the region. While there are several small apartment complexes on the North Side, most have been converted to [[condominiums]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the villages of Nobscot, Pinefield and Saxonville all had a large number of slab and raised [[ranch-style house]]s constructed by the Campanelli Company. These homes are classic cookie-cutter style homes that feature the same general shape and [[floor plan]]; while there are six or seven styles of the houses, the large majority of which are referred to Campanelli &quot;L&quot; ranches because their floor plan resembles the letter &quot;[[L]]&quot;. At the time of construction, these homes were considered by many to be the epitome of the American dream of homeownership; today they are viewed as more modest homes.

Today, most of Framingham has been developed with the exception of some parcels in the northwest quadrant. In this part of town there are more people with wells and septic systems, combined with a large amount of ledge, which prevents most of the unbuilt land from being developed.

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Framingham, Massachusetts}}
Framingham's government is similar to the structure of other New England town governments. In Framingham, the Board of Selectmen act as the executive branch. They set policy and hire a Strong Town Manager who manages government services. A [[Representative town meeting|representative Town Meeting]] serving as the legislative branch.

==Pollution==
Framingham is part of the Middlesex County.  In 2002 the county ranked among the worst and dirtiest 10% of all counties in the United States in regards to air and water releases.  

Of the top 20 polluters in the county, one is located in Framingham town limits: Dennison MFG. CO.&lt;ref name=scorecard.goodguide,org&gt;{{cite web|title=Pollution Report Card: Middlesex County|work=Scorecard: The Pollution Information Site|accessdate=May 2011|url=http://scorecard.goodguide.com/community/index.tcl?zip_code=01701&amp;set_community_zipcode_cookie_p=t&amp;x=0&amp;y=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dennison has been a landmark for the town of Framingham since its move to the town in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dennison Manufacturing Company|url=http://www.mountainlumber.com/index.php/learn/histories_detail/dennison_manufacturing_company/|accessdate=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dennisonâs threat to the environment is from air releases of recognized developmental toxicants, toluene being of the greatest impact.  Toluene is often used in adhesives, which Dennison is known for.  Toluene is harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the skin and may affect liver, kidneys, blood system, or central nervous systems.  Causes irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract.  Toluene is the leading toxic chemical released in Middlesex County at 209,169 pounds in 2002.

In 1998 according to the clean water act, four bodies of water in Middlesex County were reported as watersheds.  These bodies of water were the concord river, the Charles River, Merrimack River, and the Nashua River.  

The leading polluters of the countyâs rivers, streams, and creeks are pathogens, which affect 65% of the countyâs water bodies.  These pathogens most often make their way into the water through improper sewage system, animal waste runoff, and storm water drains.  72% of lakes, reservoirs, and ponds are affected with noxious aquatic plants, which can affect drinking water.  However, the EPA was only able to assess 18% of rivers, streams, and creeks and 56% of lakes, reservoirs, and ponds.  

The distribution of burden in the county is uneven, with 53000 on people of color and 30000 on whites, a ration of 1.77.  There are also drastic inequalities in regards to income, poverty, and education (high school v. non high school).&lt;ref name=&quot;scorecard.goodguide,org&quot;/&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Framingham, Massachusetts}}
The Framingham School Department can trace its roots back to 1706 when the town hired its first school master, Deacon Joshua Hemenway. While Framingham had its first school master, it did not get its own public school building until 1716. The first high school, the Framingham Academy, opened its doors in 1792; however this school was eventually closed due financing issues and the legality of the town providing funds for a private school. The first town operated high school opened in 1852 and has been in operation continuously in numerous location throughout the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historic time line of Framingham&quot;&gt;[http://www.framingham.com/history/histtime.htm Historic time line of Framingham] on Framingham.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, Framingham upgraded its schools, it replaced the former Cameron school with a completely new school and performed major renovations to Wilson, McCarthy and [[Framingham High School]]. Two public school buildings that were mothballed due to financial issues or population drops have been leased to the Metrowest Jewish Day School (at the former Juniper Hill Elementary) and Mass Bay Community College (at the former Farley Middle school). Several schools that were no longer being used were sold off, including Lincoln, Roosevelt and Washington.

Framingham has three [[college]]s, including [[Framingham State University]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Community College]]'s Framingham Campus.

===Private services===
Framingham has two [[taxicab|taxi]] companies, Tommy's Taxi and Town Taxi, and several [[limousine]] companies that service the area.

==Economy==
Framingham's economy is predominantly derived from retail and office complexes. There are scatterings of small manufacturing facilities and commercial services such as plumbing, mechanical and electrical expected to be found in communities of its size. Framingham has three major business districts within the town, The &quot;Golden Triangle,&quot; Downtown/South Framingham and West Framingham. Additionally, there are several smaller business hubs in the villages of Framingham Center, Saxonville, Nobscot and along the Route 9 corridor.

=== Golden Triangle ===
{{Main|Golden Triangle (Massachusetts)}}
The Golden Triangle was originally a three square mile district on the eastern side of Framingham, bordered by Worcester Rd. (Route 9), Cochituate Rd. (Route 30), and Speen Street in [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]]. In 1993, the area began to expand beyond the borders of the triangle with construction of a [[BJ's Wholesale Club]] and a [[Stop &amp; Shop|Super Stop &amp; Shop]] just north of Route 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/others/index.html|title=Other Development in the Golden Triangle on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now includes the original area plus parts of Old Connecticut Path., Concord St. (Route 126), and Speen St. north of Route 30. Because of the size and complexity of this area, Framingham and Natick cooperatively operate it as a single distinct district with similar [[zoning]]. The area is one of the largest shopping districts in [[New England]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The area was formed with the construction of [[Shoppers World (Framingham)|Shoppers World]] in 1951. Shoppers' World was a large open air [[shopping mall]], the second in the US and the first east of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=288|title=History of Shoppers World on Massmoments.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mall drew many other retail construction projects to the area, including [[Marshalls]] (1961, rebuilt as [[Bed, Bath and Beyond]] 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/marshalls/index.html|title=The Marshals Mall on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caldor]] (1966, Rebuilt as [[Wal-Mart]] in 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/caldor/index.html|title=Caldor on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bradlees]] (1960s, rebuilt as [[Kohl's]] in 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/bradlees/index.html|title=Bradlees on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Route 30 Mall (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/rte30mall/index.html|title=History of the Route 30 Mall on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[AMC Theatres|AMC Framingham 15]], the Framingham Mall (1978, rebuilt 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/framingham/index.html|title=the Framingham Mall on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lowes]] (formerly the [[Verizon]] Building, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/verizon/index.html|title=The Verizon Building on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary developments in Natick include the [[Natick Mall]] (1966, rebuilt in 1991, expanded 2007 &amp; renamed Natick Collection),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/natickmall/index.html|title=The Natick Mall on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherwood Plaza (1960),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/sherwood/index.html|title=Sherwood Plaza on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloverleaf Marketplace (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamnatickretail.com/cloverleaf/index.html|title=The Evolution of the Cloverleaf Mall on Framingham/Natick Retail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Home Depot]]. In 1994, Shoppers' World was demolished and replaced with a strip mall name Shoppers World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://framingham.wordpress.com/2007/01/13/bid-adieu-shoppers-world/|title=Bid Adieu Shoppers World}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also seven hotels and two car dealerships located within the Triangle.

In addition to retail properties, there are large office developments located in the area including several companies headquartered in the triangle; the world headquarters of [[TJX]] is located at the junction of Route 30 and Speen St, as is the main office of [[IDG]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]]. [[Breyers]], [[Leggat McCall]], the [[American Heart Association]], and the [[American Cancer Society]] all have facilities in the area. [[Boston Scientific]] headquarters is housed in Natick, in the old [[Carling]] Brewery building and former [[Prime Computer|Prime]] parkway complex. There are over a dozen large office complexes located in, and along, the borders of the Triangle.

===Downtown and South Framingham===
[[File:FraminghamMATownHall 2007-03-25.jpg|thumb|right|The Memorial Building, Framingham's town hall]]
[[File:Framingham Public Library Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Framingham Public Library, Lexington St.]]

The downtown area is located between the &quot;Y&quot;-shaped [[traffic circle]] formed by the intersection of Concord St. and Union Ave. It is known as little Brazil and it is called Memorial Square, to the north and its mirror intersection at the junction of Irving St. and Hollis St. on the south end. The area is bisected by Waverly St. (Route 135) and the [[MBTA]] [[Commuter Rail]] tracks. The anchoring structure of Downtown is the town hall, The Memorial Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.com/downtown/dtrevdef.htm|title=Downtown Framingham Economic Development Strategic Plan on Framingham.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Framingham became the commercial center of the town with the advent of the railroad in the 1880s. It eventually came to house [[Avery Dennison|Dennison Manufacturing]] and the former [[General Motors]] [[Framingham Assembly]] plant, but the area underwent a financial downturn after the closure of these facilities during the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stepps.info/downtown.html|title=Downtown Revitalization in Framingham plan on STEPPS.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influx of [[Hispanic]] and [[Brazil]]ian immigrants helped to revitalize the district starting in the early 2000s. Along with Brazilian and Spanish oriented retail shops, there are restaurants, legal and financial services, the town offices and library, an art museum, police headquarters, and the local branch of the [[Social Security Administration]]. Several [[Culture of Asia|Asian]] and [[Indian American|Indian]] stores and restaurants add to the rich ethnic flavor of the area, and many small businesses, restaurants and automotive-oriented shops line Waverly St. from Natick in east to Winter St. in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://framingham.com/shop/downtown.htm|title=Shop Downton Guide on Framingham.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Fitts Market &amp; Hemenway buildings faÃ§ades underwent a restoration project; these newly renovated structures were awarded a 2006 Massachusetts Historical Commission Preservation Award in the Restoration and Rehabilitation Category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/mhc/mhcpra/prawin.htm|title=2006 MHC Preservation Award Winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several retail and housing projects involving the Arcade Building and the former Dennison Building Complex are in the planning stages or under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bealsandthomas.com/Project/1691framingham.htm|title=Framingham Arcade reconstruction project designed Beals and Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.com/news/history/new_site_on_historical_society_house_tour.htm|title=The Residences at Dennison Triangle on Framingham.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framingham Time Capsules===
Framingham, Massachusetts has a mammoth town hall, known as Memorial Hall, located at the corner of Union Avenue and Concord Street. Flanking the staircase to the entrance of the building are two flagpoles, one on each side. And at the base of each flagpole are two plaques.

The western plaque reads: &quot;Two Time Capsules were buried on this site September 17, 2000 To Commemorate Framingham's Tercentennial &quot;300 Years of History&quot; - One capsule to be opened in 2025, the other to be opened 2100.&quot;

The eastern plaque reads: &quot;Time Capsule to be opened October 16, 2025 - Items symbolizing efforts to eliminate racism, stereotyping and discrimination in Framingham&quot;.

===West Framingham===
The business section on the West Side of Framingham runs primarily along Route 9, starting at Temple St.; it is dominated by two large office/industrial parks: the Framingham Industrial Park on the north side of Route 9 and the Framingham Technology Park on the south side, both on the Ashland/Southborough border. [[Bose (company)|Bose]] and [[Staples Inc]] both have their world headquarters in these parks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamma.org/planning_dept/LIFT_schedule_9_update.pdf|title=Local Bus Schedule with maps of these Company HQs|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does convenience store chain [[Cumberland Farms]]; in addition, [[Genzyme]], [[Capital One]], [[CA Technologies]], [[ITT Tech]] and the local paper, [[The MetroWest Daily News]], all have major facilities located there. Two of Framingham's seven major auto dealerships are also located in West Framingham: [[Ford]] and [[Toyota]]/[[Scion (car)|Scion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernarditoyota.com/|title=Bernardi Toyota}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamford.com/ou/framingham-ford/|title=Framingham Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large tracts of multi-story [[apartment]] and [[condominium]] complexes line both sides of Route 9 from Temple St. to the industrial parks. These buildings represent the majority of Framingham's multi-family dwellings, and along with the business complexes, helped create a large network of support services on the West Side: Framingham's second Super Stop &amp; Shop supermarket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopandshop.com/cgi-bin/stores.pl|title=Stop and Shop stores in Framingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; dozens of restaurants and pubs, [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=756|title=Sheraton Framingham on Sheraton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Residence Inn by Marriott]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriott.com/hotels/travel/bosfm-residence-inn-boston-framingham/|title=Framingham Residence Inn on Marriott.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; hotels and a large [[day-care]] facility all are in the two-mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) section of Route 9 from Temple St. to [[Ashland, Massachusetts|Ashland]].

===Villages and Route 9===
[[File:Fram common.jpg|thumb|left|The Common in Framingham Center]]

Framingham Center is the physical and historic center of town. Formed at the junctions of [[Massachusetts Route 9|Worcester Rd. (Route 9)]], Pleasant St. (Route 30), High St., Main St. and Edgell Rd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometownlocator.com/City/Framingham-Center-Massachusetts.cfm|title=Map of Framingham Center on HomeTownLocator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dominating presence is [[Framingham State University]]. The school is home to several thousand students, about one third of whom live on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.edu/about_fsc.htm|title=Framingham State College's home page}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, [[MassHighway]] replaced the intersection with an overpass, depressing Route 9 below the local roads, and destroying the south half of the old Center retail district. The remaining half houses several small stores, restaurants, [[realtors]] and legal offices. The old Boston and Worcester Street Railway depot, on the east side of the Center, was converted in to a strip mall in the early 1980s and houses the Center Postal Station (01703) and several small stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicframingham.blogspot.com/2009/09/boston-worcester-trolley.html|title=Boston &amp; Worcester trolley on historicframingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center is rounded out by One and Two Edgell Rd. (two small retail/office buildings), the historic [[Village hall|Village Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicvillagehall.org/|title=Village Hall home page}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jonathan Maynard Building (a former school converted to an office building which now houses most of the school district's administration), the Framingham History Center (formerly the Framingham Historical Society and Museum),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framinghamhistory.org/|title=Framingham History Center home page}}&lt;/ref&gt; several banks, a Chinese restaurant, the [[American Medical Response]] paramedic station and McCarthy Office Building.

The village of Nobscot, located at the intersection of Water St., Edmands Rd. and Edgell Rd., and the Pinefield/Saxonville villages, located where Concord St., Water St., and Central St. intersect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.com/shop/nobscot.htm|title=Shopping Nobscot on framingham.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.com/shop/saxonville.htm|title=Shopping Saxonville on framingham.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; are home to several small office buildings, strip malls and gas stations. Saxonville is the home of the former Roxbury Carpet Company buildings, now an industrial park.

In addition, the section of Route 9 from the Route 126 [[overpass]] to the Main St./Edgell Rd. beetleback in Framingham Center is heavily developed. Three car dealerships, [[Acura]], [[Chevrolet]] and [[Nissan]], several strip malls of varying sizes, many small apartment complexes, several small office complexes and other small shops and restaurants make Route 9 the main commercial thoroughfare in Framingham.

Finally, there are several other small retail areas and facilities spread throughout the town, e.g. near Mt Wayte Ave. and Franklin St.; the intersection of Concord St. and Hartford St.; and along School St., near Hamilton St.
