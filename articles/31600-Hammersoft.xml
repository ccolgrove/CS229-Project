[[Richard Stengel]] has been the managing editor since 2006.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
[[Image:Time Magazine - first cover.jpg|thumb|right|The ''TIME Magazine''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s premiere issue on March 3, 1923, featuring [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Joseph Gurney Cannon|Joseph G. Cannon]] on its first cover.]]
''Time'' magazine was created in 1923 by [[Briton Hadden]] and [[Henry Luce]], making it the first weekly news magazine in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of TIME&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/collections/0,21428,c_time_history,00.shtml|title=History of TIME|publisher=TIME magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor respectively of the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' and considered calling the magazine ''Facts''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Henry R. Luce&quot;, in ''Current Biography 1941, p530&lt;/ref&gt; Hadden was a rather carefree figure, who liked to tease Luce and saw ''Time'' as something important but also fun. That accounts for its tone, which many people still criticize as too light for serious news and more suited to its heavy coverage of celebrities (including politicians), the entertainment industry, and pop culture. It set out to tell the news through people, and for many decades the magazine's cover was of a single person. The first issue of ''Time'' was published on March 3, 1923, featuring on its cover [[Joseph Gurney Cannon|Joseph G. Cannon]], the retired [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]]; a facsimile reprint of Issue No. 1, including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original, was included with copies of the February 28, 1938 issue as a commemoration of the magazine's 15th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brycezabel.com/instanthistory/2006/03/time_magazine_f.html Instant History: Review of First Issue with Cover]&lt;/ref&gt; On Hadden's death in 1929, Luce became the dominant man at ''Time'' and a major figure in the history of 20th-century media. According to ''Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1972â2004'' by Robert Elson, &quot;Roy Edward Larsen [...] was to play a role second only to Luce's in the development of Time Inc.&quot; In his book, ''The March of Time, 1935â1951'', Raymond Fielding also noted that Larsen was &quot;originally circulation manager and then general manager of ''Time'', later publisher of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', for many years president of Time, Inc., and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after Luce.&quot;

Around the time they were raising US$100,000 from wealthy [[Yale University|Yale]] alumni like Henry P. Davison, partner of [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], publicity man Martin Egan and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. banker Dwight Morrow, Henry Luce and Briton Hadden hired Larsen in 1922&amp;nbsp;â although Larsen was a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate and Luce and Hadden were Yale graduates. After Hadden died in 1929, Larsen purchased 550 shares of Time Inc., using money he obtained from selling [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] stock which he had inherited from his father, who was the head of the [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|B.F. Keith]] theatre chain in [[New England]]. However, after Briton Hadden's death, the largest Time Inc. stockholder was [[Henry Luce]], who ruled the media conglomerate in an autocratic fashion, &quot;at his right hand was Larsen,&quot; Time Inc.'s second-largest stockholder, according to &quot;Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923â1941&quot;. In 1929, Roy Larsen was also named a Time Inc. director and a Time Inc. vice-president. J.P. Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks, both over ''Time'' and ''Fortune''. Other shareholders were Brown Brothers [[W. A. Harriman]] &amp; Co., and The New York Trust Company ([[Standard Oil]]).

By the time of Henry Luce's death in 1967, the Time Inc. stock which Luce owned was worth about US$109 million and yielded him a yearly dividend income of more than US$2.4 million, according to ''The World of Time Inc: The Intimate History Of A Changing Enterprise 1960â1989'' by Curtis Prendergast. The value of the Larsen family's Time Inc. stock was now worth about $80 million during the 1960s and Roy Larsen was both a Time Inc. director and the chairman of its Executive Committee, before serving as Time Inc.'s vice-chairman of the board until the middle of 1979. According to the September 10, 1979 issue of ''The New York Times'', &quot;Mr. Larsen was the only employee in the company's history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65.&quot;

After ''Time'' magazine began publishing its weekly issues in March 1923, Roy Larsen was able to increase its circulation by utilizing U.S. radio and [[movie theater]]s around the world. It often promoted both &quot;Time&quot; magazine and U.S. political and corporate interests. According to ''The March of Time'', as early as 1924, Larsen had brought ''Time'' into the infant radio business with the broadcast of a 15-minute sustaining quiz show entitled ''Pop Question'' which survived until 1925.&quot; Then, according to the same book, &quot;In 1928 [...] Larsen undertook the weekly broadcast of a 10-minute programme series of brief news summaries, drawn from current issues of ''Time'' magazine [...] which was originally broadcast over 33 stations throughout the United States.&quot;

Larsen next arranged for a 30-minute radio programme, ''The March of Time'', to be broadcast over CBS, beginning on March 6, 1931. Each week, the programme presented a dramatisation of the week's news for its listeners, thus ''Time'' magazine itself was brought &quot;to the attention of millions previously unaware of its existence,&quot; according to ''Time Inc.: The Intimate History Of A Publishing Enterprise 1923â1941'', leading to an increased circulation of the magazine during the 1930s. Between 1931 and 1937, Larsen's ''The March of Time'' radio programme was broadcast over CBS radio and between 1937 and 1945 it was broadcast over NBC radio&amp;nbsp;â except for the 1939 to 1941 period when it was not aired. ''[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]]'' was based on ''Time'''s People page.

''Time'' became part of [[Time Warner]] in 1989 when Warner Communications and Time, Inc. merged. [[Jason McManus]] succeeded [[Henry Grunwald (editor)|Henry Grunwald]] in 1988 as Editor-in-Chief and oversaw the transition before [[Norman Pearlstine]] succeeded him in 1995.

Since 2000, the magazine has been part of AOL Time Warner, which subsequently reverted to the name Time Warner in 2003.

In 2007, ''Time'' moved from a Monday subscription/newsstand delivery to a schedule where the magazine goes on sale Fridays, and is delivered to subscribers on Saturday.&lt;!--dead link&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4123937.html Chron.com]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The magazine actually began in 1923 with Friday publication.

During early 2007, the year's first issue was delayed for roughly a week due to &quot;editorial changes.&quot; The changes included the job losses of 49 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/news/time-inc./time-inc-layoffs-surveying-the-wreckage-229978.php|title=Time Inc. Layoffs: Surveying the Wreckage|accessdate=December 15, 2007|publisher=Gawker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 ''Time'' announced that they were introducing a personalised print magazine, ''Mine'', mixing content from a range of Time Warner publications based on the reader's preferences. The new magazine met with a poor reception, with criticism that its focus was too broad to be truly personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/04/times-foray-into-personalized-publishing-time-mine/|title=Time's foray into personal publishing|accessdate=December 15, 2007|date=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has an online archive with the unformatted text for every article published. The articles are indexed and were converted from scanned images using [[optical character recognition]] technology. There are still minor errors in the text that are remnants of the conversion into digital format.

On Tuesday May 2 ''Time'' announced that subscribers to its paper magazines including ''Time'', ''Sports Illustrated'' and ''Fortune'' will have access to the iPad versions of these magazines for no extra charge.  European subscribers are excluded from accessing the online version of ''Time'' or becoming online subscribers.  Only the paper addition is available in Europe.

Time Inc. and Apple have come to an agreement wherein subscribers to Time Inc. magazines will be able to read the iPad versions of those magazines for free, at least until the two companies sort out a viable digital subscription model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703703304576296980128055282.html?mod=WSJ_Tech_RightMostPopular WSJ.com, Time Inc. in iPad Deal With Apple]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal controversy===
On September 10, 2007, the [[Indonesian Supreme Court]] awarded former Indonesian President [[Suharto]] [[damages]] against ''Time Asia'' [[magazine]], ordering it to pay him one trillion [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] for [[Defamation|libel]]. The High Court reversed the [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] of the [[Appellate court|Appeal Court]] and [[Central Jakarta]] [[District court|District Court]] (made in 2000 and 2001). Suharto sought more than US$27 billion ($32bn) in the [[Lawsuit|suit]] against US-based ''Time'' over a 1999 article which published that he transferred stolen money abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22396808-5005961,00.html News.com.au, Suharto wins $128m in damages]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}

During the second half of 2009 the magazine saw a 34.9% decline in news stand sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/magazines-newsstand-sales-fall-91-percent/|work=The New York Times|title=Magazines' Newsstand Sales Fall 9.1 Percent|first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|date=February 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first half of 2010, there was another decline of at least one third in ''Time'' magazine sales. In the second half of 2010, ''Time'' magazine newsstand sales declined by about 12% to just over 79 thousand copies per week.

==Style==
The distinctive ''Time'' writing style was parodied in 1936 by [[Wolcott Gibbs]] in an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': &quot;Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind [...] Where it all will end, knows God!&quot;{{citation}} The early days of incessantly inverted sentences, &quot;beady-eyed tycoons&quot; and &quot;great and good friends&quot;, however, have long since vanished.

Up until the mid-1970s or so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' had a weekly section called &quot;Listings&quot;, which contained capsule summaries and/or reviews of then-current significant films, plays, musicals, television programs, and literary bestsellers, much like ''The New Yorker'''s section &quot;Current Events&quot;.

''Time'' is also known for its signature red border, introduced in 1927. The iconic red border was homaged or satirized by Seattle's ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' newspaper in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/great-american-novelist/Content?oid=4940853 |title=Great American Novelist |last=Lin |first=Tao |date=September 21, 2010 |work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|TheStranger.com]] |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The border has only been changed thrice since 1927: The issue released shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States featured a black border to symbolize [[mourning]]. However, this edition was a special &quot;extra&quot; edition published quickly for the breaking news of the event; the next regularly scheduled issue contained the red border. Additionally, the April 28, 2008, [[Earth Day]] issue, dedicated to [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], contained a green border.&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC-TV report by Andrea Mitchell, April 17, 2008, 1:45PM .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- temporary reference; more permanent one to follow --&gt; The most recent change in border was in the September 19, 2011 issue, commemorating the [[Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks|10th anniversary of September 11 attacks]] with a metallic silver border.

In 2007, ''Time'' engineered a style overhaul of the magazine&lt;!--LATTER PART NEEDS A CITE: aimed at appealing to a younger generation--&gt;. Among other changes, the magazine reduced the red cover border in order to promote featured stories, enlarged column titles, reduced the number of featured stories, increased white space around articles, and accompanied opinion pieces with photographs of the writers. The changes have met both criticism and praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Time of Their Lives|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/28976/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does The Redesign of Time Magazine Mean It Has A New Business Model As Well?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2007/03/does_the_redesi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Full Esteem Ahead |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/20/AR2006122001330.html|work=The Washington Post|first=George F.|last=Will|date=December 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special editions==
===Person of the Year===
[[File:Time-magazine-person-of-the-century.jpg|thumb|The editors of the Time have chosen a [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] since 1927. In 1999 [[Albert Einstein]] was named the [[Person of the Century]].]]
{{Main|Time Person of the Year}}
''Time''{{'}}s most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual &quot;Person of the Year&quot; (formerly &quot;Man of the Year&quot;) cover story, in which ''Time'' recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest effect on the year's news. Despite the title, the recipients are not necessarily individuals or even human beings&amp;nbsp;â for instance, in 1982 the &quot;Person&quot; of the Year was the [[Personal Computer]]. [[Albert Einstein]] was chosen by ''Time'' as Person of the Century.

Controversy has occasionally arisen because of the designation of alleged dictators and warmongers as &quot;Persons of the Year&quot;. The distinction is supposed to go to the person who, ''for good or ill'', has most affected the course of the year; it is therefore not necessarily an honor or a reward. In the past, such figures as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] have been Man of the Year.

In 2006 the Person of the Year was designated as [[You (Time Person of the Year)|&quot;You&quot;]], a move that was met with split reviews. Some thought the concept was creative; others wanted an actual person of the year. Editor Stengel reflected that, if it had been a mistake, &quot;we're only going to make it once.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Time of Their Lives|url= http://nymag.com/news/features/28976/|accessdate=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the Person of the Year was [[Barack Obama]], with [[Sarah Palin]] as a runner-up.  Obama is the twelfth U.S. President (or [[President-elect]]) so honored, following a line of every president since [[Franklin Roosevelt]], with the sole exception of [[Gerald Ford]].

===''Time'' 100===
{{Main|Time 100}}

In recent years ''Time'' has assembled an annual list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Originally, they had made a list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. These issues usually have the front cover filled with pictures of people from the list and devote a substantial amount of space within the magazine to the 100 articles about each person on the list. There have, in some cases, been over 100 people, when two people have made the list together, sharing one spot.

The magazine also compiled &quot;All-''TIME'' 100 best  novels&quot; and &quot;[[Time magazine's &quot;All-TIME&quot; 100 best movies|All-''TIME'' 100 best movies]]&quot; lists in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All-''TIME'' 100 Movies|work=Time|first=Richard|last=Corliss|authorlink=Richard Corliss|coauthors=[[Richard Schickel|Schickel, Richard]].|publisher=Time.com|url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies|date=February 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Soundtracks|work=Time|publisher=Time.com|url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/0,23220,soundtracks,00.html|date=February 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1068026,00.html|title=That Old Feeling: Secrets of the All-''Time'' 100|first=Richard|last=Corliss|date=June 2, 2005|publisher=Time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;The 100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME''&quot; in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659192_1652529,00.html|title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME''|first=James|last=Poniewozik|authorlink=James Poniewozik|work=Time|publisher=Time.com|date=September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
