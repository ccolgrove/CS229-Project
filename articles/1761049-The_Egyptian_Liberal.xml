[[Egypt]]'s '''&quot;Liberal Experiment&quot;''' took place between 1924 and 1936.

The [[Wafd Party]] saw independence and constitutional government linked. While the British did not agree with full independence, they certainly liked the idea of European-style constitutional government. The country's first elections for parliament were held in January 1924. [[Saad Zaghlul]], the leader of the Wafd party, was elected [[Prime Minister of Egypt]].

==End of the Liberal Experiment==
Egypt's only attempt to establish parliamentary institutions along European lines was short lived. Reasons suggested for the failure of the Liberal Experiment include:

#'''Nature of the constitution:''' It awarded extensive powers to the king, including the right to appoint the prime minister and dissolve parliament, and so created a weak legislature.
#'''British Interference:''' They continued to undermine the integrity of the parliamentary government.
#'''No compromise:''' Neither the Wafd nor any of the smaller parties adopted the principles of compromise and respect for the opposition that are essential for the proper conduct of constitutional government. 
#'''Continual struggle:''' Politics was not focused on the nation but on the struggle between the Wafd, the monarchy, and the British.
