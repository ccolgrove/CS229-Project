'''Anime Mid-Atlantic''' is an [[anime convention]] held in [[Virginia]], [[USA]], normally '''Fathers Day Weekend''' every June. Founded in 2000, Anime Mid-Atlantic's goal is to provide a place where [[anime]] and [[manga]] fans can gather together and share in their common interest in a festive and fun atmosphere. Those familiar with the convention often refer to it as '''AMA''', for short. 

==Programming==
Typical '''AMA''' programming includes:

* Two or more '''video rooms''' in which [[live action]] Japanese films and anime are shown in various rooms on big screens throughout the convention.  Fan-produced [[anime music video]]s, in which anime film clips are set against the background of a particular song, are also shown.
* '''Panels''' and '''Workshops''' on subjects such as [[voice acting]] or how to draw manga. Expert guests discuss or show tricks of their trade and field questions from the audience.
* A '''Dealers' Room''' in which commercial vendors such as publishers and retailers set up booths and sell their merchandise.
* The '''Artist's Alley''' in which amateur and professional artists may sign up for a table and display, advertise, sell, and auction their artwork.
* A '''[[video game]] room''' in which attendees may play a variety of '''[[Video game console|console]]''', '''[[Arcade game|arcade]]''' and participate in '''[[tournament]]s'''.
* '''[[Cosplay]]''' and '''[[live-action role-playing]]'''.  Many attendees spend most of the convention in costume as their favorite anime, manga, or video game character. Those seeking recognition for their costumes may enter the more private '''Hall Costume Contest''', or may opt for the &quot;big stage&quot; in the formal '''Cosplay''' event, held on Saturday night.
* '''Musical guests''', '''Concerts''', a mock-'''[[rave]]'''-style dance and a '''[[karaoke]]''' competition.
* '''Asian Cultural Events''' have also become a staple of the convention.
* '''Charity Events''' Supporting Charities such as Make A Wish Foundation for a number of years and Save the Children Japan and the Japan Relief Effort in 2011.
