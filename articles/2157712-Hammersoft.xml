In the 1998-1999 season, Nam won the silver medal at the [[1999 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] behind [[Michelle Kwan]]. Although this medal would under normal circumstances have qualified Nam for the team to the World Championships, Nam was not eligible to be sent because she was not old enough. [[Sarah Hughes]], who had placed 4th at Nationals, was sent in her stead. Hughes was also not age-eligible for Worlds, but was allowed to compete at the World Championships because she had won a medal at the [[1999 World Junior Figure Skating Championships]].
