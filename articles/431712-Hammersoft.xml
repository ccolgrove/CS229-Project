'''Daytona International Speedway''' is a [[race track]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]], [[United States]].  Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the [[Daytona 500]], one of the most prestigious races in [[NASCAR]]. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of [[ARCA]], [[AMA Superbike]], [[Grand-Am]] and [[Motocross]]. The track features multiple layouts including the primary {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} high speed [[tri-oval]], a {{convert|3.56|mi|km}} [[sports car]] course, a {{convert|2.95|mi|km}} motorcycle course, and a {{convert|.25|mi|km}} karting and motorcycle flat-track.  The track's {{convert|180|acre|adj=on}} infield includes the {{convert|29|acre|adj=on}} Lake Lloyd, which has hosted [[powerboat]] racing. The speedway is owned and operated by [[International Speedway Corporation]].

The track was built in 1958 by NASCAR founder [[William France Sr.]] to host racing that was being held at the former [[Daytona Beach Road Course]]. His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars. Lights were installed around the track in 1998, and today it is the second largest single lit outdoor sports facility. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 &amp; 2010.

==Track history==
===Construction===
[[NASCAR]] founder [[William France Sr.]] began planning for the track in 1953 as a way to promote the series, which at the time was racing on the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&amp;nbsp;â Tales from 500&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Jim|title=Tales from the Daytona 500|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2003|edition=illustrated|pages=13â14 of 200|chapter=Big Bill's Dream for America's Speed Capital|isbn=1582615306, 9781582615301|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UGbf0A2G10gC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=1959+Daytona+500+qualify#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; France met with Daytona Beach engineer Charles Moneypenney to discuss his plans for the speedway. He wanted the track to have the highest banking possible to allow the cars to reach high speeds and to give fans a better view of the cars on track. Moneypenny traveled to [[Detroit, Michigan]] to visit the [[Ford Proving Grounds]] which had a high speed test track with banked corners. Ford shared their engineering reports of the track with Moneypenney, providing the needed details of how to transition the pavement from a flat straightaway to a banked corner. France took the plans to the Daytona Beach city commission, who supported his idea and formed the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;created&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Aumann|first=Mark|title=How Daytona International Speedway was created|url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/cup/02/04/daytona.500.dis.history/story_single.html|publisher=Nascar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Daytona International Speedway 2011.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Daytona International Speedway following the repaving of the track in 2010]]
The city commission agreed to lease the {{convert|447|acre}} parcel of land adjacent to [[Daytona Beach International Airport]] to France's corporation for $10,000 a year over a 50 year period. France then began working on building funding for the project and found support from a [[Texas]] oil millionaire, Clint Murchison. Murchison loaned France $600,000 along with the construction equipment necessary to build the track. France was also able to secure funding from [[Pepsi-Cola]], [[General Motors]] designer [[Harley Earl]], a second mortgage on his home and selling 300,000 stock shares to local residents. Ground broke on construction of the {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} speedway on November 25, 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;created&quot; /&gt;

To build the high banking, crews had to dig out millions of tons of soil from the tracks infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the hole that was excavated filled with water to form what is now known as Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph Saxton &quot;Sax&quot; Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. 22 tons of [[limerock]] had to be brought in to form the track's [[base course|binding base]], where the [[asphalt]] would be laid on top. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenney had to come up with a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers that were anchored at the top of the banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenney subsequently patented his construction method and later designed [[Talladega Superspeedway]] and [[Michigan International Speedway]]. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;created&quot; /&gt;

The first practice runs on the new track began on February 6, 1959. One February 22, 1959, 42,000 people attended the inaugural Daytona 500.&lt;ref name=&quot;created&quot; /&gt; When the track opened it was the fastest race track to ever host a stock car race, until [[Talladega Superspeedway]] opened 10 years later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Lights were installed around the track in 1998 to run NASCAR's July race, the [[Coke Zero 400]] at night. The track was the worlds largest single lighted outdoor sports facility until being surpassed by [[Losail International Circuit]] in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Musco Lighting]] installed the lighting system, which took into account glare and visibility for aircraft arriving and departing nearby Daytona Beach International Airport, and costs about $240 per hour when in operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;musco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Daytona International Speedway|url=http://www.musco.com/projshow/project.php?id=138+motorsports|publisher=Musco Lighting|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layouts===
====Tri-Oval====
{{See also|List of NASCAR race tracks}}
[[Image:Daytona International Speedway.svg|thumb|left|Map of the speedway]]
Daytona's [[tri-oval]] is {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long with 31Â° banking in the turns and 18Â° banking at the start/finish line.  The front straight is {{convert|3800|ft|m}} long and the back straight (or &quot;superstretch&quot;) is {{convert|3000|ft|m}} long.  The tri-oval shape, was revolutionary at the time as it greatly improved sight lines for fans. It is one of the two tracks on the Sprint Cup Series circuit that uses [[restrictor plate]]s to slow the cars down due to the high speeds, the other being [[Talladega Superspeedway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trackfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Track Facts|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/Track-Facts.aspx|publisher=Daytonainternationalspeedway.com|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2010 repaving of the track began. The repaving came almost a year earlier than planned due to the track coming apart during the [[2010 Daytona 500]]. The project used an estimated 50,000 tons of asphalt to repave {{convert|1400000|sqft|m2}} including the racing surface, apron, skid pads and pit road. Because of good weather, the project was completed ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name=goodyear&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodyear Tire Test on Daytonaâs New Racing Surface Set For Dec. 15â16|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2010/11/Homestead-Miami-Update.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Road courses====
[[Image:Daytona International Speedway - Road Course.svg|thumb|left|Map of the 24-hour road course configuration]]
The {{convert|3.56|mi}} road course was built in 1962 to host a three-hour sports car race called the Daytona Continental.  Eventually the race was extended to a 24-hour endurance race known as the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]]. [[File:2011 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona start.png|thumb|right|Start of the 2011 Rolex 24 at Daytona]] While the more famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] is held near the [[summer solstice]], Daytona's endurance race is held in winter (meaning that more of the race is run at night).  The track's lighting system is limited to 20% of its maximum output for the race to keep cars dependent on their headlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race Profile&amp;nbsp;â 24 Hours of Daytona|url=http://www.sportscardigest.com/race-profile-%E2%80%93-24-hours-of-daytona/|publisher=Sports Car Digest|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daytona International Speedway - Moto Course.png|thumb|left|Map of the Moto-Course]]
In 2005, a second infield road course configuration was constructed, primarily [[Daytona 200|for motorcycles]]. Due to fears of tire wear on the banked oval sections, oval turns 1 and 2 were bypassed giving the new course a length of {{convert|2.95|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Dean|title=Daytona Changes Course|url=http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2004/Aug/040811a.htm|publisher=Superbikeplanet.com|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=August 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 26 and 27, 2006, the [[Indycar Series]] held a compatibility test on the 10-turn, {{convert|2.73|mi|km|sing=on}} modified road course, and the 12-turn {{convert|2.95|mi|km|sing=on}} motorcycle road course with 5 drivers. The drivers who tested at the track were [[Vitor Meira]], [[Sam Hornish Jr.]], [[Tony Kanaan]], [[Scott Dixon]] and [[Dan Wheldon]]. This marked the first time since 1984 that open wheel cars have taken to the track at Daytona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRL Begins Testing at Daytona Road Course|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2006/09/IRL-Begins-Testing-At-Daytona-Road-Course.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 31&amp;nbsp;â February 1, 2007, Indycar returned for a full test involving 17 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndyCar Series Kicks Off Two-Day Test At Daytona |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2007/01/Indycar-Series-Kicks-Off-Two-Day-Test-At-Daytona.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=January 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supercross====
During [[Daytona Beach Bike Week]], a supercross track is built between pit road and the tri-oval section of the track.  Historically the track has used more sand than dirt, providing unique challenges to riders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The 2008, 2009 and 2010 track configurations were designed by former champion, [[Ricky Carmichael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Carmichael Designs Daytona Supercross By Honda Course For Second Straight Year|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2009/01/Ricky-Carmichael-To-Design-Daytona-Supercross-By-Honda-Course-For-Second-Straight-Year.aspx|publisher=Daytona International Speedway|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Daytona Flat Track====
Popular dirt-track races in karting and flat-track motorcycle racing had been held at [[Municipal Stadium (Daytona Beach)|Daytona Beach Municipal Stadium]], but in 2009, the city announced the stadium was replacing its entire surface with [[FieldTurf]], and thereby eliminating the flat-track racing at the stadium. To continue racing, speedway officials built the Daytona Flat Track, a new quarter-mile dirt track outside of Turns 1 and 2 of the main superspeedway.  It seats 5,000 in temporary grandstands and opened in December 2009 for WKA KartWeek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMA FLAT TRACK: DIS To Construct Dirt Track|url=http://moto-racing.speedtv.com/article/ama-flat-track-dis-to-construct-dirt-track/|publisher=Speed|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatalities===
{{Main|List of Daytona International Speedway fatalities}}
A total of 27 people have been fatally injured in the track, with most during auto, motorcycle, and powerboat racing events. Arguably the most notable was [[Dale Earnhardt]], who died February 18, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/earnhardt/list.htm#daytona |title=Auto racing fatalities list |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2001-02-18 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan amenities==
===Sprint Fanzone===
The Sprint Fanzone is an access package similar to pit passes for fans to get closer to drivers and race teams. The fanzone was built in 2004 as part of a renovation of the track's infield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hembree|first=Mike|title=NASCAR fans get in the 'zone' at Daytona International Speedway|url=http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/sprintcupseries/NASCAR_fans_get_in_the_zone_at_Daytona_International_Speedway.html|publisher=Scene|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans are able to walk on top of the garages, known as the &quot;fandeck&quot;, and view track and garage activity. Fans can also view race teams working in the garage, including NASCAR technical inspection, through windows. The garage windows also include slots for fans to hand merchandise to drivers for autographs. The fanzone also includes a live entertainment stage, additional food and drink areas and various other activities and displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprint FANZONE|url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Tickets-Events/Events/2011/Speedweeks-2011/Sprint-FANZONE.aspx|publisher=Daytona international Speedway|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 renovation of the infield, headed by design firm [[HNTB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daytona Speedway|url=http://www.hntb.com/our-work/market/sports#/ajax/project/976|publisher=HNTB|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first major renovation of the infield in the history of the track.&lt;ref name=aia-award&gt;{{cite web|last=Engdahl|first=David|title=Daytona International Speedway Renovation|url=http://info.aia.org/nwsltr_db.cfm?pagename=db_a_200603_engdahl|publisher=American Institute of Architects|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1.  The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and hardscaping, such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and inspection facilities, and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from Design-Build Institute of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;aia-award&quot;/&gt; Following the success of the Sprint Fanzone at Daytona, [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] and [[Kansas Speedway]] each built a similar infield fanzone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Budweiser Party Porch===
The Budweiser Party Porch is a {{convert|46|ft}} high porch located along the backstretch of the track. It is built on top of a portion of the backstretch grandstands and includes a {{convert|277|ft}} wide, {{convert|33|ft}} tall sign, the largest sign in motorsports.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The porch features tables, food and drinks, offering fans a &quot;fun-filled&quot; atmosphere that breaks fans away from the confines of grandstand seating without sacrificing on the view. Below the porch is an interactive fan zone featuring amusement rides, a go-kart track, show cars and merchandise trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budweiser Party Porch Is The Place To Be On The Superstretch For The 52nd Annual Daytona 500|url=http://www.catchfence.com/2010/sprintcup/02/09/budweiser-party-porch-is-the-place-to-be-on-the-superstretch-for-the-52nd-annual-daytona-500/|publisher=The Catchfence|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
