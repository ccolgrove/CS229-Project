'''Immunix''' was a commercial [[operating system]] that provided host-based application [[Computer security|security]] solutions. The last release of Immunix's GNU/Linux distribution was version 7.3 on November 27, 2003. Immunix, Inc. was the creator of [[AppArmor]], an application security system. 

On May 10, 2005, [[Novell]] acquired Immunix, Inc., a long-time partner with Novell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Novell Acquires Immunix, Delivers Industry's Best Application Security for Linux | url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/novell_acquires_immunix_delivers_industrys_best_application_security_for_linux | date=2005-05-10 | publisher=Novell |}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AppArmor]] was one of Novell's primary interests, and as a result, it was adopted by the company and renamed Novell AppArmor powered by Immunix. In September 2007, Novell laid off the [[AppArmor]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Novell lays off AppArmor programmers | url=http://www.news.com/8301-13580_3-9796140-39.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-5 | date=2007-10-10| publisher=CNET |}}&lt;/ref&gt;
