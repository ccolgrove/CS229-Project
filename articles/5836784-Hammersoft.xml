<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="5836784" ns="0" title="List of Haruhi Suzumiya character song singles"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The following music [[Single (music)|singles]] are from the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' sung by the [[seiyÅ«|voice actors]] for the three main female and two main male characters in the series along with four other supporting female characters, making the total number of character albums nine in all. The first three released included songs by [[Aya Hirano]] as [[Haruhi Suzumiya]], [[Minori Chihara]] as [[Yuki Nagato]] and [[Yuko Goto]] as [[Mikuru Asahina]]. Moreover, two additional character CDs were released on December 6, 2006, sung by [[Yuki Matsuoka]] as [[List of characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya series#Tsuruya|Tsuruya]] and [[Natsuko Kuwatani]] as [[List of Haruhi Suzumiya characters#Ryoko Asakura|RyÅko Asakura]]. Two more character CDs were released on January 24, 2007, sung by [[Sayaka Aoki (voice actress)|Sayaka Aoki]] as [[List of characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya series#Kyon's Sister|Kyon's Sister]]&lt;ref name=Imouto&gt;''[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=LACM-4341 cdjapan.co.jp for Kyon's Sister's CD]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Shiratori]] as [[List of characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya series#Emiri Kimidori|Emiri Kimidori]].&lt;ref name=Emiri&gt;''[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=LACM-4342 cdjapan.co.cp for Emiri Kimidori's CD]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the CDs for [[Itsuki Koizumi]] and [[Kyon]] were released on February 21, 2007.

Each of the nine singles feature the ending theme song &quot;Hare Hare Yukai&quot;. Other than the three main female character's versions which are solo cover versions of the original, there are some alterations. For Tsuruya's version as well as RyÅko's version, the lyrics were changed to fit the character; Tsuruya's version contains her [[catch phrase]] &quot;nyoro&quot;, while RyÅko reverses the optimistic lyrics to convey futility and destruction. However, while Tsuruya's and RyÅko's versions have the same arrangements as the original version, the last four released have their arrangements changed along with the lyrics. Kyon's Sister's version is very upbeat; Emiri's version is very fact-based; Itsuki's version talks about his [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]; and Kyon reflects about his now-disturbed life in his version.
