Their first album [[Rebelde (album)|Rebelde]], was released on November 30, 2004 by EMI. The main writers and producers for the project were Carlos Lara (aka D.J. Kafka) and Max di Carlo. The first three singles (&quot;[[Rebelde (song)|Rebelde]]&quot;, &quot;[[Solo quÃ©date en silencio|SÃ³lo QuÃ©date En Silencio]]&quot; and &quot;[[SÃ¡lvame]]&quot;) were all number one hits in Mexico, with the fourth single, &quot;[[Un poco de tu amor|Un Poco De Tu Amor]]&quot; reaching number two.

Rebelde sold well in the United States, reaching #95 on the Billboard 200 and reaching number two on the Latin Albums chart.
