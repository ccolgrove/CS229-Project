'''ARccOS''' (Advanced Regional Copy Control Operating Solution) is a [[copy-protection]] system made by [[Sony]] that is used on some [[DVD]]s. Designed as an additional layer to be used in conjunction with [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS), the system deliberately creates corrupted [[Cylinder-head-sector|sectors]] on the DVD, which cause copying software to produce errors (see [[bad sector]]).

Despite being promoted as &quot;fully compatible with available DVD players and drives,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ARccOS | url = http://www.sonydadc.com/americas/prod.newtech.arccos1.go | accessdate = 2007-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some DVDs with ARccOS cannot be played on some DVD players:  Sony DVPCX995, Toshiba SD4700, Harman Kardon DVD101, Microsoft Xbox and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sony copy protection taking heat again: now DVDs won't play | author = Erik Hanson | work = engadget | date = 2007-04-16 | url = http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/16/sony-copy-protection-taking-heat-again-now-dvds-wont-play/ | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sony has announced a future firmware update for their players to fix this incompatibility issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sony Pictures DVDs have a new a copy protection that makes the movies unplayable on some Sony (and other makes) DVD players! | date = 2007-04-19 | url = http://sonystrikesagain.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/hello-world/ | accessdate = 2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sony admits, fixes problem with DVD DRM | author = Jacqui Cheng | date = 2007-04-18 | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070418-sony-to-replace-incompatible-dvds.html | accessdate = 2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One revision of the ARccOS scheme used by Sony was incompatible with a higher number of players than average.  Sony has offered to replace those discs for owners having problems; the replacement discs will have a newer version of ARccOS coding on them, which Sony claims is more compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sony fixes problem with ARccOS-protected DVDs | author = Adrian Kingsley-Hughes | date = 2007-04-18 | url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=360 | accessdate = 2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sony Replaces ARccOS-Protected DVDs | date = 2007-04-19 | url = http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=20244 | accessdate = 2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some DVD rental companies have warned users that the Sony DVDs in question may not play on their machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Netflix ARccOS Warning | url = http://www.netflix.com/FAQ?p_faqid=2462 | accessdate = 2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[DVD Ripper]]s have been designed to overcome ARccOS protection, it is also naturally overcome by using [[ddrescue]], a linux utility designed to copy images with errors.
