The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[San Francisco 49ers]] season''' was the franchise's 63rd season. Although they failed to reach the playoffs for the straight 6th year, the team improved on their disappointing 5-11 record from the 2007 season, and ended the season on a high note

==Offseason==

Despite a disappointing season in 2007, [[Mike Nolan]] was retained as head coach. With the 49ers offense struggling the previous season, [[offensive coordinator]] [[Jim Hostler]] was fired and replaced by [[Mike Martz]]. In addition, [[Scot McCloughan]] was promoted from vice president of player personnel to [[general manager]]. Mike Nolan was fired after a 29-17 loss to the [[New York Giants]] in Week 8.

I want people that want to win.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = TSN|title = SINGLETARY FIRED BY 49ERS AFTER TWO DISAPPOINTING SEASONS|date = December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
