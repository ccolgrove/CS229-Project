==History==
105.5 originally went on the air in the Atlantic-Cape May market in 1985 as WBNJ. WBNJ was an adult contemporary station that by 1989 had evolved into a new age-style station marketed as &quot;Joy 105.5.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 1992, WBNJ tried flipping to several other formats, including an MOR format for a few months, followed by a country format branded as &quot;Hit Country 105.&quot; When neither of these caught on, WBNJ began simulcasting another station further north in the market, [[WTTH|96.1 WTTH The Touch]], based in Margate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In February 1999, WBNJ changed call letters and flipped to a Dance/Rhythmic A/C station known as WZBZ, &quot;The Buzz 105.5.&quot; Don Brooks, owner and general manager, hired Ted Noah in January 1999 to launch the radio station in its new dance format. It was Noah's first official full-time on air position and programming job at 19 years old. Noah programmed and directed The Buzz musically and was also the afternoon announcer for the first 3 years. The station operated in Atlantic City right in front of The Tropicana Casino. Ironically its signal reached the actual broadcast facilities, even though its broadcast tower served the extreme southern end of the Atlantic City/Cape May market, mainly covering Cape May, Southern and Western Atlantic and Eastern Cumberland Counties its first year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2000, WBNJ began using sister station [[WZBZ|99.3 WSAX]] as a simulcast. Then, the station, while keeping the Buzz name, switched formats to Rhythmic Top 40.&lt;ref&gt;http://formatchange.com/1055-wbnj-becomes-dance-chr-wzbz-b1055-the-buzz/&lt;/ref&gt;  105.5's call letters, WZBZ, moved to 99.3; 105.5 became WGBZ. 99.3 became the originating station while 105.5 was now the simulcast frequency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2002, WGBZ, along with all its sister stations WZBZ, [[WMID]] and [[WAIV|WMID-FM]], were purchased by the competition, Equity Communications, owner of then-rival CHR station [[WAYV]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2007, WGBZ's call letters were changed to the current WSNQ.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Call Sign History |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=40031&amp;Callsign=WSNQ |work=FCC Media Bureau CDBS Public Access Database |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2008, The Buzz became 99.3 KissFM and becan playing more of a CHR format. 105.5 WSNQ continues to broadcast a simulcast of WZBZ. However, the WSNQ call sign and 105.5 frequency are very rarely used in station promotion, aside from the top of the hour legal ID.
