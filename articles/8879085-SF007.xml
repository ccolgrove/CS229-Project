'''Mobile broadband''' is the marketing term for [[wireless]] [[Internet access]] through a [[portable modem]], [[mobile phone]] (called &quot;cell phones&quot; in North America and South Africa) or other mobile device.

==Description==
Although [[broadband]] has a technical meaning, the phrase &quot;mobile broadband&quot; is a [[wireless carrier]] marketing term for [[Internet access]]. [[Bit rate]]s of broadband support voice and video as well as other data access.&lt;ref name=&quot;ergen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Mobile Broadband: including WiMAX and LTE |publisher= Springer Science+Business Media |year= 2009 |author= Mustafa Ergen |isbn= 978-0-387-68189-4 |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-68189-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}
Devices that provide mobile broadband to [[mobile computing|mobile computers]] include: [[PC card]]s also known as ''PC data card '' or [[Connect card]]s, [[USB modem]]s, [[USB stick]]s often called &quot;dongles&quot;, and portable devices with built-in support for mobile broadband (like [[notebook]]s, [[netbook]]s and [[Mobile Internet Device]]s. Notebooks with built-in mobile broadband modules are offered by many laptop manufacturers.

The [[GSM Association]] of telecommunication manufacturers, mobile phone producers, [[integrated circuit]] manufacturers and notebook manufacturers have joined forces to push built-in support for mobile broadband technology on notebook computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mark&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Service mark: The global technology identifer |publisher= GSM Association |url= http://www.gsmworld.com/our-work/mobile_broadband/service_mark/index.htm |accessdate= July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association established a [[service mark]] to identify devices that include Internet connectivity with devices not usually associated with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;mark&quot;/&gt;

North America refers to mobile phones as cell phones.&lt;!-- the networks of both are &quot;cellular&quot;, see next sentence --&gt; However all non-satellite mobile access technologies are cellular designs, but only CDMA-1 (EVDO related), GSM (GPRS/EDGE), UMTS/WCDMA/3G/FOMA/T-CDMA (HSPDA, HSUPA, HSPA, HSPA+) were originally intended for voice telephone calls. LTE and Mobile WiMax are data only, using VOIP for voice. Flash-OFDMA, IPW (derived from CDMA) and iBurst are also Data only networks. In theory also you could have an ERAN based EDGE2 network with no GPRS or GSM voice. Voice and SMS pays for the mobile phone networks.

Various network standards may be used, such as [[GPRS]], [[3G]], [[WiMAX]], [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]], [[Flash-OFDM]], IPW, iBurst [[UMTS]]/[[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[EV-DO]] and some portable [[Satellite Internet access|satellite-based]] systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ergen&quot;/&gt;
However mostly the term refers to EVDO (sister system to CDMA-1), EDGE on GSM and HSPDA/HSUPA/HSPA on UMTS/3G/Foma. Such systems piggyback on the mobile phone infrastructure (EDGE, HSPA etc. actually share spectrum with voice calls, which have priority). The actual &quot;non-Mobile Phone&quot; Mobile networks are very small subscriber base (Mobile WiMax, iBurst, Flash-OFDMA, IPW and portable Satellite terminals) compared to fixed wireless broadband. A common vendor tactic is to quote the peak speed for the entire channel. This capacity can be shared among other users, or limited in other ways as the network becomes more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Is Mobile &quot;midband&quot; in Ireland Destroying broadband Infrastructure? |work= Ireland Offline opinion piece |date= August 29, 2009 |url= http://irelandoffline.org/2009/08/is-mobile-midband-in-ireland-destroying-broadband-infrastructure/ |accessdate= July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:3G With USB cable.jpg|thumb|[[Huawei]] [[CDMA2000]] [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] USB wireless modem model E226]]
 
In 2002, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) established a Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) working group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= IEEE 802.20 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |url= http://ieee802.org/20/ |work= Working group web site |accessdate= July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed the [[IEEE 802.20]] standard in 2008, with amendments in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= IEEE 802.20 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |url=http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.20.html |work= Official standard |publisher= [[IEEE Standards Association]] |accessdate= July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another working group, [[IEEE 802.16]], produced standards adopted in products using the [[WiMAX]] trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IEEE Approves IEEE 802.16m - Advanced Mobile Broadband Wireless Standard |date= March 31, 2011 |url= http://standards.ieee.org/news/2011/80216m.html |publisher= IEEE Standards Association |accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A barrier to mobile broadband was the coverage the mobile phone networks can provide. In many areas customers will not be able to achieve the speeds advertised due to mobile data coverage limitations.  In addition, there are issues with connectivity, network capacity, application quality, and mobile network operators' overall inexperience with data traffic.&lt;ref&gt;DPI and Mobile Broadband White Paper; http://www.thetanetworks.com/resources/white-papers&lt;/ref&gt; 

Demand from emerging markets fueled growth in mobile broadband . Without a widespread fixed line infrastructure, many emerging markets leapfrog developed markets and use mobile broadband technologies to deliver high-speed internet access to the mass market. 

The global Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) family of standards - which includes GSM, EDGE, WCDMA, HSPA and LTE â is the most widespread way to deliver mobile broadband. 3GPP standards are serving about 90 percent of the worldâs mobile subscribers.{{citation needed |date= July 2011}}

After mobile broadband subscribers hit 500 million in 2010, at the end of 2011 [[Ericsson]] predicted it will be doubled to a billion. 400 million come from Asia Pacific region, followed by North America and Western Europe with more than 200 million subscriptions each.&lt;ref&gt;Mobile broadband subscriptions to bypass 1bn in 2011 http://www.siliconrepublic.com/comms/item/19891-mobile-broadband-subscripti/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], a steering group known as [[Digital Britain]] was set up, with the aim of promoting digital telecommunications in October 2008. The conclusion of the steering group was a recommendation that the government took up, namely to have 100% broadband coverage, with a minimum speed of 2[[Mbps]] in the United Kingdom by the year 2012. Mobile &quot;broadband&quot; using 3G is not now expected to be able to ensure 2Mbit/s broadband coverage to the more remote areas of the UK as coverage is too poor and contention too high. Another suggestion is Ka Satellite for Rural areas, which may be very cheap by the end of 2010 if Eutelsat's [[KA-SAT]] is successfully launched. There is also a smaller Ka Sat in 2010 from [[Avanti Communications|Avanti]]. However Satellite latency is about 790ms.{{fact|date=November 2011}}
