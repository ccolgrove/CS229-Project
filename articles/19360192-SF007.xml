The original '''[[Microsoft Windows]] Entertainment Pack''' ('''WEP''') is a collection of simply-designed [[16-bit]] computer games for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. These games were somewhat unusual for the time, in that they would not run under [[MS-DOS]]. Many of the games (still compatible with [[Windows XP]]) were later released in the [[Best of Windows Entertainment Pack]].  There were four Entertainment Packs in the original series. All games being 16-bit run on modern 32-bit versions of Windows but not on 64-bit Windows, except through a virtual machine.

** &lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt; Bundled in some later versions of Windows

==GameSampler==
For much of the early 1990s, the Gamesampler, a subset of the Entertainment Pack called small enough to fit on a single [[Floppy_disk#The_3.C2.BD-inch_microfloppy_diskette|high-density disk]], was shipped as a free eleventh disk added to a ten-pack of [[Verbatim Corporation|Verbatim]] blank 3.5&quot; microfloppy diskettes. Games on the sampler included Jezzball, Rodent's Revenge, Tetris, and Skifree. A &quot;Best of&quot; disk of several of the games was also available at times as a mail-in premium from [[Kellogg's]] cereals.

==32-bit versions==
In the copies of [[Windows NT 4.0]] and [[Windows 2000]] source code which leaked back in 2004, there are 32-bit versions of Cruel, Golf, Pegged, Reversi, Snake (Rattler Race), Taipei and TicTactics. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2004/2/15/71552/7795/119#119 We Are Morons: a quick look at the Win2k source] &lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Freecell]] and [[Minesweeper (Windows)|Minesweeper]] have had official 32-bit versions bundled even with early versions of [[Windows NT]]. The original game developers of some of the games such as SkiFree &lt;ref&gt; [http://ski.ihoc.net/ The most officialest SkiFree homepage] &lt;/ref&gt;, TriPeaks &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.rhogue.com/tripeaks/tripeaks.htm TriPeaks Homepage] &lt;/ref&gt;, WordZap &lt;ref&gt; [http://wordzap.com/downloads.asp#Classic Classic WordZap] &lt;/ref&gt; now offer 32-bit versions. Third party developers have also created 32-bit freeware clones of Klotski &lt;ref&gt; [http://phil.freehackers.org/klotski/ Klotski homepage] &lt;/ref&gt;, TetraVex &lt;ref&gt; [http://delphi.about.com/od/gameprogramming/a/tetravex.htm Tetravex Game in Delphi] &lt;/ref&gt; Rodent's Revenge &lt;ref&gt; [http://web.archive.org/web/20070822075641/http://www.emu8086.com/vb/rodent.html Rodent's Revenge 2000] &lt;/ref&gt;, JezzBall &lt;ref&gt; [http://gametop.com/download-free-games/jezzball/ J-Ball] &lt;/ref&gt;, and Tetris. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.crystaloffice.com/games/ CrystalOffice Games] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Port to the Game Boy Color==
A [[multicart]] containing seven games was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] as simply Microsoft Entertainment Pack. Four of the games on the multi-cart were ported from Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack, while the remaining three were ported from other Microsoft Entertainment Pack compilations.

Games found on the GBC Microsoft Entertainment Pack mult-cart:

* Tut's Tomb
* TriPeaks
* FreeCell
* TicTactics&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* Minesweeper&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* Life Genesis&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* SkiFree

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Not included in the original Best of Windows Entertainment Pack.&lt;/small&gt;
