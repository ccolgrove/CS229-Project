[[Sharon Wise]], is Co-Chairman of the Party &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.migop.org/news.asp?artid=221]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Its [[Republican National Committee|National Committee]] Members are [[Saul Anuzis|Saulius &quot;Saul&quot; Anuzis]] and [[Holly Hughes (politician)|Holly Hughes]].

==History and notable Michigan Republicans==
The Republican Party was born in the early 1850s by anti-slavery activists and individuals who believed that government should grant western lands to settlers free of charge. The first informal meeting of the party took place in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]], a small town northwest of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, WI]]. The first official Republican meeting took place on July 6, 1854 in [[Jackson, Michigan]] with [[David S. Walbridge]] serving as chairman. The name &quot;Republican&quot; was chosen because it alluded to equality and reminded individuals of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. At the Jackson convention, the new party adopted a platform and nominated candidates for office in Michigan.

In 1856, the Republicans became a national party when [[John C. Fremont]] was nominated for [[President of the United States]] under the slogan: &quot;Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Fremont.&quot; Even though they were considered a &quot;third party&quot; because the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] represented the two-party system at the time, Fremont received 33% of the vote. Four years later, [[Abraham Lincoln]] became the first Republican to win the [[White House]].  (For continued history [http://www.gop.com/About/AboutRead.aspx?AboutType=3])

Republicans have been elected [[List of Governors of Michigan|Governor of Michigan]] 27 out of 48 elections.  The first was [[Kingsley Bingham]] in 1855 and the most recent is the current governor [[Rick Snyder]].

[[Image:Gerald Ford.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Gerald R. Ford]], the 38th U.S. President, grew up in [[Grand Rapids, MI]].]]
[[Gerald R. Ford]] was the only Republican [[U.S. President]] and also the only Republican [[U.S. Vice President]] from Michigan.  He was also the longest living President in U.S. History who died at the age of 93, only surpassing [[Ronald Reagan]] by 45 days.  He is the only President born in Nebraska, as well as the only President to be buried in Michigan, aling with his wife, [[Betty Ford|Betty]].

[[Thomas W. Ferry]] was the first Republican from Michigan to become [[president pro tempore of the Senate]] (1875â79).  [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] was the second (1947â49) as well as the longest serving Republican U.S. Senator from Michigan at 23 years.  None have been a [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|U.S. Sentate party leader]] from Michigan.

In 1857, [[Zachariah Chandler]] was the first Republican to serve as [[United States Congressional Delegations from Michigan|U.S. Senator from Michigan]] (Class 1).  Two years later, he served alongside fellow Republican [[Kinsley Bingham]] (Class 2).  The GOP would continue being elected to serve alongside each other until 1923.  The last time two Republicans were simultaneous U.S. Senators from Michigan was from 1953-55 with [[Homer Ferguson]] and [[Charles E. Potter]].  The last Republican to serve as a U.S. Senator from Michigan was [[Spencer Abraham|E. Spencer Abraham]] who left office in 2001.

No Republican Michigander has ever been [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] or House Majority Leader.

Gerald R. Ford is the only Republican [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] (1965â69) from Michigan.

In 1855, [[William A. Howard]] [[Michigan's 1st congressional district|(1st district)]], [[Henry Waldron]] [[Michigan's 2nd congressional district|(2nd district)]], and [[David S. Walbridge]] [[Michigan's 3rd congressional district|(3rd district)]] became the first three Republicans to serve in the [[United States Congressional Delegations from Michigan|U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan]].  Republicans were seated in all Michigan congressional districts during these years: 1857-59, 1860â63, 1865â71, 1873â75, 1879â83, 1895â97, 1899â1903, 1905â11, 1921â23, and 1925-33.

[[Roy O. Woodruff]] served 32 years in the U.S. House, the longest as a Republican from Michigan.

[[Ruth Thompson]] of [[Whitehall, Michigan|Whitehall]] was the first woman to represent Michigan in Congress and the first woman to serve in the [[U.S. House Judiciary Committee]].

The only [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] from Michigan who was appointed by a Republican President ([[Benjamin Harrison]]) was [[Henry Billings Brown]]. Zachariah Chandler and Arthur E. Summerfield are the only Michiganders to become [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]].
