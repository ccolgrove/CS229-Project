'''Africa''' is the world's second largest and second most populous [[continent]], after [[Asia]]. At about 30.2 million kmÂ² (11.7 million sq&amp;nbsp;mi) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of the [[Earth]]'s total surface area and 20.4% of the total land area.&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;Sayre, April Pulley. (1999) ''Africa'', Twenty-First Century Books. ISBN 0-7613-1367-2.&lt;/ref&gt; With 1.0 billion people (as of 2009, see [[#Territories and regions|table]]) in 61 territories, it accounts for about 14.72% of the [[world]]'s [[human]] [[population]].

The continent is surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, both the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] along the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to the northeast, the [[Indian Ocean]] to the southeast, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The continent has 56 [[sovereign states]], which includes [[Madagascar]] and various island groups, and two [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognised countries]].

Africa, particularly central [[Eastern Africa]], is widely regarded within the [[scientific community]] to be the origin of [[human]]s and the [[Hominidae]] [[clade]] ([[great ape]]s), as [[evidence]]d by the discovery of the earliest [[hominids]] and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago â including ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|A. afarensis]]'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'', ''[[Homo habilis|H. habilis]]'' and ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]'' â with the earliest ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' (modern human) found in [[Ethiopia]] being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.utah.edu/unews/releases/05/feb/homosapiens.html Homo sapiens: University of Utah News Release: Feb. 16, 2005]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa straddles the [[equator]] and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern [[temperate]] to southern temperate zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Etymology==

[[Afri]] was a Latin name used to refer to the [[Carthaginians]] who dwelt in [[North Africa]] in modern-day [[Tunisia]]. Their name is usually connected with [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''afar'', &quot;dust&quot;, but a 1981 hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber language|Berber]] word ''ifri'' or ''ifran'' meaning &quot;cave&quot; and &quot;caves&quot;, in reference to cave dwellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;book on ligne&quot;&gt;The Berbers, by Geo. Babington Michell, p 161, 1903, Journal of Royal African people [http://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 book on ligne]&lt;/ref&gt; Africa or Ifri or Afer&lt;ref name=&quot;book on ligne&quot;/&gt; is the name of [[Banu Ifran]] from [[Algeria]] and [[Tripolitania]] ([[Berber people|Berber]] Tribe of [[Yafran]]).&lt;ref&gt;Itineraria Phoenicia, Edward Lipinski, Peeters Publishers, pÂ 200, 2004, ISBN 90-429-1344-4 [http://books.google.fr/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=Itineraria+Phoenicia+Ifren&amp;sig=opSH-an97IhmB6GtJjMvn7bt4tc#PPA200,M1 book on line]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of [[Africa Province]], which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Consultos.com etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin suffix &quot;[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]&quot; can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''Celtica'' from ''[[Celts|Celtes]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim kingdom of [[Ifriqiya]], modern-day [[Tunisia]], also preserved a form of the name.

Other etymological hypotheses that have been postulated for the ancient name &quot;Africa&quot;:
* the 1st century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Latin]] word ''aprica'' (&quot;sunny&quot;) mentioned by [[Isidore of Seville]] in ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2.
* the Greek word ''aphrike'' (ÎÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ®), meaning &quot;without cold.&quot; This was proposed by historian [[Leo Africanus]] (1488â1554), who suggested the Greek word ''phrike'' (ÏÏÎ¯ÎºÎ·, meaning &quot;cold and horror&quot;), combined with the [[privative]] prefix [[alpha privative|&quot;a-&quot;]], thus indicating a land free of cold and horror.
* Massey, in 1881, derived an etymology from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', &quot;to turn toward the opening of the Ka.&quot; The [[Egyptian soul#Ka (life force)|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and &quot;opening of the Ka&quot; refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, &quot;the birthplace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm |title='Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey' |publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk |date=1907-10-29 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* yet another hypothesis was proposed by MichÃ¨le Fruyt in ''Revue de Philologie'' 50, 1976: 221â238, linking the Latin word with ''africus'' 'south wind', which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally 'rainy wind'.

The [[Irish name|Irish female name]] ''{{lang|ga|Aifric}}'' is sometimes [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as ''Africa'', but the given name is unrelated to the [[geonym]].

===Paleohistory===
[[File:Massospondylus BW.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The African prosauropod ''[[Massospondylus]]''.]]
At the beginning of the [[Mesozoic Era]], Africa was joined with Earth's other continents in [[Pangaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; Africa shared the [[supercontinent]]'s relatively uniform fauna, which was dominated by [[theropods]], [[prosauropods]] and primitive [[ornithischians]] by the close of the [[Triassic period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; Late Triassic fossils are found through-out Africa, but are more common in the south than north.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; The boundary separating the Triassic and [[Jurassic]] marks the advent of an extinction event with global impact, although African strata from this time period have not been thoroughly studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot;&gt;Jacobs, Louis L. (1997). &quot;African Dinosaurs.&quot; ''Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs''. Edited by Phillip J. Currie and Kevin Padian. Academic Press. pp. 2â4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early Jurassic]] [[Stratum|strata]] are distributed in a similar fashion to [[Late Triassic]] beds, with more common outcrops in the south and less common fossil beds which are predominated by tracks to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; As the Jurassic proceeded, larger and more iconic groups of [[dinosaurs]] like [[sauropods]] and [[ornithopods]] proliferated in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; [[Middle Jurassic]] strata are neither well represented nor well studied in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; Late Jurassic strata are also poorly represented apart from the spectacular [[Tendaguru]] fauna in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; The Late Jurassic life of Tendaguru is very similar to [[Paleobiota of the Morrison Formation|that]] found in western North America's [[Morrison Formation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt;

Midway through the [[Mesozoic]], about 150â160 million years ago, [[Madagascar]] separated from Africa, although it remained connected to [[India]] and the rest of the [[Gondwanan]] landmasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; Fossils from Madagascar include [[abelisaur]]s and [[titanosaur]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Spinosaurus BW2.png|thumb|left|200px|The African theropod ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' was the largest known carnivorous dinosaur.]] Later into the [[Early Cretaceous]] epoch, the India-Madagascar landmass separated from the rest of Gondwana.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; By the Late Cretaceous, Madagascar and India had permanently split ways and continued until later reaching their modern configurations.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt;

By contrast to Madagascar, mainland Africa was relatively stable in position through-out the Mesozoic.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; Despite the stable position, major changes occurred to its relation to other landmasses as the remains of Pangea continued to break apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; By the beginning of the Late Cretaceous epoch [[South America]] had split off from Africa, completing the southern half of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; This event had a profound effect on global climate by altering [[ocean currents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt;

During the Cretaceous, Africa was populated by [[allosauroids]] and [[spinosaurids]], including the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; [[Titanosaurs]] were significant herbivores in its ancient [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; Cretaceous sites are more common than Jurassic ones, but are often unable to be dated radiometrically making it difficult to know their exact ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt; Paleontologist Louis Jacobs, who spent time doing field work in Malawi,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}&lt;!-- Cite his book &quot;Quest for African dinosaurs here&quot; --&gt; says that African beds are &quot;in need of more field work&quot; and will prove to be a &quot;fertile ground ... for discovery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-african&quot; /&gt;

Africa is considered by most [[paleoanthropologist]]s to be the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on [[Earth]], with the [[human]] [[species]] [[mitochondrial Eve|originating]] from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1058484.stm Genetic study roots humans in Africa], BBC News | SCI/TECH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070828155004.htm Migration of Early Humans From Africa Aided By Wet Weather], sciencedaily.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the middle of the 20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago. Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into modern man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[radiometrically dated]] to approximately 3.9â3.0&amp;nbsp;million years [[Before Christ|BC]]),&lt;ref&gt;Kimbel, William H. and Yoel Rak and Donald C. Johanson. (2004) ''The Skull of Australopithecus Afarensis'', Oxford University Press US. ISBN 0-19-515706-0.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'' (c. 2.3â1.4&amp;nbsp;million years BC)&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, Colin. (2002) ''The Variety of Life.'', Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-860426-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' (c. 1.9&amp;nbsp;millionâ600,000 years BC) have been discovered.&lt;ref name=Sayre /&gt;

Throughout humanity's [[prehistory]], Africa (like all other continents) had no [[nation state]]s, and was instead inhabited by groups of [[hunter-gatherers]] such as the [[Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan van Sertima|van Sertima, Ivan]]. (1995) ''Egypt: Child of Africa/S V12 (Ppr)'', Transaction Publishers. pp. 324â325. ISBN 1-56000-792-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mokhtar, G. (1990) ''UNESCO [[General History of Africa]], Vol. II, Abridged Edition: Ancient Africa'', University of California Press. ISBN 0-85255-092-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eyma, A. K. and C. J. Bennett. (2003) ''Delts-Man in Yebu: Occasional Volume of the Egyptologists' Electronic Forum No. 1'', Universal Publishers. p. 210. SBN 1-58112-564-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Ice Age]]s, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the [[Sahara]] had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the [[Second Cataract]] where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and [[Eastern Africa]]. Since this time dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa, and increasingly during the last 200 years, in [[Ethiopia]].

The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gathering cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC cattle were already domesticated in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1999) &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York:Norton, pp.167.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals including the [[donkey]], and a small screw-horned goat which was common from [[Algeria]] to [[Nubia]].
In the year 4000 BC the climate of the Sahara started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp.22â23&lt;/ref&gt; This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot; /&gt;

By the first millennium BC [[ironwork]]ing had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin and O'Meara. &quot;Africa, 3rd Ed.&quot; Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995. [http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology]&lt;/ref&gt; and by 500 BC metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. [[Copper]] objects from [[Egypt]], North Africa, Nubia and [[Ethiopia]] dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that [[trans-saharan trade]] networks had been established by this date.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot; /&gt;

[[European exploration of Africa]] began with [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In 332 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] was welcomed as a liberator in [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Persian-occupied Egypt]]. He founded [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/EGYPT/PTOLEMY.HTM |title=Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt: 332 BC-395 AD |publisher=Wsu.edu |date=1999-06-06 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the [[Roman Empire]], the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. [[Africa Province|Roman settlement]] occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. [[Christianity]] spread across these areas from Palestine via Egypt, also passing south, beyond the borders of the Roman world into [[Nubia]] and by at least the 6th century into [[Ethiopia]].

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Ummayad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic center of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists and philosophers. During the above mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.&lt;ref name =Ayoub&gt;{{cite book

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[Bushmen|San]] people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people of central and southern Africa, heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]], the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]], and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo people]] (also misspelled as Ibo) in West Africa, and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[East Africa]].

By the 9th century a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Gao]], and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]]. Ghana declined in the 11th century but was succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]] which consolidated much of western Sudan in the 13th century. Kanem accepted Islam in the 11th century.

In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew up with little influence from the [[Islam|Muslim]] north. The [[Kingdom of Nri]] of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] was established around the 9th century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest Kingdom in modern day [[Nigeria]] and was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]]. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate [[Igbo Ukwu#Bronzes|bronzes]], found at the town of [[Igbo Ukwu]].

Until the 15th century these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.

===Height of slave trade===

Between the 15th and the 19th centuries (500 years), the [[Atlantic slave trade]] took an estimated 7â12 million slaves to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Welcome to EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica's Guide to Black History], ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1523100.stm Focus on the slave trade], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=5t5ERBlosqUC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22muslim+slave+trade%22&amp;sig=XSpyahikSAcJv9wxLcLOJxylVL4 ''Transformations in Slavery: A History of Slavery in Africa''] p 25 by Paul E. Lovejoy&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[West Africa]], the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Sailing against slavery. By Jo Loosemore] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against &quot;the usurping King of [[Lagos]]&quot;, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS |title=The West African Squadron and slave trade |publisher=Pdavis.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of &quot;legitimate commerce&quot; in the form of [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[timber]] and [[gold]], forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian L. (1995) ''State of Humanity'', Blackwell Publishing. p. 175. ISBN 1-55786-585-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers engaged in a major [[scramble for Africa|territorial scramble]] and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: [[Ethiopia]] (known to Europeans as &quot;Abyssinia&quot;), and [[Liberia]]. [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt &lt;!-- the fate of Sudan and its administrative status under British rule differed from those of Egypt --&gt; was effectively under British administration [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|until 1922]].

===Berlin Conference===
The [[Berlin Conference]] held in 1884â85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to bring an end to the [[Scramble for Africa]] by European powers by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.

===Independence struggles===
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ltzav890zpIC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=tunisia+morocco+independance+1956&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=M-AVTafIN4is8QPWosSDBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Lucien BÃ©ly, '&amp;#39;History of France'&amp;#39;.

Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognised as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===
Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which still have the borders drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'Ã©tat|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of [[Ethnic nepotism|marginalization of ethnic groups]], and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed force|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.

[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]], also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by funding insurgency movements. There was a [[1984â1985 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist/Soviet policies made the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia | date=2000-04-06 | accessdate=2010-01-01 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Patman, ''The Soviet Union in the Horn of Africa'' 1990, ISBN 0-521-36022-6, pp. 295â296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Varnis, ''Reluctant aid or aiding the reluctant?: U.S. food aid policy and the Ethiopian Famine Relief'' 1990, ISBN 0-88738-348-3, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the [[Second Congo War]]. By 2008, this conflict and its aftermath had killed 5.4 million people. Since 2003 there has been an ongoing [[Darfur war|conflict in Darfur]] which has become a humanitarian disaster. [[AIDS in Africa|AIDS]] has also been a prevalent issue in post-colonial Africa.

In the 21th century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have lead to a great increase in forreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly finally ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economomies are among the world's fasted growing as of 2011.

According to the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Africa lay to the west of [[Egypt]], while &quot;Asia&quot; was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85â165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the [[Suez Canal|isthmus of Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of ''Africa'' expanded with their knowledge.

Geologically, Africa includes the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; the [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran and the [[Anatolian Plateau]] of Turkey mark where the [[African Plate]] collided with Eurasia. The [[Afrotropic ecozone]] and the [[Saharo-Arabian Region|Saharo-Arabian desert]] to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] unites the north linguistically.

===Climate===
[[Image:Africa satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A map of Africa showing the ecological break around the [[Sahara desert]]]]
{{Main|Climate of Africa}}

The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]] or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] [[plain]]s and very dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions. In between, there is a convergence where vegetation patterns such as [[sahel]], and [[steppe]] dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth; drylands and deserts comprise 60% of the entire land surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html &quot;Africa: Environmental Atlas, 06/17/08.&quot;] [http://www.africa.upenn.edu African Studies Center], University of Pennsylvania.

===Fauna===
[[Image:NgoroNgoro Crater, Tanzania, Africa.jpg|thumb|240px|Savanna at [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]]]
{{Main|Fauna of Africa}}

Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and &quot;range of freedom&quot; of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of &quot;jungle&quot; animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. In addition, Africa has the largest number of [[megafauna]] species, as it was least affected by the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna]].

===Ecology===
[[Deforestation]] is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 Deforestation reaches worrying level â UN]. AfricaNews. June 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest every year, which is twice the average deforestation rate compared to the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;/&gt; Some sources claim that deforestation has already destroyed roughly 90% of the original, virgin forests in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/features/10278 Forests and deforestation in Africa â the wasting of an immense resource]. afrol News.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago, [[Madagascar]] has lost more than 90% of its original forest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/at/at0118.html Terrestrial Ecoregions â Madagascar subhumid forests (AT0118)], National Geographic.&lt;/ref&gt; About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nature-laid-waste-the-destruction-of-africa-844370.html Nature laid waste: The destruction of Africa]. The Independent. June 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodiversity==
Africa has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves and 80 wetlands reserves.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;/&gt; Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;/&gt; Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threatens biodiversity in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;/&gt; This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;/&gt;

==Politics==
{{See also|List of political parties in Africa by country}}
There are clear signs of increased networking among African organisations and states. For example, in the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.

===The African Union===
[[Image:Map of the African Union with Suspended States.svg|thumb|upright|Map of the African Union with suspended states highlighted in light green.]]
{{Main|African Union}}
The African Union (AU) is a 54 member federation consisting of all of Africa's states except [[Morocco]]. The union was formed, with [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]] as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002&lt;ref name=&quot;African Union 2002&quot;&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a successor to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in [[Addis Ababa]]. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.

The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Political associations such as the [[African Union]] offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[CÃ´te d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's [[poverty|poorest]] and most [[Human Development Index|underdeveloped]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include the spread of deadly [[disease]]s and [[virus]]es (notably [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]), [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla]] warfare to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sandbrook, The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1985 passim&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]]' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 25 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/], [[United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poverty]], [[illiteracy]], [[malnutrition]] and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent.

From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably [[Angola]], [[Sudan]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], all three of which had recently begun extracting their [[petroleum]] reserves or had expanded their [[oil extraction]] capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the worldâs [[cobalt]], 90% of its [[platinum]], 50% of its [[gold]], 98% of its [[chromium]], 70% of its [[tantalite]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200802070635.html Africa:  Developed Countries' Leverage On the Continent]&quot;.

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the [[NigerâCongo languages|NigerâCongo]] family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking farmers from West Africa's inland savanna progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''&quot;.

Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also &quot;San&quot;, closely related to, but distinct from &quot;[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]&quot;) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa.

The peoples of [[North Africa]] comprise two main groups: [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking peoples in the west, and [[Egyptians]] and [[Libyans]] in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century introduced the [[Arabic language]] and [[Islam]] to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Berbers still make up the majority in [[Morocco]], while they are a significant minority within [[Algeria]]. They are also present in [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm Q&amp;A: The Berbers]. BBC News.

Some [[Ethiopia]]n and [[Eritrea]]n groups (like the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrayans]], collectively known as [[Habesha people|Habesha]]) speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, while the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] speak languages from the [[Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic.

European colonization also brought sizable groups of [[Asian people|Asians]], particularly people from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and East African countries. The large [[Indians in Uganda|Indian community in Uganda]] was [[Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|expelled]] by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] are an [[Austronesian people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Cape Coloured]]s (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of [[Demographics of Lebanon#The Lebanese diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Africa&quot;/&gt; have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce]&quot;, By Naomi Schwarz, VOANews.com, July 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
{{Main|Languages of Africa}}
[[File:Languages of Africa map.svg|thumb|250px|left|Map showing the distribution of the various language families of Africa.]]

By most estimates, well over a thousand [[language]]s ([[UNESCO]] has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8048&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Africa

Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa.
* The [[Afro-Asiatic languages|''Afro-Asiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by [[Nilotic]] tribes in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[NigerâCongo languages|''NigerâCongo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 120,000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. [[Italian language|Italian]] is spoken by some in former [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colonies]] in Africa. Prior to World War I, [[German language|German]] was used in certain areas also.

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of Africa}}
Some{{Which?|date=June 2010}} aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practiced in recent years as a result of years of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalourise African traditional cultures, under such movements as the [[African Renaissance]], led by [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Afrocentrism]], led by a group of scholars, including [[Molefi Asante]], as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and other forms of spirituality. In recent years, traditional African culture has become synonymous with rural poverty and subsistence farming.

===Visual art and architecture===
[[African art]] and [[African architecture|architecture]] reflect the diversity of African cultures. The oldest existing examples of art from Africa are 82,000-year-old [[bead]]s made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells that were found in the [[Aterian]] levels at Grotte des Pigeons, Taforalt, Morocco.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the [[world's tallest structure]] for 4,000 years, until the completion of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] around the year 1300. The stone ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] are also noteworthy for their architecture, and the complexity of [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia, of which the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]] is representative.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Africa}}
[[Image:Namibia Rugby Team.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia rugby team]]]]
Egypt has long been a cultural focus of [[Arab World|the Arab world]], while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[samba]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[rock music|rock]]. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Highlife]] music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. [[Arab]] influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, [[Western culture#Widespread influence|Western influences]] are apparent due to [[colonisation]].

===Sports===
Fifty-three African countries have [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]], while Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so. According to FIFA ranking, Egypt currently has the best soccer team in Africa. Their team has won the African Cup 7 times, and a record-making 3 times in a row.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team in [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] and has attained permanent [[One Day International|One-Day International]] status. The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa and Namibia.

However, according to [[Encyclopedia Britannica]], 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims and less than 15% continue to follow traditional [[African traditional religion|African religions]]. A small number of Africans are [[Hindu]], [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith|Baha'i]], or have beliefs from the [[Judaism|Judaic tradition]]. Examples of [[Jews and Judaism in Africa|African Jews]] are the [[Beta Israel]], [[Lemba people]]s and the [[Abayudaya]] of Eastern Uganda.
