'''Le Marais''' (&quot;The Marsh&quot;, {{IPA-fr|maÊÉ}}) is a historic district in [[Paris]], [[France]]. Long the aristocratic district of Paris, it hosts many outstanding buildings of historic and architectural importance. It spreads across parts of the [[IIIe arrondissement|3rd]] and [[IVe arrondissement|4th]] [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissement]]s in Paris (on the [[Rive Droite]], or Right Bank, of the [[Seine]]).

==History==
===Paris aristocratic district===
In 1240 the [[Order of the Temple]] built its fortified church just outside Paris' walls, in the northern part of the Marais. The [[Order of the Temple|Temple]] turned the district into an attractive area, and many religious institutions were built nearby: the des Blancs-Manteaux, de Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie and des Carmes-Billettes [[convent]]s, as well as the church of Sainte-Catherine-du-Val-des-Ãcoliers. 

During the mid-13th century, [[Charles I of Anjou]], King of [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]], and brother of King [[Louis IX of France]] built his residence near the current nÂ°7 rue de SÃ©vignÃ©.&lt;ref&gt;This hÃ´tel remained until [[1868]]. The rue du Roi-de-Sicile is named after it.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1361 the King [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] built a mansion known as the HÃ´tel Saint-Pol in which the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]] settled during his reign as well as his son's.  

From that time to the 17th century and especially after the ''Royal Square'' (''Place Royale'', current ''[[place des Vosges]]'') was designed under King [[Henri IV]] in [[1605]], the Marais was the French nobility's favorite place of residence. French [[nobles]] built their urban [[mansions]] there&lt;ref&gt;[[HÃ´tels particuliers]] in French&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[HÃ´tel de Sens]], the [[HÃ´tel de Sully]], the [[HÃ´tel de Beauvais]], the [[HÃ´tel Carnavalet]], the [[HÃ´tel de GuÃ©nÃ©gaud]], and the [[HÃ´tel de Soubise]].

===Jewish community===

After the nobility started to move to the [[Faubourg Saint-Germain]], the district became a popular and active commercial area, hosting one of Paris' main [[Jewish]] communities.
At the end of the 19th century and during the first half of the 20th, the district around the [[rue des Rosiers]], refers to as the''&quot;[[Pletzl]]&quot;'', welcomed many Eastern European Jews ([[Ashkenazi]]) who reinforced the district clothing specialization. But, during World War II the Jewish community was targeted by the [[Nazis]] who were occupying France.

The [[rue des Rosiers]] is still a major centre of the Paris Jewish community, which has made a renewal since the 1990s. Public notices announce Jewish events, bookshops specialize in Jewish books, and numerous restaurants and other outlets sell [[kosher]] food. 

The [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue|synagogue]] on 10 [[rue PavÃ©e]], not far from [[rue des Rosiers]], is a strong religious centre. It was designed in 1913 by Art Nouveau architect [[Hector Guimard]], famous for having designed several [[Paris Metro]] stations.

===Post-War Rehabilitation===
By the 1950s, the district had become a working-class area and most of its architectural masterpieces were in bad state of repair. In 1964, General de Gaulle's Culture Minister [[Andre Malraux]] made the Marais the first ''secteur sauvegardÃ©'' (Literally ''secured area''). These were meant to protect and conserve places of special cultural significance. The following decades, the government and the Parisian municipality have led an active restoration and [[Rehabilitation Policy]]. 

The main [[HÃ´tels particuliers]] have been restored and turned into museums: the [[Hotel Sale|HÃ´tel SalÃ©]] hosts the Picasso Museum, the [[HÃ´tel Carnavalet]] hosts the Paris Historical Museum, the HÃ´tel Donon hosts the Cognac-Jay Museum etc. The site of Beaubourg, the western part of Marais, was chosen for the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], France's national Museum of Modern Art and one of the world's most important cultural institutions. The building was completed in [[1977]] with revolutionary architecture by [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Richard Rogers]].

===Today's Marais===

The Marais is now one of Paris' main localities for art galleries. Following its rehabilitation, the Marais has become a fashionable district, home to many trendy restaurants, fashion houses, and hype galleries. 

The neighbourhood has experienced a growing [[gay]] presence since the 1980s, as evidenced by the existence of many gay cafÃ©s, nightclubs, cabarets and shops. These establishments are mainly concentrated in the southwestern portion of the Marais, many on or near the streets Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie and Rue des Archives.

The Marais is also known for the strong Chinese community it hosts. The community began during [[World War I]]. At that time, France needed workers to replace its at-war soldiers and China decided to send a few thousands of its citizens on the condition that they would not take part of the war. After the 1918's victory, some of them decided to stay in Paris, specifically living around the current rue au Maire. Today, most work in [[jewelery]] and leather-related products. The Marais' Chinese community has settled in the north of the district, particularly in the surrounding of [[Place de la RÃ©publique]]. Right next to it, on the [[rue du Temple]], is the Chinese Church of Paris.

Other features of the neighbourhood include the [[MusÃ©e Picasso]], the house of [[Nicolas Flamel]], the [[MusÃ©e Cognacq-Jay]], the [[MusÃ©e Carnavalet]] and the new and very popular [[CafÃ© Charlot]].
