It was written by [[Rose Marie McCoy]] and [[Charles Singleton (songwriter)|Charles Singleton]], also known as Charlie Singleton.&lt;ref&gt; This appears to be the co-writer of &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; and other hits. See [[Talk:Trying to Get To You]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.com/search/ BMI Repertoire]: Charles Singleton is identified by CAE/IPI #40561413; the composer's works are split between two lists at BMI.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally recorded by the rhythm and blues outfit [[The Eagles (rhythm and blues group)|The Eagles]] in 1954 and released in mid-1954 on [[Mercury Records]] 70391.&lt;ref&gt;http://users.pandora.be/davidneale/elvis/originals/list9.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.originals.be/en/originals.php?id=6478 Arnold Rypens, history of Trying To Get To You]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.telenet.be/davidneale/elvis/originals/list9.html#S78672 David Neale, origin of Trying To Get To You]&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising in ''Billboard'' magazine indicates that the format of the title on The Eaglesâ record was âTryinâ To Get To Youâ, with an apostrophe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?cd=1&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES&amp;q=%22tryin%27+to+get+to+you%22+eagles&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_coll2=+issn%3A0006-2510+ Mercury Records advertising in ''Billboard'' magazine, 10 &amp; 17 July, 1954, archived pages at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley recorded five versions of the song. The first on March 23, 1955 and the second on July 11, 1955, with the second session being released during his lifetime. He also recorded live versions of the song on ''[[Elvis (NBC TV Special)]]'', ''[[Elvis: As Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis]]'', and ''[[Elvis in Concert (album)|Elvis in Concert]]''. On the earlier version that appeared on the 1999 album ''[[Sunrise (Elvis Presley album)|Sunrise]]'', Presley recorded this song while simultaneously playing the piano (and not aided by his rhythm guitar, as previously believed). Because his piano playing was not up to the expected standards, producer [[Sam Phillips]] erased the 
sound of the piano on the master take so, in addition to Elvisâ tantalizing vocals,  all one hears is the lead guitar, the bass and  the drums.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, ''[[Sunrise (Elvis Presley album)|Sunrise]]'', [[RCA Records]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Elvisâ piano is heard on the July session version and appeared on his self-titled 1956 LP.  Presleyâs vocal delivery appears to be influenced by that of The Eaglesâ lead singer,&lt;ref name=&quot;usenet&quot;&gt;[http://groups.google.com.au/group/rec.music.rock-pop-r+b.1950s/browse_thread/thread/748d2537f7f8782c?hl=en&amp;q=eagles+%22trying+to+get+to+you%22+mercury MP3 (1954 R&amp;B) Eagles - Trying To Get To You]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=iUQyBYhGPZsC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=eagles+%22trying+to+get+to+you%22 Michael Hicks, ''Sixties Rock'', 2002, p.148]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100823151 ''Lady Writes The Blues: The Life Of Rose McCoy''], text and audio at NPR website&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Scotty Moore]]âs guitar solo on the Presley recording replaces a saxophone solo heard on the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;usenet&quot;/&gt;

The track was released on Presleyâs March 1956 RCA debut album ''[[Elvis Presley (album)|Elvis Presley]]''. It also featured on the famous 1976 ''[[The Sun Sessions]]'' release and on numerous other Elvis efforts and collections as well.

âTrying To Get To Youâ was next recorded by [[Roy Orbison]] in April 1956 as Je-Wel JE-101 backed with âOoby Doobyâ on the B-side.&lt;ref&gt;http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/o/orbi1000.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
A version by [[Johnny Carroll]] also then ensued,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/artists/jcarroll.htm&lt;/ref&gt; being made on [[Decca Records]] on May 19, 1956 (Decca 9-29940).&lt;ref&gt;http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/c/carr5800.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d00/616.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rick Nelson]] and [[Roy Orbison]] were the next to give their own treatments of the song.

After [[Eric Burdon]] performed it a few times on his own shows he reunited with [[The Animals]] in late 1983 and recorded the song in the studio. It appeared on their album ''[[Ark (The Animals album)|Ark]]'' but was retitled âTrying To Get Youâ. It was also included on their live shows before they disbanded again in early 1984.

Later it was also covered by [[Faith Hill]], [[Susie Arioli]], [[Gene Summers]] and many others.
