'''''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare''''' is a 2007 [[first-person shooter]] video game, developed by [[Infinity Ward]] and published by [[Activision]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]]. A [[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (Nintendo DS)|handheld game]] was made for the [[Nintendo DS]]. The game was released in North America, Australia, and Europe in November 2007 for video game consoles and Windows. It was released for the Mac in September 2008, then released for the Wii in November 2009, given the subtitle ''Reflex Edition''. It is the fourth installment in the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' video game series, excluding [[expansion pack]]s, and is the first in the ''Modern Warfare'' line of the franchise, followed by a direct sequel, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' as well as the first game in the series to have a Mature rating. The game breaks away from the [[World War II]] setting of previous games in the series and is instead set in modern times. ''Call of Duty 4'' was in development for two years. It uses a proprietary [[game engine]]. On September 10, 2009, it was re-released in Japan by [[Square Enix]].

The story takes place in the year 2011, where a radical leader has executed the president of an unnamed country in the [[Middle East]], and an &quot;[[Ultranationalism|Ultranationalist]]&quot; movement starts a [[civil war]] in Russia. The conflicts are seen from the perspectives of a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|U.S. Reconnaissance Marine]] and a [[Special Air Service|British SAS commando]], and are set in multiple locations, including [[Credenhill]] in the UK, the Middle East, [[Azerbaijan]], Russia, and [[Pripyat, Ukraine]]. The [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] portion of the game features various [[game mode]]s, and contains a leveling system that allows the player to unlock additional weapons, weapon attachments, and camouflage schemes as they advance.

Critically acclaimed, the game received an aggregated score of 94% from both [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]]. The gameplay and story received particular praise, while criticism targeted the failure of the game to substantially innovate the first-person shooter genre. The game won numerous awards from gaming websites, including [[IGN]]'s Best Xbox 360 Game. It was the top-selling game worldwide for 2007, selling around seven million copies by January 19 and over thirteen million by May 2009.

==Gameplay==
As opposed to earlier games in the [[Call of duty series|''Call of Duty'' series]], the game features modern equipment and new features, many exclusive to the multiplayer part of the game, such as &quot;killstreaks&quot;; killing a number of enemies without the player dying in between kills allows access to various assets including airstrikes and helicopter support. A character can be positioned in one of three stances: standing, crouching, or prone; each affecting the character's rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage. As such, there are no armor or health power ups. When the character has taken damage, the edges of the screen glow red and the character's heartbeat increases. If the character stays out of fire, the character can recover. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, a marker indicates the direction of the grenade, helping the player to either flee or toss it back to the enemy.

===Campaign===
The player takes on the role of various characters during a single-player campaign. The characters' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game. As such, the player's perspective changes from one character to another between missions. Each mission features a series of objectives; the player is led to each objective with the [[HUD (video gaming)|heads up display]], which marks its direction and distance. Some objectives require that the player arrives at a checkpoint, while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. After the credits, a special epilogue mission is unlocked for play, featuring a four-man squad retrieving a VIP from terrorists who have hijacked an airliner. The SAS rescue the VIP and escape before the plane is destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Official Strategy Guide|author=[[BradyGames]] |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[BradyGames]] |isbn=0-7440-0949-9 |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0744009499|unused_data=ISBN status=May be invalid â please double check }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplayer===
[[File:Call Of Duty 4 MP Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A player completes the objective of a Domination multiplayer game by [[Capture the flag#Software and games|capturing and defending 3 flags]].]]
''Call of Duty 4'' features team-based and [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]]-based [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes on various maps. Each [[Game mechanic#Game modes|mode]] has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;cod4-pc&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare|developer=[[Infinity Ward]]|date=2007-11-06|publisher=[[Activision]]|language=[[English language|English]]|version=1.0|platform=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can call in [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] [[reconnaissance]] scans, air strikes, and attack helicopters, when they achieve three-, five-, and seven-enemy kill streaks respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt; A game ends when either a team or player has reached a predefined number of points, or the allotted time expires in which case the team or player with the most points wins. If the points are even when the time expires, Sudden Death mode is activated in which there is no re-spawning and the team who either has the last man standing, or achieves the objective first are the winners. If the player is in either of the two matches, then there is an Overtime match, in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;cod4-pc&quot; /&gt;

The player's performance in the multiplayer mode is tracked with [[experience point]]s, which can be earned by killing opposing players, completing challenges, completing objectives, or by completing a round or match. As the player gains experience, they advance in level, unlocking new weapons, perks, challenges, and gameplay modes. The highest obtainable level is 55, but on the console versions of the game, the player has the option to enter &quot;Prestige&quot; mode, which returns their level to one and removes all accumulated unlockables. This process can be repeated up to 10 times with a different insignia being given each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-17|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/xbox360/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/cheatsheet|title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Cheats, Codes, Hints, Tips |work=[[Yahoo! Games]] |publisher=Yahoo! Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completing a challenge grants [[experience point]]s and may unlock weapon attachments. As a player's level increases by gaining experience points within online games, it unlocks new weapons, perks, or challenges. As the player advances in levels, they earn the ability to customize their classes; this includes selecting their main weapon, side arm and special grenade type. Additionally, the player can select 3 perks, one from each of the three &quot;Tiers&quot;, that can customize their character further. Perk effects include, but are not limited to, extra ammunition, increasing bullet damage by the player, or dropping a live [[grenade]] when the player is killed. The player is also given the choice to complete challenges in order to receive even more experience points; challenges include achieving a certain number of kills with a specific weapon, shooting down a helicopter or performing a number of head shots. Additionally, when the player attains a certain amount of headshots with a specific weapon, excluding sidearms, the player unlocks extra weapon &quot;camos&quot;, or camouflage, to use for that specific weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Characters===
{{main|List of characters in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare}}
During the single player campaign, the player controls six different characters from a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player assumes the role of recent [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Air Service]] recruit Sgt. John &quot;Soap&quot; MacTavish for most of the game, starting with his enrollment in the 22nd SAS Regiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamespyplot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/833211p1.html|title=GameSpyâ COD4 Plot|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sgt. Paul Jackson is part of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|USMC 1st Force Recon]] deployed to the Middle East, and the player controls Jackson's character during five levels of Act 1. Cpt./Lt. John Price (voiced by actor [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) is an SAS officer who is playable in two flashback missions from 1996. Yasir Al-Fulani is the [[president]] of the unnamed Middle Eastern country in the game, and is playable only in the game's opening credit sequence before he is executed. The player also assumes the role of an American thermal-imaging TV operator aboard an [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]] gunship during one level, and a British SAS counter-terrorist operative infiltrating a hijacked airliner to save a VIP in the &quot;Mile High Club&quot; level.&lt;ref name=&quot;cod4-pc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamespyplot&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign review&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/832/832599p1.html | title = Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review | accessdate = 2008-03-17| last = Goldstein | first = Hilary | date = 2007-11-08 | work=IGN Xbox 360 | publisher = [[IGN|IGN Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's [[Non-player character|non-playable characters]] (NPCs) feature prominently in the story. [[Captain Price (Call of Duty)|Captain John Price]] (in his NPC capacity) and his right-hand man, Gaz (voiced by [[Craig Fairbrass]]), serve as mentors to Soap. Jackson's USMC platoon is led by [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Vasquez (voiced by [[David Sobolov]]) and Staff Sgt. Griggs (voiced by and modeled after Infinity Ward lead animator Mark Grigsby); Griggs later accompanies MacTavish in Russia. Sgt. Kamarov leads the Russian Loyalists that ally with the SAS and USMC forces. &quot;Nikolai&quot; is a Russian informant who helps the SAS. Captain MacMillan is Price's mentor and [[commanding officer]] during the flashback to the assassination attempt on Zakhaev.

The antagonists in the story are: Imran Zakhaev, the leader of the Russian Ultranationalist party and the main antagonist of the game; Khaled Al-Asad, the commander of the revolutionary forces in the [[Middle East]] and an ally of Imran Zakhaev; and Victor Zakhaev, the son of Imran Zakhaev and a priority figure in the Ultranationalist party.&lt;ref name=&quot;cod4-pc&quot; /&gt;

--&gt;
The game starts with Sgt. John &quot;Soap&quot; MacTavish arriving for his first day with the British SAS at a training camp in [[Credenhill]], Hereford in the [[UK]]. There, he trains for a cargo ship raid in the CQB, or &quot;Killing House&quot;. During the actual mission, located in the [[Bering Sea]], Soap, Captain Price, Gaz, and several SAS members attempt to find a nuclear device on board. As they clear the ship of the hostile crew, the ship is fired on by Russian MiGs and begins to sink. The team escapes with the cargo manifest, which provides evidence of ties between the Russian Ultranationalist Party and a rebel faction in the [[Middle East]]. 

Russian Ultranationalist leader Imran Zakhaev, who plans to return his motherland to the times of the [[Soviet Union]], draws international attention away from his plans by funding a [[coup d'Ã©tat]] in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, organized by a local separatist leader named Khaled Al-Asad. Discovering the plot, the American government starts a [[police action]] to stop the uprising, while the SAS continues to operate in Russia. After President Al-Fulani of the Middle Eastern country is executed on live TV and Al-Asad takes control, the SAS rescue their compromised informant, Nikolai, from Ultranationalist forces.

During the American invasion of the Middle Eastern country, a platoon from the [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|USMC 1st Force Recon]], led by Lt. Vasquez, searches for Al-Asad but are too late and only secure a television station broadcasting Al-Asad's plan. They then proceed to aid other American units who are fighting a battle against the separatists. During the final stages of the operation, [[United States Central Command]] learns of Al-Asad's position in the capital but is also notified by [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|SEAL Team Six]] of a Russian [[nuclear weapon]] nearby and sends the [[Nuclear Emergency Support Team]] to disarm it. Meanwhile Vazquez's squad stays behind to rescue the pilot of a downed [[AH-1 Cobra]] that was providing them with fire support. Despite being able to save the pilot, the nuclear device suddenly [[Effects of nuclear explosions|detonates]], leveling most of the city, killing most of the US invasion force. Jackson's squad's helicopter is caught in the blast, killing everyone on board. &lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT INSERT ORIGINAL RESEARCH OR SPECULATION ABOUT THE FATE OF THE OTHER HELICOPTER CREW MEMBERS, OR THE METHOD BY WHICH JACKSON DIES. PLEASE REVIEW WP:NOR AND WP:SYN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. --&gt;

The British then learn that Al-Asad fled the country before the American invasion and is hiding in a safe house in [[Azerbaijan]]. With the help of Nikolai's intel and assistance from Loyalist Russian soldiers, the SAS clear the village of the Ultranationalist forces, then capture and interrogate Al-Asad at his safehouse. Shortly into the interrogation, Al-Asad's phone begins to ring. After hearing the voice of the person calling Al-Asad's phone, Captain Price executes Al-Asad, now knowing that Zakhaev is Al-Asad's backer. Price then tells the story of a mission to eliminate Zakhaev in [[Pripyat, Ukraine]], 15 years earlier. 

In the aftermath of the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985â1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], Zakhaev took advantage of the turmoil to profit from [[nuclear proliferation]], and used his new wealth to lure soldiers from the [[Red Army]] to form his Ultranationalist Party. In 1996, Price was paired with Captain MacMillan, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] SAS captain, to carry out a [[Black operation|black op]] [[assassination]] of Zakhaev. After sneaking into Pripyat and hiding in an abandoned hotel, Price shot Zakhaev with a [[Barrett M82]] sniper rifle, but Zakhaev survived, losing his left arm. MacMillan was injured by a crashing helicopter after he and Price shot it down. Price then carried MacMillian to the exfil point, defending it from attack by Ultranationalist soldiers until the [[Casualty evacuation|evac]] helicopter arrived.

Back in the present day, a joint operation is conducted by Price's SAS unit, a USMC Force Recon unit led by Staff Sgt. Griggs, and Loyalist Russian forces led by Kamarov, to stop Zakhaev. They attempt to capture his son Victor in an unnamed Russian city, to learn of Zakhaev's whereabouts, but as they corner him on the roof of an apartment building, Victor commits suicide to avoid being captured. Zakhaev becomes enraged, blaming Western nations for the death of his son, and plans to retaliate by launching ICBMs armed with nuclear warheads at the East Coast of the [[United States]], with predicted losses of over 41 million people. When the operatives arrive at the facility in [[Russia]], Zakhaev manages to launch [[ICBM]]s towards the United States. However, the squad successfully seizes the silo command room and remote detonates the missiles over the [[Atlantic]]. They then escape the facility in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.

Before the squad can escape across a nearby bridge it is destroyed by an [[Mi-24 Hind]], leaving them trapped. Zakhaev's forces arrive and engage the remaining members of the strike force. Gaz receives a call from Kamarov informing him that his forces are on their way to help. On the bridge a gas tanker behind them explodes, incapacitating everyone, except Griggs, who is killed while trying to pull Soap to safety. Zakhaev, along with two of his soldiers, walks through the squad executing them, killing Gaz and several others. Before he reaches Soap and Price, however, he is distracted by the destruction of his gunship and the arrival of the Loyalist helicopters. As Zakhaev fires at the Loyalist helos, Price slides his [[Colt 1911|M1911 pistol]] to Soap, who shoots and kills Zakhaev and his two guards. When Sgt. Kamarov and his team arrive Soap is [[Medical evacuation|evacuated]] to safety, while a Russian medic attempts to resuscitate Price.

''Call of Duty 4'' was developed by a team of a hundred people, over the course of two years. After ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', the [[Infinity Ward]] team decided to move away from the [[World War II]] environment of previous games in the series. This resulted in two game concepts: ''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''. While developing the story for ''Call of Duty 4'', Infinity Ward chose to avoid referencing current, real-life wars, and keep the series' common theme of two opposing forces of similar strength. To enhance the realistic feel of the game, the development team attended a live-fire exercise at [[Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms]], a training facility in the California desert. This helped the developers to simulate the effects of being near an Abrams tank when it fires. The team also talked with United States Marines who were recently in combat to get a feel for the background, emotions, and attitude of Marines in combat. Veterans were also recruited to supervise [[motion capture]] sessions and the [[artificial intelligence]] design of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamedev&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer]]|month=March | year=2008|title=Infinity Ward's Call of Duty 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Infinity Ward set two goals to achieve while developing the game: build a better multiplayer, and --&gt;

The development team designed the online multiplayer component to be balanced and rewarding for new players while still offering something for experienced players. An early idea to implement air support (air strikes and attack helicopters) involved players fighting over special zones to access a trigger for air support against enemies. This idea was discarded because it discouraged the type of deathmatch gameplay they intended. The kill streak reward system was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills. Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting. Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch gamesâthe developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well. Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI-178&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| author= Game Informer Staff| publication-date= February 2008| title=The Art of FPS Multiplayer Design| periodical=[[Game Informer]]| publication-place= | publisher=Cathy Preston| issue=178| pages=20â21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
Most of the music for ''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'' was written by British composer [[Stephen Barton]], who had also contributed to [[film score]]s by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]]. Gregson-Williams also composed music for the game, such as the main theme. Several music tracks from the game are available on Infinity Ward's &quot;7 Days of Modern Warfare&quot; website, and some are available at Barton's own web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-21|url=http://www.music4games.net/Music_Display.aspx?p1=644|title=Music|publisher=[[Music4Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rap song played during the end credits is performed by ''Call of Duty 4''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s lead animator, Mark Grigsby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-30|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1584526/20080331/id_0.jhtml|title='Call Of Duty 4' End-Credits Song: The Story Behind The Rap, In GameFile |publisher=MTV|date=2008-04-01|author=Totilo, Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game engine===
[[File:Cod4 game engine.png|thumb|A scene from ''Modern Warfare'' displaying the game's graphics quality.]]
''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'' runs on the [[IW engine]], specifically IW 3.0, featuring true world-dynamic lighting, [[High dynamic range rendering|HDR lighting effects]], dynamic shadows and [[depth of field]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ign au&quot; /&gt; Bullet penetration is calculated by the engine, taking into account factors such as surface type and entity thickness. The game runs in a [[Display resolution|native resolution]] of 600p on the Xbox 360 and PS3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Chad | last=Lakkis | title=Infinity Ward Asked About COD4 Sub-HD Resolution Concerns | date=2007-11-22 | publisher=ripten | url =http://www.ripten.com/2007/11/22/infinity-ward-asked-about-cod4-sub-hd-resolution/ | work =ripten | accessdate = 2008-06-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain objects, such as cars and some buildings, are destructible. This makes distinguishing [[Cover (military)|cover]] from concealment important, as the protection provided by objects such as wooden fences and thin walls do not completely protect players from harm. Bullet  stopping power is decreased after penetrating an object, and the decrease is dependent on the thickness and surface type of the object. The game makes use of a dynamic [[physics engine]], not implemented in previous ''Call of Duty'' titles. Death animations are a combination of pre-set animations and [[ragdoll physics]]. Console versions of ''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'' run at a consistent 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]], and the Wii version runs at 30 frames per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign au&quot;&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-03-17 |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/796/796451p1.html |title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare AU Interview |work=IGN Xbox 360 |publisher=[[IGN|IGN Entertainment]] |date=2007-06-13 |last=Shea |first=Cam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code was included to determine [[Spawning (computer gaming)|spawning points]] based on the nearby weapons and the relationship between enemy positions and [[Line of sight (gaming)|line of sight]] to the points. The various criteria are meant to minimize players dying immediately after rejoining a match, or being &quot;spawn-killed&quot; due to players simply waiting for others to &quot;respawn&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI-178&quot;/&gt;

The game engine has also been used for the development of two other [[Activision]] games. An enhanced version of the original engine was used in ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'', the fifth installment in the ''Call of Duty'' series after ''Call of Duty 4'',&lt;ref name=&quot;COD5 details&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Robinson, Andy |publisher=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=2008-06-09|accessdate=2008-06-09|title=News: Call of Duty: World at War â first details in OXM|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=190547}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a slightly altered version has been used for the [[James Bond]] video game ''[[007: Quantum of Solace (video game)|Quantum of Solace]]'' as well as [[GoldenEye 007 (2010 video game)|GoldenEye 007]] using a heavily modified version.&lt;ref name=&quot;QOS joystiq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/09/new-bond-game-quantum-of-solace-runs-on-cod4-engine-launching-w/|title=New Bond game Quantum of Solace runs on COD4 engine, launching with movie|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2008-05-09|publisher=Joystiq|author=Ross Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and release==
On April 27, 2007, the day before the release of the game's official trailer, Infinity Ward launched a website called &quot;Charlie Oscar Delta&quot; to provide information on the game. Charlie Oscar Delta features a ranking system that allows users to complete missions to increase their rank and compete for prizes. Charlie Oscar Delta is derived from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] and the initials of ''Call of Duty''.&lt;ref name=&quot;release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/activision-gets-streetwise-on-charlie-oscar-delta/?biz=1|title=Activision Gets StreetWise on Charlie Oscar Delta|accessdate=2008-04-21|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|date=2007-11-12|author=Radd, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail versions===
The game was released as a standard version and a collector's edition. The Collector's Edition contains the standard retail game and a DVD containing a [[documentary film]] entitled &quot;Great SAS Missions,&quot; which consists of archive footage of the SAS in action and accounts from former SAS members. The DVD contains a &quot;[[Making-of|making of]]&quot; featurette and a level walkthrough by the developers. Also included is a limited edition poster and an exclusive hardcover art book featuring never-before-seen concept, development, and final artwork. These elements were packaged in a larger cardboard version of the standard retail box. The collector's edition was originally only available in the US, but was later released in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-21|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/951/951053.html|title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (Limited Collector's Edition) |work=IGN Xbox 360 |publisher=[[IGN|IGN Entertainment, Inc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Game of the Year&quot; edition was later released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The PlayStation 3 version included the Variety map pack on the disc, and while the Xbox 360 Game of the Year edition initially included an insert in the packaging which could be redeemed on Xbox Live Marketplace to download the Variety map pack, later releases did not contain the inserts, and so were no different from the original release of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2010-08-08|url=http://gameoftheyear.callofduty.com/|title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Game of the Year Edition Keycode Redemption |work=Activision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Modern Warfare'' on release received critical acclaim from many [[Video game journalism|video game publications]].

The game's story has received a considerable amount of acclaim from reviewers. ''GamePro'' notes that &quot;the intense single-player campaign offers up an action packed experience that features a tremendously compelling narrative; there are moments in the game that will send chills down your spine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot; /&gt; [[GameSpot]] mentioned that the fact the &quot;single-player campaign is over in a flash&quot; as the only major flaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot; /&gt; While [[IGN]] described the campaign as &quot;still very linear&quot; like that of its predecessors, &quot;eschewing the concept of [[Sandbox mode|sandbox game]]play,&quot; it noted that this resulted in &quot;a much richer, more focused experience&quot; with &quot;beautifully scripted set pieces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-29|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/833/833308p1.html|title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare AU Review |work=IGN Xbox 360 |publisher=[[IGN|]]|date=2007-11-06|author=Ring, Bennett }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's Voodoo Extreme similarly remarked that it &quot;virtually plays [[Rail shooter|on a rail]], but thatâs part of its charm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty 4 First Impressions|date=November 8, 2007|work=Voodoo Extreme|publisher=IGN|author=Robert Howarth|url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/35295/Call-of-Duty-4-First-Impressions|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Call of Duty 4'' has also received criticism.

===Sales===
Before ''Call of Duty 4'' was released, it was predicted to sell even more copies than the highly successful ''[[Halo 3]]''; it had received reviews as high as ''Halo 3''{{'}}s, it was launching on three systems as opposed to one for ''Halo 3'', and demand for the game led to a wide range of retailers only having enough available to satisfy [[pre-order]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;outsell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-30|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,139653/article.html|title=Call of Duty 4 to Outsell Halo 3 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date=2007-11-15|author=Snow, Blake }}&lt;/ref&gt; It fulfilled the prediction and the [[Xbox 360]] version became the best-selling video game in the [[United States]] from November 2007 to January 2008 according to the [[NPD Group]]. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would go on to sell 1.57 million and 444,000 units, respectively, in the United States in November 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;november&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-15|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6184008.html|title=NPD: November cooks up $2.63 billion in game sales|publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNET Networks, Inc]]|date=2007-12-13|author=Thorsen, Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.47 million units of the Xbox 360 version were sold in December 2007;&lt;ref name=&quot;december&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-15|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6184847.html|title=NPD: 2007 game earnings nearly $18 billion, Halo 3 sells 4.82 million|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNET Networks, Inc]]|date=2008-01-17|author=Thorsen, Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt; the game sold 331,000 copies for the Xbox 360 and 140,000 copies for the PlayStation 3 in January 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;january&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-15|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6186077.html|title=NPD: January game sales slip 6%, Wii and PS3 neck-and-neck|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNET Networks, Inc]]|date=2008-02-14|author=Sinclair, Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox 360 version was the third [[2007 in video gaming#United States|best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S.]] with 3.04 million units sold, behind ''Halo 3'', which sold 4.82 million units, according to the NPD Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;december&quot;/&gt; By January 2008, ''Call of Duty 4'' had sold more than 7 million copies worldwide, and was the best-selling game of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-30|url=http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=289631|title=Call of Duty(R) 4: Modern Warfare(TM) Ranks #1 Title in Units Worldwide for Calendar 2007 |publisher=[[Activision]]|date=2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2008, [[Infinity Ward]] reported that ''Call of Duty 4'' had sold over 10 million units.&lt;ref name=10M&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-9959146-52.html?tag=nefd.top|title='Call of Duty 4' hits 10 million units sold|work=[[CNET Networks#CNET News|CNET News]] |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|author = Terdiman, Daniel|date=2008-06-03|authorlink= Daniel Terdiman}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a May 2009 conference call, [[Activision]] announced that the game has sold 13 million copies, surpassing ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' as the best selling game released that week of November 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamedaily.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-sells-13-million/?biz=1|title=Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Sells 13 Million}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Call of Duty 4'' is a target of [[Copyright infringement|piracy]], which has resulted in multiple copies of the game being illegally distributed online. Robert Bowling, Community Manager at Infinity Ward stated, &quot;We pulled some disturbing numbers this past week about the amount of PC players currently playing Multiplayer....What wasn't fantastic was the percentage of those numbers who were playing on stolen copies of the game on stolen/cracked CD keys of pirated copies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-30|url=http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=156948|title=PC piracy levels are &quot;astounding&quot; says COD4 dev |publisher=[[GamePro]]|date=2008-01-15|author=Snow, Blake |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080117044430/http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=156948|archivedate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wii version===
''Modern Warfare â Reflex Edition'' was ported by [[Treyarch]]. The Wii version of ''Modern Warfare'' has fewer features than the other console versions. It does not support split-screen multiplayer, and the graphics are not as developed. However, Wii fan can play through the epic campaign of Modern Warfare co-op gameplay with a friend on a single screen. At any moment, a second Wii remote can be activated giving the second player their own aiming crosshairs. The game received an aggregated score of 76% on Metacritic.&lt;ref name=metacritic-wii&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2011-10-07 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-reflex-edition |title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition |publisher=Metacritic }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] gave the Wii version of the game, ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare â Reflex Edition'', a score of 7.0, saying the visuals and pointer controls are not as polished as the Wii version of ''[[Call of Duty: World at War|World at War]]'', though they did mention the customization options and multiplayer are impressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/104/1044522p1.html Call of Duty: Modern Warfare â Reflex Edition Review â Wii Review at IGN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' gave it 80%, praising it for packing everything from its next-gen counterpart, but again criticizing the visuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=13130 Review: Call Of Duty Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition â Official Nintendo Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave the game an 8.8, saying that despite some sacrifices, it retains everything good from its original version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-modern-warfare/59410 Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition Video Game, Review | Video Clip|Game Trailers &amp; Videos|GameTrailers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' scored the game at a 6.5, stating that while the game was rather poor graphically, even by Wii standards, the bigger problem was the Wii remote, stating that it did not have enough buttons to support ''Modern Warfare's'' control scheme, and also that it was quite imprecise, contrasting it with the dual analog system used by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and the mouse and keyboard system on the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of the game. GameSpot gave the game an 8.5, stating that the online was as addictive as the other versions, they also said that the controls &quot;are precise and customizable enough to let you be all you can be&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/callofduty4modernwarfare/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition Review for Wii â GameSpot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
