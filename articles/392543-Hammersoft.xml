'''Dennis Lee Eckersley''' (born October 3, 1954 in [[Oakland, California]]), nicknamed '''&quot;Eck&quot;''', is a former [[United States|American]] [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]]. Eckersley had success as a [[starting pitcher|starter]], but gained his greatest fame as a [[closer (baseball)|closer]], becoming the first of only two pitchers in Major League history to have both a 20-win season and a 50-save season in a career (the other being [[John Smoltz]]).

He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2004, his first year of eligibility. He is also noted as the pitcher who gave up a dramatic, [[walk-off home run]] (a phrase Eckersley coined after [[Kirk Gibson 1988 World Series home run|this home run]]) to the injured [[Kirk Gibson]] in Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]].

==Baseball career==
===Cleveland Indians===
Eckersley was drafted by the [[Cleveland Indians]] out of [[Washington High School (Fremont, California)|Washington High School]] of [[Fremont, California]], in the third round of the 1972 amateur draft, and made his Major League debut on April 12, 1975. He was the [[American League]] Rookie Pitcher of the Year in 1975, compiling a 13&amp;ndash;7 record and 2.60 [[Earned run average|ERA]]. His unstyled, long hair, [[moustache]], and live fastball made him an instant and identifiable fan favorite. Eckersley pitched reliably over three seasons with the Indians; he even threw the 200th [[no-hitter]] in history on May 30, 1977, against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]].

===Boston Red Sox===
Eckersley was traded with [[Fred Kendall]] on March 30, 1978 to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for [[Rick Wise]], [[Mike Paxton]], [[Bo Diaz]], and [[Ted Cox (baseball player)|Ted Cox]]. In the book ''[[Curse of Rocky Colavito|The Curse of Rocky Colavito]]'', author [[Terry Pluto]] noted that the trade was necessitated by an awkward situation, namely that Eckersley's wife had left him for teammate [[Rick Manning]].&lt;ref name=p167-169&gt; The Curse of Rocky Colavito: A Loving Look at a Thirty-Year Slump, [[Terry Pluto]], p.167-169, Gray &amp; Company, ISBN 978-1-59851-035-5&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two seasons, Eckersley won a career-high 20 games in 1978 and 17 games in 1979, with a 2.99 ERA in each year. However, during the remainder of his tenure with Boston, from 1980 to 1984, Eckersley pitched poorly. His fastball had lost some steam, as demonstrated by his 43&amp;ndash;48 record with Boston. He later developed a great [[slider]].

===Chicago Cubs===
Eckersley was traded on May 25, 1984 with [[Mike Brumley (infielder)|Mike Brumley]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Bill Buckner]], one of several mid-season deals that helped the Cubs to their first postseason appearance since 1945. Eckersley performed poorly in his sole start for the Cubs in their NL Championship Series with the [[San Diego Padres]].

Eckersley remained with the Cubs in 1985, when he posted an 11&amp;ndash;7 record with two shutouts (the last two of his career). Eckersley's performance deteriorated in 1986, when he posted a 6&amp;ndash;11 record with a 4.57 ERA. After the season, he checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic to treat [[alcoholism]]. (Eckersley noted in Pluto's book that he realized the problem he had after family members videotaped him while drunk and played the tape back for him the next day.)

===Oakland Athletics===
Eckersley was traded again on April 3, {{by|1987}} to the [[Oakland Athletics]], where manager [[Tony La Russa]] intended to use him as a [[set-up pitcher]] or [[long reliever]]. Indeed, Eckersley started two games with the A's before an injury to then-closer [[Jay Howell]] opened the door for Eckersley to move into the closer's role. He saved 16 games in 1987 and then established himself as a dominant closer in 1988 by recording a league-leading 45 saves. He recorded saves in all four games as the A's swept the Red Sox in the 1988 AL Championship Series, but he found himself on the wrong end of [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run]] as the A's lost to the Dodgers in 5 games. In the [[1989 World Series]] he secured the victory in Game Two, and then earned the save in the final game of the Series, as the A's swept the San Francisco Giants in four games.

Eckersley was the most dominant closer in the game from 1988 to {{by|1992}}, finishing first in the A.L. in saves twice, second two other times, and third once. He saved 220 games during the five years and never posted an ERA higher than 2.96. He gave up five earned runs in the entire {{by|1990}} season, resulting in a microscopic 0.61 ERA. Eckersley's control, which had always been above average even when he was not otherwise pitching well, became his trademark; he walked only three batters in 57.2 innings in {{by|1989}}, four batters in 73.1 innings in 1990, and nine batters in 76 innings in 1991. In his 1990 season, Eckersley became the only relief pitcher in baseball history to have more saves than baserunners allowed (48 SV, 41 H, 4 BB, 0 HBP).

He was the [[American League]]'s [[Cy Young Award]] winner and the American League's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in 1992, a season in which he posted 51 saves. Only two relievers had previously accomplished the double feat: [[Rollie Fingers]] in {{by|1981}} and [[Willie Hernandez]] in {{by|1984}}. In {{by|1987}}, the Phillies' [[Steve Bedrosian]] was named the National League Cy Young Award winner. Since Eckersley, one other reliever, [[Ãric GagnÃ©]], has won Cy Young honors (GagnÃ© won the National League award in {{by|2003}} with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]). His numbers slipped noticeably following 1992: although Eckersley still was among the league leaders in saves, his ERA climbed sharply, and his number of saves never climbed above 36.

In 2002, then-Atlanta Braves pitcher [[John Smoltz]] matched Eckersley's feat of having a 20-win season and a 50-save season.

===Final playing years===
When Tony LaRussa left the A's after the 1995 season, he became the St. Louis Cardinals' new manager and arranged to bring Eckersley along with him. Eckersley continued in his role as closer and remained one of the league's best, but following the 1997 season, he signed on with the Red Sox for one final season, 1998. Eckersley's 390 career saves ranks fifth on the all-time list.

==Post-playing career==
He currently works as a studio analyst for the [[Boston Red Sox]] on [[NESN]], where he primarily provides post-game coverage, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the team's play. He also has a multi-year deal with [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] to serve as an analyst for their post-season coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090223/ap_on_sp_ba_ne/bbo_eckersley_tbs;_ylt=AvzbAFRrgcRCHgWPccialTALMxIF Eckersley Extends Contract As An Analyst] Yahoo Sports, February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the Spring of 2009, regular NESN commentator [[Jerry Remy]] took time off for health reasons. Eckersley filled in for Remy, providing color commentary alongside [[Don Orsillo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.nesn.com/boston-red-sox/2009/05/04/eckersley-to-fill-in-for-remy/;_ylt=AvzbAFRrgcRCHgWPccialTALMxIF Eckersley to fill in for Remy] NESN.com, May 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other commentators, he is willing to point out sloppy plays by the team that employs him. This has earned him the nickname &quot;Honest Eck&quot; among fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bostondirtdogs.boston.com/2006/05/curt_shelling.html] Boston Dirt Dogs, May 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonsportz.com/blog/2009/5/22/the-eck-experiment.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eckersley is known for his eccentric vocabulary: most notably, he often refers to a pitcher's ability to throw in the mid to upper 90's as &quot;cheese.&quot; He also refers to the act of hitting a home run as &quot;going bridge,&quot; and to hair, whether on the head or the face, as &quot;moss.&quot;

Eckersley spends time with his three children Mandee, Jake, and Allie. During the summer, he lives in the Turner Hill golf community in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]].
