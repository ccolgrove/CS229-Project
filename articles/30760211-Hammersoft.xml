The University of California Santa Barbara has fielded men's lacrosse teams from 1970-2011. The current head coach is Mike Allan, who previously coached the Gauchos from 2004 to 2008. During that time, the team won two MCLA National Championships, three WCLL Championships and had an overall record of 85 wins and 22 losses. The current assistant coaches are coaches Jon Miller and Ryan Sanders. The team won the MCLA championship in 2004 and 2005 and made an appearance in the championship in 1997, 2003, 2004, and 2005.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucsblax.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  Mike Allan was hired in August 2011, and his predecessor, Lane Jaffe, was coach for the 2010-2011 season. Under Jaffe the team placed 14th in the nation. In the 2010-2011 season the UCSB Gauchos went (10-6) while losing key games to Cal Poly, Chapman, and Arizona State University.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Computer Rating.&quot;Â College &amp; High School Lacrosse Schedules, Scores, Ratings &amp; Rankings | LaxPower. 18 July 2010.

==Field==
The UCSB lacrosse team is the only UC which has a dedicated lacrosse field. This field is dubbed &quot;The Pit&quot; because of its dilapidated nature. &quot;The Pit&quot; has little crowd seating with only two metal bleachers and an old couch. Occasionally the team will play a night game in [[Harder Stadium]], which is where the UCSB soccer team plays.
