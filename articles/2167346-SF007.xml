The '''meibomian glands''' (or '''tarsal glands''') are a special kind of [[sebaceous gland]] at the rim of the [[eyelid]]s inside the [[tarsal plate]], responsible for the supply of [[meibum]], an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the [[human eye|eye's]] [[tear film]]. They prevent tear spillage onto the cheek, trapping tears between the oiled edge and eyeball, and make the closed lids airtight.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot; EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]].  Chicago: EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 50 glands on the upper eyelids and 25 glands on the lower eyelids.
The glands are named after [[Heinrich Meibom (doctor)|Heinrich Meibom]] (1638â1700), a German physician.

==Meibum==
=== Lipids ===
Lipids are the major components of meibum (also known as &quot;meibomian gland secretions&quot;). The term &quot;meibum&quot; was originally introduced by Nicolaides ''et al.'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaides N, Kaitaranta JK, Rawdah TN, Macy JI, Boswell FM 3rd, Smith RE. &quot;Meibomian gland studies: comparison of steer and human lipids.&quot; ''Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci''. 1981 Apr;20(4):522-536. PMID 7194326.&lt;/ref&gt;
The biochemical composition of meibum is extremely complex and very different from that of [[sebum]]. Lipids are universally recognized as major components of human and animal meibum. Recently, an update on the composition of human meibum and on the structures of various positively identified meibomian lipids was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Butovich IA|title=The Meibomian puzzle: combining pieces together|work=Prog Retin Eye Res|date =November 2009|issue=6|volume=28|pages=483â498|id=|pmid=19660571|doi=10.1016/j.preteyeres.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the most sensitive and informative approach to lipidomic analysis of meibum is mass-spectrometry in combination with liquid chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;Butovich IA. &quot;Lipidomic analysis of human meibum using HPLC-MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.&quot; ''Methods Mol Biol''. 2009;579:221-246. PMID 19763478.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proteins===
In humans, more than 90 different proteins have been identified in meibomian gland secretions.&lt;ref&gt;Tsai PS, Evans JE, Green KM, Sullivan RM, Schaumberg DA, Richards SM, Dana MR, Sullivan DA. &quot;Proteomic analysis of human meibomian gland secretions.&quot; ''Br J Ophthalmol.'' 2006 March;90(3):372-7. {{DOI|10.1136/bjo.2005.080846}} PMID 16488965.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dysfunction ==
Dysfunctional meibomian glands often cause [[dry eye]]s, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also cause [[blepharitis]], as the dry eyeball rubs off small pieces of skin from the eyelid, which may get infected. Inflammation of the meibomian glands (also known as ''meibomitis'', ''meibomian gland dysfunction'', or ''posterior blepharitis'') causes the glands to be obstructed by thick waxy secretions. Besides leading to dry eyes, the obstructions can be degraded by bacterial [[lipase]]s, resulting in the formation of free [[fatty acid]]s, which irritate the eyes and sometimes cause [[Thygeson's superficial punctate keratopathy|punctate keratopathy]].
