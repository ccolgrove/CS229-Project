In the [[X Window System]], an '''X display manager''' runs as a program that allows the starting of a [[login session|session]] on an X [[Server (computing)|server]] from the same or another [[computer]].

A display manager presents the user with a [[login|login screen]] which prompts for a [[username]] and [[password]]. A session starts when the user successfully enters a valid combination of username and password.

When the display manager runs on the user's computer, it starts the X server before presenting the user the login screen, optionally repeating when the user logs out. In this condition, the display manager realizes in the X Window System the functionality of &lt;tt&gt;[[init]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[getty (Unix)|getty]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;login&lt;/tt&gt; on [[computer terminal|character-mode terminals]]. When the display manager runs on a remote computer, it acts like a [[telnet]] server, requesting username and password and starting a remote session.

X11 Release 3 introduced display managers in October 1988 with the aim of supporting the standalone [[X terminal]]s then just coming onto the market. Various display managers continue in routine use to provide a graphical login prompt on standalone [[computer workstation]]s running X. X11R4 introduced the '''X Display Manager Control Protocol''' ('''XDMCP''') in December 1989 to fix problems in the X11R3 implementation.

== Local and remote display management ==

A display manager can run on the same computer where the user sits or on a remote one. In the first case, the display manager starts one or more X servers, displaying the login screen at the beginning and (optionally) every time the user logs out. In the second case, the display manager works according to the XDMCP protocol.

[[Image:Xserver and display manager.svg|thumb|400px|In the X Window System, the X server runs on the computer in front of the user. The X server may connect to a display manager running on another computer, starting a session which may comprise a variety of programs running on that other computer.]]
The XDMCP protocol mandates that the X server starts autonomously and connects to the display manager. In the X Window System paradigm, the server runs on the computer providing the display and input devices. A server can connect, using the XDMCP protocol, to a display manager running on another computer, requesting it to start the session. In this case, the X server acts as a graphical [[telnet]] client while the display manager acts like a telnet server: users start programs from the computer running the display manager, while their input and output take place on the computer where the server (and the user) sits.

An administrator can configure an X server running on the computer or terminal of the user either to connect to a specific display manager, or to display a list of suitable hosts running potential X display managers. An '''XDMCP Chooser''' program allows the user to select a host from among those the terminal can connect to:

# a predefined list of hosts and their respective network addresses;
# a list of hosts (on the local [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] [[subnetwork|subnet]]) that the XDMCP server (part of the X server?) in turn obtains by a [[broadcast domain|network broadcast]]

The XDMCP server will often present itself in this list. When the user selects a host from the list, the X server running on the local machine will connect to the selected remote computer's X display manager.

==X Display Manager Control Protocol ==

The X Display Manager Control Protocol uses [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 177. An X server requests that a display manager start a session by sending a &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; packet. If the display manager allows access for that X server, it responds by sending a &lt;code&gt;Willing&lt;/code&gt; packet back to the X server. (The X server can also send &lt;code&gt;BroadcastQuery&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;IndirectQuery&lt;/code&gt; packets to start a session - this mechanism for requesting a session resembles using [[DHCP]] to request an IP address.)

The display manager must authenticate itself to the server. To do this the X server sends a &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt; packet to the display manager, which returns an &lt;code&gt;Accept&lt;/code&gt; packet. If the &lt;code&gt;Accept&lt;/code&gt; packet contains the response the X server expects, the display manager is authenticated. Producing the correct response might require the display manager to have access to a [[secret key]], for example. If authentication succeeds, the X server sends a &lt;code&gt;Manage&lt;/code&gt; packet to inform the display manager. Then the display manager displays its login screen by connecting to the X server as a regular X client.

During the session, the server can send &lt;code&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/code&gt; packets to the display manager at intervals. If the display manager fails to respond with an &lt;code&gt;Alive&lt;/code&gt; packet within a certain time, the X server presumes that the display manager has ceased running, and can terminate the connection.
&lt;!-- missing: 1. when is the connection terminated 2. more on indirect and broadcast --&gt;

One problem with XDMCP is that, similarly to [[telnet]], the authentication takes place unencrypted. If snooping is possible, this leaves the system vulnerable to attack. It is more secure to use an [[Secure Shell|ssh]] [[tunneling protocol | tunnel]] for X traffic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/docs/2.14/security.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

[[X Display Manager (implementation)|XDM]] (the X Window Display Manager) originated in X11R3. This version suffered from several problems, most notably when users switched X terminals off and on. In X11R3, XDM only knew about an X terminal from its entry in the &lt;tt&gt;Xservers&lt;/tt&gt; file, but XDM only consulted this file when it started. Thus every time a user switched a terminal off and on, the [[system administrator]] had to send a [[SIGHUP]] [[signal (computing)|signal]] to XDM to instruct it to rescan &lt;tt&gt;Xservers&lt;/tt&gt;.

XDMCP arrived with the introduction of X11R4 (December 1989). With XDMCP, the X server must actively request a display manager connection from the host. An X server using XDMCP therefore no longer requires an entry in &lt;tt&gt;Xservers&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Some implementations ==

The [[X Window System]] supplies [[X Display Manager (implementation)|XDM]] as its standard display manager.  

Programmers have developed other X display managers, both commercial and free, offering additional functionality over the basic display management:

* [[GNOME Display Manager|GDM]] ([[GNOME]])
* [[KDE Display Manager|KDM]] (provided by [[KDE]]) allows the user to graphically select a [[X window manager|window manager]] or [[desktop environment]] in the login screen
* [[X Display Manager (implementation)|XDM]], the default X Window System Display Manager
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdm-options/ XDM-OPTIONS] for xdm. Easy full install, Xhost Phonebook, X Login, X Desktop Chooser, menu-reconfig, repair utils.
* LDM, the (remote) Display Manager of the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]]
* [[dtlogin]] (shipped with [[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]])
* &lt;tt&gt;scologin&lt;/tt&gt; (provided by [[SCO OpenServer|SCO Open Desktop]]) also checks for expired passwords and performs some administrative tasks
* [[WINGs Display Manager]] (using the WINGs widget-set used in [[Window Maker]])
* [[entrance (display manager)|entranced/entrance]] (employs the architecture used in [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] v.17, on hiatus since 2005)
* [http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXDM LXDM], a lightweight display manager, part of [[LXDE]], cross-desktop, fully themeable
* [[SLiM]], an independent login manager.
* [http://cdm.ghost1227.com/X11 CDM], an ultralight Console Display Manager for Linux
* [http://www.jonshouse.co.uk/xlogin.cgi xlogin], X Window login with separate XDMCP server
* [http://enter.sf.net Enter] Lightweight graphical login manager
* [http://dev.e-x-a.org/projects/orthos/ Orthos], another lightweight solution with very configurable animated themes that use OpenGL only
* [http://www.enricozini.org/sw/nodm/ nodm], auto-login display manager for systems like kiosks, appliances and mobile phones
* [[LightDM]], a lightweight, modular, cross-desktop, fully themeable desktop display manager
On most Linux distributions, the default display manager is selected in file /etc/X11/default-display-manager
