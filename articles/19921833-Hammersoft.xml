==History==
===Historic 1922 season===

The team by many to be considered the greatest in Drake history is to date the only undefeated Bulldog team. Drake capped the historic season with a 48â6 triumph over [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] on November 25, 1922. They received votes as the number one team in the College Football Researchers Association poll and were invited to the [[White House]] for their accomplishments. The Bulldogs were coached by legend [[Ossie Solem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake Bulldogs Football&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org |accessdate=2008-01-01|title=Drake Bulldogs Football |publisher=www.drakebulldogs.org|date=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The &quot;Babe&quot; at the 1926 Drake football scrimmage===

During the 1926 Homecoming activities, [[Babe Ruth]] visited and suited up for a Drake scrimmage. Head coach [[Ossie Solem]] extended the invitation stating &quot;We finally inquired had he ever indulged in the 'dirt eating' pastime known as football. The answer was sort of a woeful 'No.' It was evident that the 'Big Bimbo' had missed something in his boyhood days, and when the invitation to work out with the Bulldogs was extended, it was accepted with glee.&quot; Ruth scored a 20&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown in the mock scrimmage.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Day Babe Ruth Played Some Football&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-21/sports/sp-523_1_day-babe-ruth |accessdate=1990-21-09 |title=The Day Babe Ruth Played Some Football |publisher=latimes.com |date=1990-21-09 | first=Ted | last=Brock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1927 Drake vs. UCLA at the Rose Bowl Stadium===

While it was not the official [[Rose Bowl Game]], Drake was the first Iowa school to play in the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]]. The Bulldogs defeated [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] 25â6 in front of a near capacity crown of 40,000 on November 28, 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Drake Expirence&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/drakebulldogs/docs/09fb_drakeexperences2-15 |accessdate=2009-02-15 |title=The Drake Experience |publisher=www.drake.edu|date=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] played major games at the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]]. The Bruins did not officially move on a permanent basis to the Rose Bowl Stadium until 1982. The game was highlighted as one of the NCAA Football [[Thanksgiving]] Special Games that year.

===The birth of night football===

Drake was the first college football stadium to install lights. On October 6, 1928, the Bulldogs defeated [[Simpson College]] 41â6 in the first night game at [[Drake Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Drake Expirence&quot;&gt;[http://issuu.com/drakebulldogs/docs/09fb_drakeexperences2-15 |accessdate=2009-15-02 |title=The Drake Experience |publisher=www.drakebulldogs.com|date=2009-15-02]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Drake played the first night game at [[Soldier Field]], losing a close contest to the [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]] 14â7 on October 3, 1930. It was an event that was the first intersectional night games played in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The Drake vs. [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]] game was followed by [[Loyola Ramblers|Loyola]] vs. [[Georgetown Hoyas football|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Milwaukee Journal - Drake vs. Oregon Tonight&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19301003&amp;id=L7EWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tCEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6651,4933056 |accessdate=1998-03-08 |title=The Milwaukee Journal â Drake vs. Oregon Tonight |publisher=www.jsonline.com |date=1930-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aloha trip===

Following the 1931 season head coach [[Ossie Solem]] schedule a game in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] in which the bulldogs squared off against [[Hawaii Warriors football|Hawaii]]. Solem frustrated by the lack of postseason rewards (the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] on January 1, 1932, was the only NCAA Bowl Game following 1931 season), called the trip a reward for his teamâs fourth straight [[Missouri Valley Conference]] championship.

In a close encounter at [[Honolulu Stadium]] on December 19, 1931, [[Hawaii Warriors football|Hawaii]] defeated Drake 19â13 in a game dubbed the Aloha Classic. The game was the first by an [[Iowa]] school in the state of [[Hawaii]]. It was also the last game for Solem as Bulldog coach. He would leave the next season taking the head football coach vacancy at [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Drake Expirence&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/drakebulldogs/docs/09fb_drakeexperences2-15 |accessdate=2009-02-15 |title=The Drake Experience |publisher=www.drake.edu|date=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1938 double-header===

On September 23, 1938, Drake became the first [[college football]] team to win two games in the same day. The Bulldogs would defeat [[Central College (Iowa)|Central]] 45â0 in the afternoon game, followed by a 47â0 win over [[Monmouth Hawks football|Monmouth]] in the evening game.

Drake was the only team to be credited with two games in the same day until October 17, 2009, when [[Delaware State Hornets football|Delaware State]] became the first team to lose two games in a day. The Hornets lost to [[North Carolina A&amp;T]] by forfeit and to [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] 63â6. [[Delaware State Hornets football|Delaware State]] forfeited the game versus [[North Carolina A&amp;T]] in order to accept a $500,000 payout to play [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;No Good Comes From This Game&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=4199819&amp;sportCat=ncf |accessdate=2009-05-26 |title=No Good Comes From This Game |publisher=www.espn.com |date=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnny Bright===
{{Main|Johnny Bright}}
In 1951, 'Johnny Bright was named a First Team [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]], and was awarded the [[Nils V. &quot;Swede&quot; Nelson Award|Nils V. &quot;Swede&quot; Nelson Sportsmanship Award]]. He was invited to the [[Heisman Trophy]] festivities and finished fifth in the voting.

In 1969, Bright was named Drake University's greatest football player of all time. Bright is the only Drake football player to have his jersey number (#43) retired by the school, and in June, 2006, received honorable mention from ''[[ESPN]].com'' senior writer Ivan Maisel as one of the best college football players to ever wear #43.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/newsstory.php?nid=1151679923 |accessdate=2006-07-08 |title=Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized |publisher=DrakeBulldogs.org |date=2006-06-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060711061727/http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/newsstory.php?nid=1151679923  |archivedate = 2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, the football field at [[Drake Stadium]], in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], was named in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa - Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcci.com/sports/7374962/detail.html?rss=des&amp;psp=sports |accessdate=2006-08-12 | title=KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa â Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions |publisher=KCCI.com |date=2006-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Bright was voted one of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s [[TSN Top 50 CFL Players|Top 50 players]] (#19) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN Top 50 CFL Players&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/feature/?fid=10866 |accessdate=2007-04-28 |title=TSN Top 50 CFL Players |publisher=TSN.ca |date=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Johnny Bright incident====
{{Main|Johnny Bright Incident}}
The Johnny Bright Incident was a violent [[Violence in sports|on-field assault]] against [[African-American]] player [[Johnny Bright]] by [[White American]] player Wilbanks Smith during an American [[college football]] game held on October 20, 1951 in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]]. The game was significant in itself as it marked the first time that an African American athlete with a national profile and of critical importance to the success of his [[Drake University]] team had played against Oklahoma A&amp;M (now [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]]) on their [[Home (sports)|home field]]. Bright's injury also highlighted the racial tensions of the times and assumed notoriety when it was captured in what was later to become both a widely disseminated and eventually [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning photo sequence. The event later came to be known as the &quot;Johnny Bright Incident&quot;.

===Near perfect 1981 season===
{{main|1981 Drake Bulldogs football team}}
The most successful Drake team in the modern era of college football was the 1981 Bulldogs. Drake finished the season with 10 wins and nearly had an undefeated season. The Bulldogs would fall 59â6 to [[Tulsa]] ending their chance at a perfect season. With a 7â4â0 record, [[Tulsa]] would clinch the lone [[Missouri Valley Conference]] postseason berth due the head-to-head tie-breaker. Both teams finished conference play 7â1â0. The [[Missouri Valley Conference]] had tentatively reached an agreement with the [[Western Athletic Conference]] in 1981 where the runners-up would play in the [[Aloha Bowl]]; however, the [[Aloha Bowl]]âs certification by the [[NCAA]] Championship Committee was delayed until 1982. The 1981 [[Aloha Bowl]] would have featured Drake (10â1) against [[Hawaii Warriors football|Hawaii]] (9â2).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Rob Ash era â the rebirth of Drake football===
Following the historic 1981 season, the Bulldogs suffered five straight non-winning seasons. In 1986, the school chose not to award athletic scholarships (&quot;grants-in-aid&quot;) to football players. It was unclear if Drake football would survive until [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]] native [[Rob Ash]] was introduced as coach in 1989.

Ash rejuvenated the program during his eighteen seasons at Drake and played a crucial role in the founding of the [[Pioneer Football League]], a football-only league, run out of the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] offices in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], [[Missouri]]. In the process, he became Drake's all-time winningest coach with a record of 125â63â2; leading the Bulldogs to four conference titles and five runners-up finishes in the [[NCAA Division I FCS Consensus Mid-Major Football National Championship|Sports Network Cup]]. As a result, Ash was named the conference coach of the year three times (1995, 1998, and 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ash Blog - About Coach Ash&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robashfootball.com/about-coach-ash.cfm |accessdate=2008 |title=Rob Ash Blog â About Coach Ash |publisher=www.robashfootball.com/w|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 season, Ash accepted the head football coach position at [[Montana State Bobcats football|Montana State]]. In his final Drake season, he led the team to a runner-up finish in both the Pioneer Football League and the Sports Network Cup. Ironically, [[San Diego Toreros football|San Diego]] defeated Drake in both, marking the first time two Pioneer Football League teams finished first and second in the [[NCAA Division I FCS Consensus Mid-Major Football National Championship|Sports Network Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/george_dohrmann/08/07/trouble.in.paradise0813/ | work=CNN | title=Two former athletes allegedly murder a drug dealer.

===2007âpresent===

The Bulldogs were coached by long-time [[NFL]] assistant [[Steve Loney]] in 2007. The team finished 6â5, with a highlight 27â24 victory over #7 [[Illinois State Redbirds football|Illinois State]] on August 30. Loney would resign at the end of the season to accept a position as offensive line coach with the [[Saint Louis Rams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;drake&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godrakebulldogs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=15700&amp;ATCLID=925810 |title=Steve Loney Coach's Bio |accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher=godrakebulldogs.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2007, the Bulldogs hired [[Chris Creighton]] as head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake hires Wabash coach Creighton as football coach&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/college-football/article/2007-12-20/wabash-drake-hires-wabash-coach-creighton-football-coach|title=Drake hires Wabash coach Creighton as football coach |accessdate=2007-12-20 |publisher=www.sportingnews.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creighton finished 6â5 in 2008, his first season at Drake. In 2009, the Bulldogs were leading the conference with two games remaining before falling to rivals [[Dayton Flyers football|Dayton]] 23â6 and [[Butler Bulldogs football|Butler]] 20â17.  With one second left in the final regular season game, [[Butler Bulldogs football|Butler]] secured the victory with a field goal, knocking Drake out of first place for he first time during the 2009 campaign. The Bulldogs finished with an overall record of 8â3 (tied for third in the [[Pioneer Football League]]), eliminating them from a post-season birth.

On September 1, 2010, Drake announced it would forgo its normal postseason tie-ins in order to participate in the [[2010 NCAA Division I FCS football season#Global Kilimanjaro Bowl|Global Kilimanjaro Bowl]], the first [[American Football]] game in [[Africa]]. The Bulldogs solidified their spot in the game, securing a winning season with their sixth win on October 30, 2010 (a 38â17 defeat of [[San Diego Toreros football|San Diego]]). &lt;ref name=&quot;Global Kilimanjaro Bowl&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.godrakebulldogs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=71156&amp;SPID=8123&amp;DB_OEM_ID=15700&amp;ATCLID=204986351|title=Drake To Play First American Football Game In Africa|first=Drake University |publisher=GoDrakeBulldogs.com |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*See [[2011 Kilimanjaro Bowl]]

Drake continued their success during the 2011 season after the victory in the Kilimanjaro Bowl. The Bulldogs shared the [[Pioneer Football League]] title. Coach Creighton and his team were honored with the [[National Consortium for Academics and Sports|NCAS Giant Steps Award]] for their charity work in Africa. They were also featured in a documentary by [[CBS Sports]] for their work in Africa. 

==Notable Drake teams==

Drake was the first university in the state of Iowa to participate in a college football bowl game. In addition, they were the first Iowa school to accept a January 1 bowl invitation. During their [[Missouri Valley Conference]] era, Drake competed in five bowl games (three January 1), winning two. In 1981, they were slated to participate in a sixth (the [[Aloha Bowl]]); however, the game failed to reach [[NCAA]] certification until 1982. Since joining the [[Pioneer Football League]] in 1993, the Bulldogs have finished second in the Sports Network Cup (a yearly series between mid-major programs prior to the founding of the [[Gridiron Classic]]) which concluded by coaches votes on the first week of December. In 2010, Drake announced it would forgo its normal postseason tie-ins in order to participate in the Global Kilimanjaro Bowl, the first [[American Football]] game in [[Africa]]. Drake has yet to compete in the [[Gridiron Classic]] which became an annual postseason game between the [[Northeast Conference]] and the Pioneer Football League following the 2006 season. &lt;ref name=&quot;Drake Bulldogs Football&quot;/&gt;

In addition, the Bulldogs have won or shared thirteen conference championships throughout their history. The first was in 1922 and the last was 2011. They have won a total of eight [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Championships and five [[Pioneer Football League]] Championships. Only four Bulldog team's (1981, 2004, 2006 &amp; 2011) have won nine or more games in a season, while the 1922 team is the lone undefeated Drake team. &lt;ref name=&quot;Drake Bulldog Football Official Site&quot;&gt;[http://www.godrakebulldogs.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=15700&amp;KEY=&amp;SPID=8123&amp;SPSID=71156 |accessdate=2009-01-01 |title=Drake Bulldog Football Official Site |publisher=www.drakebulldogs.org|date=2009-01-01]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drake vs. Notre Dame series===

Drake and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] have played eight times in football with the Fighting Irish owing an 8â0â0 record versus the Bulldogs. The series began as a home and away series from 1926 to 1931. After Notre Dame defeated Drake 63â0 in 1931, the 1932 game was moved to a neutral site at [[Soldier Field]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; however it did not have an effect on the game as it ended in a 62â0 Notre Dame victory. The teams would try to renew the series in 1937, playing one game before it was officially canceled as an annual event. The Fighting Irish were coached by legend [[Knute Rockne]] during the games from 1926â1930 and Notre Dame won national titles in 1927, 1929, and 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake Bulldog Football Official Site&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godrakebulldogs.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=15700&amp;KEY=&amp;SPID=8123&amp;SPSID=71156 |accessdate=2009-01-01 |title=Drake Bulldog Football Official Site |publisher=www.drakebulldogs.org|date=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
