'''Portugal Telecom (PT)''' is the largest [[telecommunications service provider]] in [[Portugal]]. Although it operates mainly in Portugal and [[Brazil]], it has also a significant presence in [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Mozambique]], [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]], [[Angola]], [[Kenya]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe]].

Due to its large market share, Portugal Telecom is considered a ''de facto'' monopoly in fixed telephony in Portugal.

== History ==

The first [[telephone]] experiments in Portugal connected [[Carcavelos]] to the Central do Cabo in [[Lisbon]], in 1877. In 1882, the [[Edison Gower-Bell Telephone Company of Europe, Ltd.|Edison Gower-Bell Telephone Company]] was established in both Lisbon and [[Porto]], to explore the respective telephone service concessions. In 1887, the concession was transferred to APT - The Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company, which was kept by the latter until 1968, the year in which the Public Company &quot;Telefones de Lisboa e Porto&quot; (TLP) was created. The Post Office, Telegraphs and Telephones ([[CTT]]) explored until this present day, the telephone service in the rest of the country. For the exploration of [[radiotelegraphy]] and [[wireless telephone]], a contract with the Marconi's Wireless Telegraphy Company concession was confirmed in 1922. In 1925, the &quot;Companhia Portuguesa RÃ¡dio Marconi&quot; (CPRM) was set up and took on all responsibilities of the previous concession.
 
In 1970, CTT became a Public Company and in 1989, the TLP was transformed into a Limited Company, and was completely controlled by the State. 

In 1992, the Portuguese government and the Public Service Television Corporation [[RÃ¡dio e TelevisÃ£o de Portugal|RTP]] agreed to separate the transmitter network from the rest of the corporation, transferring it to a recently created state-owned company named &quot;TeledifusÃ£o de Portugal&quot; (TDP). The purpose of this was to explore a nationwide TV broadcasting network available for any TV station in Portugal to request its services. At the time, RTP (a &quot;native&quot; client of TDP) was having competition for the first time since its creation in the 1950s. [[Sociedade Independente de ComunicaÃ§Ã£o|SIC]] required the services of TDP, but [[TelevisÃ£o Independente|TVI]] decided to create its own transmitter Network (RETI).

In 1992, CTT became a Limited Company with public capital and the ComunicaÃ§Ãµes Nacionais, SPGS, SA (CN) was created, a state holding company responsible for the managing of all state participation within the sector - CTT, TLP, CPRM e TDP. In this same year, the Telecommunications developed by CTT was automatized through the creation of Telecom Portugal, SA, giving CTT the possibility to dedicate itself exclusively to the Post Office. With this, Portugal had its own telecommunications network which was being explored by 3 operators: the TLP explored the telephone services in the Lisbon and Porto areas, Telecom Portugal was responsible for the remaining national, European and Mediterranean communications; and Marconi took hold of international traffic. In 1994, a unique national telecommunications operator was created with the fusion of companies within the CN State holding: Portugal Telecom, SA (PT), with the fusion of Telecom Portugal, TLP and TDP.

Portugal Telecom was the only telephone operator in Portugal, being a [[monopoly]], until 1994, when the government gradually retired its control over the corporation and, in 2000, Portugal Telecom became a publicly owned company. Since then, it has held a dominant position in the liberalized Portuguese market.

In early 2007, the Portuguese conglomerate, [[Sonae]]'s [[takeover]] offer for Portugal Telecom failed. PT's board rejected an initial bid, worth EUR 11.1 bn, in February 2006. Sonae.com's takeover bid opposed [[Belmiro de Azevedo]] (founder and historical chairman of [[Sonae]] holding company) and his son Paulo Azevedo (then the head officer of [[Sonae.com]] telecommunications operator) to the investor [[JosÃ© Berardo]] and PT's administrators Zeinal Bava and Henrique Granadeiro.{{what|date=July 2011}} In April 2007 the [[European Commission]] gave an ultimatum to the [[Portuguese government]] ordering it to give up on the 500 [[golden share]]s pack that it owned on the company and that enable special veto powers to the government on vital issues. This could give the government a decisive role in the bid by any company to buy Portugal Telecom. In November 2007, Portugal Telecom spun off its media assets ([[PT MultimÃ©dia]]), that included [[TV Cabo]] and [[Lusomundo]] Cinemas. In January 2008, the [[European Commission]] began legal proceedings against the Portuguese government over its 'golden share' in incumbent telecoms operator Portugal Telecom. The 500 golden shares with extended voting rights, allowing it to block potential takeover bids, were the reason for the Commission's legal action. Similarly, in November 2005, the Commission had forced the [[Spanish government]] to give up its golden share in the other telecommunications' major player in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the Spanish telecoms giant [[TelefÃ³nica]].

In December 2009, Portugal Telecom purchased RETI.

Portugal argued that the shares were in the [[public interest]]. A case brought before the [[European Court of Justice]] by the Commission to force the government to cede its shares resulted in the announcement of their abolition in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goncalves|first=Sergio|title=Portugal scraps golden shares in utilities|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/05/portugal-goldenshares-idUSLDE76414L20110705|accessdate=18 November 2011|date=5 July 2011|author2=Alvarenga, Daniel|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
