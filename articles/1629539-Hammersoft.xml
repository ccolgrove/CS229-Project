{{nihongo|'''DigiDestined'''|é¸ã°ããå­ä¾é| Erabareshi Kodomotachi| lit. &quot;Chosen Children&quot;}}&lt;!--add kanji and romaji--&gt; are the major heroes in the [[Digimon]] [[media franchise]] who have been chosen by certain beings to protect the [[Digital World]], a [[Plane (metaphysics)|plane]] which originated from data produced by Earth's [[telecommunications network]]s. This plane is often beset by evil forces, and is closely linked to [[Earth]]; saving the Digital World usually saves the Earth as well. The term is primarily used in ''Digimon Adventure'', ''Digimon Adventure 02'', and ''Digimon Frontier'', though it is sometimes used for the protagonists of the other settings in the Digimon franchise. All DigiDestined are partnered with a Digimon, and possess a [[Digivice]]; however, these are not defining characteristics, as the &quot;Tamers&quot; in ''Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01'' and ''Digimon Tamers'' had the same characteristics and were not considered DigiDestined. 

While there are many heroic Digimon who can fight to save their world, a DigiDestined child enables their partner to more quickly grow in power by [[Digivolution|Digivolving]] to higher levels of power. This ability to grow quickly allows the DigiDestined's Digimon to quickly surpass the most powerful of enemies, making them instrumental in saving the worlds.

==The Original DigiDestined==
{{original research|section|date=July 2011}}
[[Image:Firstkids2.jpg|thumb|200px|Silhouettes of season 1 DigiDestined and their Digimon partners used to represent the Original DigiDestined and Digimon]]

Never seen, nor revealed in great length, it was revealed in Digimon Adventure that another group of children were chosen to be DigiDestined even before the group in that series had ever been called upon. They were in fact the first to defeat and seal away &quot;a great evil&quot; behind the same Firewall.

It is believed by many Digimon fans that this was only a reference to the first Digimon franchise, the manga [[Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01]], in which Taichi Yagami, Neo Saiba, Rei Saiba, Sigma, Mari Goutokuji, and Hideto Fujimoto travel to the Digital World to defeat the evil [[Daemon (Digimon)|Daemon]], but strangely only five of them had Digimon partners, just as the silhouettes depict. This is merely a guess made by fans as it has been more than a decade since these Chosen Children were mentioned and no canon prequel has been created. Even though the children in [[Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01]] were not considered as Chosen Children, it is believed that it was just a reference to the manga.

It is also believed that the Original DigiDestined may be the DigiDestined from the Digimon Frontier series for the following reasons:
*There were five children that were chosen in Frontier.
*The use of the word 'Frontier' suggests that they were exploring a new world (the Digital World being the Frontier).
*Similar to Digimon Adventure 01, the progressiveness of time in the Digital World was faster than that in the Real World, which means that Apocalymon has not yet been defeated.
*The idea of Spirit Evolution in Digimon Frontier can be considered as primitive, as if the concept of Digimon partners had not yet been introduced.
*In Digimon Frontier, the Digimon that govern the Digital World are the 3 Celestial Digimon (Arch Angels), whom are not as powerful as the 4 Digimon Sovereign in season 1, 2 and 3, which may indicate that the Digital World was younger then.

However, the fact that the Frontier children did not have Digimon partners and that the only two Digimon who followed them are Bokomon and Neemon makes this theory hard to believe for some people, who instead assert that each series (with the exception of 01 and 02) takes place in a separate universe. 

Although if looking closely at the picture (provided on right) from Episode 53 of [[Digimon Adventure]] the silhouettes of the &quot;Original DigiDestined&quot; appear to be silhouettes of 5 the original ([[Digimon Adventure]]) 8 kids. In order from left to right they and their Digimon partners appear as [[Taichi &quot;Tai&quot; Kamiya]], and [[Agumon]], [[Takeru &quot;T.K.&quot; Takaishi]]  and [[Patamon]], [[Sora Takenouchi]] and [[Biyomon]], [[Koushiro &quot;Izzy&quot; Izumi]] and [[Tentomon]], [[Yamato &quot;Matt&quot; Ishida]] and [[Gabumon]]. This is only speculation based on similarities in character designs to these 5 DigiDestined and their respective [[Digimon (creature)|Digimon]]. Although it's possible the series creators were just cutting a couple of corners to save time. No other mention of these DigiDestined or who they might be was ever made.

A final possibility is that these are the parents of the Season 1 DigiDestined. In Season 1, Takeru and Yamato's father tells Yamato to stay hidden with Gabumon. Yamato asks how his father knew who Gabumon was and his father says he'll explain later. The audience never finds out how their father knew Gabumon, though it could only be because their father had met a Gabumon before, or had one of his very own. This idea is supported by the fact that in the end of Season 2 there is a scene that takes place 25 years in the future. The DigiDestined have all grown up and had children of their own and these children have the same Digimon companions that they're parents had. If the DigiDestined of Season 1 and 2 had children who became the new DigiDestined then it's a logical possibility that it was their parents before them who were the original DigiDestined. However, it should be noted that the above conversation between Yamato and his father does not occur in the Japanese release. Instead Yamato's father asks Gabumon to take care of Yamato, implying that Yamato had introduced Gabumon to his father. (&quot;Gabumon-kun was it? Take care of Yamato for me.&quot;) 

Its been speculated and been proven that the five original chosen children were actually just primitive character designs for Taichi &quot;Tai&quot; Yagami, Takeru &quot;T.K.&quot; Takaishi, Sora Takenouchi, Koushiro &quot;Izzy&quot; Izumi&quot;, and Yamato Ishida which the directors or producers disposed of later on. It was confirmed from the producers themselves, but the reference or the source might be expired, but it came from the official fan site 

Please keep in mind that these are only speculations, as no official announcements have confirmed them.

==Digimon Adventure / Digimon Adventure 02==
In Digimon Adventure the DigiDestined were chosen by unseen digital beings that wished to help the Digital World from the chaos brought upon it by [[Apocalymon]]'s influence. There is no information on who chose the DigiDestined of Adventure 02.

Although it has been stated that the DigiDestined from Adventure were chosen because of an earlier battle between Agumon and Parrotmon (in which Tai and Kari helped Agumon [[Digivolve]] into Greymon), the second set of DigiDestined were chosen because of various things that the group from Adventure did. Yolei was chosen because she sent many [[emails]] during the battle with [[Diaboromon]] on the internet, Cody was chosen because he was in the plane that [[Garudamon]] saved from crashing when the sky opened, and Davis was part of the group of people who were being held inside the convention center when [[Myotismon]] was looking for the 8th DigiDestined.

The twelve main DigiDestined in Adventure and Adventure 02 all come from Japan. Late in the series, they discover that there are DigiDestined in many other parts of the world. Unlike the Japanese DigiDestined, some of the international DigiDestined teams had multiple children paired with the same species of Digimon. Not all of the international Chosen Children were named, and not all were shown.

The DigiDestined in [[Digimon Frontier]] were chosen from a pool of potential DigiDestined gathered by [[Ophanimon]]. These children have no Digimon partners. They use the power of the [[spirit]]s of the Legendary Warriors, deceased Digimon heroes that saved the Digital World of this series in its ancient past, to transform into Digimon themselves.

==Digimon Savers (Data Squad)==
The main human characters of this series possess Digivices but are referred to as &quot;partners&quot; or simply the Data Squad (in the English dub) rather than &quot;Digidestined&quot; as they were mostly chosen by DATS.

However, they overcame their difficulties, and have since become steady team-mates. Gaomon is Thomas' loyal Digimon partner, and is a focused and serious-minded warrior - he responds to Thomas's every order with a steadfast &quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot; (in the original Japanese version, he used the English phrase, &quot;Yes, Master!&quot;)

Falcomon is his partner and childhood friend, who does his best to help Keenan as he comes to grips with his humanity. Keenan looks up to Marcus as a big brother.
