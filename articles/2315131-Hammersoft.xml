'''Leonard Whiting''' (born June 30, 1950) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] actor who starred as Romeo in the 1968 [[Franco Zeffirelli|Zeffirelli]] [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|film version of ''Romeo and Juliet'']] opposite [[Olivia Hussey]]'s Juliet, a role which earned him the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actor]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Whiting was born in the [[Wood Green]] area of [[London]], [[England]], the only son of Arthur Leonard Whiting and Peggy Joyce O'Sullivan. He has [[England|English]], [[Ireland|Irish]] and some [[Romani people|Romani]]/[[Romani people|Gypsy]] ancestry.[http://members.tripod.com/~lenpage/LW95.htm] Whiting attended the St. Richard of Chichester School, [[Camden Town]], leaving just a week or two before beginning work on ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1968).

===Career===
Whiting was spotted by an agent at a recording studio at the age of 12. After hearing him sing, the agent suggested he try out for [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]'' which constantly needed replacements for its child performers. Whiting played the [[Artful Dodger]] in the long-running London musical for 18 months, and for 13 months appeared at [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in the production of Congreve's &quot;Love for Love&quot; opposite Olivier, which toured [[Moscow]] and [[Berlin]].

Director [[Franco Zeffirelli]] described his discovery, made from 300 youngsters who auditioned during more than three months: &quot;He has a magnificent face, gentle melancholy, sweet, the kind of idealistic young man Romeo ought to be.&quot; 

In the mid-1970s, his voice caught the attention of ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' engineer [[Alan Parsons]], who was in the process of recording what was to be the first album by [[The Alan Parsons Project]], ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]''. Whiting performed lead vocals on the song &quot;[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]&quot;.

Whiting ended his film career, for the most part, in the mid-70s and subsequently placed his
focus upon his theatrical career as an actor and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brennan|first=Sandra|title=Biography|url=http://www.starpulse.com|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whiting now lives in the [[Haverstock]] area of London.
