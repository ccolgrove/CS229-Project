'''Kenneth Gene Caminiti''' (April 21, 1963 &amp;ndash; October 10, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[third baseman]] in [[Major League Baseball]] and the 1996 [[National League]] Most Valuable Player. He was born in [[Hanford, California]], and attended [[San Jose State University]]. He died of a [[drug overdose]] on October 10, 2004.

==High school years==
Caminiti attended [[Leigh High School]] in San Jose, California and played football, basketball and baseball. In football, he was invited to many all-star games after his senior football season.

==Baseball career==
===Minor leagues===
Caminiti played professional baseball for 15 seasons, beginning with the Osceola Astros of the Single-A [[Florida State League]] in {{by|1985}}. He also played third base for the [[Indios de MayagÃ¼ez]] along with [[Wally Joyner]] in the Puerto Rico Winter League. He earned a call-up to the Double-A [[Columbus Astros]] in 1987.

===Major leagues===
He made his major league debut at age 24 with the [[Houston Astros]] on July 16, 1987. In {{by|1988}}, Caminiti returned to the minor leagues, playing with the Triple-A [[Tucson Toros]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], before he was called up to stay late in the season.

After 6 full seasons in Houston, Caminiti was traded to the [[San Diego Padres]] after the {{by|1994}} season in a 12-player trade. In San Diego he reached career highs at the plate by hitting .302 with 26 home runs and 94 RBI in 1995, which rose to .326/40/130 in {{by|1996}}. His 1996 performance earned him the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|National League Most Valuable Player Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-224232.html Caminiti Died of Overdose] Washington Post. November 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caminiti returned to Houston as a [[free agent]] in {{by|1999}}, where he played for two more seasons. He was slowed by injuries during his second tenure in Houston, and after struggling the first half of {{by|2001}} with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], he was released and finished his [[career]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]], who moved him across the infield in an effort to fulfill their desire for a power-hitting [[first baseman]].

===Awards===
Caminiti won 3 [[Gold Glove Award]]s while playing for the Padres&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/7578054/ Padres to hold Ken Caminiti Night] AP. NBC Sports MSNBC. Wed., April 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in {{by|1995}}, {{by|1996}}, and {{by|1997}}, and he was unanimously selected as the [[National League]]'s [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] in 1996. In {{by|1994}}, 1996, and 1997, he appeared in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star Game]].

==Post-baseball career==
Following his playing career in baseball, Caminiti was hired by the Padres to be a [[spring training]] instructor for his former team.

Caminiti entered into a partnership with actor [[Jason Gedrick]] and hockey player [[Mario Lemieux]] to open a cigar bar called Ashes Cigar Club on Wall Street.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tobaccocontrol.neu.edu/tcu/tcu01.3,4/Contents/cigars.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2010}}

==Substance abuse==
Caminiti struggled with [[substance abuse]] throughout his career. He admitted in {{by|1994}} to having a problem with [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and checked himself into a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center in {{by|2000}}. In a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' cover story in {{by|2002}}, a year after his retirement, he admitted that he had used [[anabolic steroid|steroids]] during his 1996 MVP season, and for several seasons afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/magazine/03/02/flashback_juiced/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  His admitted steroid abuse was discussed in the 2007 [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]] on steroid abuse in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Caminiti also had a long struggle with [[cocaine]], having been arrested in March 2001 for possession and sentenced to [[probation]].   

After he had tested positive for cocaine while on probation for cocaine possession, a Houston judge ordered Caminiti to visit a [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]]-operated treatment program in February 2003. In May the program was eliminated, so he was forced to leave. Caminiti completed most of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Nowell, Scott. &quot;Prison Break?&quot; ''[[Houston Press]]''. Thursday July 17, 2003. [http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-07-17/news/prison-break/ 1]. Retrieved on September 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2004 &amp;ndash; just five days prior to his death &amp;ndash; he admitted in a [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] court that he had violated his probation. He tested positive for cocaine in September 2004. It was his fourth such violation and he was sentenced to 180 days in prison but given credit for time already served and released.

==Death==
Caminiti died at [[Lincoln Hospital (Bronx, New York)|Lincoln Hospital]] in [[The Bronx]] on October 10, 2004. Preliminary news reports indicated he died of a heart attack,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-123062574.html Former baseball MVP Caminiti dies at 41]. Mark Emmons. San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, CA). October 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but the autopsy results stated that  &quot;acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates&quot; caused his  death, with [[coronary artery disease]] and cardiac [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] (an enlarged [[heart]]) as contributing factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/727751171.html?dids=727751171:727751171&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+02%2C+2004&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Record&amp;desc=Caminiti's+death+ruled+accidental+drug+overdose&amp;pqatl=google Caminiti's death ruled accidental drug overdose] The Record - Kitchener, Ont. Nov 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Silva, an acquaintance of Caminiti who spent part of the day with him on October 10, told ''[[Newsday]]'' that Caminiti was edgy and depressed on the day he died, but also said he did not witness Caminiti using drugs on that day.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
