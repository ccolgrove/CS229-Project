'''''Metamorphosis''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Hilary Duff]]. Promoted as her debut album, it was released on August 26, 2003 by Buena Vista and [[Hollywood Records]] as a follow up to her holiday album, ''[[Santa Claus Lane]]'' (2002). According to Duff, the album incorporates elements of pop and rock music, and it represents changes that are specific to her life and that everyone experiences. Duff worked with several producers on the album, mostly notably [[The Matrix (production team)|The Matrix]], who were well known at the time for their work with [[Avril Lavigne]]. Others who collaborated on the album include [[Chico Bennett]], [[Matthew Gerrard]], [[John Shanks]] and his frequent writing partner [[Kara DioGuardi]].

''Metamorphosis'' was released shortly after Duff's departure from [[Disney]]'s ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' franchise, and it coincided with other high profile projects in which she was involved in other media.{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} The album received mixed reviews from music critics; some complemented it for being a modern-day [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] album, while others considered the album to be a promotional gimmick for the singer, lacking real substance. The album debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 203,000 copies in its first week, becoming the highest opening week sales figure for a debut album by a female artist in 2003. The album became the eighth best selling album of 2003 in the US, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], selling 2.6 million copies in a period of five months. By late 2005, the album had sold five million copies worldwide. For Hollywood Records, ''Metamorphosis'' was the label's first high seller in several years, and led to the company's further successful cultivation of new artists and brands using the [[Disney Channel]].

Three singles were released from the album. The lead single, &quot;[[So Yesterday]]&quot;, was released in July 2003 to mixed reception. The song failed to make much of an impact in the US, peaking in the top fifty. Internationally, it peaked within the top ten of music charts in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The album's second single, &quot;[[Come Clean (Hilary Duff song)|Come Clean]]&quot;, released in early 2004, had the same effect. The third and final single from the album, &quot;[[The Little Voice|Little Voice]]&quot; was only released in Australia. Duff further promoted the album with the Metamorphosis Tour that began in November 2003.

== Background  ==
[[Hilary Duff]] had always wanted to follow in the footsteps of her elder sister, [[Haylie Duff|Haylie]]. Duff watched her sister rehearsing in 2001, after which she told her mother that she wanted to be involved in singing.&lt;ref name=EW-Aug2003/&gt; During the same time period, she attended a [[Radio Disney]] concert where she met Andre Recke, whose client [[Myra (singer)|Myra]] was performing. According to Duff, watching the pop musicians preparing and warming up backstage at the concert made her think, &quot;I want to do this so bad&quot;.&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jan2004&gt;Rosen, Craig. [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2076149 &quot;Hilary Duff: A Performer's Metamorphosis&quot;]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. January 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Recke said he thought Duff, who was popular with preteens at the time because of her role in the popular [[Disney Channel]] original series ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', had &quot;something special ... Sometimes you just have that feeling, that, 'Wow, she's a star.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jan2004/&gt; After becoming determined to start a music career, Duff resumed her vocal lessonsâwhich she had started before her acting career beganâand became one of Recke's clients. &quot;I've always had a big drive&quot;, she said. &quot;When I felt like something looked fun or I wanted to accomplish something, I really just go for it&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;I didn't really know what it was gonna be like, but I knew I wanted to try it and I knew that I could do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=NewsTimesJan2005&gt;[http://www.hilaryontheweb.com/news/2005/january/21012005_Hilary%20Duff%20comes%20clean.html &quot;Hilary Duff comes clean&quot;]. ''News Times''. January 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Duff recorded several songs for Disney soundtrack and compilation albums, and a Christmas album, ''[[Santa Claus Lane]]'', in 2002. Her songs &quot;[[I Can't Wait (Brooke McClymont song)|I Can't Wait]]&quot;, &quot;[[Why Not (song)|Why Not]]&quot; and &quot;What Dreams Are Made Of&quot; were hits on Radio Disney, but Recke and executives at [[Buena Vista Music Group]] envisioned ''Metamorphosis'' as a vehicle by which Duff could reach a more mature audience.&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jan2004/&gt;

== Recording and production ==
Duff, her mother Susan, and Recke enlisted the songwriting and production team [[The Matrix (production team)|The Matrix]]âwhom Recke had previously hired to write songs for Myra's 2001 [[Myra (album)|eponymous debut album]]âand songwriter [[Charlie Midnight]], who had contributed to ''Santa Claus Lane'' (2002). According to Duff, her, her mother and Recke worked very hard to get music that she related to and was age-appropriate for her.&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jan2004/&gt; Duff said that she did not want to make &quot;a really poppy album&quot; because that was not the type of music she listened to.&lt;ref name=EW-Aug2003/&gt; The presence of The Matrix was noted because of their work on [[Avril Lavigne]]'s highly successful debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'' (2002), but Duff said that did not want to emulate other artists: &quot;There are definitely people I respect and I love their music, but there was never really an artist that I said, 'I want to be just like them...' ... I wanted to be like myself&quot;.&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jan2004/&gt;

According to Duff, although she did not write most of the songs, she collaborated on each of them.&lt;ref name=GirlsLife-AugSep2003&gt;Bryson, Jodi. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBX/is_1_10/ai_106059240 &quot;Life after Lizzie - Hangin With - Hilary Duff&quot;]. ''[[Girls' Life (magazine)|Girls' Life]]''. AugustâSeptember 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from The Matrix and Charlie Midnight, contributions to the album came from [[singer-songwriter]] [[Meredith Brooks]], [[Kara DioGuardi]], [[Matthew Gerrard]], [[John Shanks]] and Duff's sister, Haylie, who Duff said knows her better than &quot;anyone else in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=hilaryduffdotcom/&gt; Duff discussed her feelings with some of the songwriters, and she praised them because they were open to her opinions and &quot;really got it&quot;.&lt;ref name=hilaryduffdotcom/&gt; She said that she would have liked more time to work with the songwriters and co-write more of her own material, saying &quot;I feel like you need time to really get in touch with yourself to do that&quot;.&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jan2004/&gt; In May 2004, Meredith Brooks, writer and producer of &quot;Party Up&quot;, complained about the million-dollar budgets major labels spend to produce albums, saying &quot;There's something seriously wrong with all that! You can't keep that going. Artists have to sell millions of records for anybody to make money off of those bloated budgets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_meredith_brooks_redefines/ |title=Meredith Brooks interview-interview with singer/songwriter Meredith Brooks on A&amp;R |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=2004-05-01 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept and musical style ==
Duff described the album as &quot;pop music &lt;!-- but it --&gt;[that] has some more [[rock music|rock]] and edginess to it&quot;;&lt;ref name=EW-Aug2003&gt;Hiatt, Brian. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,474123,00.html &quot;Duff Enough&quot;]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. August 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; she said the type of music was &quot;somewhere in between&quot; pop and &quot;[[hard rock|hardcore rock]]&quot;, but that she did not know how to explain it. According to her, there is &quot;a lot of different music&quot; on ''Metamorphosis'' that she finds difficult to categorise.&lt;ref name=MTVMovieHouse-Jun2003&gt;Downey, Ryan. J. [http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/movie_house/hillaryduff_news_feature_060203/ &quot;Hilary Duff: Not Just for Kids&quot;]. [[MTV.com]]. June 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The music on the album is &quot;a little different&quot; from her previous music because, according to her, the album &quot;has all the kinds of music I like to listen to&quot;. She said that there are many &quot;different sounds&quot; on the album, such as rock and [[electronic music|electronic]], and &quot;a whole range&quot; of [[tempo (music)|tempo]]s, including &quot;deep, slow&quot; tracks and &quot;high-energy&quot; songs to provide her with a &quot;boost&quot;. According to Duff, everyone experiences varied feelings and moods, and they can &quot;feel a bit better&quot; by playing their favorite song.&lt;ref name=hilaryduffdotcom/&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine described the album as &quot;a slick collection of pop songs, master-crafted to appeal to huge numbers of young people&quot;.&lt;ref name=RollingStone-Aug2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5940065/teenager_of_the_year |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090215095447/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5940065/teenager_of_the_year |archivedate=2009-02-15 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-02-15 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duff told the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' in 2005 she was under the control of the record label during the making of ''Metamorphosis'' and her second album, ''[[Hilary Duff (album)|Hilary Duff]]'' (2004), and could not incorporate the sound she wanted into her recordings. She said the production &quot;[had&lt;!-- has --&gt;] been [[audio mastering|master]]ed and sounds really pretty ... If I could change it, I would, and it would sound [less pop]. My name is Hilary Duff, and I don't know why I don't get to make Hilary Duff music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050719/ai_n14877317 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071015200240/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050719/ai_n14877317 |archivedate=2007-10-15 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the release of ''Santa Claus Lane'', ''Metamorphosis'' is considered Duff's &quot;proper&quot; debut album.&lt;ref name=RollingStone-Aug2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeckell, Barry A.

June 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duff said the album represented &quot;kind of a change&quot; because it was &quot;kind of different&quot; from anything she had previously done;&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Lynda. [http://www.themovieinsider.com/interviews/interview.php?cid=117 &quot;Hilary Duff: A Teenage Sensation&quot;]. themovieinsider.com. March 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; as she put it, &quot;We called the album ''Metamorphosis'' because it's about changes that everybody experiences&quot;.&lt;ref name=BusinessWire-Aug252003/&gt; Duff called change &quot;a very important and natural thing&quot;, saying that the album was a good way to introduce everyone to &quot;the real me&quot; because, in her words, &quot;Everyone evolves and changes&quot;.&lt;ref name=hilaryduffdotcom/&gt; She said she was &quot;excited&quot; about ''Metamorphosis'' because it represented her rather than characters she played: &quot;It's more personal than acting&quot;, she said;&lt;ref name=GirlsLife-AugSep2003/&gt; however, she said that the album was &quot;not just about me&quot;.&lt;ref name=BusinessWire-Aug252003/&gt; Duff said she believed her music provided a way for people to get to disassociate her from her [[Lizzie McGuire (character)|Lizzie McGuire]] persona, a goal she said was &quot;so important to me&quot;.&lt;ref name=MTVMovieHouse-Jun2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP-Aug2003&gt;Moody, Nekesa Mumbi.

== Composition ==
[[File:AvrilVancouver.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The presence of [[The Matrix (production team)|The Matrix]] raised similarities to the work of [[Avril Lavigne]].]]

The album opens with its [[lead single]] &quot;[[So Yesterday]]&quot;, that according to Duff, is an empowering song about breaking up with someone and getting over it.&lt;ref name=EW-Aug2003/&gt; The song, that incorporates elements of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], was cited as having influences of [[Avril Lavigne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url ={{Allmusic|class=album|id=metamorphosis-r651320/review|pure_url=yes}}|title =Metamorphosis &gt; Hilary Duff &gt; Allmusic|publisher =Allmusic|accessdate =2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second song on the album, and second single, &quot;[[Come Clean (Hilary Duff song)|Come Clean]]&quot; documents a relationship between a boy and a girl who feel they are &quot;in the dark&quot; about each other; in Duff's words: &quot;they're coming clean, whether it means they're gonna be together or not.&quot;&lt;ref name=NewsTimesJan2005/&gt; The third song on the album, &quot;Workin' It Out&quot;.

The fourth song and third single is &quot;[[The Little Voice|Little Voice]]&quot;, a re-revision of the 2000 single &quot;The Little Voice&quot; by Swedish recording artist [[Sahlene]]. The song speaks of having a conversation with ones conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rettenmund |first= Matthew|title= Hilary Duff: All Access |publisher= Berkley Trade |year= 2005 |month= July |isbn= 0425205193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth song on the album &quot;Where Did I Go Right?&quot;. The album's sixth song &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot;.

The album's seventh song, &quot;The Math&quot;. The eight song &quot;Love Just Is&quot;. The ninth song &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; is a song that Duff described as being &quot;really fun&quot;, and relateable to what she was going at the time.&lt;ref name=hilaryduffdotcom&gt;[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Hilary-Duff-Biography/DDF3214E3E845D9848256C9D000EE18B &quot;Hilary Duff Biography&quot;]. hilaryduff.com via sing365.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Party Up&quot;, the tenth song on ''Metamorphosis''. The album's title track &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; is a song about &quot;getting over a boy&quot;. Duff insisted the song was not about fellow singer and ex-boyfriend [[Aaron Carter]], with whom she was rumored to have broken up after a fight.&lt;ref name=GirlsLife-AugSep2003/&gt; &quot;Inner Strength&quot; is, &quot;[v]ery empowering and uplifting&quot; and &quot;really beautiful&quot;.&lt;ref name=hilaryduffdotcom&gt;[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Hilary-Duff-Biography/DDF3214E3E845D9848256C9D000EE18B &quot;Hilary Duff Biography&quot;]. hilaryduff.com via sing365.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The final song on the album, &quot;[[Why Not (song)|Why Not]]&quot; was previously released on the [[The Lizzie McGuire Movie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'', a film in which Duff starred in.

== Marketing and promotion ==
During the period in which ''Metamorphosis'' was released, Duff was participating in many projects in film, [[brand licensing]], music and television; ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote in July 2003 that she was emerging as &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; and &quot;a marketing powerhouse&quot; with nine to twelve year-olds, and ''Billboard'' magazine said that she &quot;is looking to become more than just the nation's next teen [[pop princess]]. She wants to become a brand-name phenomenon ... [''Metamorphosis''] is just the beginning.&quot;&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jun2003&gt;Traiman, Steve. [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1924257 &quot;Hilary Duff Plots Album, Merchandise Bonanza&quot;]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. June 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These projects included the high profile Hollywood films ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (2003) and ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'' (2004), a clothing and accessories line called [[Stuff by Hilary Duff]], a ''Lizzie McGuire'' merchandise line, and a [[VISA]] prepaid credit card for children aged six to thirteen.&lt;ref name=USAToday-Jul2003/&gt; She also participated in a marketing campaign for the [[Hasbro]] personal video player [[VideoNow]], for which she filmed the video ''A Day in the Life of Hilary Duff'', which included a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the &quot;Why Not&quot; music video. Entertainment lawyer Larry Golring called it &quot;a great cross-promotion&quot; for VideoNow and Duff's music career, which he said were &quot;two new brands that are going to be huge this time next year, and they hopefully will have helped each other get there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20030502/ai_n10869560 &quot;Hilary Duff thinks big and small&quot;]. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. May 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] quoted Bob Cavallo, the chairman of Buena Vista Music Group, as saying that &quot;At this point, she's obviously already a franchise&quot;.&lt;ref name=AP-Aug2003/&gt;

Marketing people such as Laura Groppe, president of Girls Intelligence Agency, said that the timing of the release of ''Metamorphosis'' and other Duff-related products was right because there had been a lack of [[teen idol]]s since [[Britney Spears]], and that Duff &quot;[is] not too pretty. Not too thin. Not too anything ... like a little [[Meg Ryan]].&quot;&lt;ref name=USAToday-Jul2003/&gt; According to Marketing Evaluations/TvQ, Duff was, in July 2003, the female star most popular with kids aged between six and eleven.&lt;ref name=USAToday-Jul2003/&gt; Amy Doyle, at MTV's vice president of music programming, said Duff was &quot;definitely one of the hot people to watch ... She's become the fabric of pop culture with teens right now.&quot;&lt;ref name=GirlsLife-AugSep2003/&gt; There was concern from some, however, that Duff could become overexposed, although Duff's manager emphasised his selectiveness against &quot;[i]f something looks cheesy&quot;, and that Duff &quot;doesn't want to be all over TV commercials&quot;.&lt;ref name=USAToday-Jul2003/&gt; Others, such as Robert Thorne, the CEO of the [[Olsen twins]]' Dualstar Entertainment, said that Duff should have stayed with [[The Walt Disney Company]]&amp;nbsp;â from which she separated after contract negotiations broke down&amp;nbsp;â to build the ''Lizzie McGuire'' franchise and use it to help develop her career into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Allison Hope.

June 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this split, the profile of Duff and the album was supported by the DVD release of ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'' and reruns of ''Lizzie McGuire'' episodes on the Disney Channel for two [[television season|season]]s. Duff herself said that ''Lizzie McGuire'' was &quot;a great place to begin my career&quot;, but said that &quot;it's exciting to go out on my own&quot; with ''Metamorphosis''.&lt;ref name=Billboard-Jun2003/&gt;

Before the release of the album, and beginning in July 2003, Duff and ''Metamorphosis'' were given substantial promotional support from MTV, which highlighted &quot;So Yesterday&quot; on ''[[Making the Video]]'' and ''[[Total Request Live]]''; Duff co-hosted the special ''TRL's All-Star Backyard BBQ''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_July_14/ai_105364086 &quot;MTV Premieres Hilary Duff's New Music Video; First Single, &quot;So Yesterday&quot;, Goes to Radio on July 15&quot;].
