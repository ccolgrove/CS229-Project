'''Coast''' is a [[New Zealand]] [[radio network]] owned by [[The Radio Network]] that plays [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] music with an emphasis on music from the fifties and sixties. A live breakfast show presented by Kim Adamson, along with programmes presented by Jacqui Taite and Rick Morin from [[Auckland]] studios are broadcast across the network's fifteen stations, except for a local breakfast breakout for [[Hawera]].

Coast begins every hour with a four minute [[Newstalk ZB]] news and sports bulletin and a [[MetService]] weather update. The rest of the hour consists of music, comments from the presenter on the music being played and issues of the day, and up to three [[Radio advertisement|commercial breaks]] of no more than 60 seconds each. There are also Newstalk ZB business news bulletins at 06:30, 12:30 and 17:30 on weekdays.

During weekdays, the national weather report is read out by the previous hour's presenter, however in the weekends a 30-second localised forecast is aired, pre-recorded for each market from the Newstalk ZB Timesaver Traffic Center. Other stations of TRN also air these forecasts on their stations. 

''Coast'' should not be confused with '''Coast FM''', which is an unrelated, independently owned and operated radio network, based in [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]] on the West Coast of the [[South Island]].''

The head office and main studios of Coast are located on the corner of Cook &amp; Nelson Streets in [[Auckland City]], along with the other seven stations of The Radio Network.

==History==
Coast originally started in [[Hawkes Bay]] in 2002 as a local station. The history of this station dates back to 1995 as [[The Wireless Station]] broadcasting on 1530AM and playing music from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s; The Wireless station was operated by the Hawke's Bay Media Group. The station was rebranded as [[Gold 1530AM|Goodtime Gold]] in 1998, playing music from the 1960s and 1970s and in 1999 became ''Gold 1530.'' This station was sold to The Radio Network in 2000 and was rebranded as [[Jammin' Oldies 1530]] or JO 1530. The final rebranding of this station was to the current name Coast 1530.

In 2004 the station became voice tracked from [[Auckland]] in preparation for the station's launch in the Auckland market. On the 26th of April 2004 Coast launched in Auckland with the Auckland based programme being networked back to Hawkes Bay. Later in 2004 Coast was networked to other markets around New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theradiovault.net/napier_hastings.htm The Radio Vault - Napier/Hastings]&lt;/ref&gt;

All Coast stations take the same networked programme from Auckland except [[Hawera, New Zealand|Hawera]], which has its own local breakfast show called &quot;The 1557 Breakfast.&quot; This show was originally played on [[Newstalk ZB]] in the Hawera region when Newstalk ZB broadcast on 1557AM. After Newstalk ZB in Hawera moved to 1278AM this show was dropped and replaced with the Auckland based show but later picked up by Coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theradiovault.net/hawera.htm The Radio Vault - Hawera]&lt;/ref&gt;

That's the Story hosted by [[Ronnie Mackie]] which is played between 7.00am and 8.00am on Sunday mornings where it was played on [[Classic Hits FM]].

The breakfast host since the station's foundation, well-known radio veteran Mike Oliver, left the station in 2011.
