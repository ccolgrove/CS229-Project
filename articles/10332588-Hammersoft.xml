The '''2006â07 [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt Commodores]] menâs basketball team''' finished with a 22â12 record ([[Southeastern Conference|SEC East]]: 10â6, 2nd) and reached the Sweet 16 of the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The Commodores were ranked No. 19 in the final [[Coaches Poll|ESPN/USA Today (Coaches) poll]].

The team was led by head coach [[Kevin Stallings]] and played its home games at [[Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University)|Memorial Gymnasium]]. 

==Preseason outlook==
Entering the season, Vanderbilt was picked by the media attending the SEC's media days in October to finish 4th in a strong SEC East, behind the defending national champion [[Florida Gators|Florida]], [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee Vols|Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vucommodores.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/102606aaa.html|title=VU Makes Appearance at SEC Hoops Media Days|publisher=CSTV.com|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They returned three starters: swingmen [[Shan Foster]] and [[Derrick Byars]] and point guard Alex Gordon. Foster was their leading scorer last season and was the third-leading returning scorer in the SEC. Vanderbilt lost two starters: [[Julian Terrell]], their top rebounder (7.2 rpg), and rising-junior [[DeMarre Carroll]], their second-leading scorer (12.1 ppg). Terrell graduated, while Carroll unexpectedly decided to transfer to [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]] shortly after the 2005â06 season ended, a decision influenced by the fact that Mizzou's new head coach [[Mike Anderson (basketball coach)|Mike Anderson]] is his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vucommodores.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/041806aaa.html|title=DeMarre Carroll Leaving Vanderbilt|publisher=CSTV.com|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junior [[Shan Foster]] was named by the leagueâs coaches to the preseason all-SEC first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/1440|title=Foster wins preseason honors|publisher=InsideVandy.com |accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular season==
The Commodores got off to a rocky 1â3 start that included an embarrassing home loss to [[Furman University|Furman]] (15â16 final record, 8â10 [[Southern Conference]]). After that, Vanderbilt won 17 of their next 22 games, culminating in an 83â70 home win over then-No. 1 [[Florida Gators basketball|Florida]] (33â5, SEC East: 14â2, 1st). They entered the NCAA Tournament winning only 2 of their last 5 games, including two losses to [[Arkansas Razorbacks basketball|Arkansas]] (21â14, SEC West: 7â9, 3rd), but one of the wins was a come-from-behind 67â65 home win over [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] (22â12, SEC East: 9â7, 4th), their fourth straight win over the Wildcats.

Vanderbilt finished the regular season tied for 2nd with [[Tennessee Volunteers|Tennessee]] (24â11, SEC East: 10â6) in the SEC East, four games behind eventual national champion Florida (35â5, SEC East: 14â2, 1st).

==NCAA tournament==
The Commodores were the No. 6 seed in the East Regional and lost 66â65 to No. 2 seeded [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] (30â6, Big East: 13â3, 1st) at [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. The Commodores defeated No. 11 seeded [[George Washington University|George Washington]] (23â9, A-10: 11â5, 3rd) in the first round, 77â44, and No. 3 seeded [[Washington State Cougars|Washington State]] (26â7, Pac-10: 13â5, 2nd), 78â74, in two overtimes, at [[ARCO Arena]] in [[Sacramento, California]].

==Awards==
Following the end of the regular season, head coach [[Kevin Stallings]] was named SEC Coach of the Year by his fellow SEC coaches, while senior [[Derrick Byars]] was named SEC Player of the Year by the league coaches (the [[Associated Press|AP]] chose [[Chris Lofton]] of Tennessee). Stallings has now led the Commodores to 20 wins in three of the last four seasons. Byars led the Commodores in scoring with 17.0 points per game and was a unanimous selection to the All-SEC first team. Junior [[Shan Foster]], who averaged 15.6 points per game, was named to the All-SEC second team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070308/SPORTS0602/703080416/1002|title=Coaches say Byars SEC's best|publisher=Tennessean.com |accessdate=2007-03-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Including NCAA Tournament games, Vanderbilt finished the season 7â3 against teams ranked in the Top 25. Only North Carolina and UCLA had more wins against ranked opponents
