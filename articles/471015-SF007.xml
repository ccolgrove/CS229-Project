'''Doxygen''' is a [[documentation generator]] for multiple [[programming language]]s.

Doxygen is a tool for writing software reference documentation. The documentation is written within code, and is thus relatively easy to keep up to date. Doxygen can cross reference documentation and code, so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code.

Doxygen is [[free software]], released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

== Design ==

Like [[Javadoc]], Doxygen extracts documentation from source file comments. In addition to the Javadoc syntax, Doxygen supports the documentation tags used in the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt toolkit]] and can generate output in HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) as well as in [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help]] (CHM), [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF), [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF), [[LaTeX]], [[PostScript]] or [[man page]]s.

== Uses ==

Doxygen can be used with [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Fortran]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Objective-C]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Interface description language|IDL]] ([[Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]] and Microsoft flavors), [[VHDL]], and to some extent [[D (programming language)|D]].

It runs on most [[Unix-like]] systems, [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

The first version of Doxygen borrowed some code from an old version of DOC++; later, the Doxygen code was rewritten by Dimitri van Heesch.

== Example code ==
[[Image:Doxygen ouput.png|thumb|A screenshot of what the output would look like in HTML]]

The generic syntax of documentation comments is to start a comment with an extra asterisk after the leading comment delimiter '/*':

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/**
&lt;A short one line description&gt;

&lt;Longer description&gt;
&lt;May span multiple lines or paragraphs as needed&gt;

@param  Description of method's or function's input parameter
@param  ...
@return Description of the return value
*/
&lt;/source&gt;

Many programmers like to mark the start of each line with space-asterisk-space, as follows, but that is not necessary.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/**
 * &lt;A short one line description&gt;
 *
 * &lt;Longer description&gt;
 * &lt;May span multiple lines or paragraphs as needed&gt;
 *
 * @param  Description of method's or function's input parameter
 * @param  ...
 * @return Description of the return value
 */
&lt;/source&gt;

The following illustrates how a [[C++]] source file can be documented.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

/**

 */

class Time {

    public:

       /**
        * Constructor that sets the time to a given value.
        *
        * @param timemillis Number of milliseconds
        *        passed since Jan 1, 1970.
        */
       Time (int timemillis) {
           // the code
       }

       /**
        * Get the current time.
        *
        * @return A time object set to the current time.
        */
       static Time now () {
           // the code
       }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

An alternative approach for documenting parameters is shown below. It will produce the same documentation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
       /**
        * Constructor that sets the time to a given value.
        */
       Time (int timemillis ///&lt; Number of milliseconds passed since Jan 1, 1970.
            )
       {
           // the code
       }
&lt;/source&gt;

Richer markup is also possible.  For instance, add equations using [[LaTeX]] commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/**
 *
 * An inline equation @f$ e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 @f$
 *
 * A displayed equation: @f[ e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 @f]
 *
 */
&lt;/source&gt;
