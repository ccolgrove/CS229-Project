'''Texas vs. Ohio State football game''', played September 10, 2005, was the first-ever meeting between [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] in a [[college football]] game. The two teams came into the game ranked No.&amp;nbsp;2 and No.&amp;nbsp;4, respectively. It was the second game of the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005 season]] for both teams. Schools have become increasingly conservative in scheduling non-conference opponents of a high caliber, so a meeting of two top-five teams in the country was unusual this early in the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early power&quot;/&gt; For either team, winning the game would boost their chances of ultimately playing in the [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|BCS National Championship Game]] while the loser likely faced the end of their national championship hopes.

According to observers such as ''[[USA Today]]'', the match-up between the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]] and the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] was one of the most-anticipated games of the 2005 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA-OSU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckeyes welcome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boi from Troy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vmag&quot;/&gt;  Due to the high level of anticipation, [[ESPN]] chose the game for the location of its weekly [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]] broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckeyes welcome&quot;/&gt;

The [[2005 Texas Longhorn football team]] (variously &quot;Texas&quot; or &quot;UT&quot; or the &quot;Horns&quot;) was coached by head football coach [[Mack Brown]] and led on the field by [[quarterback]] [[Vince Young]]. The [[2005 Ohio State Buckeyes football team]] (variously &quot;Ohio State&quot; or &quot;OSU&quot; or the &quot;Bucks&quot;) was coached by [[Jim Tressel]].  [[Justin Zwick]] and [[Troy Smith]] shared time as quarterback due to disciplinary measures enforced against Smith. The game was a back-and-forth affair which was ultimately won by Texas, 25-22. The game's attendance was 105,565, which set the then all-time attendance record for [[Ohio Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU-box&quot;/&gt;  The game was televised nationally on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and drew 9.9&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDB&quot;/&gt;

[[ESPN]] and ''College Football Rivals'', were among the observers who named the game one of the best football games of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;best of the best&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;revenge games&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot;/&gt;  Texas' win kept them near the front of the national championship picture. They ultimately finished the season unbeaten, snaring the [[Big 12 Conference]] and [[NCAA]] championships. Ohio State finished the season with ten&amp;nbsp;wins and two&amp;nbsp;losses and ranked No.&amp;nbsp;4 in the nation.

==Leading into the 2005 season==

The [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] and the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]] are two of the most storied programs in college football.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckeyes welcome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tickco.com/sports/NCAA_Football/ohio_state_football_tickets.htm | title=Ohio State Football Tickets | publisher=TickCo | accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://friends.macjournals.com/mattd/bcswins2002 | title=The BCS wins after all | publisher=Life and Deatherage | accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swagger&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU recap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 5 teams&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/09/07/Sports/Top-5.Teams.Prepare.For.Primetime-977296.shtml | title=Top 5 teams prepare for primetime | publisher=The Daily Texan | date=September 5, 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-12|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930220943/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/09/07/Sports/Top-5.Teams.Prepare.For.Primetime-977296.shtml |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before 2005 each school had participated in college football for more than 100&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 5 teams&quot;/&gt;  They are home to nationally known traditions from the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football#Buckeye football traditions|Buckeye leaf stickers]] and the [[The Ohio State University Marching Band#Ramp Entrance|O-H-I-O chant]] at Ohio State to [[Bevo (mascot)|Bevo]] and the [[Hook 'em Horns]] of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/trads/osu-m-footbl-trad.html | title=Ohio State Football Traditions | publisher=Ohio State University | accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Longhorns, the Buckeyes are an elite football program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://story.scout.com/a.z?s=145&amp;p=2&amp;c=631803 | title=Gators and Buckeyes prove you can win at both | publisher=Scout.com | author=Kendall, Josh | date=April 1, 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/s/content/oh/story/sports/college/osu/2007/04/02/ddn040207osufootball.html | title=Football team's loss motivates Buckeyes - 'You want to win this game for our football team.

The 2005&amp;nbsp;UT team was attempting to follow on the success of the 2004&amp;nbsp;season, in which quarterback Vince Young led the team to Mack Brown's first [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) game in the 2005 Rose Bowl and a top-5 finish in the polls. With the exception of [[Cedric Benson]], [[Derrick Johnson]], and [[Bo Scaife]], Texas returned most of their key players from 2004â2005, including [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] junior quarterback Vince Young.

Texas was given a pre-season No.&amp;nbsp;2 ranking (behind defending National Champions [[University of Southern California]]) by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine and was also ranked second in the pre-season [[Associated Press Poll]] and ''[[USA Today]]'' [[Coaches Poll]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Preseason consensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://preseason.stassen.com/consensus/2005.html#national | title=2005 Preseason Consensus | publisher=Stassen.com | accessdate=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This created anticipation that Texas might play for the national championship if they could win their road game against Ohio State University&lt;ref name=&quot;play for&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200509100033 | title=(2) Texas - (4) Ohio State | publisher=Yahoo.com | date=September 10, 2005 | accessdate=2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if they could snap their five-game losing streak against the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] who started the season [[2005 Oklahoma Sooners football team|ranked at No. 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;road to Rose clear&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/10/13/Sports/Longhorns.Road.To.The.Rose.Bowl.Is.Clear-1432097.shtml?sourcedomain=www.michigandaily.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | title=Longhorns' road to the Rose Bowl is clear|authors=Geise, John &amp; Kia Hamadanch|publisher=The Michigan Daily|date=October 13, 2005|accessdate=2009-06-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080119234643/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/10/13/Sports/Longhorns.Road.To.The.Rose.Bowl.Is.Clear-1432097.shtml?sourcedomain=www.michigandaily.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |archivedate = 2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio State had similarly high pre-season expectations with their No.&amp;nbsp;4 ranking. There was preseason speculation they might win the [[Big Ten Conference]] and possibly even to have a chance at the national championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckeyes return&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.docsports.com/ohio-state-buckeyes.html | title=Ohio State Buckeyes Return to the Top | date=July 15, 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team featured a &quot;dynamic duo&quot; of wide receivers in [[Ted Ginn, Jr]]. and [[Santonio Holmes]]. Holmes entered his junior year as the No.&amp;nbsp;1 receiver for the Buckeyes after catching a pass in every game he played during the 2004&amp;nbsp;season; he finished the season with 769&amp;nbsp;yards and seven&amp;nbsp;touchdowns on 55&amp;nbsp;catches. Ginn was known for his explosive plays and versatility. For instance in the 2004 game&amp;nbsp;against the [[Michigan State Spartans]], he scored three&amp;nbsp;touchdowns (one&amp;nbsp;rushing, one&amp;nbsp;receiving, and one&amp;nbsp;[[Punt (football)|punt]] return).&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckeyes return&quot;/&gt;

For either team to play in the national title game, that team had to end up [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football rankings|ranked No. 1 or No. 2]] at the end of the regular season. Since the [[Bowl Championship Series]] was formed in 1998, 9&amp;nbsp;of the 14&amp;nbsp;teams were unbeaten going into the championship game.&lt;ref name=&quot;on-the-line&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14687967 | title=Ohio State, Texas put BCS hopes on line - Nos. 1-, 2-ranked teams can't afford loss in big matchup Saturday | agency=Associated Press | publisher=MSNBC | date=September 8, 2006 | accessdate=2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only time the national champion has not been unbeaten during that stretch was in 2003 when [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] and [[University of Southern California|USC]] claimed a share of the title as each finished with one loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;on-the-line&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tx-OSU-Preview&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14687408/ | title=Ohio St-Texas Preview | publisher=MSNBC | author=Einhorn, Justin | date=September 7, 2006 | accessdate=2006-09-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio State tackle Kirk Barton would later say &quot;Thereâll probably be two undefeated teams at the end of the road and if youâre not one of them youâre probably not going to be playing for the championship.

The Buckeyes entered the game with an all-time record of 766-298-53 including an Ohio Stadium mark of 356-101-20. During the 115&amp;nbsp;years the school has played football, the Buckeyes had won seven&amp;nbsp;national championships, the most recent being in 2002 when they finished with a [[List of undefeated Division I-A football teams|perfect 14-0 record]]. Texas came into the game with an all-time record of 788-310-33 since 1893. The Longhorns victory total and victory percentage are both the third highest in the NCAA annals. The Longhorns had won three national championships, most recently in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckeyes welcome&quot;/&gt;  OSU ranked sixth all-time winning percentage and was tied with [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] for fifth in terms of total victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Notes PDF&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/doc_lib/2005_OhioSt_notes.pdf | title=Game Notes | format=PDF | publisher=MackBrownTexasFootball | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First quarter==
{{See also|American football positions|Glossary of American football}}
The Buckeyes got the ball to start the game and Justin Zwick was the starting quarterback.  He led his team to advance only five&amp;nbsp;yards in three&amp;nbsp;plays so they punted from their own 46&amp;nbsp;yard-line to the UT eleven&amp;nbsp;yard-line.  Less than five minutes into the game, Texas scored first on a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by [[David Pino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/ut2.htm#GAME.QCK | title=Texas vs Ohio State (Sep 10, 2005) | publisher=MackBrownTexasFootball | date=September 10, 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 42-yard kick was a career-long for Pino and also the first of what would be a career-high (single game) three&amp;nbsp;[[Field goal (football)|field goals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU game notes&quot;/&gt;  Ohio State strung together 11&amp;nbsp;plays for 64&amp;nbsp;yards but had to punt.  With 1:37 to play in the first quarter, Texas extended this lead to 10-0 with a five-yard [[touchdown]] pass from Vince Young to [[Billy Pittman]].  Troy Smith came into the game for the first time and was still leading the Buckeyes at the end of the first quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;

==Second quarter==
Ohio State controlled most of the second&amp;nbsp;quarter. Their first&amp;nbsp;score was a 45-yd field goal by [[Josh Huston]] followed by a 36-yard touchdown pass from Troy Smith to [[Santonio Holmes]] to tie the score at 10â10. They took the lead with two more field goals from Josh Huston; the first was from 36&amp;nbsp;yards and the second was from 25&amp;nbsp;yards. Following the kick-off, Texas took possession of the ball at their own 31&amp;nbsp;yard-line with only 31&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining in the first half. Young began the drive by throwing a 36-yard pass to the Ohio State 18&amp;nbsp;yard-line and then the receiver ran out of bounds to stop the clock with 20&amp;nbsp;seconds to play. On the next play, Young rushed for six yards and was tackled in-bounds, causing Texas to use a [[Time-out (sport)|time out]] with 12&amp;nbsp;seconds on the clock. On second down, OSU's [[A.J. Hawk]] sacked Vince Young for a loss of 8&amp;nbsp;yards, forcing Texas to take another time-out with seven&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining. Texas put in David Pino to complete a 37&amp;nbsp;yard kick with two&amp;nbsp;seconds left, making the score 16â13 in favor of Ohio State. Texas kicked off and time expired on the ensuing 18-yard return by Erick Jackson.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;

Just as it was the first ever meeting of the two football teams, it was also the first time that [[The Ohio State University Marching Band]] (nicknamed &quot;The Best Damn Band in the Land&quot; or TBDBITL) and [[The University of Texas Longhorn Band]] (nicknamed &quot;The Showband of the Southwest&quot;) had ever performed back-to-back [[half-time]] performances. The OSU band performed ''Script Ohio'' and the UT band performed ''Script Texas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 5 teams&quot;/&gt;  Ohio State also held a ceremony to honor one of their long-time coaches, [[Woody Hayes]], by placing his name on the east side of the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woody Hayes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/090505aad.html | title=Ohio State to Honor Woody Hayes at Halftime of Texas Game | publisher=Ohio State University | date=September 5, 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third quarter==
Texas got the ball at their 20 to start the second half. On the first play from scrimmage, Jamaal Charles rushed for three&amp;nbsp;yards. On second down, Vince Young's pass was intercepted by [[Nate Salley]] at the UT&amp;nbsp;37. Two rushes by [[Antonio Pittman]] resulted in a first down at the UT 30. After a short gain on first down and an incomplete pass on second down, Troy Smith recovered his own fumble on third down to set up a successful 44-yard field goal by Huston. Texas used six plays, including a 63-yard pass to Billy Pittman before being stopped at the Ohio State eight&amp;nbsp;yard-line. David Pino made the 25-yard field goal. On the ensuing kick-off by [[Richmond McGee]], OSU's [[Ted Ginn, Jr.]] took the ball at the one&amp;nbsp;yard-line and ran it out to almost mid-field. The drive ended with a successful 26-yard field goal by Huston. The following three possessions (two for Texas and one for Ohio State) resulted in punts. The third quarter expired with Ohio State leading 22 to 16 and with control of the ball near mid-field.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;

==Fourth quarter==
Ohio State was unable to score and gave the ball back to Texas with 13:24 left in the game. Texas was forced to punt. On the Buckeyes' next possession they drove from their own 30 to the Texas 33 before settling for a sixth field goal attempt by Huston, this one from 50&amp;nbsp;yards out. Huston missed wide left to leave Ohio State still ahead by six&amp;nbsp;points. Texas took over at their own 33&amp;nbsp;with 5:07 left in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;

On an incomplete pass to Brian Carter, Texas benefited from a [[pass interference]] penalty which moved the ball to the UT&amp;nbsp;48. Vince Young rushed for four&amp;nbsp;yards and then threw an incomplete pass to [[Ramonce Taylor]] before taking a timeout with 4:42 left to play. Young's next pass was complete for a first down to Jamaal Charles who went out-of-bounds to completely stop the clock. Vince Young rushed for one&amp;nbsp;yard to the OSU&amp;nbsp;38 and then took a time-out at 3:53. Young threw to Jamaal Charles who gained eight&amp;nbsp;yards and went out-of-bounds. An [[American football#Penalties|offsides]] penalty by Ohio State and a one-yard rush by Jamaal Charles gave Texas second and nine from the Ohio State 24.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;  On second and nine with 2:37 remaining to play, Vince Young passed a touchdown pass over the head of a defender to find [[Limas Sweed]] in the end-zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU recap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU game notes&quot;/&gt;  It was the 23rd&amp;nbsp;touchdown pass by Young, putting him seventh in the all-time school record book.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU game notes&quot;/&gt;  David Pino's kick gave Texas the lead at 23-22.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;

Texas kicked off to the Ohio State five&amp;nbsp;yard-line and Holmes returned it 26&amp;nbsp;yards to the Buckeye 31. Justin Zwick was in at quarterback for Ohio State. On first-and-ten and needing a score to win the game, Zwick rushed around the left side to the 35 but a fumble was forced by UT's [[Drew Kelson]]. UT's [[Brian Robison]] recovered the fumble at the 30&amp;nbsp;and advanced it nine yards before being tackled by [[Vernon Gholston]] at the Ohio State 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;

With 2:19 to play and nursing a one-point lead, Texas was in position to win if they could run out the clock. They began with a 12-yard rush on the left side by Jamaal Charles for a first down. Charles then carried again up the middle for a two-yard gain to the Ohio State 7. OSU called a time-out to stop the clock at 1:36. On second-and-goal, Vince Young kept the ball and gained three&amp;nbsp;yards before being tackled by A.J. Hawk. The Buckeyes again called time-out with 1:23 left. Young carried again for three&amp;nbsp;yards before being brought down by B. Carpenter and A.J. Hawk just one yard short of the goal-line. This time, Texas took a time-out with 29&amp;nbsp;seconds left to play. Following the time-out, Young handed off to Henry Melton who was stopped for no gain. Ohio State took over on downs.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;

Troy Smith came back in as quarterback for Ohio State. On first down, Smith was [[Quarterback sack|sacked]] for a loss of one yard by [[Aaron Harris (American football)|Aaron Harris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Defeated 25-22&quot;/&gt;  This gave Texas a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]], extending their lead to 25-22.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Defeated 25-22&quot;/&gt;  Josh Huston attempted an onside kick, but Texas was able to recover it at the Ohio State 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Defeated 25-22&quot;/&gt;  Texas took a knee to end the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX v Ohio State&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Defeated 25-22&quot;/&gt;
