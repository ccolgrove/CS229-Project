THIS IS NOT A FAN SECTION--&gt;

On September 2, 2011, it's revealed that Kim is [[Cutter Wentworth]]'s real sister, and that her real name is Aubrey Wentworth when Kim pays her brother Cutter a visit to The Minute Man Motel, and he calls her by her real name &quot;Aubrey&quot;. It was also revealed that Kim had plastic surgery done to turn herself from an &quot;ugly duckling&quot; to a sexy looking woman, thanks to the money she stole from her former French boarding school roommate Rama Patel to pay for the plastic surgery. Kim also found out that her brother was inspired to scam the Buchanan family after he read about Kim's marriage to Clint in the newspaper. Kim told Cutter that she would pay back the money that she stole from Rama. Kim also discovered that her brother quit being a con artist so that he could turn over a new leaf to impress Aubrey, who also reformed from her grifting ways, and got a job working as a front desk clerk at The Minute Man Motel. Kim later goes to Llanfair to talk to Clint about helping her take care of her friend in the hospital. Clint agrees to help if she quits stripping, saying she is better than that, and Kim agrees to the deal. Kim later comes face to face with Cutter's girlfriend and former scamming partner Christine Karr (the fake [[Aubrey Wentworth]]) at the motel room. Kim tells Christine that she is the real Aubrey Wentworth and Cutter's sister. After Kim left, Cutter told Aubrey that he and Kim used to be scamming partners when he teamed up with her to seduce rich men for their money after Kim had her plastic surgery, but they later parted ways after they were exposed as con artists after the incident at the Spotted Pony. Kim returns to Llanfair where Clint wants Kim's friend to be moved to Llanview Hospital, but Kim refuses. Clint also look up information on Kim's friend in the hospital in Anchorage, Kentucky, but comes up with nothing. Kim later visits her brother Cutter and discovers that he bought a stuffed beaver named Morris for Aubrey as a gift that Rex's adoptive mother [[Roxy Balsom]] was selling at a flea market being held in Angel Square, and that Rex's gun was hidden in the beaver (Rex was the suspect in the murder of [[Victor Lord Jr.]], and his gun was considered as evidence in the case) Cutter told Kim that he was tempted to use Rex's gun to blackmail him for the Buchanan fortune, but later changed his mind so that he could still be a changed man for Aubrey. Kim sneaks back into his motel room and steals the gun to blackmail Rex's biological mother [[Echo DiSavoy]] to convince her son to hand back the entire Buchanan fortune to Clint, so she can pay her friends medical bills or she will give the gun to the police.

In late September 2011, Rex find the hospital that her friend is at in Kentucky. Kim gets Rex to leave and returns to the hospital room and says &quot;That was a close one, Stacy!&quot;. Cutter arrives in the hospital in Kentucky to confront Kim about stealing Rex's gun from him, but Kim convinces her brother to let her still keep the gun to continue to blackmail Echo to convince her son Rex to give back the entire Buchanan fortune to Clint, and to help pay for Stacy's medical bills. Cutter then goes into Stacy's hospital room and tells Kim she left out a lot of details about her mysterious condition. Cutter decides to keep Stacy's condition a secret, saying that no one will believe him when he tells anyone about what happened to Stacy. On October 10, 2011, Kim tells Stacy she got Echo to forge Rex's signature on the documents that Echo signed herself to give the Buchanan fortune back to Clint. It's also revealed that Stacy has Gigi's face when Kim reminicesd about Stacy reuniting with Kim several months earlier at the Spotted Pony, and Kim finding out that Stacy survived drowning in that frozen lake, and that Stacy had plastic surgery done to her in [[South America]] to look like her sister Gigi so that she could take over her life. Cutter then arrived at the hospital and told Kim that Aubrey broke up with him because she found out about what he really did with Rex's gun, and also blamed Kim for their break-up. He also decided to revert back to his grifting ways and blackmailed Kim to give him the forged documents, or he will tell everyone in Llanview about Stacy still being alive with Gigi's face. Cutter then asked Kim if she was sure that it was Stacy that was in that hospital room. Kim explained to Cutter that Stacy ended up in a coma because she went to Llanview to track down Gigi, but instead she ended up in the same basement of the rental house with her that was leaking carbon monoxide that killed Gigi. Kim then tracked down Stacy and took her body, and put her in a hospital in Cherryvale before she ended up in the hospital in Kentucky. Cutter told Kim that he believes her, and Kim gave him the forged documents on the condition that he gives her some of the money to pay for Stacy's hospital bills. On October 14, 2011, Kim revealed to Stacy of what happened that night several years ago at the Spotted Pony. Cutter enlisted Kim to seduce a rich guy at the club named Mr. Berger by working as a stripper, and Cutter snuck in too much &quot;mickey&quot; into his drink, which caused Mr. Berger to pass out and die. Kim runs into Rama at the Spotted Pony, who recently discovered from Aubrey that she stole money from her to pay for her plastic surgery and calling herself &quot;Kim&quot;, and that she was there to &quot;settle the score&quot; once and for all! On October 17, 2011 Cutter and Rama set Kim up for the murder years ago at the Spotted Pony. Kim begs Cutter to take care of Stacy before being dragged away by the police. On October 28, a letter from Kim arrives from the prison she's staying at in Kentucky at Llanfair for Clint, but the letter ends up falling into Clint's granddaughter's [[Bree Brennan]]'s bag that she's using to go trick or treating with on Halloween before Clint could see the letter. Bree later discovers the letter in her bag and dumps it on the front doorsteps of the Buchanan Mansion. Cutter then discovers Kim's letter and has it forged, along with another forged letter from Clint, to make it both look like they were breaking up with each other, and to not let anyone know about Stacy's identity, and to cover up the truth about Cutter framing Kim for the murder that he committed at the Spotted Pony.

[[Kelly Cramer]]'s boarding school friend '''Grace Monroe''' comes to [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]] with her grandfather in 1999 and soon becomes romantically involved with [[Kevin Buchanan]]. Grace's grandfather, secretly a mobster, is searching for [[Ben Davidson (One Life to Live)|Dr. Ben Davidson]] to kill him because Grace's father had died while Ben was treating him.

Meanwhile, [[Rae Cummings]] returns to town in search of her missing husband Daniel Faulkner; her one lead is Daniel's former mistress â Grace. The young woman has no information to help Rae find Daniel. Hating Grace for the affair, Rae tries to convince Kevin to end the relationship. He is upset by Grace's past but forgives her, so Rae slowly and subtly tries to lead Kevin to believe that Grace is a horrible woman. Rae complicates their relationship, but Kevin and Grace grow closer and are eventually engaged.

Ben is shot but survives, and it is revealed that Grace is really the younger sister of Ben and his brother [[Sam Rappaport (One Life to Live)|Sam Rappaport]], kidnapped as a child by the mob and presumed dead (Grace's childhood nickname is &quot;Maisy&quot; â short for &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot; It is through the memories associated with the nickname â which Ben and Sam continue to use â that Ben and Sam realize that Grace is their sister.) Reunited with her brothers, Grace changes her name to '''Grace Davidson'''.

At Kevin and Grace's engagement party, Kevin's grandfather [[Asa Buchanan]] â who hates Ben and Sam â confronts Grace with pictures he had uncovered of her sleeping with her father's mob friends. An upset Grace runs out into the storm and ends up in the Buchanans' summerhouse, which is under construction. Locked in, she falls through a hole in the floor into the cold water below. Rae arrives and unsuccessfully tries to save Grace; the two women make peace and Grace tells Rae that Daniel is in [[Pine Valley, Pennsylvania|Pine Valley]]. Both woman are eventually pulled from the water, but despite her brother Ben's best efforts, Grace dies on November 3, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grace&quot;/&gt;

Kevin is devastated over Grace's death and starts drinking heavily; he and Kelly console each other as she and Kevin's brother [[Joey Buchanan|Joey]] become engaged in December 1999. Kevin and Kelly begin developing feelings for each other, which complicates her relationship with Joey.

'''Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Ford''' is the abusive ex-husband of [[Inez Salinger]] and father of [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]], [[James Ford (One Life to Live)|James Ford]], and [[Nate Salinger]].

In November 2010, Eddie showed up at the doorstep of his two eldest sons, Bobby and James. Eddie had been in jail in Ohio for running an illegal chop shop but told his sons that the charges hadn't stuck. Eddie had shown up in town, looking for the $50,000 that James had stolen from him earlier that year, but James and Bobby said the money was gone. Eddie threatened to have James sent to jail unless they agreed to let him stay at their apartment.

When James began defending Inez against his father's diatribes, Eddie realized that Inez had been in contact with her sons. When Inez showed up at the apartment with Nate to deliver some food, she was shocked to see Eddie there. Eddie assumed Nate was Inez's lover, but she told him he was their son â something Eddie still doubted. Eddie lashed out at Inez for leaving him alone with two small boys, and Inez said she regretted running away but that she would protect them from his abuse now.

Bo paid Eddie a visit and warned him that the police would be watching him. Eddie rightly assumed that Inez had sought Bo's assistance and warned Bo that Inez was trying to get her hooks into him. Eddie followed his sons to Dorian Lord's house on Thanksgiving Day and crashed her gathering. When he was ordered to leave, Eddie went berserk, insulting Starr and punching James in the face before being physically restrained by Robert. Furious and disgusted, Dorian immediately called the police and had Eddie arrested for trespass and assault.

Eddie met Nora and insinuated that Bo and Inez were having an affair, and then made a crude pass at Nora. Eddie was released from police custody after a high-priced lawyer hired by Clint Buchanan got the charges dismissed. Eddie then was summoned to the Buchanan mansion, where Clint promised to pay Eddie a large sum of cash and provided him a gun. In return, Clint had Eddie kidnap Nora and send text messages from her phone to Bo, telling Bo that he should sleep with Inez to even the score over her affair years before with Sam Rappaport. Nate punched Eddie in the face after Eddie made suggestive remarks to Nate's girlfriend, Danielle. Todd Manning warned Eddie to stay away from Todd's daughter.

Eventually, James confronted his father at his hotel room and held him at gunpoint. Even after being egged on by Eddie, James was ultimately unable to bring himself to do so, instead warning him to leave town before someone else tried to do so. Indeed, some time after James' departure, Eddie was found shot dead in his hotel room, and it is eventually discovered that Clint murdered him to cover his tracks. However on April 1, 2011, it was revealed that [[Matthew Buchanan]] had in fact shot and killed Eddie as Clint told this to Bo and Nora.

''[[Trevor St. John]]'' (2003)

Walker Flynn is the brother of Mitch Laurence and a mobster running casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  After Todd Manning is beaten to near death by Mitch's followers, he is recovered by Flynn, who has Todd's face surgically altered to look like his own in order to hide from authorities.

Natalie Buchanan also enters a pool tournament in Las Vegas, run by Flynn.  John McBain, an FBI agent posing as one of Flynn's thugs becomes her manager, and helps her compete in the pool tournament, under the guise of trying to lure Natalie into a trap.  Flynn's plans are for Natalie to make it to the final round of the tournament, and then throw the competition.

Blair Cramer ends up in a relationship with the faux Walker (Victor), and after meeting the real Walker (who wears glasses, talks with a posh accent, and has a snobby demeanor), assumes that he is leading a double life of sorts.  She later verbally attacks the real Walker and John in Las Vegas, and after Victor/faux Walker shows up, they cover their tracks by claiming to be twins.

As Walker's plans begin to unravel, he decides to blackmail Todd, demanding $500,000 or he will reveal the faux Walker's identity as Todd Manning(Victor Lord Jr. .  Natalie defies Flynn by winning the tournament, and she is brought to Flynn's suite to be killed.  After a confrontation between Walker, Todd, John (who has revealed himself to FBI), Antonio Vega, Cristian Vega, and Jessica Buchanan, Walker takes Natalie hostage.  A botched rescue attempt leads to Cristian being taken by Flynn and seemingly killed (he is later revealed to be alive and in the custody of Flynn's business partner, Tico Santi, both of whom are under the employ of Carlo Hesser).

Flynn returns to Llanview and disguises himself as the faux Walker.  However, Todd(Victor), desperate to keep his identity secret, plots to kill Flynn.  He creates a remote control that will cause the elevator in his penthouse to fall.  The two lookalikes end up fighting in the elevator, and it ends up crashing.  Flynn is killed in the crash, and Todd (Victor) survives.

'''Wes Granger''' first appears in September 2008 when [[Rex Balsom]] and [[Gigi Morasco]] contact him for information on his best friend [[Brody Lovett]]. A former [[Navy SEAL]] who had done several tours in [[Iraq war|Iraq and Afghanistan]], Wes had served with Brody in Fallujah and Basra, and had witnessed the [[friendly fire]] incident in which Brody had accidentally shot and killed an Iraqi child, triggering Brody's downward spiral into [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]]. With Wes' help, Rex, Gigi and the [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]] police are able to track down the unstable Brody, who has made off with Gigi's young son [[Shane Morasco|Shane]]. After Brody is committed to St. Ann's Sanitarium for treatment, Wes comes to Llanview and becomes a frequent visitor during Brody's convalescence. As Brody undergoes therapy, he begins to recover memories that contradict what he believes happened during the shooting in Basra. Though Wes urges him not to delve deeper into the mystery, Brody continues treatment and Wes ultimately admits that the Iraqi boy had been unarmed, and Wes had planted a weapon on him to protect Brody.

Wes forms a friendship with the troubled amnesiac [[Marty Saybrooke]], who has begun to behave irresponsibly as she crumbles under the pressure of other people's expectations of her. Marty stays with Wes in his hotel room in a platonic arrangement, as Marty's teen son [[Cole Thornhart]] and former love interest [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] become concerned that she has taken up with a questionable stranger. Wes is shocked to discover that the key witness in a local trial is [[Lee Halpern]], a woman whom he thought had been killed 20 years before. Con artist Lee had seduced Wes' father and swindled him, leaving the Grangers penniless and fatherless. Wes is hungry for revenge, and when Lee is later found stabbed to death, John discovers her connection to Wes and suspects him of the crime. Wes maintains his innocence, but after a heated argument with Marty even she is unsure whether or not to believe him. Falling asleep next to Wes drunk, Marty wakes up on February 16, 2009 to find him stabbed to death in the bed next to her in a manner similar to Lee's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2009-02-16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/6093/Entering_Into_The_Morning_After |title='&amp;#39;One Life to Live'&amp;#39; recap (2/16/09) |publisher=Soaps.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no memory of the night before and covered in his blood, Marty is arrested for Wes' murder when her fingerprints are found on the knife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2009-02-20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/6124/Knocked_Out_Cold |title='&amp;#39;One Life to Live'&amp;#39; recap (2/20/09) |publisher=Soaps.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Powell Lord III]] later confesses to the murder (among others), committed as part of his plan to punish anyone who has hurt Marty, frame Todd, and then punish him by killing him and anyone he loves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2009-05-14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/6599/Not_Your_Normal_Frat_Party |title='&amp;#39;One Life to Live'&amp;#39; recap (5/14/09) |publisher=Soaps.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Jessica Buchanan, who met Wes a few times during her stay in St. Ann's, developed an alternate personality based on memories of him and stories she heard from Brody.  Unlike Jessica's other alters, &quot;Wes&quot; seems to believe that &quot;he&quot; actually is Wes Granger rather than a part of Jessica's psyche.

'''Lee Halpern''', a former prostitute for [[Renee Divine]] and now a business partner of [[Max Holden (One Life to Live)|Max Holden]]'s, arrives in Llanview in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC OLTL&quot;/&gt;  She marries [[Charles Sanders (One Life to Live)|Charles Sanders]], former [[Ambassadors of the United States|US Ambassador]] to the [[Europe]]an [[principality]] of [[Mendorra]], during a drunken night in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], and he dies of a heart attack on their wedding night. Lee manages to torment Charles' wealthy mother [[Elizabeth Sanders (One Life to Live)|Elizabeth Sanders]] more than even his first wife, [[Judith Sanders|Judith]]. It is soon revealed that Lee is in fact '''Carol Harper Dennison''', the presumed-dead wife of Llanview resident [[Tom Dennison (One Life to Live)|Tom Dennison]] and mother to Tom's daughter, [[Mari Lynn Dennison|Mari Lynn]]; Tom is the twin brother of [[Joe Riley (One Life to Live)|Joe Riley]], first husband of Llanview society figure [[Victoria Lord Davidson|Viki Buchanan]]. The revelation of Carol's past as a prostitute had ended her marriage to Tom, and she had subsequently chosen to fake her death. Lee's awkward reunion with her daughter is cut short when it appears that Lee is accidentally shot to death by Mari Lynn in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC OLTL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the October 13, 2008 episode, [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] reiterates that Lee/Janet faked her death in 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, private nurse '''Janet Ketring''' appears in Llanview,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps 2008-04-02&quot;/&gt; helping [[Lee Ramsey]] care for a bedridden and [[amnesia]]c [[Marty Saybrooke]]. Ramsey is killed and [[Todd Manning]] secretly takes custody of Marty, whom all of Llanview believes had been killed in an explosion in December 2007. Todd coerces Janet, who is only concerned for Marty's well-being, to continue tending to Marty under his employ. For the sum of $1 million, Janet also agrees to keep Marty's existence a secret from the people, according to Todd, who wish to harm Marty. Neither Marty nor Janet are aware that Todd had raped Marty over a decade before; though Todd had served time and Marty had overcome the trauma, their relationship before the explosion had been far from intimate. Seeking absolution for his crimes against Marty (and an escape from his troubled life) at any cost, Todd lies about their relationship and even the existence of Marty's son; both Marty and Janet come to trust Todd and his warnings about the danger to Marty's life. During a personal conversation with Todd about their families, Janet reveals that, like him, she is estranged from her loved ones â in particular, a daughter â and claims she is &quot;dead to them.&quot; Todd shows Janet a picture of his sister, local society figure Viki Davidson; Janet becomes anxious, soon explaining that she merely recognizes Viki from the newspaper. During his investigation of his nemesis Todd in October 2008, Llanview Police Detective [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] discovers that Janet is, in fact, a very-much-alive Lee Halpern.

''[[Matthew Ashford]] (December 10, 2003 â March 22, 2004)''

'''Dr. Stephen Haver''' is a psychology professor at [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview University]] who specializes in [[human sexuality]] and researches [[serial killer]]s and [[sexual predator]]s. He becomes a favorite instructor of [[Jessica Buchanan]]. When a friend confides in Jessica that another professor had demanded sex from her in return for a passing grade, Jessica recruits Dr. Haver, his colleague, psychiatrist [[Rae Cummings]], and student activist and radio talk show host [[Marcie Walsh]] to help her expose the scandal.  When the serial killer known as the &quot;Music Box Killer&quot; begins terrorizing the university, Jessica and Dr. Haver find themselves at the center of the investigation, with Haver and Rae Cummings acting as consultants and [[criminal profiler|psychological profilers]] for the Llanview Police Department.  Haver works closely with new Chief of Detectives [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]], but no one is aware that Haver and the &quot;Music Box Killer&quot; are actually one and the same, and that Haver had been responsible for the death of McBain's fiancÃ©e years before.

The Music Box Killer strangles his victims with a red leotard, paints a teardrop on their faces, and leaves a music box by their bodies as a calling card.  He sometimes targets women at random, such as private investigator Elyssa Collins or [[sorority]] girl Madison Kensington, but seems to focus on women who are either older and maternal, or promiscuous and involved in sex work, like [[Jennifer Rappaport]] or her friend Karen, a local prostitute.  In reality, Haver is murdering women who he identifies with his mother, a promiscuous, alcoholic dancer and [[folk singer]] from the &quot;[[free love]]&quot; era of the 1960s.  For a time, Haver uses psychotic mental patient [[Troy MacIver]] as his alibi; as MacIver's therapist at St. Ann's Sanitarium, Haver releases the man from the institution at the times when he plans to kill.  As the authorities get closer, Haver kills [[Police Commissioner]] [[Bo Buchanan]]'s girlfriend [[Gabrielle Medina]], and nearly kills [[Sarah Roberts]].  Meanwhile, John McBain grows increasingly suspicious of Haver, who becomes his prime suspect in the case.  Jessica, Haver's protege, angrily defends her teacher to McBain, but when she stumbles upon the truth, Haver is forced to take action.  He kidnaps Jessica, and [[brainwashing|brainwashes]] her with drugs and [[hypnosis]] to conceal his crimes and conspire with him against the police.  In the meantime, Rae Cummings also deduces Haver's secret; he takes her hostage, forcing her to act out his twisted psychological ritual of posing as his mother before apparently strangling her and then [[Cremation|immolating]] her isolated prison.

The LPD discovers Jessica's brainwashing and rehabilitates her, but they still have no actionable proof of Haver's guilt.  As John McBain digs deeper into Haver's past, he discovers that Haver has actually posed as many serial killers in many different parts of the United States, changing [[methodology]] and [[modus operandi]] each time to avoid detection.  John is shocked to learn that Haver was once the &quot;White Rose Killer,&quot; who he had hunted unsuccessfully during his tenure with the [[FBI]]; as the &quot;White Rose Killer,&quot; Haver had murdered McBain's fiancÃ©e Caitlin Fitzgerald in her bed while she slept beside him.

Trapped and growing desperate, Haver abducts Jessica's sister [[Natalie Buchanan]], who John has become romantically linked to.  In a stand-off with police, Haver straps a bomb to Natalie's body and threatens to kill her.  Haver is shocked as Rae Cummings suddenly enters the room â she had survived his assault, and has been kept in police protection.  Taunting Haver with the memory of his mother, the focus of his [[psychosis]], Rae manages to distract Haver long enough for the police to subdue him.

While behind bars and awaiting trial, Haver is shot and killed by a rogue cop.  It is revealed that Haver brainwashed the cop to shoot him and then commit suicide, in the hopes of framing John for Haver's &quot;murder&quot; (the cop implicated John as an accomplice in his suicide note); his plan does not succeed.

'''Melvin &quot;Mel&quot; Hayes''' is a prize-winning journalist and &quot;loose cannon&quot; who crosses paths with [[Dorian Lord]] in April 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Markle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Mel&quot;/&gt; Drunk in a Washington, D.C. hotel bar, Mel literally &quot;falls&quot; over Dorian, and their mutual attraction soon sparks a relationship. Dorian convinces Mel to seek a job at [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]]'s newspaper, ''The Banner'', and he moves into a houseboat on the Llantano River. The death of Mel's wife Muriel in a plane crash 18 months before had fueled his addiction to alcohol, which in turn has estranged him from their children, Roger, Frank, and '''Dorothy Hayes'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Mel&quot;/&gt; Dorothy comes to Llanview in 1997 to rebuild her relationship with Mel, but leaves in 1998 after a failed relationship with [[Joey Buchanan]]. Mel and Dorian's family begin to suspect that Dorian is hiding something from her past; after Mel's investigation into the deaths of Dorian's parents reveals conflicting information, he convinces her to face her painful childhood. Dorian returns to Canton in 1998, remembering the psychological abuse she and her sisters had suffered at the hands of their mentally ill mother, Sonya. Dorian is shocked to discover that Sonya had not only killed Dorian's father, but is actually still alive and being cared for by the former Cramer nanny, Charlotte Stonecliffe. Dorian and her daughter [[Cassie Callison|Cassie]] are attacked by a deranged Sonya, who later dies with Charlotte when the house is consumed by fire. Furious that he had dredged up her past, Dorian breaks things off with Mel.

A near-death experience after Dorian is accidentally shot changes her mind. Dorian proposes to Mel suddenly at ''The Banner'' in May 1998; they marry in an impromptu wedding in the middle of the newspaper's city room.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Mel&quot;/&gt; All ends badly in January 1999 when [[Victoria Lord Davidson|Viki Carpenter]] â Mel's boss and Dorian's longtime nemesis â is on a plane with Mel and inadvertently intercepts a note from Dorian telling Mel to come home. Viki gets off the plane instead, and it crashes; Mel is killed and Dorian blames Viki.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Mel&quot;/&gt; Psychic [[Madame Delphina]] later channels Mel's spirit, who advises Dorian to make peace with Viki and give up her vendetta. Feeling a great sense of peace, Dorian finally accepts Mel's death, and lets go of her animosity toward Viki over the crash.

Mel appears to Dorian as a ghost on July 21 and 22, 2008 (''One Life to Live'''s 40th Anniversary episodes)&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG 2008-06-11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 40th Anniv&quot;/&gt; as Dorian grapples with whether or not to try to save Viki's life after a car crash.

'''Hugh Hughes''' comes to [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]] as the new Assistant District Attorney, working closely with both the district attorney's office and the police. Not long after his arrival, Hugh is out with one of the many leggy models he often has on his arm and runs into [[Marcie McBain|Marcie Walsh]], who is being ridiculed by other writers after her novel ''The Killing Club'' had been played out by a serial killer. He gives up his evening to take the drunken Marcie home, where she throws up on his shoes. This begins an unusual friendship between the playboy Hugh and writer Marcie, much to the annoyance of her ex-boyfriend [[Michael McBain|Dr. Michael McBain]].

Hugh is soon thrown into the seat of district attorney as [[Nora Hanen]] is hospitalized. His first big case is the trial of [[Todd Manning]] for the murder of pregnant [[Margaret Cochran]]. Hugh is determined to see Todd pay for his crimes, in part because Hugh himself had been adopted and he cannot rationalize to himself why anyone would want to kill a child. His belief in Todd's guilt never wavers, and he feels that justice is truly served when Todd is convicted. When it is discovered that Todd had been innocent, Hugh immediately apologizes to him for having been the one to put him in prison, even though he had been only following the trail of the evidence.

Hugh then discovers that doctors [[Spencer Truman]] and [[Paige Miller]] are his biological parents; Paige had put him up for adoption without telling the evil Spencer that she was pregnant. At Spencer's bail hearing for Margaret Cochran's murder, it appears that Hugh wants Spencer to go free when he agrees to offer him a $1 million bail. However, he and Detective [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] had planned it in the hopes that Truman would lead them to the gun that he used to kill John's father, Thomas McBain.

Hugh is killed on September 22, 2006 in a car accident, but in a case of mistaken identity he is thought to have survived and been bandaged for his burns. In reality, it is John McBain (who had also been in the accident) under the bandages while Hugh is buried in what everyone thought was John's grave.

In the fall of 2006, &quot;popular girl&quot; '''Britney Jennings''' targets Llanview High School freshman [[Starr Manning]] after an argument between their fathers [[Todd Manning]] and Blake Jennings, taking every opportunity to bully Starr and her friend [[Langston Wilde]]. Britney's attitude toward Starr worsens when Britney sets her sights on football player [[Cole Thornhart|Cole]], who himself is developing feelings for Starr after coming to her rescue at a dance. Trying everything to thwart Starr and Cole's new relationship, Britney discovers that Cole had been pressured into taking [[steroid]]s, and uses it to her advantage. Britney spikes Cole's drink, which pushes him into a fit of &quot;[[roid rage]]&quot; during which he attacks Starr. Britney, posing as Starr, calls the police. In the aftermath, it is revealed that Cole's parents are [[Marty Saybrooke]] and the deceased [[Patrick Thornhart]], both enemies of Starr's father Todd. Todd had raped Marty years before, and Starr's mother [[Blair Cramer]] had been romantically involved with Patrick between her marriages to Todd.

Starr forgives Cole but her parents forbid her to date him. They secretly see each other, much to Britney's dismay, and Britney does all she can to split them up. Cole and Starr attend a school ski trip, each telling their parents that the other is not there. Todd, Blair, and Marty arrive coincidentally and the lodge is snowed in; Britney orchestrates the reveal that Starr and Cole have spent the night together, nearly having sex. Starr and Cole run away together, but are soon caught and forced to break up.

Teacher [[Marcie McBain]] coerces several students to participate in the school musical, including Britney, Starr, and Cole. Though at first trying to follow their parents' orders and stay apart, Starr and Cole are soon drawn back together. Meanwhile, Britney uses fellow school student [[Henry Mackler]] to do her homework for her, falsely leading him to believe that she would date him. Henry begins to see that Britney is deceiving him, and a worried Starr and Langston encourage him to cut himself loose from Britney. Henry has been secretly taking pills to stay awake to do both his and Britney's homework; after not having slept for two weeks, a distraught Henry steals a car. Starr, Cole, and Britney get inside and Henry drives off; acting strangely, Henry has chest pains and his vision blurs. Henry confronts Britney, but Cole manages to get Henry to drive back to school. However, when they arrive to find the police in the parking lot, Henry panics and drives the car into a tree. Starr, Cole, and Britney are unharmed, but Henry â not wearing a seatbelt â is thrown from the car to his death. Starr and Langston place blame on Britney for pushing Henry to this extreme; Britney begins to see that she had wronged Henry, and feels responsible for his death.

Britney seems to turn over a new leaf, dropping her [[Feud|vendetta]] against Starr. But after Cole leaves her at the prom to be with Starr, Britney reverts to her old ways. With Todd missing, Blair decides to allow Starr and Cole, obviously devoted to each other, to date. Soon Britney learns that Cole is lying to Starr about her father's whereabouts; Cole's new stepfather [[Miles Laurence]] is holding Todd captive, but Cole is keeping quiet to keep Miles from telling the authorities that Marty had supposedly murdered [[Spencer Truman]]. The secrets come out and strain Starr and Cole's relationship, but they are soon reunited, Todd is found, Marty is exonerated, and Miles is arrested.

Britney incites an argument in class between Starr and teacher Marcie, which results in Marcie's temporary suspension from her job. Britney soon announces during the week of October 15, 2007 that her parents are sending her to a prestigious boarding school in [[Massachusetts]]. Before she leaves, Britney overhears that Langston's parents had died over a year before and Langston has been living on her own; Britney calls [[Social Services]], who take custody of Langston â despite [[Dorian Cramer Lord|Dorian Lord]]'s protests â and put her in a [[group home]] pending assignment to a [[foster home]].

In March 2009, a distraught Starr kisses Schuyler in the school hallway. She later tries to seduce him, and her ex-boyfriend [[Cole Thornhart]] becomes convinced that Schuyler is the one trying to seduce his underage student; Cole reports the incident, and Schuyler is suspended from his teaching position. Schuyler's ex-girlfriend [[Stacy Morasco]] comes to town, and he stumbles upon her plot to steal her sister [[Gigi Morasco|Gigi]]'s boyfriend [[Rex Balsom]] through blackmail. Stacy forces Gigi to break up with Rex, and in June 2009 Schuyler helps Gigi turn the tables on Stacy. He soon develops feelings for Gigi but refuses to tell her; when he finally does, he and Gigi grow closer. Rex and Gigi reunite, but their relationship falls apart when Stacy is revealed to be pregnant after sleeping with Rex while he and Gigi were separated. Gigi is drawn to Schuyler, and they begin a relationship; meanwhile, Schuyler determines that he is actually the father of Stacy's baby, but Stacy convinces him to keep the secret so that Gigi will not reunite with Rex. Rex learns that he is not the baby's father just as Stacy gives birth to [[Sierra Morasco]]. Stacy apparently dies soon after (she seemed to drown, but her body was never recovered); Gigi breaks up with Schuyler for keeping the secret, and states her intention to challenge him for custody of Sierra.

In spring 2010, [[Allison Perkins]] shows up as a house inspector and a volunteer from child services at Schuyler's apartment and later points a gun at Schuyler and then kidnaps Sierra. Later Schuyler goes to Statesville prison and helps [[Mitch Laurence]] escape. Meanwhile Allison shows up at Foxy Roxy's hair salon and then holds [[Roxy Balsom]] and [[Natalie Buchanan]] at gunpoint. Allison then takes Roxy and baby Sierra back to [[Kyle Lewis]] and [[Oliver Fish]]`s apartment and holds them hostage there. Then Mitch calls Allison and tells her to come down to Statesville prison and bring Sierra with her. In the medical room Schuyler gives Mitch a drug that will make his heart stop and hopes that he will die. Later Allison shows up with the baby and reveals that Mitch and Roxy are Schuyler's real parents, making [[Jessica Buchanan]] his biological paternal half-sister, [[Walker Laurence]] and [[Miles Laurence]] his uncles, and Jessica's daughters [[Megan Buchanan]] (deceased), [[Bree Brennan]], [[Chloe Brennan]] (deceased), and later her son [[Ryder Ford]] are his nieces and nephew. Years earlier, Allison had switched infants Schuyler and Rex, who is not their son after all, and tried to convince Roxy that the baby she'd given birth to had died the night he was born, while she gave Schuyler to her sister, Dr. Leah Joplin, who could not conceive children of her own.

Later, Schuyler takes Allison's gun and holds Gigi at gunpoint at [[Viki Buchanan]]`s cabin and tries to force Gigi to sleep with him. He once more says that he wants Gigi back in his life but Rex and the police find them. He attempts to shoot Rex, blaming him for all his problems, but ends up shooting police commissioner [[Bo Buchanan]], who is badly wounded and taken to the hospital for surgery. [[Brody Lovett]] arrests Schuyler and takes him to the police station. His [[lawyer]] [[TÃ©a Delgado]] comes and is told what happened. Then Roxy shows up and tells him that she knows the truth as well as he does. Everyone eventually accepts the truth and Schuyler finds out that Sierra is not his daughter, she is Oliver's child as confirmed by a [[DNA test]] which Schuyler also accepts. On April 9, 2010, Schuyler appears in court and confesses to the judge, who sends him to Statesville prison where he is to await sentencing. As he is led away, Schuyler tells Rex that &quot;I never had a chance with her (Gigi).&quot;

In 1993 '''Rebecca Lewis''', follower of the Tabernacle of Joy ministry, meets and falls for [[Todd Manning]], who is incarcerated for the rape of [[Marty Saybrooke]]. Though Todd begins to have feelings for her as well, he escapes while on work assignment at the Tabernacle to seek revenge on his &quot;enemies.&quot; A fugitive Todd and a captive Marty are surrounded in 1994; Rebecca talks her way inside in exchange for Marty. Todd escapes with Rebecca as a willing hostage, and she tries to persuade him to turn himself in. Surrounded yet again, Todd lets Rebecca go and flees; he is shot and presumed dead after a fall into an icy river. Rebecca returns to Llanview and begins a romance with [[Powell Lord III]], a reluctant accomplice in Marty's rape who had since been released from prison for good behavior. Meanwhile, Todd reappears alive and hides out in the gardener's shed at Llanfair where Rebecca â the only person who cares about him â is an occasional babysitter. Todd makes his presence known to Rebecca, who is at first terrified but later softens; he is eventually caught, but pardoned after saving the lives of Marty, [[Jessica Buchanan]] and [[C.J. Roberts]] en route back to prison. Rebecca and Powell become engaged as a serial rapist begins terrorizing Llanview; Todd is the obvious suspect. It is ultimately revealed that Powell, threatened by Rebecca's obvious attraction to Todd, has descended into madness and has been raping women to emulate Todd and thereby win Rebecca's love once and for all. Powell is caught and institutionalized, and Rebecca leaves town.

In 2009, former Llanview police detective [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] is investigating a serial murderer who leaves clues pointing to Marty's 1993 rape.

In April 2006, the secret comes out: as a youth, David had shot police detective Thomas McBain, father of Detective [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]]. At the hospital, Paige had operated on Thomas despite the fact that she was intoxicated, and McBain had died. Spencer had covered up both crimes.

David is arrested, and Paige's license to practice medicine is revoked.

It is also revealed that Paige had a son by Spencer and put him up for adoption, never telling Spencer. Llanview attorney [[Hugh Hughes (One Life to Live)|Hugh Hughes]] is discovered to be that son, but is killed in a car wreck on September 22, 2006.

Luna was a funny and intelligent woman who was a Southern new-age goddess worshiper. She believed in crystals, horoscopes, and auras. She arrived in Llanview by parachute and fell in love with Max Holden. Max's eyes were set on Blair, and so they decided to become business partners and open up a health spa called Serenity Springs. During that time, Max had told Luna that nothing could happen between them, and he wanted to be friends, that was all.

Luna started her own radio show called &quot;Love Line.&quot; In that time, she began receiving poems and love letters from a guy named Suede Pruitt. Suede escaped from prison and made his way to Llanview to see Luna and asked for her help. He told her he was innocent, so Luna consulted the goddess. The goddess told her he was telling the truth, even though Max was told her Suede could not be trusted. Suede was wrongfully accused of murdering his wife (Deborah), who ironically, looked like Luna. Suede told her that Deborah's father, Marcus, was the killer. So, Max, Luna, and Suede planned to set Marcus up to tell the truth. Max got shot and he was rushed to the hospital. Max was fighting for his life and she had to go into to a trance to save him. She saved him and he professed his love to her.

They married in December of 1993. She helped Max out with gambling problems, she saved Al from death and got struck by a car. She was paralyzed, but was able to walk again. In May of 1995, she had twins, one girl and one boy. Their names were Francis Thomas and Leslie Diana. Luna's brother was in danger with a gang called the Arrows. She went the Community Center to see her brother and he was held up by the gang. When she walked in, Luis (gang member) turned around and shot her right in the stomach. She survived surgery, but she later became feverish and died right in Max's arms. Luna has returned several times over the years as a spirit, most recently she appeared to Max after his son, Al died.

On August 22, 2011, Kimberly, who is in Anchorage, Kentucky working as a stripper at The Spotted Pony strip club, is seen talking to a mysterious comatose woman at a hospital. Next to the mysterious woman's bed is a picture of Stacy and Kim together. Kim promises to have Stacy taken care of at the hospital before she goes back to Llanview to win back her ex-husband's [[Clint Buchanan]]'s heart, and to still get her piece of the Buchanan fortune after Kim was blackmailed out of Llanview and out of her marriage to Clint a year and a half ago over a mysterious secret that [[David Vickers Buchanan]] had on Kim over what happened at The Spotted Pony several years ago. It is implied that Stacy is still alive. On September 20, 2011, Rex find the hospital that her friend is at. Kim gets Rex to leave and returns to the hospital room and says &quot;That was a close one, Stacy!&quot;. On September 21, 2011, Kim's brother and former scamming partner [[Cutter Wentworth]] arrives at the hospital in Kentucky to confront Kim on stealing Rex's gun from him that he had hidden in the stuffed beaver he bought from [[Roxy Balsom]] (Cutter quit being a con artist so that she could impress his girlfriend and former scamming partner [[Aubrey Wentworth]], who also reformed from her grifting ways. Cutter was tempted to use the gun to blackmail Rex for the Buchanan fortune, but later changed his mind so that he could still be a changed man for Aubrey, and lied to her about turning over the gun to the police). Kim told him that she wanted to use the gun to blackmail Rex's biological mother [[Echo DiSavoy]] to convince Rex to sign over the entire Buchanan fortune back to Clint that Rex extorted money from so that Clint could get Rex's finace's Gigi's heart after she died from carbon monoxide poisoning after being trapped in the basement of a rental house that was set-up by [[Jack Manning]], who was bullying Shane in high school, when Gigi went in Shane's place to walk into a trap set-up by Jack and his friends. Kim also wanted to use some of the money to help pay Stacy's medical bills. When Cutter walked into Stacy's hospital room, he notices something different about Stacy. Cutter then tells Kim about Stacy's mysterious condition, and Kim tells her brother not to tell anyone about what he saw strange about Stacy. Cutter agrees to keep Kim's secret about Stacy, noting that no one will believe him when he tells anyone back in Llanview about what happened to Stacy.

On October 10, 2011 Kim comes to Stacy's room and tells her she can now pay for her medical bills since Echo forged Rex's signature on the documents to give all that he took from Clint back. It is also revealed that Stacy has Gigi's face thanks to plastic surgery she got in [[South America]] after she survived drowning in that frozen lake a year and a half ago. Cutter after his break up with Aubrey then decides to revert back to his grifting ways by blackmailing Kim to give him the forged documents so that he could use it to scam the Buchanans, or he'll reveal the truth about Stacy to everyone in Llanview. Cutter also asked Kim if she was sure that it was really Stacy in that hospital room. Kim told Cutter that it was really Stacy, and that she got plastic surgery to look like her sister so that she can take over her life. Kim also confessed to Cutter that she tried to stop Stacy's scheme against Gigi when she followed Stacy to Llanview, and found her in the basement of a rental house that was leaking carbon monoxide, along with Gigi's dead body. Cutter told Kim he believed her story, and Kim then gave the forged documents to Cutter on the condition that he'll give her some of the money to pay for Stacy's hospital bills. On October 14, 2011, Stacy wakes up from her coma. She then asks Cutter questions about where she is and who she is, but he is evasive to her answers. He only tells her that she has a sister who recently passed away. Cutter then decides to use Stacy as leverage to blackmail Rex for the Buchanan fortune. On October 24, Stacy looks up information on Gigi and Stacy on the internet on Cutter's laptop computer he left in her room, and comes to the conclusion that she might be Gigi. Stacy then leaves the hospital, and goes to Llanview to stop by the Llanfair estate and sees [[Tina Lord]] at the front door. Tina told her that she didn't recognized the name since she's been out of town for a few years, but will ask her relatives. Tina then ask her her niece [[Jessica Buchanan]] if she knew about Gigi. Jessica told her that Gigi is dead, and when Tina went back to talk to Stacy, she saw that she was gone. Stacy then went to Gigi's gravesite at the cemetery, and was confused about who she was and why she looked like her dead sister. Cutter then found her at the cemetery and she asked him about why she looked like someone who just died. Cutter then explained to Stacy that she wasn't Gigi, and that she got plastic surgery to look like her sister to take over her life, and survived being trapped in that basement that was leaking carbon monoxide that killed her sister before her friend Kim rescued her to take her to the hospital when she ended up in a coma. On October 28, Cutter convinces Stacy to crash Natalie and Brody's costume themed engagement party at the Buchanan Mansion on Halloween night with him so that when she sees Rex and Shane at the party, it could help her to get her memories back. Cutter dressed himself in a mummy costume, and Stacy dressed as Little Red Riding Hood wearing a mask when they both arrive at the mansion greeted by Rex at the door. Stacy tells Cutter that she felt strong feelings towards Rex when she first saw him at the door. Cutter and Stacy then leaves the party to head back home. The next morning, after Stacy wakes up from dreaming about Rex, Stacy confronts Cutter about why she's using her to get to Rex. Cutter explains to Stacy that he's using her so that she can reunite with Rex, and that he can get the Buchanan fortune from him while they both benefit from what they want from Rex. Cutter also reminds Stacy that she used to be a con artist herself, and that's how she got to Rex before. Rex went to the Minute Man and broke into the room to find Stacy himself. Stacy then hid in the bathroom before Rex entered the room, where she heard Rex scold her for trying to fool him to think that she was his dead fiance Gigi. Stacy told Cutter that she wanted out of their deal so that she could get plastic surgery to look like her old self again. On November 14, Stacy goes to the airport to catch a flight to [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]] to reverse her plastic surgery, when Cutter stops her from boarding the plane. Stacy tells Cutter that she doesn't want to be part of his scam anymore, and that she doesn't want to hurt Rex and Shane anymore by pretending to be Gigi. Cutter becomes touched by Stacy's change of heart and drops his scam against Rex, and allows her to go to Brazil, on the condition that he can tag along with her on the trip. Stacy then asked Cutter to talk about his past after they boarded the plane. Cutter then talked about how his father William J. &quot;Billy Joe&quot; Wentworth Jr. grew up poor and then became rich after investing his money in the stock market after getting a job as a [[stock trader]]. Billy Joe then married a woman named Alexandra, who later abandoned him and Cutter and his sister Kim by taking off with some of Billy Joe's money. Billy Joe later killed himself after he failed to find his missing wife. Cutter and Kim then both were separated going into the foster care system after their father died. Cutter ran away from all of his foster homes to find his sister until he found her, and they later supported themselves by becoming con artists to try to regain the wealth they used to have in their early childhoods. Stacy began to feel sorry for Cutter after hearing about his tragic past. Stacy and Cutter then arrived in Rio where they went to the plastic surgeon's waiting room outside his office. They both asked a nurse if Stacy has been here before to get plastic surgery. Stacy and Cutter then both sat down to wait for the doctor when Cutter's estranged mother Alexandra (who later revealed herself to be [[Alex Olanov]]) left the doctor's office and complained about her botched surgery on her cheek. After Cutter confronted Alex about abandoning her family, and told her about his father and her husband's suicide, Alex told Cutter to talk to her in a private room to explain her side of the story. Stacy told Cutter that she was there for him as &quot;back-up&quot; if he needed her when he talked to his mother. Cutter and Alex then went into the private room when Cutter suddenly strangled Alex's neck to avenge her for walking out on her family. Stacy then went into the room to stop Cutter from choking Alex. When Rex and Aubrey arrived in Rio in the waiting room outside, Cutter decided to involve Alex in his scheme to hide Stacy from Rex and Aubrey, so that she could make it up to Cutter for abandoning her family. After Alex and Cutter fooled Rex and Aubrey with their scheme, Alex gave Cutter her business card to contact her if he ever needed her help again, and also wished Cutter and Stacy good luck before she went back home to St. Blaze's Island. Cutter then vowed to Stacy that she will get her surgery the next day. On December 1, Stacy is comforted by Cutter after she wakes up from a nightmare about her sister's death and her being trapped in that carbon monoxide poisoned rental house basement. Cutter then confided in Stacy about his fear about being a lot like his mother who was a con artist like he ended up becoming in his life. Stacy then reassured Cutter that by going along with her to Rio to reverse her plastic surgery and dropping his scam against Rex, that he was on the path to redemption. Cutter then planted a kiss on Stacy! Stacy then pulled away from Cutter after she was surprised that he kissed her off guard. Cutter told Stacy that he had started to develop feelings for her when she helped him reform his grifting ways by helping her out. Stacy and Cutter then get a phone call from Stacy's plastic surgeon Dr.Fascinella to alert them about Stacy's appointment. Cutter then takes Stacy to have her examined by the doctor at his office. Dr.Fascinella then asks Cutter to step out with him outside his office. The doctor told Cutter that the woman he just examined wasn't Stacy, but was the woman who she based her altered looks from, which was her sister Gigi! Cutter then figured out that Stacy was really Gigi, and that Stacy was the one that really died in that contaminated and toxic basement and had her heart donated to Clint, while Gigi was the one who really survived and ended up in a coma in that Kentucky hospital that Kim checked her in when she thought that she was Stacy.

'''Hannah O' Connor''' arrives in Llanview in 2010 as [[Cole Thornhart|Cole Thornhart's]] project partner. She is revealed to be [[Robert Ford (One Life To Live)|Robert Ford's]] ex-flame in March and that she wants him back. After several attempts to bring Ford back, Hannah loses hope and briefly turns to drugs. Cole catches Hannah with drugs and helps her through her troubles, suggesting that she see his mom, [[Marty Saybrooke]] for counseling. In April, Hannah comes to Cole's apartment to see Cole. After spilling coffee on her shirt, Hannah takes her shirt off to clean it. [[Todd Manning]] sees Hannah and Cole together and attacks Cole, causing drama between Cole and his girlfriend, [[Starr Manning]].

Marty is pushed down a flight of stairs, and miscarries her unborn baby as a result of the attack.  Hannah claims that she saw Starr's father Todd attack Marty. Both Starr and Todd disagrees and thinks Hannah is using her seeing who pushed Marty to break up Starr and Cole so Hannah have Cole to herself. Hannah then is accused to have tried to kill Ford, so she uses Cole and tells him Starr is dating a man named James Ford who she has just met. Hannah leads Cole to her old home in [[Delaware]]. Hannah then pretends Starr and James slept together, so this causes Cole to be depressed and kiss Hannah. Cole stops the kiss and escapes with Hannah when she is found by the police. Cole and Hannah head to a motel in Maryland where they run into Cris and Layla. John McBain and [[Natalie Buchanan]] soon arrive and place Hannah under arrest for the attempted murder of Robert.

Hannah hires Elijah Clarke as her lawyer, knowing he was the one who pushed Marty down the stairs. When they talk, Elijah threatens Hannah saying confess to pushing Marty down the stairs so Cole won't get hurt. Hannah fakes a breakdown and is sent to St. Anne's. She then continues to lie about Eli's crimes and Eli points a gun at Hannah and forces her to take several [[pain killer]] [[Tablet|pills]] and is out unconscious. She is revived by her doctors. While in her room alone John asks Hannah on what's really going on between her and Eli and finally reveals on what Eli has been holding over her and reveals to John that Eli had not only held at gunpoint but also forced her to take all the pills or Eli was going to hurt Cole and did to save Cole and was the only way to save him from danger. Hannah finally reveals to John that Eli pushed Marty down a flight of stairs and was being blackmailed into faking a breakdown and was forced to swallow a bottle of pills that could've killed her if Cole hadn't saved her. Hannah also told John that Eli attacked Ford. John assures Hannah that Eli will be brought to justice.

Later Marty visits Hannah and she apologize to Marty for all the trouble she caused her. Later in Hannah's court hearing, Marty volunteers to bring Hannah in her house and live with her under her care. Marty forgives her and tells her that she's going to have a good life. However, Hannah kidnaps Starr and Hope after they escape Eli, who had been holding them and Dani hostage, intending to kill them so she can have Cole all to herself. James Ford gets suspicious of Hannah and confronts her, but before he can call the cops she knocks him out with her father's pistol and kidnaps him as well. Hannah takes them all to the cemetery and forces James and Starr to dig their own graves at gunpoint before forcing Starr to [[Premature burial|bury James alive]]. Just as Hannah is about to do the same to Starr, James digs himself out of the grave and attacks her, managing to distract her long enough for Starr to bash her unconscious with a shovel, with the police arriving just in time to arrest her.

James accompanies the police and Hannah to the station, where Marty, having confessed to Eli's murder to protect Cole, watches them enter. James informs them of everything that Hannah has done. Hannah pleads with Marty to help her avoid prison time and get better, but instead, a shocked and furious Marty disowns her, coldly informing her that she is insane beyond fixing and that it was a mistake to ever trust her. Hannah is last seen being dragged away by the police, vocally bemoaning her circumstances.

[[FBI Agent]] '''Lee Ramsey''' is assigned to track down [[Marcie McBain]], who has taken her adoptive son [[Tommy McBain|Tommy]] on the run after custody is awarded to his biological father, [[Todd Manning]]. Ramsey and [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]] Police Detective/former FBI Agent [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] share some bad blood; Ramsey had carried an unrequited torch for John's late fiancee Caitlin Fitzgerald, and blames John for her murder years before at the hands of a [[serial killer]] whom both men were tracking. As Marcie is married to John's brother [[Michael McBain|Michael]], John initiates his own pursuit of her; he and Ramsey and continually run into one another on their separate searches across the country. After [[Marty Saybrooke]] and her son [[Cole Thornhart]] go missing, John returns to Llanview to find them. John discovers that Ramsey has been searching for the terrorist who had murdered Marty's husband, [[Patrick Thornhart]], and entices Ramsey to break off his hunt for Marcie in order to finally capture Patrick's killer. John and Ramsey are forced to work together to track down Marty and Cole. John discovers a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in the back of one of Patrick's books of poetry, and later uses it to bargain with terrorist Simon Ryerson in [[Ireland]] in exchange for Marty and Cole's safety. The transaction is botched by Ramsey's reckless actions, and Marty is apparently killed in an explosion. Ramsey is promptly suspended by the Bureau for his conduct during the affair.

Now a free agent, Ramsey offers his services to Todd as a bounty hunter. They confront waitress [[Gigi Morasco]], whom they soon discover is hiding Marcie from the authorities. Ramsey takes Gigi and her young son [[Shane Morasco|Shane]] hostage, over Todd's objections, and demands that Gigi call Marcie to meet with her.  Marcie arrives but escapes; Ramsey attempts to gun her down while she is still holding Tommy. Todd angrily struggles with Ramsey, and Michael McBain is shot instead. He survives, and Marcie is later apprehended. Ramsey visits a jailed Gigi and threatens to harm her and Shane if she tells anyone about Ramsey and Todd holding her hostage. He is later arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill Gigi and Shane, but on February 15, 2008 is inexplicably named the new Commissioner of Llanview Police Department after the mayor fires [[Bo Buchanan]]. It soon becomes clear that Mayor Lowell is in league with Ramsey for some mysterious reason.

Loyal Llanview police officers [[Antonio Vega]] and [[Talia Sahid]] are determined to get Bo his job back, and work with John to oust Ramsey and expose him as a crooked cop. To this end, Antonio and Talia stage a break-up, and Antonio tricks Ramsey into believing that he has switched allegiances and is open to Ramsey's corrupting influence. With Antonio as an accomplice, Ramsey orchestrates the theft of the crown jewels of Mendorra, set to be displayed in Llanview at [[Lindsay Rappaport]]'s Fine Arts Gallery. During the heist, Ramsey attempts to have Talia framed for criminal collusion and tries to have her dismissed from the force. On June 11, 2008, it is revealed that Ramsey has been secretly caring for an injured and confused Marty in the penthouse he had purchased from Todd, and that he had the jewels stolen in order to sell them on the black market and pay for Marty's private medical care.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC 2008-06-11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2008/20080611.html |title='&amp;#39;One Life to Live'&amp;#39; recap (6/11/08) - ABC.com |publisher=Abc.go.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It becomes clear that the crooked Ramsey has compassion for Marty, and harbors regret for his part in her near-fatal accident. He tells Marty that he hopes to heal her physical and mental traumas and release her to her family and friends, and then be reinstated by the FBI himself. Ramsey's buyer for the jewels turns out to be Todd's long-lost sister [[Tina Lord]] â now the Crown Princess of Mendorra. Tina arrives at Ramsey's penthouse with a briefcase full of [[Euro]]s, and the two make an exchange. But when Tina briefly moves in another room, thugs sent by [[United States Ambassador]] to Mendorra Jonas Chamberlain burst into the penthouse and shoot Ramsey to death. Ramsey's last act as he lies wounded is to crawl towards the penthouse stairs, in an attempt to protect Marty.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC 2008-06-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2008/20080612.html |title='&amp;#39;One Life to Live'&amp;#39; recap (6/12/08) - ABC.com |publisher=Abc.go.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ramsey's death, [[Carlo Hesser]] reveals that Ramsey had appointed to the commissionerâs office, by him, via the mayor. In addition, Ramsey had been in Hesser's employ as part of the scheme with the Mendorran Crown Jewels, and had secured Carlo's secret release from Statesville Prison.

''[[John Rue]] and [[January LaVoy]] (October 22, 2007 â January 17, 2008; May 7, 2008 â May 12, 2008; July 16, 2008 â August 28, 2008; December 1, 2008 â November 25, 2009 (him) /December 28, 2009 (her))''

'''Maurice âMoeâ Stubbs''' is the owner and chef of the Bon Jour CafÃ© in [[Paris, Texas|Paris]], [[Texas]] â and '''Noelle Ortiz''' is one of his waitresses â in October 2007 when wealthy [[Victoria Lord Davidson|Viki Davidson]] is revealed to be secretly working at the diner to escape the complications of her life in [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Bossy, impatient and rude, Moe is frustrated by his clientele's lack of appreciation for his gourmet cooking skills; his gruff exterior hides a warm and caring heart. Close friends with Viki, Noelle shares tales of woe from life with her ex-husband. Moe and Noelle are soon in competition over the &quot;Dallas Pie Bake-Off,&quot; in which both hope to win the blue ribbon for &quot;Best Pie.&quot; After a judges' tasting debacle at the Bon Jour which turns into a food fight, both Moe and Noelle are inadvertently disqualified, and Noelle is crushed. Struck by Noelle's sadness, Moe selflessly goes to the selection committee and has Noelle re-entered in the contest, but does not submit himself.  Noelle wins the blue ribbon, and the two longtime platonic friends begin to grow closer, a fact which does not go unnoticed by Viki. When fugitive [[Marcie McBain]] (who had been posing as new waitress &quot;Sally Ann&quot;) is arrested along with Noelle's fellow waitress [[Gigi Morasco]] following a police stand-off, Noelle takes care of Gigi's young son [[Shane Morasco|Shane]]. After the crisis makes national news, Viki's daughters [[Natalie Buchanan|Natalie]] and [[Jessica Buchanan|Jessica]] arrive at the Bon Jour CafÃ©; Moe happily serves them his duck entree which, unlike the regular lunch crowd, the girls fully appreciate. Not long afterwards, Moe, Noelle, Shane, and a newly released Gigi share an emotional goodbye with Viki as she and her family return to Llanview.

Moe and Noelle are seen again in May 2008, when Natalie and her secret lover, con man [[Jared Banks]], visit Paris and the Bon Jour to get away from the prying eyes of the [[Buchanan family]]. They are unaware that the notorious [[David Vickers]], the true Buchanan heir, has taken a job at the Bon Jour as a [[busboy]] alongside a reluctant Moe and Noelle. After discovering that Jared and Natalie are lying to the Buchanans about Jared's lineage (but unaware that he is the true heir), David quits the Bon Jour to follow them back to Llanview, but before leaving, urges Moe and Noelle to admit their mutual feelings for each other.

Moe and Noelle reappear again in July 2008 when [[Bo Buchanan]] and [[Rex Balsom]] visit the Bon Jour separately. By this time, Moe and Noelle have revealed their feelings for each other and are shown to be in a committed romantic relationship. When Bo and Rex travel through time back to 1968, they discover Moe and Noelle's counterparts in the past: Moe is &quot;Jeremiah Stubbs,&quot; (Moe's father), the hippie proprietor of what was then known as the &quot;Good Day CafÃ©,&quot; and Noelle is &quot;Rosa,&quot; a strong-willed Mexican maid working for the Buchanan family alongside [[Maria Roberts|Maria Vasquez]]. Rosa is Maria's only confidante about her out-of-wedlock pregnancy by [[Clint Buchanan]]; her unborn child will grow up to be [[Cord Roberts]]. Much like Moe and Noelle, Jeremiah and Rosa are shown to have feelings for one another. Unlike Moe, Jeremiah is a mellow, peace-loving fellow who is shown to oppose the [[Vietnam War]] and deal in certain &quot;medicinal substances,&quot; which he includes as ingredients in some of his baked goods. While sharing some &quot;brownies&quot; with a young [[Renee Divine]], he encourages her to reconsider her frayed relationship with [[Asa Buchanan]], the love of her life. Back in 2008, Gigi returns to Paris during her search for a missing Rex, Noelle has the chance to catch up with her former co-worker. After getting what information she could about Rex from Moe, Gigi heads to the Buchanan Ranch. After the customers leave, Moe proposes to Noelle, who accepts.

In late 2008, an engaged Moe and Noelle visit Viki at the &quot;Buenos Dias CafÃ©,&quot; [[Carlotta Vega]]'s burned-down diner rebuilt as a recreation of the Bon Jour CafÃ©. [[Dorian Lord]], having previously tasted Moe's quality cooking in Texas, invites him to be her personal chef, and he accepts. Later, as part of her plot to marry or gain power-of-attorney over Buchanan heir David, Dorian gives Moe her house and its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5973/Not_Quite_Busted |title='&amp;#39;One Life to Live'&amp;#39; recap (1/26/09) |publisher=Soaps.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moe and Noelle soon marry in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] on February 9, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2006-02-09&quot;/&gt;

'''Carlotta Vega''' (nÃ©e '''Espinoza''') is introduced in 1995 as the longtime maid and loyal confidante of [[Dorian Lord]].  Carlotta's teenage son [[Cristian Vega|Cristian]] soon becomes romantically involved with heiress [[Jessica Buchanan]]. At first, both Carlotta and Jessica's parents disapprove of the match. Carlotta's elder son [[Antonio Vega|Antonio]], a former gang member in [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]]'s Angel Square, is released from prison the same year after serving a seven-year sentence for murder. Carlotta eventually quits Dorian's employ to run her own diner. Antonio later proves that his crime had been self-defense; he becomes a lawyer and then a police officer, eventually leaving town in 1998, but returning in 2000. Carlotta herself is romantically linked at times to both [[Clint Buchanan]] and [[Hank Gannon]].

Carlotta suffers through the disappearance and presumed death of Cristian in 2003; Antonio is also accused of killing [[Keri Reynolds]], the mother of his child, but is later exonerated. Also in 2003, Carlotta's 15-year-old goddaughter [[Adriana Cramer|Adriana ColÃ³n]] arrives in Llanview; by 2004 it is revealed that Adriana is actually the secret daughter of Carlotta's brother, crime lord Manuel Santi, and Dorian Lord.

A Cristian lookalike with no memory of his past appears in Llanview in 2004, secretly programmed by Manuel's son [[Tico Santi]] to kill Antonio â who is secretly Manuel's eldest son and heir. Carlotta is forced to admit that Antonio is actually Manuel's son with Isabella/Angelina; the attempt to murder Antonio fails as the trauma of trying to kill his own brother brings Cristian's memories flooding back. After killing Tico and being sent to prison in 2005, Cristian keeps his true identity hidden from his family. Later in 2005, Cristian's sentence is overturned; he is released from jail and reveals himself to his overjoyed mother.
