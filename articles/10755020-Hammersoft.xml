'''Mark Ladwig''' (born May 6, 1980 in [[Fargo, North Dakota]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[pair skater]]. He competes with [[Amanda Evora]]. They are two-time (2010, 2011) [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. silver medalists]] and two-time (2007, 2009) pewter medalists. 

==Career==
Ladwig skated with Kelsey Sollom and Keri Blakinger while at the [[University of Delaware Figure Skating Club]] in [[Newark, Delaware]]. He was a volunteer at the 2002 Winter Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/vancouver/figureskating/2010-02-10-pairs_N.htm US figure skating pairs grateful for Olympic chance] accessed April 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he began skating with Amanda Evora, and together they represented the United States in several international events, with their best placement being a bronze medal at the 2007 Nebelhorn Trophy.

2009â10 was a breakthrough season for Evora and Ladwig. They finished 2nd at the US National Championships, their best finish yet at the event, which led to their selection for the US Olympic team. At the [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Vancouver Olympics]], they beat their previous personal best by a sizable margin, and finished tenth, making them the top US pair at the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/02/16/1482034/chinese-pair-in-front.html Figure skating gold goes to Chinese pair] accessed April 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They later competed at [[Worlds|2010 World Figure Skating Championships]] for the first time in their career, and finished in ninth place.

Ladwig served on the 2009â10 [[U.S. Figure Skating]] Athletes Advisory Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?cat=7&amp;id=826 | title = Athletes Advisory Committee Leadership | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | accessdate = November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the pairs vice-chair of the 2008â09 Athletes Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/AthletesAdvisoryTree.pdf | title = U.S. Figure Skating Athletes Advisory Committee 2008â09 Permanent Committee |format= PDF | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | accessdate = November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2010â2011 season, the pair was assigned to compete at Cup of China where they finished fifth (151.66 pts) and later earned their first Grand Prix medal, a bronze, at Rostelecom Cup, with a season's best of 110.27 and total score of 162.85. Evora and Ladwig once again finished second at US Nationals, and were selected to compete at [[2011 Four Continents Championships|Four Continents]] and [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]]. At Four Continents, Ladwig's left skate heel broke during the short program, but he and Evora were able to resume the program within the allowed three minutes after Canadian [[Rudi Swiegers]] lent his own boot to Ladwig.&lt;ref name=sd110217&gt;{{cite news | url = http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110217&amp;content_id=16661420&amp;vkey=ice_news | title =Disaster strikes, but Swiegers saves the day | first = Lynn | last = Rutherford | first2 = Alexandra | last2 =Stevenson |date = February 17, 2011 | work = IceNetwork.com | accessdate = February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladwig was able to repair his skate prior to the free skate,&lt;ref name=taipei&gt;{{cite web| url= http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110218&amp;content_id=16675398&amp;vkey=ice_news | title = Friday: Tidbits from New York and Taipei | first = Alexandra | last = Stevenson | first2 = Lynn | last2 = Rutherford | work= Icenetwork | date = February 18, 2011 | accessdate= August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pair went on to finish sixth overall.

Evora and Ladwig are noted for their longevity as a partnership, which is rare in U.S. pair skating.&lt;ref name=ic051811&gt;{{cite news | url = http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110518&amp;content_id=19225270&amp;vkey=ice_news | title = Evora, Ladwig commit to skate next season | first = Amy | last = Rosewater |date = May 18, 2011 | publisher = IceNetwork | accessdate = June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ladwig is originally from [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. He married Janet Marie Beverley on August 4, 2006, and their son Holden was born in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  Drew | last = Meekins | authorlink= Drew Meekins |coauthors= Sarah S.
