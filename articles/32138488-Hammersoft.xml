'''&quot;Committee of the Whole&quot;''' is a [[short story]] by [[science fiction]] author [[Frank Herbert]] which first appeared in [[Galaxy Science Fiction | Galaxy]] magazine in 1965 and later in Herbert's 1985 short story collection ''[[The Worlds of Frank Herbert]]''. It deals with the concept of [[Self control| restraint]] as a paramount virtue necessary for survival of a human race in times when both information and the means for production of [[Weapon of mass destruction | weapons of mass destruction]] are available to every individual.     

==Plot==
William R. Custer, a representative of farmers from Oregon, uses the public hearing for amendments to [[Taylor Grazing Act of 1934]] to showcase a weapon with enough power to ''&quot;cut the planet in half&quot;''. &lt;ref name=&quot;CW&quot;&gt; Herbert, Frank. The Worlds of Frank Herbert, London: New English Library, 1970. p.42. &lt;/ref&gt; The live broadcast of the hearing, during which Custer explains the details on how to build such a weapon, ensures that restraint becomes the key to survival of the human race, making threats and any form of slavery among humans obsolete, while also sending humanity in a new direction that may lead to its maturity. The idea of maturity of the human race would be fully developed by Herbert in the [[Dune Universe]], making it the main motivation behind the [[Bene Gesserit]] actions.
