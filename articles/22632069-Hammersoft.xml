==Episodes==
===Episode 1===
;Task 1
*'''Airdate:''' March 14, 2010
*'''Actual date:''' October 2009
*'''Task scope:''' The teams had to run a New York diner called Burger Heaven. They'll be making their own menus. The team with the most money wins.
*'''Tenacity project manager:''' Cyndi Lauper
*'''Rocksolid project manager:''' Bret Michaels
*'''Judges:''' [[Donald Trump]]; [[Ivanka Trump]]; [[Donald Trump, Jr.]]
*'''Winning team:''' Rocksolid
**'''Reasons for win:''' Although they didn't get $10,000 from Joan Rivers, they earned a total profit of $57,905. Bret Michaels had Curtis Stone create a range of expensive [[truffle]]-based dishes to ensure that even the members of the general public would be giving large donations.
*'''Losing team:''' Tenacity
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Even though they got $10,000 from Joan Rivers, they only earned $39,559. Ivanka said that Tenacity's price points were too low from tracking customers on the streets, and that the team were disorganized and failed to ensure that their big donors were served over the general public.
**'''Final boardroom:''' No final boardroom - Cyndi could not narrow it down to just two people.
*'''Fired:''' Carol Leifer - by process of elimination. Carol's name came up the most when Trump asked the teammates who should be fired.
*'''Notes''':
**Joan Rivers said the burger she got from Rocksolid's restaurant was cold and that she wanted to eliminate Rod Blagojevich for acting like a politician to the other customers.
**Trump came very close to firing Selita Ebanks, who brought in no money whatsoever during the task, but Ivanka spoke up in her defense and pointed out that she was the women's head chef and as such, deserved credit for the $10,000 given to the team by Joan Rivers.
**After Carol Leifer was eliminated, she asked Trump if he could donate some money to her charity, The North Shore Animal League. Trump agreed, and then donated $10,000 out of his pocket for Carol's charity.

===Episode 2===
;Task 2
*'''Airdate:''' March 21, 2010
*'''Task scope:''' Run a Kodak Storefront
*'''Task sponsor:''' [[Kodak]]
*'''Tenacity project manager:''' Maria Kanellis
*'''Rocksolid project manager:''' Sinbad
*'''Judges:''' [[Donald Trump]]; [[Ivanka Trump]]; [[Donald Trump, Jr.]]
*'''Winning team:''' Tenacity
**'''Reasons for win:''' They seemed to promote the product more than the men which is what the Kodak presidents were looking for despite numerous power outages that threatened them during the walkthrough
*'''Losing team:''' Rocksolid
**'''Reasons for loss:''' While the men were praised for using their celebrity power (such as Darryl posing in a New York Mets jersey) with certain people the men missed the bill on getting the product out to the customers and also lost because of a card that had a website to find the pictures that were taken at the store: the website was nowhere to be found on the card, according to 2 secret shoppers that shopped at the men's storefront
**'''Final boardroom:''' Sinbad, Bret Michaels, Rod Blagojevich

Upon questioning, the celebrities (apart from Bret Michaels, whom Trump did not get around to questioning before the firing occurred) all agreed that Holly Robinson Peete was the strongest of the remaining candidates, and that Maria Kanellis was the weakest. Maria then responded to Curtis Stone's criticism of her by accusing Curtis of being arrogant by &quot;taking a crap in our dressing room and leaving the stench in the room&quot; during the previous task. Mr. Trump felt that statement was offensive to Curtis's character and &quot;hitting below the belt,&quot; and Curtis told Mr. Trump that this was a &quot;good depiction&quot; of Maria's character. This, combined with the fact that Maria refused to apologise for her remark, resulted in her firing.

** According to Joan and Bill, Curtis was weaker than the other contestants, with Rancic even calling him &quot;a one-trick pony.&quot; Holly, Bret, and Sharon all agreed, although they also complimented him being a gentleman and a fantastic contestant. He was also fired for not having what it took to be the Celebrity Apprentice.
** Bill thought Sharon was not as strong as Holly or Bret, but Joan disagreed, feeling that Sharon and Holly should advance to finals.  In the end, Trump heeded Bill's advice and fired Sharon, as he thought she may not be 'strong enough' to deal with the huge task that was to come. He also had concerns that Sharon was too much in awe of Holly, due to Sharon's lengthy praises of her prior to the interviews, and felt that Sharon was effectively acknowledging Holly as being a better candidate.
