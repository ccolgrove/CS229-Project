'''Turbolinux''' is a Japanese [[Linux distribution]] targeting Asian users.

==Linux distribution==
The Turbolinux distribution was created as a rebranded Red Hat distribution by (then) Pacific HiTech employee Scott Stone.  Scott was the lead release engineer through version 3.6.

Turbolinux is notable for including licensed copies of CyberLink [[PowerDVD]] and [[Windows Media]] binary [[codec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS9651224512.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company==
Turbolinux (the company) was founded in 1992 as Pacific HiTech in [[Sandy, Utah]] by Cliff and Iris Miller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19981206005239/pht.com/corporate/index.html About Turbolinux (circa 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;

PHT changed its name to Turbolinux in June 1999 to better identify with its flagship product.

The Millers were &quot;terminated without cause&quot; from Turbolinux in July 2000 &lt;ref&gt;[http://lwn.net/2000/features/Turbolinux-ipo.php3 LWN analysis of Turbolinux IPO prospectus]&lt;/ref&gt; after a disagreement with [[venture capitalists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.com/feature/16703 &quot;Bumpy ride continues for Turbolinux: No more package sales in U.S.&quot; Linux.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

After several rounds of layoffs, Turbolinux sold its name and distribution to Japanese software corporation SRA in September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turbolinux.com/company/news/2002/020820.html SRA buys Turbolinux product and name]&lt;/ref&gt;  The former headquarters at [[Brisbane, California]] closed its doors shortly thereafter and all operations were relocated to [[Shibuya, Tokyo]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turbolinux.com/company/aboutcompany.html About Turbolinux (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbolinux successfully completed an [[IPO]] on the [[Osaka Stock Exchange]] in September 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turbolinux.com/cgi-bin/newsrelease/index.cgi?date2=20050816125136&amp;mode=syosai IPO announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; underwritten by [[Nikko Citigroup]], [[Livedoor]] Securities Co. Ltd., and [[Mizuho]] Investors Securities Co. Ltd.

Turbolinux is a member of the [[Interop Vendor Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linuxelectrons.com/news/linux/15392/turbolinux-joins-microsoft-interop-vendor-alliance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS27821+28-Nov-2007+BW20071128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://interopvendoralliance.org/Directory.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
