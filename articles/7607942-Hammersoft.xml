'''Palestinian Americans''' are [[United States|Americans]] of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ancestry. It is difficult to say when the first Palestinian immigrants arrived at the [[United States]]; however, many of the first immigrants to arrive were [[Christian]]s escaping persecution from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the late 19th century. Others came as a result of the tension during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]; the [[Six Day War]] and [[Yom Kippur War]].   

Many Palestinians settled down in cities like [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego, California]]; [[Chicago]] and the [[Chicagoland]] suburbs of [[Illinois]] and [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] alongside other [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] communities such as the [[Lebanese American|Lebanese]], [[Syrian American|Syrians]], [[Greek American|Greeks]], [[Italian American|Italians]], and [[Egyptian American|Egyptians]]. 

A Palestinian community of about 600 people can be found in [[Gallup, New Mexico]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The relatively small community actually goes back to the 1920s by a small movement of Palestinians involved in the agricultural and mineral industries. The local Southwest Indian Jewelry stores are primarily under ownership of Palestinian Americans. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} 

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there were 72,112 people of Palestinian ancestry living in the United States. However, The Arab American Institute Foundation estimates the figure at 252,000 while the Palestinian American Council puts it at 179,000 ''(1999)''. The definition of how a person identifies him/herself a &quot;Palestinian&quot; is one of political controversy. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

It is clearly understood that Palestinians, most of them practicing Christians of the Eastern Orthodox variety established large communities in the [[Americas]], among them [[Chile]] in [[South America]]. The diplomatic relationship between the U.S. government and Palestinians are often positive, but can be strained over the U.S.' alliance with [[Israel]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
