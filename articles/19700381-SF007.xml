'''Gconf-editor''' is an application for the [[GNOME]] computer desktop environment. It can be considered the graphical equivalent of [[gconftool]] and is used to maintain the GNOME registry.

Gconf-editor gives users the ability to access settings stored in the [[XML]]-based [[GConf]] configuration [[database]] or registry. It is used primarily by developers to [[debug]] [[application software|applications]], or by [[power user]]s to edit hidden and complex settings. It [[abstraction|abstracts]] the values from the GConf database and presents them in an interface similar to [[Microsoft Windows]]' [[Windows registry|registry]] editor.

Traditional CLI (Command Line Interface) power users of GNOME have criticized it as an excuse to over-simplify the user interface and design for the lowest common denominator. Preferences such as turning off desktop icons or changing window button order are not available through a friendly [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) like other settings but can only be changed using gconf-editor. GNOME core developers claim{{Who|date=October 2007}} that the majority of users find lots of options and choices confusing and difficult to learn, and that so-called power users have little difficulty finding options using an application such as Gconf-editor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Due to the controversy, other gconf tools have appeared, such as Gconfpref by [[MandrakeSoft]]. There are also [[patch (computing)|patches]] for popular applications, which add the ability to change the hidden options from within the application itself, avoiding the need for gconf-editor.
