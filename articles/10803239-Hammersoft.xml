==Den Watts==
{{Main|Den Watts}}
'''Den Watts''', played by actor [[Leslie Grantham]], is the original landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]]. He became well known for his tabloid nickname, &quot;Dirty Den&quot;. He perhaps is best remembered for his stormy love-hate relationship with his alcoholic first wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]]. After nearly 20 years of marriage, he hands divorce papers to her in the 1986 Christmas Day episode that was watched by a record-breaking 30.15&amp;nbsp;million viewers, more than half of the UK population at the time. He was also well known for his later involvement with the criminal gang known as [[The Firm (EastEnders)|The Firm]] that eventually led to an attempt on his life in 1989. For 14 years, it was believed that he had been killed, but he returned to Walford in September 2003. Seventeen months later, his character was killed off again, this time for good, at the hands of his manipulative second wife [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]]. Den was described by ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Louise Berridge]] as being arguably one of the most iconic soap characters ever.

==Ali Osman==
{{Main|Ali Osman}}
'''Ali Osman''', played by [[Nejdet Salih]], is a happy-go-lucky, easy going chap, which is in stark contrast to his highly strung wife, [[Sue Osman|Sue]]. He has a compulsive addiction to [[gambling]], which gets him into trouble on more than one occasion and his marriage ends in disaster after he had his wife sectioned. He is a member of the original ''EastEnders'' cast, appearing in the first episode on 19 February 1985. He remains with the show for nearly five years afterwards, making his final appearance on 10 October 1989. Ali Osman was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Ali, a [[Turkish Cypriot]], was originally intended to be named Chris. His name was changed to Ali when it dawned on Holland that he had given a [[Christian]] name to a [[Muslim]].  Ali was a well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the [[East End of London]]. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with.

==Arthur Fowler==
{{Main|Arthur Fowler}}
'''Arthur Fowler''' is the father of the [[Beale family|Fowler family]]. He is played by [[Bill Treacher]]. Arthur is essentially a good man, but makes some foolish choices and always ends up paying dearly for them. Bossed to the brink of insanity by his mother-in-law and wife ([[Lou Beale]] and [[Pauline Fowler]]), Arthur falls into the arms of another woman. During his time in [[Albert Square]] he suffers with [[mental disorder]], is sent to prison twice and eventually dies of a [[brain haemorrhage]] in 1996. Arthur Fowler was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Arthur was a member of the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[The Beale/Fowler family|the Beales and Fowlers]], and Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Arthur's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

'''Reginald &quot;Reg&quot; Cox''' was played by Johnnie Clayton in the opening episode and Marc Tufano in 1988 spin-off ''[[Civvy Street]]''. The first episode of ''EastEnders'' on 19 February 1985 centred upon pensioner Reg's death.  According to scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]], the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]], wanted to start the serial &quot;with a bang, throwing the audience into the middle of life in [the fictional setting of] [[Walford]]&quot;. The Reg Cox storyline was deemed as a good starting point, allowing various members of the community to be involved with or comment on the circumstances of the old man's murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;10years&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0563370572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first ever scene of the programme, the characters of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]), and [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]) were shown breaking down the door of Reg's flat. In Holland and Smith's book, ''The Inside Story'', the authors have outlined their original interpretation of the scene: &quot;[EastEnders] starts with a bang, as a size ten boot kicks down the door that's locked from the inside. The tiny, dirty and foul-smelling council-flat behind the battered door belongs to Reg Cox (known locally as &quot;the-old-boy&quot;, and a cantankerous bastard at the best of times) who hasn't been seen around &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Albert Square]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for days.... Once the door's down, three men rush into the gloomy main-room.... They find the old boy sitting in his favourite armchair beside the gas fire (which isn't on) â and he's very nearly dead.... By the end of the episode the old boy will have been removed from the square and taken to Intensive Care, and the entire community will be rife with gossip, which spreads round the houses like the plague. Via the gossip we're able to piece together the events leading up to the discovery of Reg&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
Reg lived alone at 23b [[Albert Square]]. On the morning of 19 February 1985, [[Naima Jeffery]] ([[Shreela Ghosh]]), who ran the shop on Bridge Street, became concerned about Reg after he had failed to make his daily milk purchase for the past three days and her husband, [[Saeed Jeffery]] ([[Andrew Johnson (actor)|Andrew Johnson]], mentioned this to [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), publican of the pub next door. Den and [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) roused [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]), who lived downstairs from Reg, to let them into the house and the three of them kicked in the door to Reg's room when he failed to answer their knocking. Den spoke the opening lines of the first episode, &quot;Stinks in here, dunnit?&quot;, followed by the discovery of an unconscious Reg slumped in his armchair. Den ran to get the local doctor, [[Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) and called for an ambulance. On 21 February 1985, they learnt that Reg had been severely beaten and died from injuries which had gone unnoticed when he was found. It was eventually revealed that [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman]]) was behind the beating when he was attempting to steal Reg's war medals.

Reg, who was 59 years old when he died, was not a popular figure in Albert Square. He was referred to as a 'cantankerous old [[wikt:git|git]]' by Arthur, called a 'miserable so and so' by [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) and a 'nasty old man' by his downstairs neighbour, [[Sue Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]]). But despite this, [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]) caused havoc around the Square, accusing Sue of neglect for allowing him to lie dying in his flat for days, without checking up on him. The character also appeared in the Christmas special ''[[Civvy Street]]'', set during [[World War II]], shown on 22 December 1988. He was played by Marc Tufano. He had gone [[Desertion|AWOL]] and sold dodgy gear during the Second World War.

==Ethel Skinner==
{{Main|Ethel Skinner}}
'''Ethel May Skinner''' ([[nÃ©e]] '''Lewis''') was played by the late [[Gretchen Franklin]]. Ethel Skinner also features in a 1988 ''EastEnders'' special, entitled ''[[List of EastEnders television spin-offs#Civvy Street|Civvy Street]]'', set on Albert Square during the [[World War II|Second World War]], where the character is played by [[Alison Bettles]]. Ethel was an ''EastEnders'' original character and in the early years she could always be found wandering the square with her adored pug [[Willy (EastEnders)|Willy]]. She and [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) were life long friends and although they wound each other up no end, they were completely dependent on each other. In fact Ethel trusted Dot so much that she even asked her to help her die in 2000, after she was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Ethel's original character outline states that she was born in 1920. However, during the series this was altered to 1916 and for many years her birthday fell on 19 February. When Ethel came back to Walford to die in 2000, she revealed to Dot that she had lied about her age for many years.

==Pauline Fowler==
{{Main|Pauline Fowler}}
'''Pauline Fowler''' ([[nÃ©e]] '''Beale''')&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_pauline_f.shtml|title=EastEnders character Pauline Fowler|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=24 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was played by actress [[Wendy Richard]] between 1985 and 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;gone&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5165860.stm|title=Wendy Richard to leave EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC]]|format=video|date=10 July 2006|accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauline was created by scriptwriter [[Tony Holland]] and producer [[Julia Smith]] as one of ''EastEnders' ''original characters. She made her debut in the soap's first episode on 19 February 1985, and remained for twenty-one years and ten months, making her the second longest-running original character, surpassed only by [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Pauline was a staple in the UK press during her time in ''EastEnders'', representative of the symbiosis between Britain's soaps and tabloid newspapers. Widely read tabloids, such as ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', would routinely publish articles about forthcoming developments in Pauline's storylines.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Britain's tabloids and Britain's soaps feed off each other: newspapers publish articles about forthcoming developments in shows like &quot;EastEnders&quot; and viewers tune in to watch the prophecies come true.&quot; {{cite news|title=When the East End Marries Fleet Street, Tabloids Gloat|date=4 November 2005|author=Cowell, Alan|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical opinion on the character differs.

==Harold Legg==
{{Main|Harold Legg}}
'''Doctor Harold Legg''' was played by [[Leonard Fenton]]. Dr. Legg was [[Walford]]'s original GP. He was widely trusted within the community, and was always on hand to dish out advice. Dr Legg appeared as a regular character between 1985 and 1989, but continued to appear in a recurring role until 1997. He was officially retired in 1999 by executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], though he has made cameos since this time in 2000, 2004 and 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;nadia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60611215.html|title=Nadia quits Square; She joins exodus from EastEnders|publisher=''The Mirror'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Harold Legg was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Dr. Legg was an attempt to represent the successive wave of [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrants that had settled in the [[East End of London]] between 1881 and 1914 in order avoid the persecution that they were being subjected to in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation of East End born Jews (as Dr. Legg was meant to represent) prospered in the area until the 1930s when [[Oswald Mosley]]'s British Union of Fascists was formed, and used violence to instil fear in the Jewish population.&lt;ref name=&quot;jew&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/london/article_2.shtml East End Jews]&quot;, ''BBC''.

==Lou Beale==
{{Main|Lou Beale}}
'''Louise Ada &quot;Lou&quot; Beale''' ([[nÃ©e]] '''Medeemey''') was played by [[Anna Wing]]. The character is played by [[Karen Meagher]] in the 1988 ''EastEnders'' special, ''[[List of EastEnders television spin-offs#Civvy Street|Civvy Street]]'', set during the [[Second World War]]. Lou Beale was the first ''EastEnders'' character to be created by series co-creator [[Tony Holland]], taking the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Lou was the archetypal [[East End of London|East End]] matriarch throughout ''EastEnders'' first three years. An intimidating force within the local community, she was the dowager of [[Albert Square]]'s central family, [[The Fowler/Beale Family|the Beales and Fowlers]]. Never afraid to speak her mind, and woe betide anyone who managed to get on her wrong side, Lou had the respect of her friends and family, even if they did find her a bit of a nuisance at times. Born in the [[East End of London|East End]], Lou lived in [[Walford]] all her life. Albert and Lou came to their house on the corner of [[Albert Square]], number forty-five, on getting married during the 1930s. Lou remained in the house throughout the [[Second World War]] and brought up her children there. Her affinity and ties with the area meant that she tended to view Albert Square as her own and that gave her an excuse to intrude into people's business as she saw fit.

==Willy==
{{Main|Willy (EastEnders)}}
'''Willy''' was a [[Pug]], who appeared in the first episode of the programme and remained in the show until 1992. He belonged to [[Ethel Skinner]] who loved him dearly. Willy was cast less than a week before the filming of ''EastEnders'' began. From the beginning it was decided that the pensioner [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) was to have a [[Yorkshire Terrier]] named Willy (after her dead husband). The company Janimals, who specialized in providing and training animals for television and films, was contacted by ''EastEnders'' co-creator/producer [[Julia Smith]], and informed her that they could provide an experienced Pug for the part (he had previously starred in ''[[Swallows and Amazons]]''). The dog was brought to the studio to meet [[Gretchen Franklin]], the actress who played Ethel. She took a shine to him straight away and so the pug was cast as Willy. Willy and [[Roly]] the poodle shared a dressing room at [[Elstree Studios]].&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saeed Jeffery==
{{Main|Saeed Jeffery}}
'''Saeed Jeffery''' was played by [[Andrew Johnson (actor)|Andrew Johnson]]. Saeed was the original owner of the First til Last grocery store. He was never truly accepted in Walford, and his arranged marriage ended in divorce after it was discovered that he'd been making obscene phone calls to women. He left Walford in disgrace, leaving his business to his wife. Saeed Jeffery was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Saeed and his wife [[Naima Jeffery|Naima]] were the first [[British Asian|Asian]] characters to appear in the soap. Black and Asian characters were two ethnic minorities that had previously been under-represented in British soap before ''EastEnders'' aired. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with.

==Naima Jeffery==
{{Main|Naima Jeffery}}
'''Naima Jeffery''' was played by [[Shreela Ghosh]]. Naima tried to embrace [[Western culture]], but this wasn't easy since her family constantly tried to force her to adhere to their ancient customs. Sick of being forced to live in an arranged marriage with a husband she loathed, Naima made a stand and shamed her family by filing for a divorce. Naima Jeffery was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Naima and her husband were the first [[Asian people|Asian]] characters to appear in the soap. Black and Asian characters were two ethnic minorities that had previously been under-represented in British soap before ''EastEnders'' aired. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with.

==Angie Watts==
{{Main|Angie Watts}}
'''Angela &quot;Angie&quot; Watts''' ([[nÃ©e]] '''Shaw'''), played by [[Anita Dobson]] from the first episode of the show until 1988 when the actress decided to quit and the character was written out. Angie was well known for her cheeky banter, her huge shaggy [[Permanent wave|perm]] and turning to [[alcohol]] during her stormy marriage to cheating [[Den Watts|Den]] which ended when he handed her divorce papers on Christmas Day, in an episode watched by a record-breaking 30.1 million viewers. Despite being the loud and feisty lady of Walford, and having a close relationship with her beloved adopted daughter [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]], she didn't have much real happiness during her time in [[Albert Square]] and [[alcoholism]] finally claimed her life in 2002 when she died of [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]]. Angie Watts was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. The character of Angie was originally going to be named Pearl&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she, her husband and adopted daughter were to be the occupants of the soap's local pub, now famously known as [[The Queen Vic]]. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt; Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were going to be more 'real'. The Watts were seen by Holland as integral to the shows success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub was going to be a monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt;

==Nick Cotton==
{{Main|Nick Cotton}}
'''Nick Cotton''', played by [[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]] on a recurring basis from the soap's debut episode in February 1985, through to his last appearance to date in 2009.

His storylines have seen him twice commit murder, succumb to a heroin addiction, and attempt to poison his own mother, amongst numerous other misdemeanours. Nick was also the subject of a special [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] episode, ''[[List of EastEnders television spin-offs|The Return of Nick Cotton]]'', which aired in October 2000.

==Sue Osman==
{{Main|Sue Osman}}
'''Susan &quot;Sue&quot; Osman''' was played by [[Sandy Ratcliff]]. She was one of the serial's original characters, appearing in its first episode on 19 February 1985 and departing on-screen in May 1989.

During her four years on-screen, the character contended with a phantom pregnancy, marital breakdown and finally insanity. Ratcliff left the role in 1989 after press stories began circulating about her private life.&lt;ref name=counselor&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/2845150/Square-are-they-now-EastEnders-celebrates-25-years.html#ixzz0iCLBNwG0| title= Square are they  | work = [[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] | author = Emma Cox | date = 2010-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete was featured in the soap for eight years as the local fruit and veg trader of [[Albert Square]]; he was a member of the original focal clan in the serial, [[Beale family|the Beales and Fowlers]]. Pete was portrayed as a macho and somewhat insensitive individual who struggled to cope with emotion. Pete was axed from the soap in 1993 and departed in May that year after over eight years on-screen. The character was killed off-screen later that year following Peter Dean's public criticism of the BBC.

==Kathy Beale==
{{Main|Kathy Mitchell}}
'''Katherine &quot;Kathy&quot; Mitchell''' (nÃ©e '''Hills'''; previously '''Beale''')&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.walford.net/update/19940113.htm 13-JAN-94]&quot;, ''walford.net''. URL last accessed 2007-02-07&lt;/ref&gt; was played by [[Gillian Taylforth]] between 1985 and 2000.

One of the longest-running original characters,  Kathy remained in a prominent role, covering issues such as rape and domestic violence until April 1998, when Taylforth quit. A year later, in 1999, Taylforth returned for a temporary stint to aid the departure of actor [[Ross Kemp]] who played her brother-in-law [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]], and later in December 1999 for the wedding of her screen son [[Ian Beale]]. She made her final appearance in January 2000. Despite various rumours of a possible return for Kathy in the press, this did not occur and the character was killed off-screen in a road accident in late February 2006 in a storyline to facilitate the return of her son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben]] to his father [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]]. In tribute to the character, the soap's cafÃ© is named &quot;Kathy's&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/albert_sq/map_locations/albert_sq_cafe.shtml The Cafe]&quot;, ''BBC''.

'''Hassan Osman''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by Michael Evangelou.

Hassan was the first son of [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nejdet Salih]]) and [[Sue Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]]), who was only a baby during his short time in ''EastEnders''. Hassan died in his sleep of [[cot death]] on 20 June 1985; no official causes of death were given. Before ''EastEnders'' initially aired, creators [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]] had already decided that Sue and Ali Osman would be parents to a young baby named Hassan.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt;  However, as further characters were invented they realised that there would be a total of four babies in the show: [[Annie Smith (EastEnders)|Annie Smith]] (Zara Posener), [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[Jon Peyton Price]]), [[Vicki Fowler]] (Emma Herry) and Hassan. It was decided that it would be impossible for the studios to cope with four babies, and so they invented a storyline to eliminate one of the young babies from the cast. During this time, the topic of [[sudden infant death syndrome]] was prominent in the British press, partly due to an increase in casualties, but also because a doctor had gone public with the accusation that parents were to blame for the tragic occurrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt; Holland and Smith decided that covering this issue in the soap would be a good way of 'setting the record straight', and so it was decided that Sue and Ali's baby would die from cot death in the early months of the show. This was the first of many controversial storylines in ''EastEnders''' history. After the storyline aired in June 1985, the show was praised by audience and press alike for the sensitive and unsensational way this harrowing subject was treated. The sudden tragedy came as a surprise to the audience, especially since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways had made them appear rather comic in the early episodes of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Cot Death Foundation initially feared that a soap opera would trivialise the subject and frighten new parents. They tried to stop the episodes from airing, but in the end they were pleased with the way the subject was handled, and provided back-up support after transmission to many viewers who wanted more information on the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;/&gt;

==Sharon Watts==
{{Main|Sharon Rickman}}
'''Sharon Anne Rickman''' (nÃ©e '''Stretton'''; previously '''Watts''' and '''Mitchell'''), played by [[Letitia Dean]] was a regular cast member for the first 10 years after the programme began on 19 February 1985. She returned in May 2001, and appeared on and off, having most recently appeared in January 2006. Dean has expressed her interest in reprising the role of Sharon on numerous occasions. Sharon is the adoptive daughter of the popular '[[supercouple]]'; the late [[Den Watts|Den]] and [[Angie Watts]]. She was known to Den as his &quot;princess&quot; and he made sure suitors watched their step around the teenage Sharon. Even though she disapproved of her father's dodgy deals and his constant fighting with binge-drinker Angie, she loved them both nonetheless.

==Ian Beale==
{{Main|Ian Beale}}
'''Ian Albert Beale''' is played by [[Adam Woodyatt]]. He is the longest-serving character and the only remaining original character to have appeared continuously since the first episode on 19 February 1985. The character appeared in his 2,000th episode in the show on 26 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/eastenders-ian-beele-chalks-up-2000-episodes/ |title=Eastenders: Ian Beale Chalks Up 2000 Episodes!|publisher=Unreality TV|date=4 April 2007|first=Lisa|last=McGarry|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Beale is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Ian is a member of the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[The Beale/Fowler family|the Beales and Fowlers]], and Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Ian's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

==Michelle Fowler==
{{Main|Michelle Fowler}}
'''Michelle Fowler''' (previously '''Holloway''') was played by [[actress]] [[Susan Tully]]. Although she was one of the brighter people in [[Walford]], that didn't stop Michelle making some huge mistakes during her time in [[Albert Square]]. Michelle had a habit of choosing the wrong men and her stubborn nature meant that she rarely accepted anyone's help or listened to good advice. She was tough, feisty, determined and outspoken and never afraid to defend herself or her beliefs. Early on in the series, the character of Michelle became central to the programme and was the focus of a controversial storyline involving her teenage pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt; Press interest in the show escalated to &quot;record levels&quot; as journalists continuously tried to predict who had fathered Michelle's baby.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt; In [[whodunnit]] fashion, the audience had been kept in the dark as to the real identity of the father and were given teasers implicating several residents on The Square.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt; The audience finally discovered the culprit in episode 66 of the programme, October 1985. The episode was written by series co-creator/script editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, and was considered to be a landmark episode in the show's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square in the early half of the episode: [[Tony Carpenter]], [[Ali Osman]], [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Den Watts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;/&gt; As Michelle waited by their rendez-vous point a car pulled up and finally the fluffy white legs of [[Roly]] the poodle bounded out of the car, and gave it all away: Den Watts was the man meeting Michelle and it was he who had fathered her baby. The rest of the episode consisted of just one long scene, where Den and Michelle discussed whether or not to keep the baby.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;/&gt; Up to that time it was the longest scene ever done in a soap-opera, lasting fifteen minutes.

==Mark Fowler==
{{Main|Mark Fowler}}
'''Mark Albert Fowler''' was an original regular character in the series starting February 1985 but became a semi-regular after his original portrayer [[David Scarboro]] was written out of the role in April 1985. Scarboro made brief returns to the role in 1986 and 1987. Scarboro committed suicide in April 1988. The role was recast in 1990, with [[Todd Carty]] taking the role. From this point the character was a permanent fixture in the series and Carty remained in the role until the character was written out of the series in early 2003. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|title=Carty's exit from the square revealed|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a8790/cartys-exit-from-the-square-revealed.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; started out as a delinquent teenager, but returned to Walford a changed man when he was 22. Contracting HIV forced him to grow up fast and accept his responsibilities. He frequently found it difficult to accept the restrictions of the illness, which finally claimed his life in April 2004.

==Roly==
{{Main|Roly}}
'''Roly''' was an [[Apricot (color)|apricot]] coloured [[Standard Poodle]], who appeared in the first episode of the programme and remained in the show until 1993. Roly was cast less than a week before the filming of ''EastEnders'' began. From the beginning it was decided that the occupants of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Rickman|Sharon Watts]], were to have an [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]] named Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000218/ai_n14290686?tag=content;col1|title=Once upon a time in the East|publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' | accessdate=2008-06-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, finding an Alsatian that was light enough in colour not to merge into the background of the set proved to be difficult. Eventually, the co-creator/producer of the show, [[Julia Smith]], was contacted by a company named Janimals, who specialised in providing and training animals for television and films. They had found a seven month-old Poodle, called Roly, who might still be young enough to be trained. Training was said to take three weeks, and as the Poodle was a similar size to an Alsatian, Roly got the part. Roly was made the property of the BBC, given an ID card, and taken to live with Julia Smith at her home in London. Roly and [[Willy (EastEnders)|Willy]] the [[pug]] shared a dressing room at Elstree studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has appeared since the first episode on 19 February 1985, where she is seen working on the flower stall on Bridge Street Market.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalspytracy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a202283/loads-more-from-eastenders-tracey-the-barmaid.html|title=Loads more from 'EastEnders' Tracey The Barmaid|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=9 February 2010|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracey starts working as a barmaid at [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], in 1989. Her existence is largely to provide somebody to man the bar while one of the main characters resolves disputes, arguments or disagreements, or tends to the main plot of the episode. Despite featuring on the television programme frequently, and occasionally having a line to say, her surname and most of her details are unknown. She has also featured in a few minor storylines. As well as being a barmaid, Tracey owns a flower stall on Bridge Street market. Her stall is regularly robbed by new characters who steal flowers for people they are meeting. She employs workers whilst she does shifts in the pub, including [[Ina Foot]] ([[Ina Clare]]) and [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]). Tracey becomes good friends with [[Debbie Bates]] ([[Nicola Duffett]]), and is godmother to her daughter [[Clare Bates]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]). Tracey is often seen to be pleased at the prospect of additional overtime in The Queen Victoria when a Mitchell family wedding or other event is planned as she could always do with extra money.

On 14 April 2003 Tracey has a one-night stand with [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), the adoptive half-brother of former pub owner [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), when he arrives in Albert Square, despite the fact that she is married. The day after, he returns her knickers to her publicly over the bar. In 2005, [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) breaks into the pub with a crowbar and Tracey discovers her, asking her to leave. Sam knocks Tracey out with the crowbar and drags her, unconscious, into the bathroom, locking her in. She goes downstairs to unearth the body of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) who is buried in the basement, and when the police arrive, Tracey is comforted by [[Little Mo Mitchell]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]). After Sam is released from prison on bail she apologises to Tracey, but Tracey appears shaken by the ordeal and scared of Sam.

On 7 August 2008, Tracey opens up when [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]) questions why she is so quiet. She says she wants to keep herself to herself because she thinks that the Mitchells are all &quot;stark raving mad&quot; and that she does not fear any new barmaids as she had seen them come and go but she knows that she will always be behind the bar. She goes on to say that whoever lives in the pub is &quot;cursed&quot; in her opinion and that they will never be able to live happily together.

In March 2009, [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]) makes Tracey a cleaner at The Queen Victoria, and she is pleased for the extra money. She attends [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) hen party and Peggy and Archie's wedding on 2 April. On 16 April 2009, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) accuses [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) of drinking again. However, Phil covers this up by saying that he had broken a bottle of alcohol earlier, and Tracey backs him up. On 28 April 2009, Tracey answers the phone to [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]) questioning Phil's whereabouts from the night before. Tracey tells Phil about having to talk to the bank about some money issues. Following that, Phil pressures Tracey into talking about her feelings, supposedly for him, mentioning her husband in the process. Finally, she appears again towards the end of the episode wanting to help [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Charlie Jones (actor)|Charlie Jones]]) get to school as Phil is too drunk to assist him. Phil, flirting with Tracey, tells her that her husband will not mind.

On 30 April 2009, she finds [[Heather Trott]]'s ([[Cheryl Fergison]]) lost inhaler. On 30 July, she phones in with a back injury, and Peggy says it was unlike her to skive so it must be serious. [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) describes Tracey as the person who &quot;sees everything but says very little.&quot; On 8 September 2009, Peggy tells Sam (now [[Daniella Westbrook]]) that Tracey still holds a grudge against her. On 26 November Tracey covers for both Peggy and Phil when bailiffs asks for them, by pretending she is just a barmaid from an agency and does not know them. She then informs Ben he needs to tell Phil that the bailiffs are looking for him and want to repossess his car. On 24 December, Archie Mitchell and [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) take over the pub, ousting Peggy and her family. Tracey is unhappy with the way Archie and Janine treated Peggy and the rest of the Mitchell family, and the straw that broke the camel's back comes the next day when Janine tells Tracey to put some tinsel in her hair and asks her to keep an eye on the Christmas dinner. Tracey leaves a note saying &quot;Gone fishing&quot;, implying that she resigned. The next day, Tracey is present when [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) is arrested on suspicion of Archie's murder, and looks shocked. She also attends Jean's party on 11 January 2010. When [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]) opens a betting circle on the identity of Archie's killer, she lists Tracey as the rank outsider, giving her the nickname &quot;Silent Assassin&quot;.

On 18 January 2010, Tracey appears behind the bar in a non-speaking capacity for The Queen Victoria's reopening. On 22 January, the pub's new owner, [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), gives Tracey a warning for arriving two hours late, but Peggy explains that she asked her to come in late as she has done a lot of unpaid overtime recently. Later, Roxy sacks Tracey because she wants the pub to have younger bar staff. Peggy demands that Roxy beg Tracey to come back for the evening shift as workers like Tracey are 'gold dust'. Peggy tells Tracey on the phone that she is not sacked but Tracey hangs up. Tracey decides to take Roxy to an unfair dismissal tribunal, so Roxy says she will audition a new barmaid, giving Tracey a chance but making sure she loses. However, when Roxy realises she does not know how to run a pub, she gives Tracey her job back. Tracey suggests a curry night, and Roxy is happy to leave Tracey in charge of it, saying it is the most she has ever heard her speak. On that same day, viewers find out that Tracey and Shirley Carter are good friends. In March 2010, [[Billie Jackson]] ([[Devon Anderson]]) holds up The Queen Victoria, asking Tracey for cash and saying he has a gun. She fills his bag with cash but Phil takes it off her. In September 2010, following the fire at The Queen Victoria, Tracey starts working at [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) fish and chip shop. The next month, [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Ritchie]]) offers Tracey her old job back at The Queen Victoria, along with [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), after he reopens the pub.

On Friday 14 January 2011, during a conversation with Kat, it is revealed that Tracey has a son who lives with his father, as she and her husband have split up.

===Development===
Being one of the only two remaining original cast members in the show, Slaughter said that when she joined the show &quot;she recognised that EastEnders could run and be something very exciting&quot; and that she 'never dreamed [that it would last] 25 years' but she 'certainly knew it was special.'&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a202281/jane-slaughter-tracey-the-barmaid-eastenders.html|title=Jane Slaughter (Tracey The Barmaid, 'EastEnders')|first=Kris|last=Green|date=9 February 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=18 June 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to pick her favourite storyline she said,&quot;In terms of actually watching and seeing scenes, I've been lucky being in The Vic. I've seen so many good ones - with the Mitchells, with Phil, with Peggy - I've been very, very lucky to see so many, that it's nigh on impossible to single any out. They've all involved different people - I could go on and on and on!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;praises&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a202885/slaughter-praises-issue-led-enders-plots.html|title=Slaughter praises issue-led 'Enders plots|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=15 February 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=18 June 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She's always there whereas other cast members such as Adam [Woodyatt] - who's been there as long as I have - wouldn't necessarily have a storyline that puts him in The Vic at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalspytracy&quot;/&gt; She also added,&quot;For me as a character, it has to be Tracey speaking to [[Sean Slater]]. It was hysterical. For someone who never says anything, she suddenly had an opinion about everything, which I just loved. It was written by Christopher Reason and done so well. To get someone who only occasionally says things like 'out the back' and make what she says make sense - he did a fantastic job. That was very memorable because everyone was so supportive.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;/&gt; 

A 2010 video on the official website of ''EastEnders'' spin-off ''[[EastEnders: E20]]'' features the character [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) giving his &quot;Survival Tips in Walford!&quot;, one of which is to not talk to Tracey, as &quot;she goes on, and on, and on, and on.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In 2010, Slaughter said that it would not make sense to make Tracey into &quot;this talkative, all-singing, all-dancing person with a fully-fledged family and surname.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalspytracy&quot;/&gt; Slaughter described her character as 'lovely', 'clever', 'loyal but strong' and 'opinionated'.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalspytracy&quot;/&gt; Jane Simon's from ''[[Daily Mirror|the Mirror]] described her as 'silent'.&lt;ref name=&quot;worth&quot;/&gt;

In May 2009, ''[[Digital Spy]]'' asked producer [[Diederick Santer]] what's in store for Tracey, he said,&quot;You just have to watch out for any script that Christopher Reason writes. Chris is obsessed with Tracey and with Jane Slaughter, who plays her. He gives her loads to do, which is fantastic. When we give her more to do, she absolutely delivers. We think she's fab.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Santer interview May 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a154157/enders-boss-hints-at-character-plots.html|title=Exclusive: 'Enders boss hints at character plots|last=Green|first=Kris|date=1 May 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=18 June 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was announced that [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] was taking over from Santer, Slaughter was asked what she hoped Kirkwood would do to Tracey saying,&quot;I would just be happy if he knows the character and likes the character and thinks he could use her. I think there is potential to use her but like I said, not in a ridiculously nonsensical way, but I think it's also down to the public. It sounds like I'm deferring my opinion but I'm not, I think the public actually would like to know. &quot;

Tracey was one of the 'outsiders' in the [[Who Killed Archie]] storyline with many viewers thinking it could be her. In a poll with ''[[Digital Spy]]'' 7.9% thought Tracey killed [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]])&lt;ref name=&quot;poll result&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a196518/poll-result-who-killed-archie-prime-suspect.html|title=Poll Result: Who Killed Archie?

Is it The Vic she protects or the family?&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;/&gt; It was later revealed that bookmakers, [[William Hill]] had slashed the odds on Tracey being the killer, with 7/1 thinking she killed Archie.&lt;ref name=&quot;slashed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a203738/odds-slashed-on-tracey-as-enders-killer.html|title=Odds slashed on Tracey as 'Enders killer|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 January 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=18 June 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killer was later revealed to be [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]).

===Reception===
Dek Hogan from ''[[Digital Spy]]'' hailed Tracey when she said a line and said it was 'such a rare event that itâs always worthy of a celebration. Fair play, she did mumble it a bit and it was so unmemorable that Iâve forgotten what it was she actually said but it was a line none the less.' He also said that she, [[Winston (EastEnders)|Winston]] ([[Ulric Browne]]) and other background characters should have a daytime soap, saying it would be a ratings winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;underused&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/dekstvdiary/a41678/monkey-magic.html|title=Monkey Magic|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Dek|last=Hogan|date=14 January 2007|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kris Green also from ''[[Digital Spy]]'' said he wants to ask scriptwriters to give more lines to Tracey,&lt;ref name=&quot;kg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a150793/10-teasers-about-the-eastenders-wedding.html|title=10 Teasers About...

Speaking of the reaction viewers have to the character of Tracey, she said, My son was telling me the other day there's a [Facebook group] that says 'Let Tracey Speak' with 47,000 members. It just blows my head. I said, 'Oh, Ollie - I think you mean 4,700' and he went, 'No mum, forty seven thousand!' It makes me go a bit 'Woah!'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalspytracy&quot;/&gt; It has become a point of amusement amongst ''EastEnders'' fans that so little is known about the character and speculation is ongoing as to whether she will take a lead role in any future storylines. Weekly magazine ''Inside Soap'' ran a regular feature commenting on Tracey's brief appearances, dubbed 'Tracey Watch'. They refer to her as &quot;our fave barmaid&quot;, making observations such as: &quot;The drinks are on Trace this week - she had an actual line! Ker-ching! Screen time: A brief, but intensely powerful, two seconds.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Jane Simon from ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' said that whenever Tracey speaks, 'it's worth listening to'.&lt;ref name=&quot;worth&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/We+love+telly%3a+WE+LOVE+SOAPS.-a0182372940|title=We love telly: WE LOVE SOAPS|last=Simon|first=Jane|date=7 August 2008|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|publisher=The Free Library|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lofty Holloway==
{{Main|Lofty Holloway}}
'''George &quot;Lofty&quot; Holloway''' was played by [[Tom Watt (actor)|Tom Watt]]. Lofty is one of the serial's original characters, making his first appearance in the third episode, 26 February 1985. Lofty is generally depicted as a meek, luckless and hapless victim. A long running storyline concerns his relationship with the character [[Michelle Fowler]]. Their unhappy marriage finally disintegrates after Michelle has an abortion, and Lofty leaves Walford for a new start. The character's final appearance is in the episode first aired on 19 April 1988. Lofty was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Both felt that to help complete the community there was a need for a character in his early twenties. He had to be someone a bit different. Not brash and confident like a lot of the older men, and not boisterous like the younger ones. A loner, maybe someone forced to be a loner. A person who &quot;stuck out like a sore thumb&quot;. Someone that was happiest in a group but still couldn't find one that he fit in with. Tony Holland had previously been in the army and found that ex-soldiers had these problems when they tried to reintegrate as civilians. So they decided that Lofty would be an ex-soldier, forced to quit because of his asthma. He was happiest in the army and felt incomplete without the group setting, the all-male camaraderie and even the security of the uniformity that the army provides.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=978-0-563-20601-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Detective Sergeant Terry Rich''', played by [[Gary Whelan]], first appeared on 26 February 1985. He was investigating the death of [[Reg Cox]], who had died the previous week and his death was now believed to be a [[murder]]. DS Rich of the [[Walford]] CID arrived in [[Albert Square]] to conduct an inquiry.

The following week, a [[badge]] that [[Lofty Holloway]] ([[Tom Watt]]) was wearing on his jumper caught the eye of [[Harold Legg|Dr Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]), who recognised it as one that he'd seen in Reg's collection of Nazi badges from the war. A few hours later, Rich arrived at [[The Queen Victoria]] where Lofty was tending bar and questioned him about how he got the badge. Lofty reluctantly admitted that he'd bought it from [[Mark Fowler]] ([[David Scarboro]]) for five pounds. When questioned by Detective Sergeant Rich, Mark insisted that he'd found the badge on the street. However, on 28 March, Rich learned that Mark had obtained the badge from [[Nick Cotton]] and 'turned over' Nick's place to find the remains of Reg's collection along with other incriminating evidence. Nick Cotton then fled Walford, but was arrested the following month for the murder of Reg Cox, although he was never charged.

Terry returned in 1987 to investigate the case of the 'Walford attacker', who was guilty of assaulting several different female inhabitants of Albert Square. In April of that year, the attacker picked the wrong victim, [[Debbie Wilkins]] [[Shirley Cheriton]]), who managed to ward him off using self-defence, which led to his arrest. Terry was impressed with the way Debbie conducted herself so he asked her if she would help him out on some police business. Terry asked Debbie to go to a French [estaurant with him on an undercover operation to expose French restaurants using English waiters and he needed her to be his cover. Debbie agreed, but whilst on their mock date they bonded and when they returned to The Vic they made a dinner date for the next night to a Chinese restaurant and they were soon inseparable. Debbie's flat-mate [[Naima Jeffery]] ([[Shreela Ghosh]]) seemed to dislike Terry immensely, but this didn't perturb Debbie and when Terry asked her to marry him, she gleefully accepted. The following month Terry was transferred to another division, so Debbie decided to leave Walford with him. He left with her on 14 May 1987.&lt;br clear=all&gt;

==Tony Carpenter==
{{Main|Tony Carpenter}}
'''Tony Carpenter''' was played by [[Oscar James]]. Happy go lucky Tony tried to carve himself a successful business and steady home for his family, but nothing he did was ever good enough for his nagging wife. Tony was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Tony was originally intended to be named Alan, and his son [[Kelvin Carpenter]] was originally named Kevin. They were the first [[Black (people)|black]] characters to appear in the soap. Black and Asian characters were two ethnic minorities that had previously been under-represented in British soap before ''EastEnders'' aired. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location.  For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had been at the forefront of the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their contacts to relay information about their origins and lifestyles and were then able to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mary Smith==
{{Main|Mary Smith (EastEnders)}}
'''Theresa &quot;Mary&quot; Smith''' was played by [[Linda Davidson]]. Punk Mary was [[Walford]]'s original wild child. She often made life difficult for herself due to her stubborn, defensive nature and she tended to feel that everyone around her was out to get her. In fact, Mary was her own worst enemy and most of her misfortune was down to her irresponsible behaviour and her inability to heed good advice. Mary Smith was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Mary's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''. As Holland and Smith wanted a diverse cross-section from the East End community, it was decided that one of the main cast had to be a young, single mother, and as [[punk rock|punk music]] was prominent in British culture at the time, they decided to use a [[punk fashion|punk image]] for the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;/&gt; Holland and Smith decided to cast an unknown actress in the role. They chose [[Linda Davidson]], who was the right age and had been brought up in northern [[England]] and therefore had an accent that would befit the character's background.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annie Smith''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by Zara Posener from 1985 to 1986, and by Samantha Crown from 1986 to 1988.

Annie was the young daughter of [[Punk subculture|punk]] [[Mary Smith (EastEnders)|Mary Smith]]. Her father was a member of a punk group of which Mary was a groupie, and had no contact with her. Annie arrived, along with Mary, on 5 March 1985 and initially resided with her mother at 23b [[Albert Square]]. Mary was an incredibly irresponsible mother and Annie was always getting lumbered on her neighbours when Mary grew tired of looking after her. [[Dot Branning|Dot Cotton]] and [[Sue Osman]] were the usual victims, but almost everyone on [[Albert Square|the Square]] had a turn at looking after Annie at one stage. Sue Osman, in particular, grew extremely fond of Annie following the death of her son [[Hassan Osman|Hassan]]. After bottling up her grief for months, she was forced to hold little Annie, which allowed her, finally, to acknowledge her pent-up sadness. Annie was once left alone in the [[launderette]] accidentally, while Mary went drinking in [[The Queen Victoria|The Queen Vic]]. [[Debbie Wilkins]] discovered her, returned her to her mother and had a few choice words for Mary. Mary also had a tendency to leave Annie home alone whilst she went out to [[prostitute]] herself at night. On one such occasion, Annie threw her blanket at the electric fan heater, causing a fire. Luckily, [[Arthur Fowler]] managed to break in and rescue her, but as a result, Annie was taken away from Mary and was put in the custody of her grandparents, [[Chris Smith (EastEnders)|Chris]] and [[Edie Smith]], who lived in [[Stockport]]. With the help of [[Rod Norman]] and [[Carmel Jackson]], Mary was eventually reunited with Annie, although it took a lot of persuading to get her back from Edie, who felt that Mary was not capable of caring for a young child. Annie spent Christmas Day 1987 in hospital after her intoxicated grandfather, Chris, abducted her, tried to drive her home to Stockport and then crashed into a wall. Luckily, Annie was unharmed. Eventually, Mary decided to leave Albert Square with Annie. They both departed in May 1988 and have not been seen since.

==Kelvin Carpenter==
{{Main|Kelvin Carpenter}}
'''Kelvin Carpenter''' was played by [[Paul J. Medford]]. Kelvin was a bright spark and full of initiative. He opened several businesses in [[Albert Square]] and even formed a [[band (music)|band]]. He was a bit of a heartbreaker in ''EastEnders'' early years, but he ended up having his heart broken in return, when his middle-aged girlfriend jilted him. Always a bit too intelligent for [[Walford]], Kelvin eventually left for [[university]] and has since married a model wife and has become a song writer.Kelvin Carpenter was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Kelvin was originally intended to be named Kevin, and his father [[Tony Carpenter]] was originally named Alan. They were the first [[Black (people)|black]] characters to appear in the soap.

==Andy O'Brien==
{{Main|Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)}}
'''Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; O'Brien''' was played by the late [[Ross Davidson]]. One of the original characters created for the series, Andy made his appearance one month after the show first broadcast in March 1985. Portrayed as altruistic and middle-classed, Andy and his partner Debbie were an attempt to represent gentrification of the East End. Despite Davidson claiming that there had been plans for his character, Andy became the first regular character in ''EastEnders'' to be killed-off. Davidson claims this was due to an altercation between himself and Executive Producer and show creator, [[Julia Smith]]. His death scene aired in August 1986.

==Debbie Wilkins==
{{Main|Debbie Wilkins}}
'''Deborah &quot;Debbie&quot; Wilkins''' was played by [[Shirley Cheriton]]. Of working class background, Debbie was [[Walford]]'s first upwardly mobile character. She had an on/off relationship with her ill-fated boyfriend Andy and she tended to be a bit too pretentious for the [[working class]] locals of [[Albert Square]]. Debbie Wilkins was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. The character of Debbie along with her boyfriend [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] were an attempt by Holland and Smith to represent the influx of upwardly mobile people that were opting to move to the usually working-class areas of the [[East End of London]]. [[Gentrification]] of the East End was on the increase in the 1980s, and in Holland's experience, the new, wealthier residents were never welcomed or truly accepted within the community, and this was what he hoped to convey on-screen with these two characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;insidestory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|coauthors=[[Tony Holland|Holland, Tony]]|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris Smith''', played by [[Allan O'Keefe]], was a haulage driver from [[Stockport]]. He was first seen in [[Walford]] in May 1985 when he came to visit his wayward daughter, [[Mary Smith (EastEnders)|Mary Smith]]. Mary (or Theresa as she was known to Chris) had left Stockport to escape her family, so she wasn't pleased when Chris arrived and tried to persuade her to return with him so he could help bring up her young daughter. After several ill-fated attempts, Mary sent him packing.

In 1987, Mary began prostituting herself. She would leave her young baby, [[Annie Smith (EastEnders)|Annie]], at home alone while she worked. On one occasion, Annie threw a blanket out of her cot straight on to an electric fan heater, causing a fire. Annie was rescued before she was harmed, but Mary's neighbour, [[Dot Cotton]], phoned Chris, who returned to Walford and took Annie to live with him and his wife, [[Edie Smith|Edie]], in Stockport.

Mary's boyfriend, [[Rod Norman]], tried to straighten Mary out so she could get her daughter back. Even though Mary seemed to have sorted herself out, Edie had grown so attached to Annie that she was unwilling to relinquish care. By December that year, Chris finally decided that Annie should be reunited with Mary. This was unpopular with Edie, and she told Chris that he could only come home when he brought Annie back. On Christmas Eve 1987, after desperately trying to convince Mary to return to Stockport, a very [[drunk]] Chris abducted Annie and tried to drive her home, only to crash into a wall at the local [[bed and breakfast]] on Bridge Street.

Mary was forced to spend Christmas Day in hospital so they could monitor Annie. Chris desperately tried to make amends with Mary for his mistake, but Mary was initially unable to forgive him until Annie was given the all clear later that day, so a jubilant Mary accepted her father's apology.

In early 1988, Chris made plans to open up a haulage company at a disused tyre shop in [[Albert Square]], but found out that his driving licence was to be suspended for 18 months following his drink driving accident. Nevertheless, he contacted his friend [[Harry Jameson]] to go into partnership and even managed to persuade [[Ali Osman]] to front up some capital. Just when it seemed things were going his way, Ali pulled out of the deal, and Chris turned to alcohol, regularly drinking himself into a stupor to drown his sorrows. A concerned Mary then decided to contact her mother, who returned to Walford to straighten her husband out.

By May 1988, Chris finally succeeded in getting the haulage company open by borrowing money from Walford Investments â the money lending organisation of [[The Firm (EastEnders)|The Firm]] â but the antics of his daughter, who started to use [[drugs]] again and neglect Annie, were causing him more grief. In a bid to help Mary out, he offered her a job at the haulage company, but Mary had grown annoyed with her parents' interference, and after sabotaging her father's office with red paint, she took Annie and left Walford.

Chris remained in Walford to run his business. Rod Norman worked for the company as a [[bookkeeper]] and [[Charlie Cotton]] took a job as lorry driver, although he was extremely unreliable. However, Chris was still short of drivers, so he made the foolish decision to do the haulage deliveries himself, despite having a suspended licence. [[Darren Roberts (EastEnders)|Darren Roberts]] (who had had several run-ins with Chris regarding the [[theft]] of his [[Backhoe|JCB]] earlier that year) informed the police that he was driving illegally and Chris was fined [[pound sterling|Â£]]1000. This severely crippled his business and he was unable to repay his loan. [[Gregory Mantel]], a member of The Firm, then arrived on the Square in search of Chris. Mantel forced Chris to sign over his business to The Firm, after which Chris had no choice but to return to Stockport. His last appearance was in August 1988. The premises of the haulage company were eventually bought by [[Frank Butcher]], who converted it into the car lot.

==Mehmet Osman==
{{Main|Mehmet Osman}}
'''Mehmet Osman''' was played by [[Haluk Bilginer]]. Mehmet was portrayed as a charmer, rogue and a serial womaniser, played as a recurring character until 1989. Mehmet Osman was conceptualised by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Mehmet, the brother of original character [[Ali Osman]], was part of a well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of [[Turkish Cypriot]]s who had immigrated to England and settled in the [[East End of London]]. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location.

Hannah's first appearance in [[Walford]] was in June 1985 and throughout the year she would show up occasionally to converse with Tony about issues concerning their children. Hannah constantly looked down on Tony's lifestyle and career, so their meetings were never pleasant.

When Hannah met the smooth talking corporate lawyer, [[Neville Agard]], she invited him to move into her house. Eventually, Neville bought the house and they announced their intention to wed. However, when she discovered that Neville had a violent temper and had beaten her daughter with a riding [[whip]], she confronted him and after a row resulted in violence she left him and turned up on Tony's doorstep at number 3 [[Albert Square]] in April 1986. Tony was furious and went to confront Neville, returning later covered in blood. Hannah was adamant that she would not return to Neville, so she and Cassie came to live with Tony and they decided to try and give their marriage another go.

Their reconciliation was not a happy one and it wasn't long before Hannah had returned to her nagging ways. She was unhappy to be living in a house that was in the throes of renovation and she constantly harangued Tony to do better and try harder. She also managed to upset her children by trying to put a stop to her son's relationship with [[Carmel Roberts]] and forcing Cassie to go to [[boarding school]].

In 1987 Hannah began to become disillusioned with Walford after getting accosted by both [[Rezaul Gabir]] and [[Mehmet Osman]]. She was also stalked one night by a man known as the Walford attacker, who was guilty of assaulting several female inhabitants of the Square. Hannah was shaken but unharmed. She later relayed to Tony that she feared that Mehmet was the culprit, because he had made a pass at her previously. Tony was furious, and he along with [[Den Watts]] and [[Pete Beale]] went to track Mehmet down and teach him a lesson. After Hannah discovered that her husband was guilty of attacking Mehmet, she took the moral high-ground and denounced his barbaric actions (Despite previously being happy for Tony to resort to violence against Neville). Hannah then decided that their marriage was over and so she left Walford in February that year to go and live with her sister in another part of [[London]]. She was not seen again.

'''Sheena Menell''' first appeared on 15 October 1985 when her taxicab broke down in Bridge Street and she wandered into the cafÃ© and asked [[Sue Osman]] where she might find another one. Sue told her that her husband, [[Ali Osman|Ali]], might be able to take her where she needed to go and so [[Mary Smith (EastEnders)|Mary Smith]], who was in the cafÃ© at the time, offered to show her the way to Number 23 [[Albert Square]] in search of Ali.

When Ali couldn't be found, Mary invited Sheena to wait in her flat above and they quickly became friends. Sheena had once been in a similar situation to Mary when she found herself pregnant and alone, although she opted to abort the baby, which she had always regretted. Mary was impressed that Sheena earned Â£150 per week as a [[stripper]]. Weary of trying to live on the [[Department of Social Security|DSS]] payments she received, Mary eagerly accepted Sheena's offer to help her find work as a stripper. Sheena also gave Mary dancing lessons.

Whilst out working, Mary left her daughter, [[Annie Smith (EastEnders)|Annie]], in Sheena's care, but she was caught by Sue 'entertaining' a man in Mary's room with Annie in close proximity. Sheena then left Annie alone while she went for a drink in [[The Queen Vic]] with her guest. When Mary found out about Sheena's behaviour she called her a &quot;sluttish bitch&quot; and told her that Annie could end up in care because of her irresponsible actions. This was the last time Sheena was seen.

'''Guizin Osman''', played by [[Ishia Bennison]], was the long suffering wife of the philandering [[Turkish Cypriot]], [[Mehmet Osman]]. She first arrived in [[Albert Square]] in October 1985 when she came to inform her sister-in-law, [[Sue Osman|Sue]], that her husband, [[Ali Osman|Ali]], had [[gambling|gambled]] away the [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] money for the home they were planning to buy.

Guizin and her three children, [[Emine Osman|Emine]], Rayif and Murat, later moved in with her brother-in-law and his family  in 1987, after her husband gambled away their home and deserted them. She worked for Ali and Sue in the cafÃ© for a few months until her husband returned and she became a partner in the business. As part owner of the cafÃ©, she hired [[Ian Beale]], who later became the sole owner.

Guizin and Mehmet's marriage was highly turbulent and they were always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. Guizin was well aware of Mehmet's flaws and [[adultery]], but unlike Sue, she was willing to turn a blind eye to most of her husband's dealings in order to keep the marriage together, and because, in her community, that's what a wife was expected to do.

Guizin may have put up with a lot from Mehmet, but she was certainly no pushover, and she was more than willing to defend herself and her family if anyone should cross her. She had numerous rows with Sue over the years and she nearly came to blows with the devious [[Donna Ludlow]] after she informed her that Mehmet had been trying to seduce her on [[New Years Eve]] 1987. Yet more animosity arose when she discovered that Mehmet had been sleeping with [[prostitute]] [[Mary Smith (EastEnders)|Mary Smith]], but although Guizin got extremely angry, she always ended up forgiving Mehmet for the sake of the family.

However, there was one affair that Guizin was not willing to forgive Mehmet for, and it happened to be the only one that he didn't actually commit. After Sue discovered that her husband had slept with Donna Ludlow, she kissed Mehmet in front of Ali for revenge, which caused a huge fight between the brothers. Ali told Guizin about Sue and Mehmet's suspected affair, after which Guizin became furious. She viciously attacked Mehmet in the middle of the Square and then immediately left for [[Northern Cyprus]], taking her three children with her. Her last appearance was in March 1989. Mehmet left [[England]] soon after to attempt to patch up their relationship.

Bennison has &quot;mixed memories&quot; about her role in ''EastEnders'', commenting in 2003: &quot;it was the start of the soap and the fame was very instant for everybody. You're in everybody's front room and everyone feels they own a bit of you. I'll never forget having to sign people's sickbags on the hovercraft to France. My daughter wouldn't walk down the street with me at the time. She would stay 10 paces behind. I still get recognised from ''EastEnders''. I can't believe it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Queen&quot; &gt;{{cite web | url = http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/0300entertainment/0600theatre/tm_method=full%26objectid=13638091%26siteid=50081-name_page.html| title= Role has Ishia as Queen | publisher = [[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] ic Newcastle| author = David Whetstone| date = 2003-11-19 | accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cassie Carpenter''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Delanie Forbes]] from 1985-1986. In an early episode, before Cassie appeared, Kelvin referred to his sister as being seven years old, but when the character was actually seen later in the year, it was decided to increase her age to eleven, so a young actress who would be capable of handling the part could be cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;/&gt;

Cassie was the daughter of [[Hannah Carpenter|Hannah]] and [[Tony Carpenter]] and the little sister of [[Kelvin Carpenter]]. Cassie's parents were separated and she initially resided with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, a corporate [[lawyer]] named [[Neville Agard]]. Cassie first appeared in November 1985 when she came to visit her father in [[Albert Square]]. Cassie loved her father and found her parents' separation difficult, particularly as she didn't get on with her mother's boyfriend.

In April 1986 Hannah and Cassie arrived on Tony's doorstep with the disturbing news that Neville had been beating Cassie with a riding [[whip]]. Both Hannah and Cassie then came to live in [[Walford]] with Tony and Kelvin, and Cassie was delighted when her parents decided to give their marriage another go.

Cassie was a mischievous youngster who, like her brother, was bright. In May 1986 she got into trouble with her school for bullying another girl, and was in even more trouble from her parents for trying to hide it from them. Tony later caught her smoking [[cannabis]] with [[Mark Fowler]]. He was furious and the Carpenters refused to speak to any of the Fowlers because of it. After a subsequent meeting with Cassie's [[headmaster]], Hannah decided that the only solution was to send Cassie away to [[boarding school]]. Cassie was against the idea but nevertheless, she was sent away in September that year. A few weeks later the Carpenters heard news that Cassie had run away from school and was nowhere to be found. She was discovered the following day, stealing food from [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] and [[Lofty Holloway]]'s kitchen in Albert Square, and returned to the school.

Cassie appeared infrequently after this, although she did play a Herald [[Angel]] in the Walford [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] play in December of that year. This was her last appearance, but after her parents attempt at a reconciliation failed, Hannah left Walford and Cassie allegedly went to live with her. Tony went to visit her occasionally, before leaving Walford too in 1987.

'''Winston''' is a recurring character who has been portrayed by [[Ulric Browne]] since 1985, with his first known on-screen appearance being in December of that year. However, he was not credited for his role until later on in the series. Winston owns the music stall in [[Walford]]'s Bridge Street Market and over the years proves to be a great friend to his fellow long-standing stall-holder, [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]). His highlights include shaving his tuft of hair off for charity and helping [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) arrive at her birthday party on the night she died. He is angry when [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) car crashes into his stall in October 2006.

Winston is always willing to help when other market traders are called away, for example, to appear in a key development of the current plot, i.e. [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) needs someone to guard the clothing stall while she and [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) slip into an unguarded bedroom to continue the next episode in their illicit affair.

Winston generally appears at events held by other Walford residents, such as weddings, funerals and parties or briefly in the background of a scene. He has attended the funerals of [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]), stag parties for [[Garry Hobbs]] ([[Ricky Groves]]), [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) and [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), [[Jean Slater]]'s ([[Gillian Wright]]) birthday party and Ricky and [[Bianca Jackson]]'s ([[Patsy Palmer]]) wedding. Sometimes characters steal DVDs or CDs from his stall, including [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]). In April 2008, Winston's niece [[List of EastEnders characters (2008)#Keisha|Keisha]] (Suzie McGrath) arrives in Walford, and leaves a month later with [[Gus Smith]] ([[Mohammed George]]). Winston wins a [[Children in Need]] raffle in [[The Queen Victoria]] in November 2008, and in July 2009, Stacey Slater offers him a flower but he refuses. He also appears with [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) getting drunk in Ian's chip shop in June 2009, drunk with another extra in August 2009, with [[#Tracey|Tracey]] ([[Jane Slaughter (actress)|Jane Slaughter]]) in August 2009 talking about Max and [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]), and in November 2009 Ian invites him for drinks at The Queen Victoria but he refuses. On 15 June 2010 Winston had a rare speaking role as he was seen engaging in a minor conversation with Max. On 2 November 2010 he had another minor speaking role asking for 3 drinks at the newly reopened Queen Vic. In April 2011, during the screening of the [[Wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine Middleton|wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton]] in The Queen Victoria, Winston accidentally rips the cord from the television electrical plug, much to the dismay of the patrons.
