== Stargate Command personnel ==
The [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) is a fictional military base at the (real) [[Cheyenne Mountain complex]] near [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. It is the main setting in ''Stargate SG-1'' and occasionally features on ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. The base extends many levels beneath the ground and is protected from most forms of attack including indirect nuclear detonations, also serving to contain biological, chemical or alien hazards to the outside world by means of a 'lockdown' status. Stargate Command is typically commanded by a General and is staffed by subject matter experts and military support personnel, several elite special operations teams, and several SG teams, including [[SG-1]]. The majority of the teams are [[United States Air Force]] with some [[United States Marine Corps]], civilians and [[United States Army]], but other nations have SG teams operating from the SGC as well after the events of season 5.

=== Kevin Elliot ===

According to portraying actor Courtenay J. Stevens, the first draft for the character was that he was supposed to be a young [[Jack O'Neill]] in the then new-[[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] show ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.  The producers dropped Elliot and minimized his role so that he was never even mentioned in ''Stargate Atlantis''. Many fans of ''Stargate'' thought that Elliot and his team would replace [[Samantha Carter]], [[Teal'c]], [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] and O'Neill as the [[main characters]] of the show. Stevens has stated that the producers took much time to look at new &quot;Options&quot;, for the series and further stated that he knew &quot;They were looking at it.&quot; But the plans were changed and actor Stevens left the ''Stargate'' set in [[Vancouver]] after the shooting of &quot;[[Last Stand (Stargate SG-1)|Last Stand]]&quot;. 

When shooting the episode, &quot;[[Summit (Stargate SG-1)|Summit]]&quot; [[J.R. Bourne]] was booked, so he was replaced with Stevens. Before being cast in the episode &quot;Summit&quot;, the producers told the history behind the [[Tok'ra]] symbiote [[Lantash]]. Stevens was later cast as Keras in the ''Stargate Atlantis'' episode &quot;[[Childhood's End (Stargate Atlantis)|Childhood's End]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;courtenayjstevensinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/chillin_with_elliot.shtml |title=Chillin' With Elliott |publisher=''[[GateWorld]]'' |date=August 2004 |accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(played by [[Teryl Rothery]], seasons 1&amp;ndash;7, 9) &amp;ndash; She is responsible for maintaining the health of the SG teams, as well as the SGC's support staff and base personnel. On many occasions, she also cares for the health of alien refugees to Earth, including Goa'uld symbiotes. In her first appearance in &quot;[[The Broca Divide (Stargate SG-1)|The Broca Divide]]&quot;, Dr. Fraiser holds the rank of Captain, and is promoted to Major in Season 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebrocadivide&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Broca Divide (Stargate SG-1) | title=The Broca Divide | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Jonathan Glassner]] | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 1 | number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hathor&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Hathor (Stargate SG-1) | title=Hathor | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Jonathan Glassner]] | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 1 | number = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In season 1's &quot;[[Singularity (Stargate SG-1)|Singularity]]&quot;, Fraiser adopts [[Cassandra (Stargate)|Cassandra]], an alien orphan whose people had been exterminated by the Goa'uld [[System Lord]] [[Nirrti (Stargate)|Nirrti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;singularity&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Singularity (Stargate SG-1) | title=Singularity | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Robert C.

Fraiser joined the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) after breaking up with her husband; there she got some training with [[firearm]]s. Her husband didn't want Fraiser to join the [[US military]] which is one of the main reasons for their [[break up]]. As a [[Physician|doctor]], Fraiser looks for peaceful solutions and is disinclined towards [[armed force|armed solutions]]. In the episode &quot;[[Serpent's Song (Stargate SG-1)|Serpent's Song]]&quot;, Fraiser is the only one in [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) who is resistant to the idea to give [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] over to his enemies. She is eventually forced to give up Apophis.&lt;ref name=&quot;characterization&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=David Read |url=http://www.gateworld.net/opinion/columns/chevronnine/a_tribute_to_janet_fraiser.shtml |title=A Tribute to Janet Fraiser |publisher=''GateWorld'' | language=| accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fraiser&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/characters/links/fraiserjanet.shtml |title=Fraiser, Janet |publisher=''GateWorld'' | language=| accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teryl Rothery]] was asked by then producer and writer (for ''Stargate'') [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] if she wanted to play the role as Fraiser.&lt;ref name=&quot;eclipse&quot;/&gt; In an interview, Rothery was asked what it was like to play a [[Physician|doctor]] in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.  Rothery replied, &quot;just being true to the character. And as far as the medical stuff, knowing what to do and what to say.&quot;  She got a lot of help from the medical advisor on the set.

In the first two seasons, Rothery didn't have a contract and was booked on every episode in which she appeared. In [[Stargate SG-1 (season 3)|season three]] of ''SG-1'', she finally got a contract deal with the producers. She also commented on her acting life once:&lt;ref name=&quot;fraisert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Tobias Mauer |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2004/12/interviewwithterylrothery.shtml |title= Interview with Teryl Rothery |publisher=''GateWorld'' | language=| accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|&quot;The life of an actor is always very up and down. So sometimes you work a lot, but sometimes ... So if you're on a series like ''Stargate SG-1'' you have that work for seven years. So that's a gift.&quot;|}}

After her character's death in [[Stargate SG-1 (season 7)|season 7]], there were various rumours which said she would appear in the upcoming ''[[Stargate]]'' film; this never happened. Rothery said it was unlikely since she hadn't had any contact with the ''Stargate'' producers since her character's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;fraisert&quot;/&gt; Rothery has stated many times that she &quot;admires&quot; the character because of her &quot;strength&quot; and &quot;intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;/&gt; [[Robert C. Cooper]], producer for ''Stargate SG-1'', called Rothery about the death of her character.

=== Walter Harriman ===
{{anchors|Walter Harriman|Norman Davis|Chevron Guy}} [[Image:Gary Jones stargate cropped.jpg|thumb|Gary Jones played Walter Harriman, an SGC technician who was also known as &quot;Norman Davies&quot; and &quot;Chevron Guy&quot;]] 
[[Chief Master Sergeant]] '''Walter Harriman''' (also known as the '''Chevron Guy''' among others, portrayed by [[Gary Jones (actor)|Gary Jones]], seasons 1&amp;ndash;10) is a [[fictional character]] in the Canadian-American television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', who joined the [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) after excelling in navigation and automatic flight control operations during the first [[Operation Desert Storm|Gulf War]]. General Hammond recruited him as someone with excellent technical ability and a cool head to operate the Stargate under extreme pressure. He specializes in installing, maintaining and repairing bomb navigation, weapons control as well as automatic flight control systems. He is also an expert in radio and navigational equipment, and in maintaining test and precision measurement equipment. He is primarily a Stargate technician, running the dialing computer and other equipment from the Control Room.&lt;ref name=&quot;childrenofthegods&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Children of the Gods| title=Children of the Gods | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 1 | number = 1 and 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also acts as an occasional administrative assistant to the head of [[Stargate Command]], and has manned the flight console on the bridge of the [[Prometheus (Stargate)|Prometheus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;walter&quot;/&gt; From [[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)|season 8]] to [[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|10]] Harriman's role is expanded to advisor to the Head of Command of the SGC

His name has been a source of confusion for many fans of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. Originally, he was simply &quot;[[Technician]]&quot; or &quot;[[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]],&quot; listed as such in the show credits.&lt;ref name=&quot;chevron&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilles Nuytens |url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/gary_jones_01.htm |title=Interview with Gary Jones |publisher=''The SciFi World'' | language=| accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, some of the writers gave him the name &quot;Norman Davis&quot;, which came with a name tag, but was never used in dialogue. In the episode &quot;2010&quot;, [[Jack O'Neill]] refers to him as &quot;Walter.&quot; Later, in the eighth season of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the character is addressed as &quot;Sergeant Harriman,&quot; resulting in the final name of &quot;Walter Harriman.&quot; Many fans fondly refer to him as &quot;the Chevron guy&quot; as many of his on-screen appearances, especially earlier on in the show, had him saying &quot;Chevron (insert number here) encoded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;walter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilles Nuytens |url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/gary_jones_02.htm |title=Gary Jones interview |publisher=''The SciFi World'' | language=| accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several DVD commentaries after the introduction of the name &quot;Walter,&quot; producer-director [[Peter DeLuise]] refers to the character as &quot;Walter Norman&quot; and &quot;Walter Norman Davis.&quot; The first time he ever says his own name is in the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode &quot;[[Home (Stargate Atlantis)|Home]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;footholdeeee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=D.

As the series continued Harriman got a heavier role in the series. According to Jones, his role was expanded since [[Richard Dean Anderson]] wanted him as his personal assistant in the show when his character [[Jack O'Neill]] was the leader of the SGC. The ''[[Stargate]]'' producer and writer staff called 2005, ''The Year of Walter'' because the staff evolved Harriman's relationship with [[General (United States)|General]] [[Hank Landry (Stargate)|Hank Landry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;walterinterv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilles Nuytens |url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/gary_jones_03.htm |title=Gary Jones interview |publisher=''The SciFi World'' | language=| accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones does not have a binding [[contract]] with the ''Stargate'' producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chevron&quot;/&gt;

=== Charles Kawalsky ===
{{anchor|Charles Kawalsky}}
[[File:Jay Acovone Creation Con 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jay Acovone]] at [[Comic Con]], 2007]]
[[Major (United States)|Major]] '''Charles Kawalsky''' portrayed by [[John Diehl (actor)|John Diehl]] (in the film) and [[Jay Acovone]] (in the series), was first introduced in the 1994 ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', as [[Jack O'Neill]]'s [[second in command]] for the mission through the stargate. In the film Kawalsky holds the rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[United States Air Force]]. He is recruited by General W.O. West to become a member of the first mission through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]. When he comes to the planet [[List of recurring alien characters in Stargate SG-1#Abydonians|Abydos]] he encounters the [[indigenous people]] of the planet, and under the orders of O'Neill, takes up the fight against [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] (who in series is revealed to be a [[Goa'uld]]). Kawalsky's relationship with [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] worsens throughout the film, because Jackson is unable to return them back to the planet at the start. However, he changes his view of Jackson later on, after they have defeated Ra. He, along with O'Neill and [[Louis Ferretti]] decides to keep silent about what really happened during their mission to the planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;film&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Stargate (film) | title=Stargate | series=| serieslink=|credits = | writers = [[Roland Emmerich]] and [[Dean Devlin]] | network = [[MetroâGoldwynâMayer]] (MGM) and [[Carolco]] | season =  | number =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Goa'uld]] [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] attacks [[Stargate Command]] (SGC), [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Army, Air Force, and Marines|Captain]] Kawalsky, was brought back together with his former teammates and questioned by General [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]]. However both he and Louis Feretti kept quiet about the mission to Abydos. O'Neill is eventually forced to tell that [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] is still alive, and O'Neill with Kawalsky and Ferretti were ordered to bring Jackson back to Earth. After what happened in the ''Stargate'' film, Kawalsky is promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] and becomes the leader of the newly formed [[SG team|SG-2]], accompanying [[SG-1]] on their mission to Chul'ac to rescue [[Sha're]] and [[Skaara]]. On the planet SG-2 guarded the Stargate and provided cover for SG-1 when they fled from the pursuing [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]]. However before he returns to Earth he is infected with Goa'uld from a dead Jaffa warrior.&lt;ref name=&quot;childrenofthegods&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Children of the Gods | title=Children of the Gods (Part 1 &amp; 2) | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 1 | number = 1 &amp; 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on Earth the [[symbiote]] started to take control over him, resulting in Kawalsky having several [[Amnesia|blackouts]]. The [[Medical|medical staff]] of the SGC tried to surgically remove the Goa'uld from his body and although they were able to remove the symbiote, it turned out only to be a dead husk while the Goa'uld had already taken over Kawalsky's mind. He freed himself and tried to flee from the base, setting off the self-destruct as he dialed the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]], but was stopped by [[Teal'c]] while the self-destruct was disarmed. They fought in front of the open Stargate and when Teal'c held his head into it, the gate was closed, resulting in Kawalsky's death as the back part of his skull and brain, complete with the Goa'uld, were lost in the [[Stargate (device)#Matter transmission|event horizon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theenemywithin&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Enemy Within (Stargate SG-1) | title=The Enemy Within | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Brad Wright]] | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 1 | number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his demise in the second episode of the show, Kawalsky still appears in three more episodes of the series. The first being &quot;[[The Gamekeeper (Stargate SG-1)|The Gamekeeper]]&quot;, O'Neill and Teal'c encountered Kawalsky in a [[virtual reality]] simulation during which O'Neill remembered an earlier mission in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;thegamekeeper&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Gamekeeper (Stargate SG-1) | title=The Gamekeeper | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 2 | number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Point of View (Stargate SG-1)|Point of View]]&quot;, Kawalsky and [[Samantha Carter]] from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] where the Goa'uld have successfully invaded Earth come into contact with the SGC of this reality, but return to their world after SG-1 help them make contact with the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] of their universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;pointofview&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Point of View (Stargate SG-1)| title=Point of View | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Jonathan Glassner]], [[Brad Wright]], [[Robert C.

In a partial mirror to the pilot, Kawalsky accompanies O'Neill, Carter and Daniel to Chulak in part two of &quot;[[Moebius (Stargate SG-1)|Moebius]]&quot;. In this last appearance, he again meets his end, although here he is merely shot; it is the alternate Daniel Jackson who is infected with the Goa'uld and killed by Teal'c.&lt;ref name=&quot;moebius&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Moebius (Stargate SG-1) | title=Moebius | series= Stargate SG-1| serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits = | writers = [[Joseph Mallozzi]], [[Paul Mullie]], [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C.

Darren Sumner called Kawalsky &quot;one of the film's strongest characters&quot; in the 1994 ''Stargate'' film.

The most known character trait for Maybourne is  with his ambiguous morals and loyalties. Maybourne's relationship with [[Jack O'Neill]] in the show has varied from enemy to collaborator. After his arrest, most of his cronies left Maybourne for dead in [[jail]]. O'Neill agrees to help Maybourne temporarily get out of jail, if he in turn could get [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]] back as leader of the [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) center. Early on on Maybourne's character development there were rumours of him being in love with [[Samantha Carter]]. It was originally planned for a scene in the series which depicted Maybourne's feelings for Carter, but the scene was cut and the relationship was never spoken about again amongst the ''Stargate SG-1'' producers and writers alike. When portraying actor [[Tom McBeath]] was asked about the O'Neill and Maybourne relationship, he explained:&lt;ref name=&quot;tommcbeath&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last= Read |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/hanging_with_harry.shtml |title=Hanging with Harry: GateWorld talks to Tom McBeath |publisher=''GateWorld'' | language=| accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McBeath called his role as Maybourne at the start of the series &quot;boring,&quot; but was glad for the new change in the character's direction in the series after he was convicted for treason.  McBeath also commented that the writers and the producers for the show had more &quot;fun&quot; when his character started to &quot;loosen&quot; up.&lt;ref name=&quot;tommcbeath&quot;/&gt; McBeath once stated that the character of Maybourne diminished after [[Richard Dean Anderson]]'s departure from the show in [[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)|season 8]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Gilles |last=Nuytens |url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/tom_mcbeath_01.htm |title=Tom McBeath interview |publisher=''The SciFi World'' | language=| accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the SGC foil the attempt, Kinsey flees aboard an [[Al'kesh]], but Kinsey's future remains uncertain as the Al'Kesh is destroyed while he operated a transport device.&lt;ref name=&quot;fullalert&quot;/&gt;

The producers of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' asked [[Ronny Cox]] if he would be interested in a role in one episode, but according to Cox it was &quot;So much fun that they and I decided we would like to do more together.&quot; According to [[executive producer]] [[Brad Wright]], every time they got a [[Teleplay|script]] from an outside editor, Kinsey was included. Cox has been noted for saying that the character has become a &quot;Malevolent force on the show.&quot; Because of the collaboration between the producers and himself. Cox described him as a &quot;self-aggrandizing senator who like[s] to throw his weight around&quot;, and as &quot;Kinsey feels that the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] [is] being used in completely the wrong way and one that is endangering American ideals and a way of life that he believes in&quot; and a &quot;Born-again, right-wing, Christian fundamentalist&quot;; Cox played him as a heroic antagonist rather than villainous. Cox was approached by the producers to play Kinsey instead of auditioning himself.

[[Robert Picardo]] was in the main cast of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' from 1995 to 2001. He was familiar with ''Stargate SG-1'' from his time as a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] subscriber. He was offered a one-day guest star as Richard Woolsey for the ''SG-1'' episode &quot;[[Heroes (Stargate SG-1)|Heroes]]&quot; in season seven (2004) while he was working on ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' in [[Vancouver]] (where ''Stargate SG-1'' is filmed). He was then brought back for the follow-up episode &quot;[[Inauguration (Stargate SG-1)|Inauguration]]&quot;, which began the rehabilitation of the Woolsey character. With the story introduction of the [[IOA (Stargate)|IOA]], the Woolsey character made more regular appearances to &quot;annoy people&quot;. Eventually, humor was added to the role, and the character was spun over to ''Atlantis'' as a recurring guest character.
