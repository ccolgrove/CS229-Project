The '''Scottish Parliament election, 1999''' was the first [[general election]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]], with voting taking place on 6 May 1999 to elect 129 members. Following the election, the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] and the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] formed the [[Scottish Executive]], with Labour [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP)]] [[Donald Dewar]] becoming [[First Minister]].

The Scottish Parliament was created after a [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|referendum on devoloution]] took place on September 11, 1997 in which 74.3% of those who voted approved the idea. The [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act (1998)]] was then passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] which established the devolved Scottish parliament and Scottish Executive. The parliament was to be elected using [[Mixed member proportional representation]] which is a combination of 73 [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions 1999 to 2011|(First-past-the-post) constituencies]] using the same boundaries as was used in the [[1997 UK General Election]] with the exception of [[Orkney (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Orkney]] and [[Shetland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Shetland]] as they were made separate constituencies and [[proportional representation]] with the 73 constituencies being grouped together to make [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions 1999 to 2011| eight regions]] which would each elect seven [[Member of Scottish Parliament|additional members]]  to make a total of 129 [[Member of Scottish Parliament|Members of Scottish Parliament (MSP's)]]. This meant that it would be unlikely for any party to gain a majority of seats in the new parliament and either [[minority government|minority]] or [[coalition]] Scottish Executive's would have to be formed.

The first general election to the [[Scottish Parliament]] overall produced few surprises with the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] still enjoying high popularity following their landslide [[1997 UK general election|UK general election win]] two years earlier as widely expected was the largest party winning 56 seats, mostly in their traditional [[Central Belt]] heartlands, which was nine seats short of an overall majority and a coalition was then formed with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] who won 17 seats. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) had done well in opinion polls running up to the election, gaining 40% in some approval ratings but this level of support was not maintained, and the SNP were the second largest party with 35 seats, but this was at the time their best performance since [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974]]. The [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative Party]], still recovering from their wipeout in [[1997 UK general election|1997]] across [[Scotland]], failed to win a single [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituency]] seat but did manage to win 18 seats through the Additional Member System.

The [[Scottish Socialist Party|Scottish Socialist Party (SSP)]] and the [[Scottish Green Party|Greens]] picked up unexpected [[additional member system|additional member]] seats. [[Robin Harper]] became the first ever elected Green parliamentarian in the history of the United Kingdom. [[Dennis Canavan]], who had failed to become an approved Labour candidate, won the [[Falkirk]] West constituency as an independent candidate. 

Following the election the new parliament meet in  the [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]] for the very first time on Wednesday 12th May 1999 although the actual [[devolution]] of powers from [[Houses of Parliament|Westminster]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]] did take place until midnight on Thursday 1st July 1999 almost two months later.
