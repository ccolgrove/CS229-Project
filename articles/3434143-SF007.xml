}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against [[software patent]]s, [[digital rights management]], and what he sees as excessive extension of copyright laws. Stallman has also developed a number of pieces of widely used software, including the original [[Emacs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.multicians.org/mepap.html#secii | title = Multics Emacs: The History, Design and Implementation | author = Bernard S.

==Early years==
Stallman was born to Daniel Stallman and Alice Lippman,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Richard Stallman's mother, Alice Lippman, still remembers the moment she realized her son had a special gift.&quot; Chapter 3, ''[[Free as in Freedom]]'' http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch03.html&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 in [[New York City]]. His first experience with computers was while in high school at the [[IBM New York Scientific Center]]. He was hired for the summer to write a numerical analysis program in [[Fortran]]. He completed the task after a couple of weeks and spent the rest of the summer writing a text editor in [[APL (programming language)|APL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stallman |first=Richard M |url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/history/garb/txt/87-2-rms.txt |title=RMS BerÃ¤ttar
|accessdate=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman spent the summer after his high-school graduation writing another program, a [[preprocessor]] for the [[PL/I]] [[programming language]] on the [[IBM System/360]].{{cn|date=October 2011}}

During this time, Stallman was also a [[volunteer]] laboratory assistant in the [[biology]] department at [[Rockefeller University]]. Although he was already moving toward a career in [[mathematics]] or [[physics]], his teaching professor at Rockefeller thought he would have a future as a biologist.&lt;ref name=freeasinfreedom-chap3&gt;{{cite book|author=Williams, Sam|title=[[Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software]]|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2002|isbn=0-596-00287-4}} Chapter 3.

Retrieved 27 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a first-year student at [[Harvard University]], Stallman was known for his strong performance in [[Math 55]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In 1971 he became a programmer at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], and became a regular in the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community, where he was usually known by his initials, rms (which was the name of his computer accounts). In the first edition of the ''[[Hacker's Dictionary]]'', he wrote &quot;'Richard Stallman' is just my mundane name; you can call me 'rms'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;initials&quot; /&gt; Stallman graduated from Harvard ''[[wikt:magna cum laude|magna cum laude]]'' earning a BA in Physics in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stallman.org/ |title=Richard Stallman's Personal Page |publisher=Stallman.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman enrolled as a graduate student at MIT, but then ended his pursuit of a doctorate in physics to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.

While a graduate student at MIT, Stallman published a paper on an AI [[truth maintenance system]] called ''dependency-directed backtracking'' with [[Gerald Jay Sussman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stallman | first = Richard M | coauthors = Sussman, Gerald J | year = 1977 | title = Forward Reasoning and Dependency-Directed Backtracking In a System for Computer-Aided Circuit analysis | publisher = Artificial Intelligence 9 | pages = 135â196 | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mcallester90truth.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s. As of 2003, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book | title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach | year = 2003 | last = Russell | first = Stuart | coauthors = Norvig, Peter | page = 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of [[constraint learning|constraint recording]], wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.&lt;ref name=russell /&gt;

As a hacker in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects like [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]], [[Emacs]], and the [[Lisp machine]] Operating System. He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]. When [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's]] [[Project MAC|Laboratory for Computer Science]] (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Levy,S: ''Hackers'', page 417. Penguin USA, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of MIT's hacker culture==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker culture]] that Stallman thrived on began to fragment. To prevent software from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing [[source code]] and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such [[proprietary software]] had existed before, and it became apparent that it would become the norm. This shift in the legal characteristics of software can be regarded as a consequence triggered by the U.S. [[Copyright Act of 1976]], as stated by Stallman's [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] fellow [[Brewster Kahle]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert X. [http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/#4 Cringely's interview with Brewster Kahle], around the 46th minute&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]] in 1979 placed [[Time bomb (Software)|time bombs]] in [[Scribe (word processing)|Scribe]] to restrict unlicensed access to the software, Stallman proclaimed it &quot;a crime against humanity.&quot;&lt;ref name=freeasinfreedom-Chap6&gt;{{cite book|author=Williams, Sam|title=Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2002|isbn=0-596-00287-4}} Chapter 6. Available under the [[GFDL]] in both the initial [http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html O'Reilly edition] (accessed on 27 October 2006) and the updated [http://www.faifzilla.org/ch06.html FAIFzilla edition] . Retrieved 27 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He clarified, years later, that it is blocking the user's freedom that he believes is a crime, not the issue of charging for the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3737586_3|title=Richard Stallman, Live and Unplugged|quote= Q: You once said &quot;the prospect of charging money for software was a crime against humanity.&quot; Do you still believe this? A: Well, I was not distinguishing the two meanings of free.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Stallman and some other hackers at the AI Lab were refused access to the source code for the software of a newly-installed [[laser printer]], the [[Xerox]] 9700. Stallman had modified the software for the Lab's previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person's job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people's need to be free to modify the software they use.&lt;ref name=freeasinfreedom-Chap1&gt;{{cite book|author=Williams, Sam|title=Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2002|isbn=0-596-00287-4}} Chapter 1.

Retrieved 27 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]], a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded [[Lisp Machines|Lisp Machines, Inc.]] (LMI) to market [[Lisp machine]]s, which he and [[Tom Knight (scientist)|Tom Knight]] designed at the lab. Greenblatt rejected outside investment, believing that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the growth of the company. In contrast, the other hackers felt that the [[venture capital]]-funded approach was better. As no agreement could be reached, hackers from the latter camp founded [[Symbolics]], with the aid of [[Russ Noftsker]], an AI Lab administrator. Symbolics recruited most of the remaining hackers including notable hacker [[Bill Gosper]], who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics forced Greenblatt to also resign by citing MIT policies. While both companies delivered proprietary software, Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab's community. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab's computers.&lt;ref&gt;Levy,S: ''Hackers''. Penguin USA, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman argues that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbor and to be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. He maintains that attempts by proprietary software vendors to prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical.&lt;ref name=OpenSources/&gt; The phrase &quot;software wants to be free&quot; is often incorrectly attributed to him, and Stallman argues that this is a misstatement of his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050513135545766 The Daemon, the GNU and the Penguin] by Peter H. Salus. Retrieved 18 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that freedom is vital for the sake of users and society as a moral ''value,'' and not merely for pragmatic reasons such as possibly developing technically superior software.

In February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the [[GNU project]], which he had announced in September 1983.

==GNU project==
{{Main|GNU Project}}
[[Image:Richard Stallman 00 .jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richard Stallman at the opening ceremony of NIXAL (a [[GNU/Linux User Group|GLUG]]) at [[Netaji Subhash Engineering College]], Calcutta, India]]
Stallman announced the plan for the [[GNU operating system]] in September 1983 on several [[ARPANET]] mailing lists and [[USENET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.co.uk/group/net.unix-wizards/msg/4dadd63a976019d7?dmode=source |title=new UNIX implementation |publisher=Groups.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Stallman published the [[GNU Manifesto]], which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with [[Unix]]. The name GNU is a [[recursive acronym]] for &quot;GNU's Not Unix.&quot; Soon after, he started a [[non-profit]] corporation called the [[Free Software Foundation]] to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the [[free software movement]]. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization founded in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman popularized the concept of ''[[copyleft]]'', a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for [[free software]]. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed. Stallman was responsible for contributing many necessary tools, including a [[text editor]] ([[Emacs]]), [[compiler]] ([[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]]), [[debugger]] ([[GNU Debugger|gdb]]), and a [[build automation|build automator]] ([[gmake]]). The notable exception was a [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. In 1990, members of the GNU project began a kernel called [[GNU Hurd]], which has yet to achieve the maturity level required for widespread usage.

In 1991, [[Linus Torvalds]], a [[Finns|Finnish]] student, used the GNU development tools to produce the [[Linux kernel]]. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform; most sources use the name ''[[Linux]]'' to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed. This has been a longstanding [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|naming controversy]] in the [[free software community]]. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project.

Stallman's influences on hacker culture include the name [[POSIX]]&lt;ref name=&quot;PE&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date = 2006-02-02| title = POSIX 1003.1 FAQ Version 1.12

On [[Unix|UNIX]] systems, GNU Emacs's popularity rivaled that of another editor [[vi]], spawning an [[editor war]]. Stallman's take on this was to canonize himself as St. IGNUcius of the [[Church of Emacs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090601054752/http://melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2004/10/80957.php &quot;Richard Stallman: GNU/Linux and a free society&quot; article by Takver Sunday October 10, 2004 at 08:06 AM on ''Melbourne Indymedia'' web site.] Hosted on the [[Wayback machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stallman.org/saint.html |title=St IGNUcius web page at www.stallman.org |publisher=Stallman.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledge that &quot;vi vi vi is the [[Number of the Beast|editor of the beast]],&quot; while &quot;using a free version of vi is not a [[sin]]; it is a [[penance]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;faif&quot;/&gt;

Around 1992, developers at [[Lucid Inc.]] doing their own work on Emacs clashed with Stallman and ultimately [[fork (software engineering)|forked]] the software into what would become [[XEmacs]].&lt;ref&gt;

Technology journalist Andrew Leonard has characterized what he sees as Stallman's uncompromising stubbornness as common among elite computer programmers:
{{Bquote|There's something comforting about Stallman's intransigence. Win or lose, Stallman will never give up. He'll be the stubbornest mule on the farm until the day he dies.

Stallman has written many essays on software freedom and since the early 1990s has been an outspoken political campaigner for the [[free software movement]]. The speeches he has regularly given are titled ''The GNU project and the Free Software movement'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fsfeurope.org/documents/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html |title=Transcript of Richard Stallman on the Free Software movement, Zagreb; 2006-03-09 |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work=[[FSFE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dangers of Software Patents'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifso.ie/documents/rms-2004-05-24.html |title=IFSO: Richard Stallman: The Dangers of Software Patents; 2004-05-24 (transcript) |accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Copyright and Community in the age of computer networks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/copyright-and-globalization.html |title=Copyright and Globalization in the Age of Computer Networks&amp;nbsp;â GNU Project&amp;nbsp;â Free Software Foundation (FSF) |accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 and 2007, during the eighteen month public consultation for the drafting of version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]], he added a fourth topic explaining the proposed changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/#transcripts |title=GPLv3 - GNU General Public License, version 3 |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work=[[FSFE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linus Torvalds]] has criticized Stallman for what he considers &quot;black-and-white thinking&quot; and bringing more harm than good to the free software community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2008/11/black-and-white.html |title=Linus' blog: Black and white |publisher=Torvalds-family.blogspot.com |date=2008-11-02 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman's staunch advocacy for [[free software]] inspired the Virtual Richard M. Stallman ([[vrms]]), software that analyzes the packages currently installed on a [[Debian]] GNU/Linux system, and report those that are from the non-free tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vrms.alioth.debian.org/ |title=The Virtual Richard M. Stallman package |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work=[[Debian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman would disagree with parts of Debian's definition of free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=221807|title=Debian Bug report logs - #221807: &quot;vrms and RMS disagree sometimes...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Stallman called for development of a free on-line encyclopedia through the means of inviting the public to contribute articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/free-encyclopedia.html|accessdate = 2006-10-15|title = The Free Universal Encyclopedia and Learning Resource|author = Richard Stallman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[GNUPedia]] was eventually retired in favour of the emerging [[Wikipedia]], which had similar aims and was enjoying greater success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html|accessdate = 2011-10-15|title = The Free Encyclopedia Project|author = Richard Stallman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Venezuela]], Stallman has delivered public speeches and promoted the adoption of free software in the state's oil company ([[PDVSA]]), in municipal government, and in the nation's military.  Stallman has criticised some policies on television broadcasting, free speech rights, and privacy in meetings with ChÃ¡vez and in public speeches in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, Richard.

In August 2006 at his meetings with the government of the [[India]]n State of [[Kerala]], he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft's, at state-run schools. This has resulted in a landmark decision to switch all school computers in 12,500 high schools from [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to a free software operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=138464 |title=Kerala logs Microsoft out |publisher=The Financial Express |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman has participated in protests about software [[patent]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wien.kpoe.at/news/article.php/20050803081612703|title=Protest in Brussels against software patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccullagh.org/image/d30-23/richard-stallman-and-flag.html|title=Protest outside and inside MPAA meeting on DRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopdrm.info/index.php?2006/06/11/89-on-remet-ca-paris|title=Protest in France against DRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[proprietary software]].

Protesting against proprietary software in April 2006, Stallman held a &quot;Don't buy from [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], enemy of your freedom&quot; placard at a speech by an ATI representative in the building where Stallman works, resulting in the police being called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/rms-ati-protest.html |title=Protest against ATI nearly led to the arrest of RMS| publisher=Free Software Foundation page}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATI has since merged with [[AMD]] Corporation and has taken steps to make their hardware documentation available for use by the [[free software community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/enterprise-linux/amd-will-deliver-open-graphics-drivers/|title=AMD will deliver open graphics drivers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman has also helped and supported the [[International Music Score Library Project]] in getting back online, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007 following a [[cease and desist]] letter from [[Universal Edition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://imslp.wikidot.com/ Temporary main page of the IMSLP], accessed on May 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Steve Jobs]], Stallman wrote the following eulogy:
{{quote|Steve Jobs, the pioneer of the computer as a jail made cool, designed to sever fools from their freedom, has died.

As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, &quot;I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone.&quot; Nobody deserves to have to die - not Jobs, not Mr. Bill, not even people guilty of bigger evils than theirs. But we all deserve the end of Jobs' malign influence on people's computing.

Unfortunately, that influence continues despite his absence. We can only hope his successors, as they attempt to carry on his legacy, will be less effective.|Richard Stallman&lt;ref&gt;http://stallman.org/archives/2011-jul-oct.html#06_October_2011_%28Steve_Jobs%29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stallman's remark stirred up accusations of being in bad taste while [[Eric S. Raymond]], author of [[Cathedral and the Bazaar]] summarized that Stallman statement was not personal, but was simply criticizing [[Walled garden (technology)|walled gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/10/stallman_glad_jobs_gone/&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman's only computer is a [[Lemote]] Yeeloong [[netbook]] (using the same company's [[Loongson]] processor) which he chose because it can run with 100% free software even at the [[BIOS]] level, stating &quot;freedom is my priority. I've campaigned for freedom since 1983, and I am not going to surrender that freedom for the sake of a more convenient computer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richard.stallman.usesthis.com/ |title=the setup is a bunch of nerdy interviews: What do people use to get the job done? |publisher=Richard.stallman.usesthis.com |date=2010-01-23 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemote is a joint venture of the [[Institute of Computing Technology]] of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], an institution of the [[State Council of China]].

Stallman has suggested that the United States government is encouraging the use of [[cloud computing]] because this allows them to access users' data without needing a [[search warrant]].&lt;ref&gt;Adhikari, Richard.

==Terminology==
[[Image:RMS iGNUcius techfest iitb.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Richard Stallman gets into his '''St. iGNUcius''' avatar at [[Techniche]], [[IIT Guwahati]], [[India]]]]

Stallman places great importance on the words and labels people use to talk about the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He untiringly asks people to say free software and GNU/Linux, and to avoid the terms ''[[intellectual property]]'' and ''[[Copyright infringement of software|piracy]]'' (in relation to copyright). His requests that people use certain terms, and his ongoing efforts to convince people of the importance of terminology are a source of regular misunderstanding and friction with parts of the [[free software community|free software]] and [[open source community|open source communities]].

One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agree to use his terminology throughout the article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/linus_pr.html Leader of the Free World], ''Wired'' Magazine, Issue 11.11, November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes he has even required journalists to read parts of the GNU philosophy before an interview, for &quot;efficiency's sake&quot;.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;linux gnu&quot;&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.html Linux, GNU, Freedom] by Richard M. Stallman. Retrieved 18 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman rejects a common [[alternative terms for free software|alternative term]], [[open source software]], because it does not call to mind what Stallman sees as the value of the software: [[freedom (political)|freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html Why &quot;Free Software&quot; is better than &quot;Open Source&quot;]. Retrieved 18 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it will not inform people of the freedom issues, and will not lead to people valuing and defending their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html Why Software Should Be Free]. April 24, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Two alternatives which Stallman does accept are software libre and unfettered software, but free software is the term he asks people to use in English. For similar reasons, he argues for the term &quot;[[proprietary software]]&quot; rather than &quot;[[closed source software]]&quot;, when referring to software that is not free software.

Stallman repeatedly asks that the term GNU/Linux, which he pronounces &quot;GNU slash Linux&quot;, be used to refer to the operating system created by combining the GNU system and the Linux kernel. Stallman refers to this operating system as &quot;a variant of GNU, and the GNU Project is its principal developer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;linux gnu&quot;/&gt; He claims that the connection between the GNU project's philosophy and its software is broken when people refer to the combination as merely Linux.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html What's in a name?] by Richard Stallman. Retrieved 18 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting around 2003, he began also using the term GNU+Linux, which he pronounces &quot;GNU plus Linux&quot;, to prevent others from pronouncing the phrase &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; as &quot;GNU Linux&quot;, which would erroneously imply that the Linux kernel is maintained by the GNU project. (See: [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]])

Stallman argues that the term [[intellectual property]] is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of [[copyright]], [[patent]], [[trademark]] and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/torino-rms-transcript.en.html#note-on-ip|title=Transcript of Richard Stallman speaking on GPLv3 in Torino|date=18 March 2006|quote=Everyone who uses the term intellectual property is either confused himself or trying to confuse you.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues.

{{quote|These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas&amp;nbsp;â a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml Did You Say &quot;Intellectual Property&quot;? It's a Seductive Mirage] by Richard M. Stallman. Retrieved 18 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives, is this sentence of an email by Stallman to a public mailing list:
{{quote|I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.fsfeurope.org/pipermail/wsis-pct/2006-April/001115.html |title=Email &quot;IP Justice Comment on Top Policy Issues for Athens&quot; |publisher=Mail.fsfeurope.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==
Stallman has devoted the bulk of his lifeâs energies to political and software activism.&lt;ref name=&quot;stallman-personal-ad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Stallman |first=Richard |title=My Personal Ad |url=http://www.stallman.org/extra/personal.html |accessdate=2006-11-26 | quote = My 23-year-old child, the Free Software Movement, occupies most of my life, leaving no room for more children, but I still have room to love a sweetheart.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professing to care little for material wealth, he explains that &quot;I've always lived cheaply ... like a student, basically. And I like that, because it means that money is not telling me what to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyu-2001-05-29&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Stallman |first=Richard |title=Transcript of Richard M.

Until around 1998, his office at [[MIT]]'s [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|AI Lab]] was also his residence.&lt;ref name=&quot;iw-glimpse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=K.C. |title=A Rare Glimpse into Richard Stallman's World |publisher=InformationWeek |url=http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=175802222}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was registered to vote from there. Nowadays he has a separate residence in Cambridge not far from MIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html |title=LifeStyle |publisher=Stallman.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position as a research affiliate at MIT is unpaid.&lt;ref name=&quot;mit-takeda-2001-10-17&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Stallman shares Takeda award of nearly $1M | publisher = MIT | date = 2001-10-17 | url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/stallman-1017.html | accessdate = 2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a footnote to an article he wrote in 1999, he says &quot;As an [[Atheism|atheist]], I don't follow any religious leaders, but I sometimes find I admire something one of them has said.&quot;&lt;ref name=OpenSources&gt;{{cite book|author=Various|title=Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=1999|isbn=1-56592-582-3|chapter=Stallman chapter|chapterurl=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/stallman.html|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman often wears a button that reads &quot;Impeach God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch04.html |title=Free as in Freedom: Chapter 4 |publisher=Oreilly.com |date=1986-10-30 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By FranÃ§ois @ Edito.qc.ca FranÃ§ois Proulx+ Add Contact |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/francois/23625436/ |title=Richard Stallman &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman chooses not to celebrate [[Christmas]], instead celebrating &quot;[[gravity|Grav]]-[[mass]]&quot; on December 25. The name and date are references to [[Isaac Newton]], whose birthday falls on that day on the [[Old Style|old style calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stallman.org/grav-mass.html |title=Celebrate Grav-mass |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work=stallman.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about his influences, he replied that he admires [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[Ralph Nader]], and [[Dennis Kucinich]], and commented as well: &quot;I admire [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]], even though I criticize some of the things that they did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FSF India: A Q &amp; A session with Richard M.

In a lecture in [[Manchester]], England on May 1, 2008, Stallman advocated paper voting over machine voting, insisting that there was a much better chance of being able to do a recount correctly if there was a paper copy of the ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Free Software in Ethics and Society | author = Stallman, Richard | date = 2008-5-1 | location = Manchester, England | url = http://manchester.fsuk.org/blog/2008/05/06/free-software-in-ethics-and-society-richard-stallman-manchester-1st-may/ | accessdate = 2010-05-30 }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman enjoys a wide range of musical styles from the works of [[Conlon Nancarrow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://slashdot.org/interviews/99/10/08/1147217.shtml | title = Bruce Sterling interview }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[folk music|folk]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://stallman.org/#humorousbio | title = Humorous bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Free Software Song]] takes the form of alternative words for the Bulgarian folk dance [[Sadi Moma]]. More recently he wrote a take-off on the Cuban folk song [[Guantanamera]], about a prisoner in the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], and recorded it in Cuba with Cuban musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stallman | first = Richard M | title = Guantanamero | url = http://stallman.org/guantanamero.html | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also enjoys music by [[BÃ©la Fleck and the Flecktones]] and [[Weird Al Yankovic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/echemi/www/040324.html | title = Richard Stallman Playlist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman is a fan of [[science fiction]], including works by the author [[Greg Egan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nearthwort.com/podpress_trac/web/74/0/2007-02-04_nearthwort_podcast_11.mp3 |title=The Leading N Earth Worth Site on the Net |publisher=nearthwort.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He occasionally goes to [[science fiction convention]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;faif&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Sam|title=Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman&quot;s Crusade for Free Software|publisher=O'Reilly Media|date=2002-03-15|isbn=0-596-00287-4|url=http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/|accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the Free Software Song while awaiting his turn to sing at a convention. He has written two science fiction stories, &quot;[[The Right to Read]]&quot; and &quot;Jinnetic Engineering&quot;.

Along with his native [[English language|English]], Stallman is also fluent enough in [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to deliver his two-hour speeches in those languages, and claims a &quot;somewhat flawed&quot; command of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = WGIG nominees&amp;nbsp;â Richard Stallman | url = http://www.net-gov.org/wgig/stallman.php | accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2011-January/msg00043.html |title=Re: How to open Gnome Malaysia Usergroup |publisher=Mail.gnome.org |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
