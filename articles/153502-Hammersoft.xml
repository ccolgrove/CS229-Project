Retrieved on 11 May 2010. &quot;Mensa's registered office is Slate Barn, Church Lane, Caythorpe, NG32 3EL, United Kingdom.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mensa'' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|m|É|n|s|É}}; Latin: {{IPA-la|Ëmensa|}}) means &quot;[[table (furniture)|table]]&quot; in [[Latin]], as is symbolized in the organization's logo, and was chosen to demonstrate the round-table nature of the organization; the coming together of equals.

==Founding==
Roland Berrill, an Australian [[barrister]], and Dr [[Lancelot Ware]], a British scientist and lawyer, founded Mensa at [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], in [[Oxford]], England, in 1946. They had the idea of forming a society for very intelligent people, the only qualification for membership being a high IQ.&lt;ref name=&quot;mensa&quot;/&gt; It was to be free from all social distinctions (racial, religious, ''etc.''), represented by the name of the organisation, which comprises two Latin words: ''[[wikt:mens#Latin|mÄns]]'', which means &quot;[[mind]]&quot;; and ''[[wikt:mensa#Latin|mÄnsa]]'', which means &quot;[[Table (furniture)|table]]&quot;, indicating that it is a round-table society of minds. Mensa was also to be a non-political organisation, reflected in its constitution: &quot;Mensa encompasses members representing many points of view. Consequently, Mensa as an organisation shall not express an opinion as being that of Mensa, take any political action other than the publication of the results of its investigations, or have any ideological, philosophical, political, or religious affiliations.&quot;

American Mensa was the second major branch of Mensa. Its success has been linked to the efforts of its early and longstanding organizer, [[Margot Seitelman]].

==Membership requirement==
Mensa's only requirement for membership is that one score at or above the 98th [[percentile]] on certain standardised [[IQ]] or other approved intelligence tests, such as the [[Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales]]. Because different tests are scaled differently, it is not meaningful to compare raw scores between tests, only percentiles. For example, the minimum accepted score on the Stanford-Binet is 132, while for the [[Cattell Culture Fair III|Cattell]] it is 148.&lt;ref name=&quot;Test_Scores&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Submit Test Scores|url=http://www.us.mensa.org/testscores|publisher=American Mensa|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But most IQ tests are designed to yield a mean score of 100 with a [[standard deviation]] of 15; the 98th-percentile score under these conditions is 130.82.

Mensa also has its own application exam, and some national groups offer alternative batteries of culture-fair, non-language tests. These exams are proctored by Mensa and do not provide a quantified score; they serve only to qualify a person for membership. In some national groups, a person may take a Mensa offered test only once, although one may later submit an application with results from a different qualifying test.&lt;ref name=&quot;Test_Scores&quot;/&gt; For some national Mensa groups, such as American Mensa, having a high enough score on some graduate school admissions exams is enough to qualify for Mensa membership.&lt;ref name =&quot;Test_Scores&quot;/&gt;

==Mission==
Mensa's constitution lists three purposes: &quot;to identify and to foster human [[intelligence]] for the benefit of humanity; to encourage research into the nature, characteristics, and uses of intelligence; and to provide a stimulating intellectual and social environment for its members&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

To this end, the organisation is also involved with programs for [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted children]], [[literacy]] and scholarships, and it also holds numerous &quot;gatherings&quot; (see [[#Gatherings|below]]).

==Organisational structure==
Mensa International consists of more than 110,000 members in 50 national groups. Individuals who live in a country with a national group join the national group, while those living in countries without a recognised chapter may join Mensa International directly. The two largest national groups are American Mensa, with more than 56,000 members, and British Mensa, with about 23,500 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;mensa_UK&quot; /&gt; Larger national groups are further subdivided into local groups. For example, American Mensa has 134 local groups, with the largest having over 2,000 members and the smallest having fewer than 100.

Additionally, members may form [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs) at international, national, and local levels; these SIGs represent a wide variety of interests, both commonplace and obscure, ranging from motorcycle clubs to entrepreneurial cooperations, reflecting the wide diversity of members in occupation and social class. Some SIGs are associated with various geographic groups, whereas others act independently of official hierarchy. There are now quite a number of electronic SIGs (eSIGs), which operate primarily as e-mail lists, where members may or may not meet each other in person.

The Mensa Foundation, a separate charitable U.S. corporation, edits and publishes its own Mensa Research Journal, in which both Mensans and non-Mensans are published on various topics surrounding the concept and measure of intelligence. The national groups also issue periodicals, such as ''Mensa Bulletin'', the monthly publication of American Mensa,&lt;ref name=mb&gt;{{Cite web

 |url= http://www.us.mensa.org/Content/AML/NavigationMenu/Publications/iMensaBulletini/Mensa_Bulletin.htm
 |accessdate =11 October 2007
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mensa Magazine'', the monthly publication of British Mensa.&lt;ref name=mm&gt;{{Cite web
 |title = Welcome to British Mensa â The High IQ Society

 |accessdate =11 October 2007
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gatherings==
Mensa has many events for members, from the local to the international level. Several countries hold a large event called the Annual Gathering (AG). It is held in a different city every year, with speakers, dances, leadership workshops, children's events, games, and other activities. The American and Canadian AGs are usually held during the [[Independence Day (United States)|American Independence Day]] (4 July) or [[Canada Day]] weekends respectively.

There are also smaller gatherings called Regional Gatherings (RGs) held in various cities that attract members from large areas; the largest in the United States is held in the Chicago area around [[Halloween]], and features a costume party for which many members create pun-based costumes.

In 2006, the Mensa World Gathering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wg06.us.mensa.org//AM/Template.cfm?Section=WGHome |work=American Mensa |title=World Gathering 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held from 8â13 August in [[Orlando, Florida]] to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of Mensa. An estimated 2,500 attendees from over 30 countries gathered for this celebration. The International Board of Directors also had a formal meeting there. In 2010, a joint American-Canadian Annual Gathering was held in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], to mark the 50th anniversary of Mensa in North America.

Since 1990 Mensa has also sponsored the annual Mensa Mind Games competition, whereat the [[Mensa Select]] award is given by American Mensa to five board games that are &quot;original, challenging and well designed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-21-mensa_x.htm |title= Mensa still plays mind games after 60 years |accessdate=16 January 2007 |first= Tracy |last=Loew |date= 21 May 2006 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/22/news_pf/Northoftampa/Brainiac_Central.shtml |title= Brainiac Central |accessdate=16 January 2007 |first= Anne |last=Arsenault |date= 22 April 2005 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual local groups and their members also host smaller events for members and their guests. Lunch or dinner events, lectures, tours, theatre outings, and games nights are all common.

==Publications==
Many national Mensa groups have a members-only hard copy newsletter, such as those in Australia, Sweden, Singapore and elsewhere.

American Mensa's flagship publication is the ''Mensa Bulletin'', published 10 times per year, which includes articles and columns written by members. The ''Mensa Bulletin'' also contains ''International Journal'', &quot;a separate publication featuring news from other national Mensas and Mensa International.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mensa Bulletin |work=American Mensa |url=http://www.us.mensa.org/Content/AML/NavigationMenu/Publications/iMensaBulletini/Mensa_Bulletin.htm |accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mensa also publishes the ''Mensa Research Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mensa Research Journal |work=Mensa Research Journal |url=http://www.mensafoundation.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Journal |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mensa also has published a number of books, including ''Poetry Mensa'' (1966), an anthology of poems by Mensans from all over the world, in which languages other than English are represented. Third party profit publishers also sell commercial products using the official Mensa name.

==Demographics==
Mensans come from many different backgrounds, vary in job and profession, and are represented among all age groups. There are many famous and prominent members (see [[list of Mensans]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.mensa.org/index0.php?page=15 |title= Prominent Mensans | work=Mensa International |accessdate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members pay annual membership dues that vary by country; some national groups offer a &quot;Life Membership&quot;, but it is not transferable between groups.

All national and local groups welcome children; many offer activities, resources and newsletters specifically geared toward gifted children and their parents. Both American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/article_0ec29a81-aaa0-5dd8-a82a-f59472499fa0.html |first=Haley |last=Ringle |title= 2-year-old joins group for high IQs |work=[[East Valley Tribune]] |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Mensa's youngest members joined at the age of two, such as Beatrix Townsend,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1259699/Joining-Mensa-Its-childs-play-year-old-Beatrix.html |title=Joining Mensa?

At the other extreme, American Mensa's oldest member is 107,&lt;ref name=&quot;American Mensa Demographics&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.us.mensa.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=8700&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm|title= American Mensa Demographics |work=American Mensa |accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Mensa had a member aged 103.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mensa.org.uk/download/1472/FAQs-_Apr-2008_2.pdf |title=MENSA FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS |work=British Mensa}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to American Mensa, 41 percent of its members are [[baby boomers]] between the ages of 47 and 64, and there are more than 1,700 families with two or more Mensa members.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Mensa Demographics&quot;/&gt;
