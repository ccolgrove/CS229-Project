Since the [[League of Ireland 2008|2008]] season they have played at the [[UCD Bowl]], also home to the [[University College Dublin R.F.C.|college's rugby team]]. 'The Students' play in sky blue and navy. The current manager is [[Martin Russell (footballer)|Martin Russell]].

==History==
===Foundation and Early Years===
University College Dublin A.F.C. was founded in 1895 as the '''Catholic University Medical School Football Club'''. They began playing regular games the following year. A First XI played College games against other Universities and a Second XI entered outside competitions. The club was founder members of the Leinster Junior League in 1896 and reached the semi-finals of the [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]] in 1897. The club became University College Dublin when the new University annexed the Medical school in 1908.  UCD won the inaugural Intervarsities competition, the [[Collingwood Cup]], in 1914 and added the [[Irish Intermediate Cup]] the following year beating Portadown 2-1 in a replayed final. When the [[Irish Free State]] was formed in 1921 and the new [[Football Association of Ireland]] was formed, UCD participated in the Preliminary round against fellow non-League team [[Shamrock Rovers]] in November 1921. The game took place in [[Windy Arbour]] and the Hoops won 6-2. UCD were invited to join the [[League of Ireland]] in 1922, but had to turn it down on the basis of not being able to field a team in the [[League of Ireland Shield]] in September as the Academic year didn't commence until October. In 1945 they won the [[FAI Intermediate Cup]] when UCD beat fellow future League of Ireland members [[Cobh Ramblers]] 4-2 in the final. UCD appeared in the [[FAI Cup]] in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, their final appearance as a non-League outfit coming in 1957 when [[Cork Athletic]] beat UCD 4-2 in the [[Mardyke]].

===1970s===

In the 1970s, the club embarked on a series of landmark tours, becoming the first Irish team to play in places like [[Jordan]], [[China]] and [[Australia]]. A second invitation to join the League of Ireland was accepted on 22 July 1979, when [[Cork Celtic]] were expelled for not having their financial affairs in order. Theo Dunne was appointed first team coach, and apart from a brief spell at Home Farm 1990-94, he was in charge of first team affairs until he retired as coach in 2001.  Dr. Tony O'Neill who was general manager when the club joined the League remained in that role until his untimely death from cancer in October 1999.

===1980s===
The club struggled initially in the league after their election, never finishing higher than twelfth in the 16-team league, although they did win the [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]] in December 1980, beating [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]] 2-1 in the final. However, important changes within the club in 1983 marked a dramatic upturn in fortunes. The previously amateur club turned semi-pro, and players outside of the college were allowed to represent the first team. This is still the situation today, although in practice most of the players are either students or ex-students. By the end of the [[League of Ireland 1983â84|1983-84]] season, UCD had won the [[FAI Cup]], beating [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] 2-1 after a replay. Shamrock Rovers weren't to lose another game in the competition for over three years â until they lost to UCD in 1988.

That win saw UCD qualify for European competition â the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1984â85|European Cup Winners Cup]] â for the first time. The draw pitted them against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], then one of the leading sides in England and boasting players of the calibre of [[Neville Southall]], [[Kevin Sheedy (Irish footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]], [[Graham Sharp]], [[Peter Reid]] and [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]]. The home leg was played in [[Tolka Park]] and a crowd of 9,000 â many times UCDâs average league crowd â saw the Students come away with a scarcely believable 0-0 draw. Another remarkable performance was to follow two weeks later as a solitary Graham Sharp goal gave Everton a 1-0 win. [[Joe Hanrahan]] skimmed the bar for the Students late on; had he scored, UCD would have progressed on away goals â as it was, Everton went on to win the entire competition, and smashed several records in winning their nation's league title. UCD's performance was made all the more remarkable in the fact that at the end of the year Everton were voted the best club side in the World of 1985 by the managers of world's national teams.

That season saw UCD finish fourth in the league, but they were then forced to release many of their best players due to financial difficulties. [[Joe Hanrahan]] signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for IRÂ£30,000, [[Ken O'Doherty]] moved to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Alan O'Neill (footballer born 1957)|Alan O'Neill]] left for [[Dundalk FC|Dundalk]]. The team were relegated in 1985/86 with eight points, a record low in the Premier Division. Despite this, in 1987, UCD won the World Collegiate Championships in [[New Mexico]].

Promotion in [[League of Ireland 1988â89|1988-89]] was followed by an immediate relegation, and it was [[League of Ireland 1994â95|1994-95]]  before UCD were to return to the Premier. They did so by recording a then record points tally for the First Division, also breaking the record for most goals scored and fewest goals conceded.

===1990s===
In [[League of Ireland 1999â2000|1999-00]], a late burst saw UCD finish fourth in the league and qualify for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 2000|Intertoto Cup]]. Their opponents were the Bulgarian side [[PFC Velbazhd Kyustendil]], who boasted a couple of full [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] internationals, including Ilian Stoianov, who would go on to represent his country in the [[2004 European Football Championship|2004 European Championships]]. UCD kept up their proud European record with a pulsating 3-3 draw in the first leg in [[Belfield Park]], before drawing 0-0 in Bulgaria to bow out on away goals. History unfortunately repeated itself as the Students once again nearly sneaked victory as they hit the post late on.

===2000 â present day===

In 2001, [[Paul Doolin]], one of the most successful players in the League of Ireland, took over as manager from former player Martin Moran. After enjoying a successful first season, the team only just avoided relegation in [[League of Ireland 2002â03|2002-03]] and was eleven points adrift when Doolin left to take over at [[Drogheda United]] in September 2003. Pete Mahon was immediately installed as the new manager, and UCD almost staged an incredible Houdini act, losing four games in 16, closing the gap at the bottom to two points and recording the highest points total for a relegated team.

[[League of Ireland 2004|2004]] saw more of the same, as UCD, together with [[Finn Harps]], smashed the First Division points record and were promoted with ease. They marked their return to the Premier Division with a highly creditable 1-1 draw away to two-time reigning champions Shelbourne. There was a bright point in College's indifferent season when they got into the [[League of Ireland Cup|League Cup]] final after a 2-1 victory over [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] in the semi-final at Tolka Park. They went on to lose the final 2-1 to [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] at [[Belfield Park]]. A season that started with UCD as contenders for the drop ended relatively well with UCD well clear of the drop-zone in 9th place.

[[League of Ireland 2006|2006]] was one of UCD's most successful seasons in a few years. Despite being knocked out of the League Cup in the first round, &quot;The Students&quot; recovered well, finishing the season in 6th place and reaching the quarter-finals of the [[FAI Cup]]. The performances of many in the squad did not go unnoticed, with [[Darren Quigley]] and [[Gary Dicker]] establishing themselves as  [[Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team|under-21]] internationals. Quigley then went one better and became on [[Republic of Ireland B national football team|B]] international, when he appeared as a substitute against [[Scotland B national football team|Scotland B]] in November. UCD players also attracted interest from many British clubs. Quigley has had trials at many clubs across the water, [[Stockport County F.C|Stockport County]] paid â¬56,000 for Dicker in May 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Stockport capture UCD midfielder|work = BBC Sport, 30&amp;nbsp;May 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/6705901.stm | date=30 May 2007 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patrick Kavanagh (footballer)|Patrick Kavanagh]] signed for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] after impressing on trial there. The club was relegated at the end of the 2008 season but swiftly bounced back to the top flight of Irish football at the first time of asking by securing their second First Division title this time under the management of [[Martin Russell (footballer)|Martin Russell]], being promoted after a 5-0 away win over [[Athlone Town]] in the penultimate match of the season on 30 October 2009, ahead of such exalted opponents as former Premier division teams [[Shelbourne]] and [[Longford Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/soccer_tables_eircomfirstdivision.html |title=Soccer Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship Scheme==
UCD A.F.C. is noted for its highly-regarded scholarship scheme, which gives players the chance to combine senior football with the opportunity to earn a college degree. Past scholars include [[Kevin Grogan]].

==Notable former players==

Many famous players have played for UCD down the years. Former Irish international [[Kevin Moran (footballer)|Kevin Moran]], who would later play for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Sporting de GijÃ³n]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] played in the League of Ireland B and was signed for Manchester United from UCDâs graduate team, Pegasus. Moran also won an [[All-Ireland]] [[Gaelic football]] winnerâs medal with [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] in 1976 while at UCD, as would [[Jason Sherlock]] nineteen years later. The [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] legend and record goalscorer [[Peter Lorimer]] played three games before returning to England for a final spell with Leeds. [[Gavin Whelan]] (nephew of [[Ronnie Whelan]]) and Pat Jennings (son of Northern Irish international [[Pat Jennings]]) played for UCD in the most recent relegation season. [[Brian Lenihan, Snr|Brian Lenihan]] played in the 1955 FAI Cup tie against [[Sligo Rovers]] and later ran for President of Ireland. [[Willie Browne]] won numerous international university caps while at UCD, he subsequently went on to win 3 full [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] caps , 16 amateur caps, 1 [[Republic of Ireland B national football team|Republic of Ireland B]] cap and 6 Inter-League caps and captained [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemian]] for 3 consecutive seasons. [[Hugo MacNeill (rugby player)|Hugo MacNeill]] scored 46 goals in 1977-78, but went on to greater things with the [[Ireland national rugby union team]], winning the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] in 1985 and playing in the [[1987 Rugby World Cup]] in [[New Zealand]]. Former [[Sky Sports]] and current [[Setanta Sports]] pundit [[Paul Dempsey (presenter)|Paul Dempsey]] played for one season in 1982/83 before taking up a job with the [[BBC]]. [[David Norman (soccer)|Dave Norman]] played senior international football for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] while at UCD and went on to play in the [[Football World Cup 1986|1986 World Cup]], and many players have received youth caps. Contrary to popular belief, however, there is no evidence that Brazilian star [[SÃ³crates]] ever played for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Futebol- Ask Alex|work = Futebol The Brazilian Way of Life, 6&amp;nbsp;April 2003 | url = http://www.ofutebol.com/AskAlex.aspx?month=April&amp;year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan culture==
UCD has a small fanbase, which included until his untimely death the [[Father Ted]] actor [[Dermot Morgan]], an occasional visitor to Belfield. When asked why he attended UCD matches, Dermot reportedly replied &quot;Because I hate crowds&quot;.
The unofficial club fanzine is ''[[STIG (fanzine)|Student Till I Graduate]]''. It has published more issues than any other in the history of the LOI, currently 74 (end 2008).
