==Crime, trial and conviction==
In 1996 while Letourneau was a Des Moines, Washington elementary school teacher, her relationship with 13-year-old student Vili Fualaau transformed from friendship into flirtation and sex.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spi-SO&quot;/&gt;  Letourneau was arrested in March 1997 after her husband, Steve Letourneau, notified the police.&lt;ref name = &quot;People&quot;/&gt;

During the trial she was examined and diagnosed with manic depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;/&gt;  Letourneau pled guilty and was convicted of two counts of second-degree child rape.  She was sentenced to six months in the county jail and three years of treatment.{{Clarify|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;heinonline1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jle35&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time she was not required to register as a sex offender.&lt;ref name=&quot;heinonline1&quot;/&gt;  As part of her plea bargain, Letourneau agreed to avoid any further contact with Fualaau.&lt;ref name=&quot;heinonline1&quot;/&gt;

Two weeks&lt;ref name=&quot;heinonline1&quot;/&gt; (or one month)&lt;ref name = &quot;Spi-SO&quot;/&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} after her release from jail, police found Letourneau while she was having sexual relations with Fualaau in her car. She was arrested for violating the terms of her parole and the police found $6200 in cash and her passport inside her car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spin Magazine, June 1998, p 124&quot;/&gt; As a result, Letourneau was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spin Magazine, June 1998, p 124&quot;/&gt;

In October 1998, while serving her sentence, Letourneau gave birth to her second daughter by Fualaau.&lt;ref name = &quot;People&quot;/&gt; In January, 2001, Letourneau's father died, and she was denied a release from prison to attend his funeral.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spi-MK-Dad&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Mary K.

In 2002, Fualaau's family sued the Highline School District and the city of [[Des Moines, Washington]], for emotional suffering, lost wages, and the costs of rearing his two children, claiming the school and the Des Moines Police Department had failed to protect him from Letourneau.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spi032202&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first = Tracy| last= Johnson| title = Fualaau's suit says he wasn't protected from Letourneau| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/63408_mary22.shtml| work = Local| publisher = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date = March 22, 2002| accessdate = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ten week trial, defense attorneys [[Anne Bremner]], representing the Des Moines Police Department, and Michael Patterson, representing the Highline School District, prevailed and no damages were awarded.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spi052102&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first = Sam| last = Skolnik| title = Schools, police absolved in Fualaau case| url= http://www.seattlepi.com/local/71277_vili21.shtml| work = Local| publisher = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date = May 21, 2002| accessdate = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
