The '''2011â12 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team''' represents [[Boston College]] in the 2011â12 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The team is coached by [[Jerry York]], '67, his eighteenth season behind the bench at Boston College.  The Eagles play their home games at [[Conte Forum|Kelley Rink]] on the campus of Boston College, competing in [[Hockey East]].

Boston College enters the 2011-2012 season as reigning [[2011 Hockey East Men's Ice_Hockey Tournament|Hockey East tournament]] champions, having defeated [[Merrimack Warriors men's ice hockey|Merrimack]] 5-3 in the championship game, as well as defending [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] champions, beating [[Northeastern Huskies men's ice hockey|Northeastern]] in the final 7-6 in overtime.  The Eagles also won the 2010-11 Hockey East regular season championship, their first since 2004-05.

In addition to the annual Beanpot Tournament in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], the Eagles will also be participating in two other in-season tournaments, the Ice Breaker in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks, ND]] and the [[Great Lakes Invitational]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, MI]]. BC won the 2011 Ice Breaker Tournament by defeating [[Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey|Michigan State]] 5-2 in the first round, and then beating [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey|North Dakota]] in the championship game, 6-2.
