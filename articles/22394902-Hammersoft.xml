The '''George R. Brown School of Engineering''' is an academic school at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. It contains the departments of [[Bioengineering]], [[Chemical Engineering and Biomolecular Engineering]], [[Civil Engineering|Civil]] and [[Environmental Engineering|Environmental]] Engineering, Computational and [[Applied Mathematics]], [[Computer Science]], [[Electrical|Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]] and [[Materials Science]], and [[Statistics]]. Engineering has been part of Rice's curriculum since the university's founding in 1912, but the school was not established as its own unit until 1975.

==History==
[[image:Duncanhall.JPG|thumb|left|Duncan Hall, home of the Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Statistics departments]]

In its earliest days, Rice offered courses in chemical, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. Over the years, the engineering program grew, and in 1975 the George R. Brown School of Engineering was established. Presently, the school comprises eight academic departments and includes fourteen research institutes and centers. More than one fourth of Rice students are engineering majors.

==Teaching==

Among the more than 100 engineering faculty are six members of the National Academy of Engineering. Virtually all undergraduate courses in engineering are taught by Ph.D. faculty. Students work closely with professors, often working in labs and research projects. Departments and centers within the school of engineering take advantage of Houston's role as a center for the energy industry, medical research, space exploration, and the city's rapidly growing high-technology sector. Several departments have active industrial affiliates programs, and many research projects are undertaken with local companies. Students benefit from these relationships through collaborative research projects, summer internships, and making contacts for employment before graduation.
