The '''[[Singapore]] national youth [[soccer|football]] team''' is a team with two departments: the Under-16s, the team that represented the nation in the inaugural [[Youth Olympic Games]] and the Lion City Cup, and the Under-15s, which also represented the nation in the Lion City Cup, and also the AFF U16 Championship.  The youth team's honours include bronze for the YOG, second and third places for the Lion City Cup (the former being the U16s and the latter being the U15s). The team is also one of the favourites in Singapore [[sport]] as of 2011.

==Background==
===Breakthrough===
For many, the YOG team of Singapore seemed to be one of the best national sides representing [[Singapore]], and so many Singaporeans were disappointed when they lost the semi-final 2â0 to a later much-hated-by-Singaporeans [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] youth team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/mensyoutholympic/matches/round=255457/match=300131868/report.html Boys' Youth Olympic Football Tournament Singapore 2010: Singapore 0:2 (0:1) Haiti â Report]. FIFA.com. Retrieved on 2011-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The team, coached by Kadir Yahaya, who later would receive a lot of stress coming to a post-Olympic mental block. When the team beat Montenegro in the Bronze Medal match, Singapore fans concluded that the cubs were the best of all Singapore sides since the 1994 Malaysia Cup team. The team went back to school following the match, and were regarded as 'national heroes'.

===Lion City Cup===
In 2011, when [[Football Association of Singapore|Singapore]] revived the Lion City Cup, another team emerged from the shadows â the Under-15 team. The YOG side, though skipper Lightfoot was absent, played under a new coach: [[Takuma Koga]]. They grabbed second and third places (U16s â 2nd; U15s â 3rd), beating the youth sides (U15) of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Everton FC|Everton]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lioncitycup.com/ Lion City Cup]. Lion City Cup. Retrieved on 2011-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Lightfoot of the U16s was called up, but he injured himself and coach [[Takuma Koga]] and the [[Football Association of Singapore|FAS]] ruled him out for the whole campaign, leaving Dhukhilan Jeevamani to stand in as captain, and Illyas Lee playing second fiddle to Jeevamani.

==The years==
===Youth Olympics â The Road To Bronze (2010)===
2010 marked the breakthrough of the Cubs as they went through the Youth Olympic Games, held in their own home, comfortably. They managed to get through the semi-finals before succumbing to a defeat against underdogs [[Haiti]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://redsports.sg/2010/08/23/singapore-haiti-youth-olympic-football-2/ Youth Olympic Football: One step too far for Singapore as Haiti steal 2â0 win Â« Red Sports. Always Game]. Redsports.sg. Retrieved on 2011-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt; who eventually lost the final and got second. Singapore then beat Montenegro 4â1 to grab third place, bronze.

This match involved a lot of controversy,  with a few Montenegro players accused of diving. Drawn 1â1, Singapore came back and eventually won the match 4â1.

===Lion City Cup: Under-16s journey (2011)===
As Under-16s, the ones who wholeheartedly fought for the bronze at the Youth Olympics, a lot was expected from them in the Lion City Cup. Though captain Jeffrey Lightfoot was absent with an injury, they managed to pull through to get '''first runners-up''' for the competition under temporary captain Dhukhilan Jeevamani.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Jasmond.

The semi-final between the youth team and Juventus U15 was an exciting match, with man of the match Hazim Hassan scoring 2 goals in the first half, and Juventus coming back with another 2 in the second. The penalty shootout, though, was plagued with controversy, as the referee made Jonathan Tan retake his penalty, allowing Singapore to score (Jonathan missed the first one). At the end of the match, Juventus players haunted the referee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redsports.sg/2011/06/25/lion-city-cup-football-singaporeu16s-juventusu15s/ Lion City Cup Football: Singapore U16s beat Juventus in semi-final penalty shootout drama Â« Red Sports.

Fashah Rosedin, or Fashah Iskandar (whichever you want to call him) was the most outstanding player that night against Flamengo. Sadly, Caio Rangel and his other Samba football fellows proved to be better, bringing the game to penalties where they won.

===Lion City Cup: Under-15s journey (2011)===
The hot-new product, the team that graduated from a U14 group in the Singapore National Football Academy to the very team included in a project for the future of Singapore football, the U15s were one of the favourites to make sure that the cup stayed in Singapore. Their journey was unsuccessful, grabbing only '''third''', losing to Flamengo U15 in the semi-finals and toppling Juventus U15 4â0, a record biggest win, not to be broken until the U15s went against Vietnam in July during the AFF U16 Youth Championship, where they won 5â0.

Their very first group game, up against Newcastle United's U15 batch, could ''arguably'' be one of the most exciting matches ever in [[Singapore]] football. Down 3â1, Singapore used just nine minutes to score 3 back, and eventually win 4â3.

The Singapore U15s navigated past the group stage, leaving Newcastle U15 behind, and reaching to a clash with competition favourites Flamengo. Eventually, they were outclassed in terms of skills and goals, and their misery was ended with a 3â0 loss, recorded as the biggest loss the Singapore youth/teen team (U14-16) ever had, breaking the 2â0 record loss to [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]].

This match, along with the Singapore U16 semi-final with the same Italian opponents, brought controversy as Juventus were victims to both refereeing mistakes, or bias. The two matches have led to the [[Football Association of Singapore|FAS]] to declare that next year's Lion City Cup will switch â foreign referees for Singapore matches and vice-versa. This match set the record, the biggest win the Singapore youth team has had, but was broken by a 5â0 win over Vietnam, also won by this very Singapore U15 team.

===The AFF U-16 Championship (2011)===
The U15 team, captained by Adam Swandi, took part in the AFF U-16 Championship, and got fourth place. During their trip their they broke the record 4â0 win, winning 5â0 against both Vietnam and the Philippines.

The team was managed by Dejan Gluscveic, and during their time there, they won 3 matches and lost 3 matches, losing both the semi-finals and the third place play-offs. The Championship also brought out 5 goals from captain and midfielder Adam Swandi, who scored 5 goals, against Vietnam, the first goal since his very first international goal (against Juventus), the Philippines and Myanmar â these 5 and the goal against Juventus U15 made him the youth team's (U16 combined) top scorer, ahead of Muhaimin Suhaimi of the U16s.
