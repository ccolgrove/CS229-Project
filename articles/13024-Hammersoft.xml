'''Graham Arthur Chapman''' (8 January 1941 â 4 October 1989) was a British comedian, physician, writer, actor, and one of the six members of the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe.

==Early life and education==
In the introduction to Chapman's (2005/2006) posthumous anthology, Jim Yoakum notes that &quot;the radio shows didn't necessarily make him laugh. Only a select few got chuckles from young Chapman including [[Frankie Howerd]], the team of [[Jimmy Jewel]] and [[Ben Warriss]], ''[[It's That Man Again]]'', ''[[Educating Archie]]'', ''[[Take It From Here]]'' and ''[[Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh]]''. 'I especially liked Robert Morton, although no one else seemed to like him very much. He would do things like tell jokes the wrong way around and switch punch lines. He was obviously a very good comedian and was ahead of his time. The appearance of incompetence was wonderful. He was one of my heroes.' But the show that truly astounded Graham, and was a major influence on his comedy was ''The Goon Show''&quot; (p.xvii). Chapman states &quot;from about the age of seven or eight I used to be an avid listener of a radio programme called ''The Goon Show''. In fact, at that stage I wanted to ''be'' a Goon&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;23).&lt;ref name=&quot;CalciumMadeInteresting&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Chapman | year=2006 | title=Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays &amp; Gondolas | editor=Jim Yoakum | publisher=Pan Books | location=London}} ISBN 978-0-330-43543-7; ISBN 0-330-43543-4. Note: This is the same book as listed in the Bibliography, but a year later by a different publisher.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Before ''Python''===
[[John Cleese]] and Chapman wrote professionally for the [[BBC]] during the 1960s, primarily for [[David Frost]], but also for [[Marty Feldman]]. Chapman also contributed sketches to the BBC radio series ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' and television programmes such as ''[[The Illustrated Weekly Hudd]]'' (starring [[Roy Hudd]]), ''[[Cilla Black]]'', ''[[This is Petula Clark]]'', and ''[[This Is Tom Jones]]''. Chapman, Cleese, and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] then joined Feldman in the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''. Here Chapman displayed a gift for [[deadpan]] comedy (particularly evident in the sketch &quot;[[The Minister Who Falls to Pieces]]&quot;) and for imitating various British [[dialects]]. Chapman, and on occasion Cleese, also wrote for the long-running television comedy series ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]''. Chapman also co-wrote several episodes with [[Bernard McKenna (writer)|Bernard McKenna]] and [[David Sherlock]].

===Monty Python===
{{Main|Monty Python}}
In 1969 Chapman and Cleese joined [[Michael Palin]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Eric Idle]], and American artist and animator [[Terry Gilliam]] for the BBC television comedy series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. He most often played characters with personalities close to his own: outwardly calm and authoritative figures barely concealing a manic unpredictability.

In David Morgan's 1999 book ''Monty Python Speaks'', Cleese asserted that Chapman â although officially his co-writer for many of their sketches â contributed comparatively little in the way of direct writing. Rather, the Pythons have said that his biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition as to what was funny. John Cleese said in an interview that one of Chapman's great attributes was &quot;his weird takes on things.&quot; In writing sessions Chapman &quot;would lob in an idea or a line from out of left field into the engine room, but he could never be the engine&quot;, Cleese said. In the ''[[Dead Parrot]]'' sketch, written mostly by Cleese, the frustrated customer was initially trying to return a faulty [[toaster]] to a shop. Chapman would ask &quot;How can we make this ''madder''?&quot;, and then came up with the idea that returning a dead Norwegian Blue [[parrot]] to a pet shop might make a more interesting subject than a toaster.

Chapman played the lead roles in the troupe's only two narrative feature films: ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''. Cleese complimented his writing partner by saying that he was &quot;very possibly the best actor of all of us&quot;.

===Final years===
In the late 1970s, Chapman moved to Los Angeles, where he guest-starred on many U.S. television shows, including ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Still Crazy Like a Fox]]'', and the [[NBC]] sketch series ''[[The Big Show (TV series)|The Big Show]]''. 

Upon returning to England he became involved with the [[Dangerous Sports Club]] (an [[extreme sport]]s club which introduced [[bungee jumping]] to a wide audience). Chapman and [[Douglas Adams]] wrote a pilot for a TV series in 1975, ''[[Out of the Trees]]'', but it never went beyond the initial episode. They also wrote an unmade show for [[Ringo Starr]]. Chapman mentored Adams, but they later had a falling out and did not speak for several years.

In 1978 Chapman co-wrote (with Bernard McKenna) and starred in ''[[The Odd Job]]'' alongside [[David Jason]] who had previously appeared on ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' with the pre-Python Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle. The film was only moderately successful.

His memoir, ''[[A Liar's Autobiography]]'', was published in 1980 and, unusually for a work of this type, had five authors: Chapman, his partner [[David Sherlock]], [[Alex Martin]], [[David Yallop]] and Douglas Adams. 

Although writing had begun in the late seventies, by 1982 Chapman was finally able to secure funding for his much cherished pirate project ''[[Yellowbeard]]''. Once again Chapman collaborated with writer Bernard McKenna and for the first time with [[Peter Cook]]. The film which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate also featured appearances from Peter Cook, [[Marty Feldman]], John Cleese, Eric Idle, [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Cheech &amp; Chong]]. The film marks the last appearance of Feldman who suffered a fatal heart attack during shooting. The movie was released in 1983 to mixed reviews. In a 2001 interview, Cleese described ''Yellowbeard'' as &quot;one of the six worst films made in the history of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;2001 interview included as an extra on the  release of the John Cleese movie ''Clockwise.''&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Idle also later dismissed the film although remembered his participation fondly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19991006/ai_n14278222 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reuniting with the Pythons in 1983 for ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', Chapman began a lengthy series of U.S. college tours where he would tell the audience anecdotes about Monty Python, the Dangerous Sports Club, [[Keith Moon]], and other subjects. In 1988, he appeared in the [[Iron Maiden]] video, ''[[Can I Play with Madness]]''. His last project was to have been a TV series called ''[[Jake's Journey]]''. Although the pilot episode was made, there were difficulties selling the project. Chapman was also to have played a guest role as a television presenter in the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' episode &quot;Timeslides&quot;, but died before filming was to have started.

In the years since Chapman's death, despite the existence of the &quot;Graham Chapman Archive&quot;, only a few of his projects have been released. One of these projects is a play entitled ''O Happy Day'', brought to life in 2000 by [[Dad's Garage Theatre Company]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Cleese and Palin assisted the theatre company in adapting the play.

==Personal life==
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2010}}
Chapman was a tall (6'2&quot;/1.88 m), craggy pipe-smoker who enjoyed mountaineering and playing [[rugby football|rugby]].

Chapman was an alcoholic from his time in [[medical school]]. His fellow Pythons noted he felt he needed a drink or two to &quot;face the world&quot; and at times would forget in the afternoon material that had been written the same day. His drinking also affected his performance on the TV recording set as well as on the set of ''Holy Grail'', where he suffered from [[withdrawal]] symptoms including [[delirium tremens]]. He stopped drinking on [[Boxing Day]] 1977, having just irritated the other Pythons with an outspoken (and drunken) interview with the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]''. Before going [[sobriety|sober]], Chapman jokingly referred to himself as the British actress [[Betty Marsden]], possibly because of Marsden's oft-quoted desire to die with a glass of [[gin]] in her hand. John Cleese used Marsden's name in his eulogy at Chapman's memorial service.

Chapman kept his [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] a [[closeted|secret]] until the 1970s, although he did allude to it in some Monty Python sketches. He publicly [[coming out|came out]] as homosexual on a chat show hosted by British [[jazz]] musician [[George Melly]], becoming one of the first celebrities to do so. Several days later, he came out to a group of friends at a party held at his home in [[Belsize Park]], where he officially introduced them to his boyfriend, [[David Sherlock]], whom he had met in [[Ibiza]] in 1966. Chapman later told a story in his college tour that when he went public, a member of the television audience wrote to the Pythons to complain that she had heard a member of the team was gay, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and [[stoning|stoned]]. With fellow Pythons already [[Coming out|aware]] of his [[sexual orientation]], [[Eric Idle]] replied, &quot;We've found out who it was and we've had him shot.&quot; In his book ''[[Graham Crackers: Fuzzy Memories, Silly Bits, and Outright Lies|Graham Crackers]]'', Chapman said that this took place just before [[John Cleese]] left the show, and he wondered what the woman thought about his disappearance after getting Idle's response.

Chapman was a vocal spokesman for [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]], and in 1972 he lent his support to the fledgling newspaper ''[[Gay News]]'', which publicly acknowledged his financial and editorial support by listing him as one of its &quot;special friends&quot;. In 1971, Chapman and Sherlock [[gay adoption|adopted]] John Tomiczek as their son. Chapman met Tomiczek when the teenager was a runaway from [[Liverpool]]. After discussions with Tomiczek's father, it was agreed that Chapman would become Tomiczek's legal guardian, and Tomiczek later became Chapman's business manager. Tomiczek died of a heart attack in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A687954 ''Graham Chapman â Comedy Writer and Actor''] BBC, www.BBC.co.uk, 29 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Chapman's closest friends were [[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]], singer [[Harry Nilsson]], and [[The Beatles]]' [[Ringo Starr]].

==Death and funeral==
Chapman died on 4 October 1989 after suffering from throat (specifically tonsil) cancer and secondary spinal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3093564.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Monty Python reunion 'unlikely' | date=9 September 2003 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had several chemotherapy treatments and tumour removal surgeries within the final months of his life, and at one point he used a wheelchair. By September 1989 his cancer was declared [[terminal illness|terminal]]. He produced scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'' that month, the last time he would appear on television, but he became ill again on 1 October. Those present at the time of Chapman's death in a Maidstone hospital included his brother, sister-in-law, husband [[David Sherlock]], and his former ''Python'' fellows [[John Cleese]] and [[Michael Palin]], who had to be led out of the room to deal with their [[grief]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Pythons Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Jones]] and [[Peter Cook]] had visited earlier that day. Chapman's death occurred on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', and Jones called it &quot;the worst case of party-pooping in all history&quot;.

The five surviving Python members decided to stay away from Chapman's private funeral, to prevent its becoming a [[media circus]] and to give his family some privacy. They sent a wreath in the shape of the famous Python foot with the message &quot;To Graham from the other Pythons. Stop us if we're getting too silly.&quot; They held a private memorial service in [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in London on the evening of 6 December 1989, with a chorus of the Chinese version of the hymn &quot;[[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]]&quot; (&quot;â¦ Bling me my speal, oh crowds unford, bling me my chaliot of fileâ¦&quot;). Cleese delivered his eulogy to Chapman, which began as follows:

{{cquote|Graham Chapman, co-author of the &quot;[[Dead Parrot|Parrot Sketch]]&quot;, is no more. He has ceased to be. Bereft of life, he rests in peace. He's kicked the bucket, hopped the twig, bit the dust, snuffed it, breathed his last, and gone to meet the great Head of Light Entertainment in the sky. And I guess that we're all thinking how sad it is that a man of such talent, of such capability for kindness, of such unusual intelligence, should now so suddenly be spirited away at the age of only forty-eight, before he'd achieved many of the things of which he was capable, and before he'd had enough fun.

Well, I feel that I should say: nonsense. Good riddance to him, the freeloading bastard, I hope he fries. And the reason I feel I should say this is he would never forgive me if I didn't, if I threw away this glorious opportunity to shock you all on his behalf. Anything for him but mindless good taste. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHk9WC7fnQ | title=Graham Chapman's funeral | medium=Video | format=.SWF |date=1989 | people=John Cleese, Eric Idle | location=London, England | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=20 January 2007}} ([http://www.eulogyspeech.net/famous-eulogies/Graham-Chapman-Memorial-Speech-by-John-Cleese.shtml transcript])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}Cleese continued after a break from laughter in the audience, claiming that Chapman had whispered in his ear the night before while he was writing the speech, saying:

{{cquote|All right, Cleese. You say you're very proud of being the very first person ever to say 'shit' on British television. If this service is really for me, just for starters, I want you to become the first person ever at a British memorial service to say 'fuck'.}}

Palin then spoke, saying that he liked to think that Chapman was there with them all that dayâ&quot;or rather, he will be in about 25 minutes,&quot; a reference to Chapman's habitual lateness when they were all working together. Idle, choking back tears, stated that Chapman had thought that Palin talked too much and had died rather than listen to him any more. He also led other surviving ''Python'' members along with Chapman's family and close friends in a rendition of &quot;[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]&quot; from the film ''Life of Brian''. Not to be outdone by Cleese, Idle was heard saying during the song's close: &quot;I'd just like to be the last person at this meeting to say 'fuck'. Thank you very much. God bless you, Graham.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHk9WC7fnQ |title=Video:Graham Chapman's Funeral |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1999, Chapman's ashes were rumoured to have been &quot;[[space burial|blasted into the skies in a rocket]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/590559.stm | title=Python star Chapman's flying ashes |work=BBC News  | date=4 January 2000 | accessdate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/chapman_in_space_000103.html | title=Monty Python Member's Ashes Missing; Rocket Blamed | work=Space.com | date=3 January 2000| accessdate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, however, Sherlock scattered Chapman's ashes on [[Snowdon]], [[North Wales]] on 18 June 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;ashes&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=BBC Comedy Map Of Great Britain |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/apps/ifl/comedymap/queryengine?attrib_1=episode_number&amp;oper_1=eq&amp;val_1_1=3&amp;Send=Search&amp;current_section=series1&amp;heading=Wales%20to%20Birmingham |accessdate=15 September 2006 |date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Chapman's death, speculation of a Python revival inevitably faded. Idle stated: &quot;We would only do a reunion if Chapman came back from the dead. So we're negotiating with his agent.&quot; Subsequent gatherings of the Pythons have included an urn said to contain Chapman's [[cremation|ashes]]. At the 1998 Aspen Comedy Arts festival, the urn was &quot;accidentally&quot; knocked over by [[Terry Gilliam]], spilling the &quot;ashes&quot; on-stage. The apparently [[Cremation|cremated]] remains were then removed with a dust-buster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/63795.stm | title=And now for something completely different (and plenty that isn't) |work=BBC News  | date=9 March 1998| accessdate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asteroid [[9617 Grahamchapman]], named in Chapman's honour, is one of six asteroids named after members of the Monty Python comedy troupe.

In 1997, Sherlock allowed Jim Yoakum to start the ''Graham Chapman Archives''. Later that year, the novel ''[[Graham Crackers: Fuzzy Memories, Silly Bits, and Outright Lies]]'' was released. It is a semi-sequel to ''A Liar's Autobiography'', with Chapman works compiled by Yoakum. ''Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman'', a collection of previously unpublished material, was released in 1999. It contains scripts Chapman wrote with Douglas Adams and others, such as &quot;Our show for Ringo Starr, a.k.a. Goodnight Vienna&quot;. In 2005 ''Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays &amp; Gondolas'' was published. At one time, the script for &quot;Out of the Trees&quot;, written by Chapman and Adams in 1975 (and later extensively rewritten by Chapman with Bernard McKenna), was online. Jim Yoakum had it removed, to the disappointment of co-writer Adams, who had made no objections to it being there.

Recordings of Graham Chapman's college tours in the 1980s have been released over the years. The CD ''A Liar Live'' was delayed several times, but was released as ''A Six Pack of Lies'' in 1997. Other college tours also came out on CD, such as ''Spot the Loony'' in 2001. A DVD of the tours (''[[Looks Like a Brown Trouser Job]]'') was released in 2005. The single episodes for &quot;Out of the Trees&quot;, which was wiped but later recovered on an early home video system, and &quot;Jake's Journey&quot; still have not been released. In 2004, there was talk of a movie about Chapman's life, to be called ''Gin and Tonic'', by Hippofilms in cooperation with Jim Yoakum. Auditions were held in March 2004 in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailyllama.com/news/2004/llama227.html | title = Daily Llama â NEWS 2004_02_06 â Worldwide Open Auditions Being Held to Play Young Monty Pythons in Graham Chapman Biography Film: | accessdate =18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project has been officially abandoned. Its website is no longer online and the [[Internet Movie Database]] page has been deleted; the Graham Chapman Archive's website has disappeared as well.

In June 2011 it was announced that most of the surviving members of the Monty Python ensemble will perform in a [[3-D film|3-D]] [[animation|animated]] version of Chapman's memoir ''A Liarâs Autobiography: Volume VI''. The voices of John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones will be spliced into commentary recorded by Chapman reading from his memoir and taped shortly before his death. The film is expected to be released in 2012 with a running time of approximately 85 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This May Be Something Completely Different|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/movies/graham-chapman-tribute-from-monty-python.html?ref=arts|author=|last=Cieply|first=Michael|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
