'''TortoiseCVS''' is a [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] client for [[Microsoft Windows]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Unlike most CVS tools, it includes itself in Windows' [[Operating system shell|shell]] by adding entries in the [[contextual menu]] of the file explorer, therefore it does not run in its own [[Window (computing)|window]]. Moreover, it adds [[Icon (computing)|icons]] onto files and directories controlled by CVS, giving additional information to the user without having to run a full-scale stand-alone application.

The name is a pun on the word [[Shell (computing)|shell]]. The [[tortoise]] in the logo is called Charlie Vernon Smythe (CVS).

The project was started by [[Francis Irving]] when he was employed by [[Creature Labs]] to provide a better interface to CVS for his colleagues.  Some of the code was derived from [[WinCVS]] and [[CVSNT]].  The first release was 4 August 2000.[http://www.tortoisecvs.org/stablechangelog.shtml]
