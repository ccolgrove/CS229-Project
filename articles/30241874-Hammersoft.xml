'''Ankole sub-region''' is a region in [[Western Region, Uganda|Western Uganda]] that consists of the following districts:

* [[Buhweju District]]
* [[Bushenyi District]]
* [[Ibanda District]]
* [[Isingiro District]]
* [[Kiruhura District]]
* [[Mitooma District]]
* [[Ntungamo District]]
* [[Rubirizi District]]
* [[Sheema District]]

The area covered by the above districts constituted the traditional [[Ankole|Ankole Kingdom]]. [[Milton Obote]] abolished the traditional kingdoms in Uganda in 1967. When [[Yoweri Museveni]] re-established them in 1993, Ankole did not re-constitute itself.

The sub-region is home mainly to the Ankole ethnic group. The people of Ankole are called '''Banyankole''' (singular: '''Munyankole'''). The Banyankole speak [[Runyankole]], a Bantu language. Runyankole is very similar to [[Rukiga]], spoken by the people of the neighboring [[Kigezi|Kigezi sub-region]]. According to the 2002 national census, the Ankole sub-region was home to an estimated 2.2 million people at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Districts of Uganda|Estimated Population of Ankole Sub-region In 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;
