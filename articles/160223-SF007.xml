'''Media player''' is a term typically used to describe [[computer software]] for playing back [[multimedia]] [[computer file|files]].  While many media players can play both [[digital audio|audio]] and [[digital video|video]], others focus only on one media type or the other.  Such players are known as either [[audio player (software)|audio players]] or [[video player (software)|video players]] and often have a [[user interface]] tailored for the specific media type.

Media players often display icons known from physical devices such as [[Tape recorder|tape recorders]] and [[Compact Disc player|CD players]].  Examples of these icons are [[File:Media-playback-start.svg|24px]] (play), [[File:Media-playback-pause.svg|24px]] (pause), and [[File:Media-playback-stop.svg|24px]] (stop).
