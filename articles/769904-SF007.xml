'''JÃ³zsef Antall''' (8 April 1932 â 12 December 1993) was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary#Republic of Hungary (1989âPresent)|first]] democratically-elected [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] after the fall of Communism (from 23 May 1990 until 12 December 1993, his death), [[teacher]], [[librarian]], [[historian]] and [[political figure]]. He was the leader of the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] between 1989 and 1993.

==Family==
JÃ³zsef Antall was born to an ancient Hungarian family from the lower nobility. His father, JÃ³zsef Antall Sr. [[jurist]] and [[civil servant]], worked for the government in several ministries. Antall, Sr. coordinated the first [[living wage]] calculations in Hungary, and he was a founding member of the [[Independent Smallholders' Party]] (1931)). During [[World War II]], he presided the government committee for refugees. After the German occupation of Hungary he resigned, later he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]]. After the war, he became Minister of Reconstruction in the government of [[ZoltÃ¡n Tildy]]. Later, he became president of the Hungarian [[Red Cross]], but after the communist coup he resigned and retired to his family estate. In 1991, he was posthumously honoured by [[Yad Vashem]].

His mother, IrÃ©n SzÅ±cs, was the daughter of a village teacher. Her father, IstvÃ¡n SzÅ±cs, also became a political figure as a deputy Secretary of State.

JÃ³zsef Antall had a sister, Edith Antall. His brother-in-law, [[GÃ©za Jeszenszky]] later became Minister of Foreign Affairs. Antall and his wife, KlÃ¡ra FÃ¼lepp, had two children, GyÃ¶rgy Antall, a lawyer, and PÃ©ter Antall, a photojournalist.

==Education==
He graduated from the Budapest [[Piarist]] High School in 1950. He was interested in politics early on, but (quite understandably) didn't pursue his political career during the communist regime of the 1950s. After graduating from high school, he studied [[Hungarian language]] and [[Hungarian literature|literature]] at the [[EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University]] as well as [[history]] and [[archival science]]. He wrote his thesis about the politics of [[JÃ³zsef EÃ¶tvÃ¶s]], obtaining degrees in [[teaching]], [[library science]] and [[museology]]. On September 30, 1991, Antall was awarded an [[Commencement at CCSU|honorary doctoral degree from Central Connecticut State University]].

==Career until the prime ministership==
After graduating from the university, he worked for the Hungarian State Archives and the Research Institute of Pedagogy. In 1955, he started teaching in JÃ³zsef EÃ¶tvÃ¶s Grammar School, leading the Revolutionary Committee of the school during the [[1956 Hungarian Uprising]]. During the revolution, he participated in the reorganization of the Independent Smallholders Party and in the founding of the Christian Youth Alliance. After the [[Soviet Union]] crushed the revolution, he was arrested and released several times. He continued his teaching career in Ferenc Toldy Grammar School in 1957, but in 1959 he was banned from teaching due to his former political activities.

Following this, he worked as a librarian for two years. In 1963 he wrote biographies of 80 doctors for the Lexicon of Hungarian Biographies. He became interested in the [[history of medicine]], and conducted fundamental research in the area. He started working in the library and archives department of the [[Semmelweis]] Museum, dedicated to the history of medicine. Starting as a research fellow, he was promoted to deputy director and in 1974 he became director of the institute.

His research was recognised internationally, and in 1986 he was the vice president of the International Society for History of Medicine.

==Return to politics, term as Prime Minister==
He was delegated to the National Roundtable Talks by the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] on 22 March 1989 and worked in the committee on constitutional reform. He became well known for his activities during the negotiations.

On 21 October 1989 he was elected President of the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] by an overwhelming majority, thus becoming the party's official candidate for prime minister. MDF won the elections in 1990 and on 23 May he became the first freely elected Prime Minister of Hungary since 1945. As prime minister, Antall oversaw the establishment of a legal system to promote a market economy and attract foreign investment. The ruling coalition attempted to stabilize the economy while implementing privatization and other elements of a market economy, while the populist right wing of the MDF was vocal about the ânational issueââthe question of the Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countriesâand attempted to put it at the centre of the government's platform.

However, the return to a capitalist system and all its accompanying reforms exposed the precarious state of Hungary's state-run economy, which resulted in socioeconomic difficulties for the country during Antall's term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jozsef Antall - MSN Encarta &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=762504754|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kws9FgIW|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment jumped from nonexistence to 14 percent. Inflation increased at an annual rate of 23â35 percent (excluding indexing of wages and pensions). Older, retired people, more than one-fifth of the population, suffered the most, and the living standards of more than one-third of the populace declined to below subsistence level. In the meantime, income disparities increased, which irritated the people. Corruption became more widespread{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and visible than before. Together with the previously omnipotent police force, street security also collapsed in 1990. The crime rate, especially in Budapest, increased threefold in five years.

In the summer of 1990, Antall and the MDF supported the introduction of a Catholic religious education into the national curriculum. This led to conflict with the other coalition parties, since only three-quarters of the Hungarian population were Catholics. By 1991 Antall was receiving criticism for his authoritarian style, though this contrasted with his uncharismatic presence. Conflict over their powers erupted between him and Hungary's President, [[ÃrpÃ¡d GÃ¶ncz]], who belonged to the opposing party, the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/j-zsef-antall&lt;/ref&gt;

Antall became ill with [[cancer]] and died on 12 December 1993, before the end of his 4-year term.

In recognition of his work, one of the [[Espace LÃ©opold|buildings of the European Parliament in Brussels]] was named after him in 2008.
