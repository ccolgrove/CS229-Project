'''Colton A.''' &quot;'''Colt'''&quot; '''Harris-Moore''' (born March 22, 1991) is a criminal and former fugitive from [[Camano Island, Washington]].  He was charged with the thefts of small aircraft, a boat, and two cars and in the burglaries of at least 100 private residences in various locations around the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States and Canada. He fled to the [[Bahamas]] on July 4, 2010, allegedly in a plane stolen from Bloomington, [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-20100706-falcon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Falcon|first=Gabriel|title='Barefoot bandit' faces indictment|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/06/barefoot.bandit.plane.theft/|accessdate=July 7, 2010|publisher=CNN|date=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[indictment|indicted]] on July 6, 2010, by a [[United States Federal Court|U.S. Federal Court]]  in [[Seattle, Washington]], on charges of transporting another stolen aircraft in that state. Harris-Moore was arrested in [[Harbour Island, Bahamas]], on July 11, 2010, after police shot out the engine of the boat in which he was attempting to flee.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC-20100713&quot; /&gt; Two days later, he was [[deportation|deported]] from [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to [[Miami, Florida]], and transferred on July 21 to the [[Federal Detention Center, SeaTac]] in Washington State.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q13FOX-20100721-Seattle&quot; /&gt; On June 17, 2011 Harris-Moore pled guilty to seven felony charges against him, and was scheduled to be sentenced in October, but then the sentencing hearing was delayed to December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Alyssa|title=Harris-Moore pleads guilty to stealing aircraft, more|url=http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2011/110617harris_moore_pleads_guilty_to_aircraft_theft_more.html|publisher=AOPA|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He became known as the &quot;'''Barefoot Bandit'''&quot; by reportedly committing some of his crimes [[barefoot]], once leaving behind 39 chalk footprints and the word &quot;c'ya!&quot;. Despite the widely-reported nickname, officials said that he more often wore shoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald-20100712&quot; /&gt;

== Background ==
Harris-Moore grew up in his mother's house in [[Camano Island, Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brooks-feb07&quot;/&gt; Neighbors said they made several calls to [[Child Protective Services]], believing he was [[child neglect|neglected]] or [[child abuse|abused]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brooks-feb07&quot;/&gt; His father, Gordon Moore, used drugs and was in prison while Colton was a toddler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald-20100712&quot; /&gt; When Colton was twelve years old, his abusive father walked out after attempting to choke him during an argument at a family barbecue.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGirk_Tim&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=McGirk|first=Tim|title=America's Most Wanted Teenage Bandit|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1946950,00.html|accessdate=July 2, 2010|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-20100722-troubled&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppmann|first=Patrick|title=Court records reveal barefoot bandit's troubled childhood|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/22/barefoot.bandit.profile/|accessdate=July 22, 2010|publisher=CNN|date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his mother, Pamela Kohler, his stepfather died when he was about seven years old, and from the time Colton was in the first grade, she knew there was &quot;something off about him&quot; &amp;ndash;  &quot;sort of a disconnection&quot;.

Harris-Moore is suspected of being responsible for approximately 100 thefts in Washington, Idaho, and Canada, including bicycles, automobiles, [[light aircraft]], and [[speedboat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGirk_Tim&quot;/&gt;  It is believed that he learned how to fly small planes by reading aircraft manuals, handbooks, watching a &quot;''How to fly a small airplane''&quot; DVD, and playing [[flight simulator]] computer games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunday_Times_2009&quot;/&gt; One plane he stole was a [[Cessna 182]] belonging to [[KZOK-FM]] [[disc jockey|radio personality]] [[Bob Rivers]], valued at US$150,000. The plane was later recovered from the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]], though it was so badly damaged that it was a total loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevick_Eric&quot;/&gt;  According to local sheriffs, he would often slip into a home just to soak in a hot bath or steal ice cream from the freezer. Initially, he would steal only what he needed for living in the woods as a [[Survival skills|survivalist]]. Once, he allegedly used a homeowner's computer and credit card to order [[Mace (spray)|bear mace]] and a pair of US$6,500 [[night vision goggles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGirk_Tim&quot;/&gt;

On May 30 or 31, 2010, police found a handwritten note and US$100 at a veterinary clinic in [[Raymond, Washington]], approximately {{convert|95|mi|km|sigfig=2}} southwest of Seattle. The note read:&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRO-TV&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Barefoot Bandit' Leaves Note, $100 At Raymond Vet Clinic|url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/23939095/detail.html|accessdate=July 3, 2010|publisher=[[KIRO-TV]]|date=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trail of suspected thefts attributed to him passes through Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. Police found a 2008 white [[Toyota Sequoia]] in [[Norfolk, Nebraska]], which was reported stolen in [[Yankton, South Dakota]].

He is scheduled to appear December 16, 2011 at the [[Island County, Washington|Island County]] courthouse in [[Coupeville, Washington]] regarding non-federal crimes he allegedly committed.  It is expected that he will plead guilty to approximately 30 charges including burglary; the charges were combined from Island, [[Snohomish County (Washington)|Snohomish]], and [[San Juan County (Washington)|San Juan]] counties in the state of Washington.  For the federal crimes, it is expected that Harris-Moore will receive a sentence of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goskagit.com/news/local_news/article_cad788b0-1c5c-11e1-b1c7-001871e3ce6c.html Skagit Valley Herald ''Federal Barefoot Bandit sentencing set for Jan. 27'']&lt;/ref&gt;
