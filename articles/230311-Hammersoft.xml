The '''University of California, Riverside''', commonly known as '''UCR''' or '''UC Riverside''', is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] and one of the ten general campuses of the [[University of California]] system. UCR is consistently ranked as one of the most ethnically and economically diverse universities in the United States.&lt;ref name= &quot;ethnic diversity&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Ethnic Diversity: National Universities | url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/natudoc_campdiv_brief.php | work=[[US News and World Report]] | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;economic diversity&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities | url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/natudoc_ecodiv_brief.php | work=[[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main campus sits on {{convert|1200|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in a suburban district of {{USCity|Riverside|California}}, [[United States]], with a branch campus of {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]]. Founded in 1907 as the [[UC Citrus Experiment Station]], Riverside pioneered research in [[biological pest control]] and the use of [[plant hormone|growth regulators]] responsible for extending the [[citrus]] growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on [[University of California, Riverside Citrus Variety Collection|citrus diversity]] and [[Entomology Research Museum|entomology]], as well as [[Eaton collection|science fiction]] and [[UCR/California Museum of Photography|photography]], are located at Riverside.

UCR's undergraduate [[UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|College of Letters and Science]] opened in 1954. The [[Regents of the University of California]] declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000&amp;nbsp;students by 2015, more than $730&amp;nbsp;million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCR factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=UCR Factsheet | url=http://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside | accessdate=2007-08-22| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070820032842/http://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html| archivedate = August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCRFacts2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=UCR Facts and Impacts 2007| url=http://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside |accessdate= 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans are underway to open California's first new research-based public [[medical school]] in 40 years there by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Mangan | first= Katherine | title=A Growth Spurt for Medical Schools| url=http://www.inthenews.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=13555 | journal= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=2007-01-08 | accessdate = 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 ''[[US News and World Report]]'' ranks UCR 44th among top public universities, 97th nationwide (out of 368 colleges) and has 16+ programs earning &quot;best grad school&quot; including the Graduate School of Education and the [[Bourns College of Engineering]] based on peer assessment, student selectivity, financial resources, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-riverside-110671/overall-rankings&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'' ranked UCR 5th in the United States in terms of social mobility, research and community service,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Washington Monthly College Rankings 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=The Washington Monthly College Rankings 2011 | url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings/national_university_rank.php | work= [[The Washington Monthly]] | accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''U.S. News'' ranks UCR as the fifth most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving [[Pell Grant]]s (42&amp;nbsp;percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnic diversity&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;economic diversity&quot;/&gt; Nearly two-thirds of all UCR students graduate within six years without regard to economic disparity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hebel&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last= Hebel | first= Sara | title= In California, a Public Research University Succeeds Because Its Low-Income Students Do | date= 2007-03-19 | work= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | url= http://www.inthenews.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=14037 | accessdate= 2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCR's extensive outreach and retention programs have contributed to its reputation as a &quot;campus of choice&quot; for minority students, including [[LGBT]] students.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT011507&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last= Paddock | first= Richard C. | url=http://www.inthenews.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=13592 | title=For many minorities, UC Riverside is the campus of choice | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date= 2007-01-15 | accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, UCR became the first public university campus in the nation to offer a gender-neutral housing option.&lt;ref name=&quot;LGBT ranking&quot;&gt;

UCR's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the [[Big West Conference]] of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]].  Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of [[Box Springs Mountain]]. The UCR women's basketball team won back to back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the men's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001.

[[Image:A Gary Anderson Graduate School of Managment.JPG|thumb|left|The original UC Citrus Experiment Station which now houses the [[A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management]] at the [[UCR School of Business Administration]].]]

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Southern California]] was a major producer of [[citrus]], the region's primary [[export|agricultural export]]. The industry developed from the country's first [[navel orange]] trees, planted in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the [[Regents of the University of California|UC Regents]] established the [[UC Citrus Experiment Station]] (CES) on February 14, 1907, on {{convert|23|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} of land on the east slope of [[Mount Rubidoux]] in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in [[fertilization (soil)|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop (agriculture)|crop]] improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site, {{convert|475|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} near [[Box Springs Mountain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citrus&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Ruther | first = Walter | coauthors= E.

The 1944 passage of the [[Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA)|GI Bill]] during [[World War II]] set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered [[liberal arts college]] next to the CES. State Senator Nelson Dilworth, former Assemblyman Philip L. Boyd and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title=University of California, Riverside Campus Timeline | url=http://www.info.ucr.edu/announce/20020722timeline.html | year=2002 | publisher=UCR News | accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gabbert Oral History transcript | url=http://www.ucrhistory.ucr.edu/pdf/gabbert.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=University of California, Riverside, Oral History Project | date=1998-04-02 |accessdate=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Earl Warren]] signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2&amp;nbsp;million for initial campus construction.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lovekin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lovekin | first=Kris | title= Enjoying Our Past | journal=Fiat Lux | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=14â17 | publisher= University of California, Riverside | month= February | year= 2004 | url=http://www.fiatlux.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=583 | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Campus, occupying approximately {{convert|600|acre|ha|0|sp=us}}, hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the [[UC Citrus Experiment Station]], residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the [[architecture]] of the major buildings followed the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LongRangePlan2005&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Bell Tower, UCR.jpg|thumb|left|110px|The [[Carillon]] [[Bell Tower]] is the dominant landmark in the center of the main campus.]]
Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the [[UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|College of Letters and Science]] (CHASS) in April 1951. A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more [[Modern architecture|Modern]] style were completed by 1954: the Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. After the Regents declared UCR a &quot;general campus&quot; of the UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an eastâwest axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway.&lt;ref name=&quot;LongRangePlan2005&quot; /&gt; The Bell Tower, one of only five [[carillon]]s in California, was built in this period. Designed by [[A. Quincy Jones]], the tower is {{convert|161|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and contains 48&amp;nbsp;bells, each weighing from {{convert|28|lb|kg}} to {{convert|5091|lb|kg}}, covering four&amp;nbsp;chromatic [[octave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= History of the Bell Tower | publisher= UCR Bell Tower Fund | url= http://www.belltower.ucr.edu/subpage.php?content=history.html | accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UCR Belltower night.JPG|thumb|UCR Bell Tower at night]]After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades.

===Economic and research impact===
UCR operated under a $435&amp;nbsp;million budget in fiscal year 2005â06. The state government provided $153&amp;nbsp;million, student fees accounted for $111&amp;nbsp;million, the federal government financed $84&amp;nbsp;million, and $45&amp;nbsp;million came from university sales and services.

Much of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs. Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[New York Times]]'' to run stories lauding UCR as a &quot;campus of choice&quot; for minority students.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT011507&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Traub&quot;&gt;

===Housing===
[[Image:Sunset, UCR.jpg|thumb|The [[Box Springs Mountains]] at dusk from the Pentland Hills [[residence hall]]]]
UCR's [[residence hall]]s consist of three structures&amp;mdash;Aberdeen-Inverness, Lothian, and Pentland Hills&amp;mdash;which as of 2002 housed 2,930&amp;nbsp;students in triple, double and single rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus [[apartment complex]]es such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Oban, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959&amp;nbsp;students. UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest, a low-density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher-density residence halls.&lt;ref name=&quot;LongRangePlan2005&quot; /&gt; Glen Mor, an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills, was opened in 2007, and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex, which is now known as Falkirk, for student housing in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;HighlanderRidge&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title=UC Riverside Buys University House at Highlander Ridge | url=http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=1575 | publisher=University of California, Riverside | date=2007-04-27 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;HighlanderRidge&quot;/&gt; Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend.&lt;ref name= &quot;University of California, Riverside, campus life&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= University of California, Riverside, campus life | url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_1316_brief.php | work= [[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting UCR's diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include ''Unete a Mundo'', for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a [[UCR Pan African Theme Hall|Pan African Theme Hall]] for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a [[gender-neutral]] community. UCR's three academic colleges in the humanities, sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls, and halls exist for honor students and transfer students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UCR Housing Services | publisher= University of California, Riverside |url=http://housing.ucr.edu/CampusLiving/SpecialInterestCommunities.htm | accessdate=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCR hosts over 375&amp;nbsp;registered student organizations, including the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Organizations| publisher= University of California, Riverside |url=http://resources.ucr.edu/studentlife/studentorgs/default.aspx | accessdate= 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 20&amp;nbsp;elected officers, who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment.

Of the registered student groups, 40 are [[fraternities and sororities]]. Ten men's fraternities belong to the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference]]; six women's sororities belong to the [[National Panhellenic Conference]]; seven men's fraternities and ten women's sororities represent the [[National Multicultural Greek Council]], and two others fall under the campus [[La Raza|Raza]] Assembly and are unique to UCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Fraternity and Sorority Life | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url=http://studentlife.ucr.edu/Student+Organizations/Fraternity+and+Sorority+Life.htm | accessdate= 2007-08-22| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013112901/http://studentlife.ucr.edu/Student+Organizations/Fraternity+and+Sorority+Life.htm| archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life, although chapter houses are not permitted.&lt;ref name= &quot;University of California, Riverside, extracurriculars&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= University of California, Riverside, extracurriculars | url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drextras_1316_brief.php | work= [[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including the Greek letter organizations, more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Community Involvement | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.impact.ucr.edu/ci.html |accessdate= 2007-08-23| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070727042846/http://www.impact.ucr.edu/ci.html| archivedate = July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through [http://www.iehillel.org/ UCR Hillel].

Student media organizations include ''The Highlander'' student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, the Highlander remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however the Highlander is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Highlander Referendum, 2001 | publisher= Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside |url=http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html | accessdate= 2007-08-22| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060904172637/http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html| archivedate = September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Highlander published a comic depicting a stereotypical [[Asian American]] graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Healy | first=Scott.

On-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB's major events include the Block Party Concert, Student Film Festival, International Film Festival, World Fest, Welcome Week, Homecoming and Spring Splash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= ASPB | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.aspb.ucr.edu | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other on-campus events take place at The Barn, one of the original buildings on campus grounds. Throughout the 60s', 70s' and 80s' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead. During the 90s' however, the university administration sought to avoid a &quot;party school&quot; stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant, The Big West Bar and Grill. As recently as the fall of 2007, concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on-campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community.

The Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR's counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GASUCR, About the Council| publisher= Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.gsa.ucr.edu/Council.html |accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCR's [[varsity team]]s compete in the [[Big West Conference]] of [[NCAA Division I]]. Programs include men and women's soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women's volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men's and women's soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from [[NCAA Division II]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division I&quot;/&gt; While at Division II level, UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men's baseball and women's volleyball. As of 2006, UCR had produced 17&amp;nbsp;individual national champions, 175&amp;nbsp;[[All-American]]s and many conference and regional champions. The men's golf team represented UCR in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA West Regionals after winning back to back Conference Championships in those respective years while having three athletes ranked in the top 100 in the country.

In 1954, UCR's founding class adopted the name &quot;Highlanders&quot;, reflecting the campus' high altitude. After the student body passed a referendum to move to Division I competition in 1998, the bear mascot was professionally redesigned to look more ferocious. The new &quot;Scotty&quot; featured a half-blue face in homage to [[William Wallace]], the subject of the movie [[Braveheart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The History of UCR's Mascot | publisher= University of California, Riverside, Department of Athletics | url= http://www.athletics.ucr.edu/administrative/mascot.html | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] motif, UCR assembles a [[bagpipe]] band made up of students and staff who play at graduation and other campus events. The blue and gold [[tartan]] worn by the pipe band and the mascot is a registered trademark of the University of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The University of California Riverside Tartan | publisher= The University of California Riverside Pipe Band | url=http://www.pipeband.ucr.edu/ | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the women's basketball team's first appearance at the NCAA Tournament in 2006, UCR sent 22&amp;nbsp;members of the pipe band to play at halftime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Durant | first= Celeste | title= Pipe Pep | journal= Inside UCR | volume=2 | issue=8 | date= 2006-04-26 | url=http://www.insideucr.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=196 | accessdate= 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
