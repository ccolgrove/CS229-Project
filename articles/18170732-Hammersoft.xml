===Diner Feedback===
Program diners who have eaten at a network restaurant can provide feedback on that restaurant. Rewards Network emails a survey to diners after network restaurant visits. The survey includes questions about food quality, service, and restaurant ambiance. This review is shared with the network restaurant and other program diners, and gives network restaurants the ability to respond directly to that diner. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewardsnetwork.com/_our-offerings/_marketing-services/_diner-feedback/&lt;/ref&gt; The program diner is like a secret shopper because network restaurants have no indication they have visited until after seeing the review. The surveys also give program diners an opportunity to post their reviews on their Facebook page, furthering the reach of that review. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewardsnetwork.com/_our-offerings/_marketing-services/_social-media/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
Rewards Network provides restaurants with detailed performance reports, summaries and statements analyzing program diner visits and spend. Network restaurants can use the data to learn the geographical origin of program diners that have visited; evaluate program diner spend against other diners; measure new and repeat business; and track their performance against other local and national Rewards Network restaurants. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewardsnetwork.com/_our-offerings/_marketing-services/_analysis/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
Member restaurants have an opportunity to qualify for funding from Rewards Network. They provide qualifying restaurants funding based on a wholesale purchase of food and drink. Network restaurants can receive payment for menu items before they have made a dish or served a customer.

==History==
Mel Chasen founded rewards Network in September 1984 as Transmedia Network Inc in New York City. Mr. Chasen â an entrepreneur and former president of Caesarâs Palace in Las Vegas â identified an untapped opportunity to introduce diners to restaurants through a unique media barter platform that offered &quot;advertisingâforâservices&quot; exchanges between radio stations, magazines, and restaurant owners. The company started with 41 restaurants and 225 members. They soon grew to a reported $1 million in sales revenues by 1987. Within five years the roster had grown to 500 restaurants and 25 thousand members with sales of $33 million. By the year 2000, Transmedia was the worlds largest dining rewards program with over 2 million members and 8,000 restaurants. In 2002, Transmedia changed its name to iDine Rewards Network. At that time, sales where at $285 million with 2.3 million active members and 9,500 participating restaurants. In 2003, they shortened the name to Rewards Network. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewardsnetwork.com/_footer-links/about-rewards-network.php&lt;/ref&gt; Today Rewards Network has over 3.4 million members that in 2010, spent over $600,000,000 dollars in network restaurants. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewardsnetwork.com/_who-we-target/_members/&lt;/ref&gt;
