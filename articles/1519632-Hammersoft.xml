'''Interstate 84''' (abbreviated '''I-84''') is an [[Interstate Highway]] extending from [[Dunmore, Pennsylvania]] (near [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]) at an interchange with [[Interstate 81]] to [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]], at an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 90]]). I-84 has [[mile-log]] junction numbering in Pennsylvania; otherwise, exit numbers are roughly [[sequential]]. There is also [[Interstate 84 (west)|a separate I-84]] in the [[northwestern United States]].

===Pennsylvania===
Interstate 84 starts in Pennsylvania at [[Interstate 81]] in [[Dunmore, Pennsylvania]], a suburb east of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. The first two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) are [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[Interstate 380 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 380]]. The two split in hilly country outside the city, with I-380 going southeast through the [[Pocono Mountains|Poconos]] and I-84 continuing almost due east into [[Wayne County, Pennsylvania|Wayne]] and [[Pike County, Pennsylvania|Pike]] counties. The Pennsylvania section is the only segment of I-84 that uses mile-based exit numbers; it began replacing sequential numbers in 2001.

This section of Pennsylvania is very lightly populated, and there are no major settlements on or near I-84, although it offers access to popular outdoor recreation areas such as [[Lake Wallenpaupack]] and [[Promised Land State Park]]. Its [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] is very wide, with a large [[central reservation|median strip]] between the two roadways as it passes through densely wooded country, except for the swampy areas in southern Wayne County. The only development along Pennsylvania's section of I-84 is where [[U.S. Route 6 in Pennsylvania|US 6]] and [[U.S. Route 209 in Pennsylvania|209]] start to parallel closely and form a commercial strip just south of [[Matamoras, Pennsylvania|Matamoras]], just west of the [[Delaware River]].

===New York===
{{Main|Interstate 84 in New York}}
[[Image:i84.jpg|thumbnail|350 px|An overlook along I-84 near [[Port Jervis, New York]].  The road is also visible left center, immediately left of the large tree in the foreground.]]
I-84 enters New York by crossing both the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and [[Neversink River|Neversink]] rivers on a long bridge south of [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis]], the first large settlement near the highway. The first mile of the road in New York runs along the [[New Jersey]] state line, then curves to the north to climb the [[Shawangunk Ridge|Shawangunks]] and cross [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], where it forms one leg of a [[distribution (business)|distribution]] &quot;golden triangle&quot; with [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]] (future [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]]) and the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87|I-87]]). I-84 includes the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]] across the [[Hudson River]] at [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]].

East of the bridge and the city of [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]], I-84 continues to head east across [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], beginning to turn south in the mountainous areas east of the [[Taconic State Parkway]] and into [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]]. At [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]], where [[Interstate 684]] heads south towards  New York City, the road resumes its eastern course into Connecticut, closely paralleled by [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US 6]] and [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|202]].

===Connecticut===
{{main|Interstate 84 in Connecticut}}
[[File:I-84 western approach to Waterbury, CT.jpg|right|thumb|I-84 (looking eastbound) just before becoming an elevated viaduct to cross downtown Waterbury]]
The interstate's first exit is at the state line, where it enters the city of [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]. Here it is designated the Yankee Expressway. Two miles to the east, where [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] comes in from the south near [[Danbury Fair Mall]] to join I-84, it turns to the north. At the next exit, routes [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|6]] and [[U.S. Route 202 in Connecticut|202]] join the highway.

The four-way concurrency ends after {{convert|3|mi|km}}, when 7 and 202 split off north towards [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]]. Route 6 leaves the interstate at the next exit, and I-84 continues east across the countryside. At Exit 11 it turns to the northeast and descends to cross the [[Housatonic River]] on the Rochambeau Bridge, into [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], then climbs into higher ground to the city of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], which it passes on an elevated [[viaduct]] with the eastbound and westbound lanes on different levels. Here the [[Route 8 (Connecticut)|CT 8]] expressway intersects.

The eastern heading continues past Waterbury to [[Milldale, Connecticut|Milldale]], where [[Interstate 691]] splits off to the east. This section has many left-hand exits and entrances and sharp curves, which were built for a planned network of freeways. I-84 heads northeast towards [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], the state capital and the largest community along its eastern length. After intersecting [[Interstate 91]], the road crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Bulkeley Bridge]], oldest on the Interstate system, then becomes the [[Wilbur Cross Highway]] and continues towards the northeast.

The last exit in Connecticut is Exit 74, an exit for [[Route 171 (Connecticut)|Route 171]].  I-84 crosses the Massachusetts border in the town of [[Union, Connecticut|Union]].

===Massachusetts===
The Wilbur Cross Highway continues on Interstate 84 after the highway crosses the state line.  For a short distance (approximately 90 yards eastbound and 200 yards westbound), the interstate passes through the town of [[Holland, Massachusetts|Holland]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]] before crossing into [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]] in [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] for the remainder of its length. I-84 only has three exits in Massachusetts, before ending at [[Interstate 90]], the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]].  I-84 ends at Exit 9 of I-90, which is located in Sturbridge, {{convert|7.7|mi|km}} into the state, making the Massachusetts section of the highway the shortest distance within any of the four states it traverses.

==History==
===Road to Providence===
Interstate 84 was originally to head east from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

====Original route====
The original route of Interstate 84 would have used present-day [[Interstate 384]] to [[Bolton, Connecticut]], then along a never-built section of freeway that would have connected to the [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] bypass around [[Willimantic, Connecticut]]. Another never-built freeway section would have connected it to Interstate 395 and extended I-84 onto [[State Road 695 (Connecticut)|State Road 695]] in Connecticut, the easternmost portion of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] in [[Plainfield, Connecticut]]. From there, it would have roughly followed US&amp;nbsp;6 through western [[Rhode Island]] to connect to the present-day US 6 freeway in [[Johnston, Rhode Island|Johnston]]. From there, a freeway from [[Olneyville Square]] to the [[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|Interstate 95]]â[[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island)|Interstate 195]] interchange was briefly considered, but abandoned in favor of what later became the [[Route 6-10 Connector]].

====Upgrades====
Sections of I-84 in Connecticut were reconstructed and widened in the 1980s.  The former I-86 portion from East Hartford to the Massachusetts state line was completely rebuilt from a narrow 4-lane freeway to a much wider profile ranging from 6 lanes at the Massachusetts state line, expanding to 8 lanes in Vernon, to 12 lanes with HOV lanes in East Hartford.  Another section through Danbury was widened from 4 lanes to 6 lanes in 1985 and 1986.  Widening of the highway through Danbury was funded by [[Union Carbide]] as part of building its world headquarters in Danbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Do-You-Remember-58816.php Do You Remember? Danbury News-Times, Sep 4, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental concerns====
Though the route was basically set in stone in [[Connecticut]], many issues remained in [[Rhode Island]], the biggest of which were major environmental concerns about how the freeway would affect the [[Scituate Reservoir]], which is the main drinking water supply for [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].

====Alternate route====
In an attempt to ease environmental concerns, an alternate route was briefly studied in [[Rhode Island]] that would have connected Interstate 84 to the present-day [[Route 37 (Rhode Island)|Route 37]] freeway. This would have allowed construction of I-84 south of the [[Scituate Reservoir]]. Major community opposition caused this plan, as well as I-84 as a whole, to be scrapped.

====Long-range plans====
In the 1992 long-range transportation plan released by the [[Rhode Island Department of Transportation]], a freeway has been added along the original route of Interstate 84 that will connect to the [[State Road 695 (Connecticut)|CT 695]] freeway on the [[Rhode Island]]â[[Connecticut]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/US-6_RI/|publisher=BostonRoads.com|title=Dennis J Robers Expressway (US 6)|last=Anderson|first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I-86 relation===
The section of I-84 between [[East Hartford, Connecticut]] (at the present-day junction with [[Interstate 384]]) and [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]] ([[Interstate 90]]) was for a time signed as Interstate 86 (unrelated to present-day [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] in [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]). Signs stating &quot;I-84 Ends, I-86 to [[Boston]]&quot; (eastbound) and &quot;I-86 Ends, I-84 to Hartford&quot; (westbound) were posted where the change took place.  Exit numbering on I-86 was that of the road's predecessor, [[Route 15 (Connecticut)|Route 15]], in a sequence beginning on New York's [[Hutchinson River Parkway]].  Exits were renumbered to correspond with the rest of I-84 in Connecticut when the road was redesignated in 1984. The present I-384 as well as the present US 6 bypass near Willimantic, both of which were a part of what was then I-84's planned easterly continuation, were also numbered I-84 prior to 1984 even though they lacked any direct connection to the rest of I-84 at that time.  (One had to use Silver Lane in East Hartford to travel between the two stretches of the highway.)  These two sections were re-numbered I-384 and Rte 6 when what was then I-86 was re-numbered I-84.

=== Tolls ===
As I-84 was built with federal funds, there are generally no highway tolls.  The exception is I-84's [[Hudson River]] crossing, the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]]. Since the bridge is under the [[New York State Bridge Authority]], it carries an eastbound-only toll of $1 for passenger vehicles (6/19/2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nysba.state.ny.us/Index%20Page/tolls.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====I-84 transfer to NYS Thruway Authority====
From 1992 through 2006, Interstate 84 in [[New York]] was a toll-free component of the [[New York Thruway|New York State Thruway]] system. It was transferred by the state DOT to the Thruway Authority in order to capitalize on that agency's steady revenue stream from upstate sources.

In 1992, maintenance responsibility for I-84 in New York was transferred to the New York State Thruway Authority and the monies for that purpose came from existing tolls on [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] in downtown [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], more than {{convert|300|mi|km}} away. On Monday, October 30, 2006, the Thruway Authority began the process of returning maintenance and operation responsibilities to NYSDOT and the tolls in Buffalo were discontinued. The I-190 tolls were considered to be one of the principal causes of highway congestion in Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20061031/1041004.asp Buffalo News]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2010, maintenance was performed by the Thruway Authority with funding provided by the state legislature.  On Monday, October 11, 2010, NYSDOT resumed full control of I-84.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nysdot.gov/news/press-releases/2010/2010-10-08]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widening projects in Waterbury===
A widening project along the congested stretch of I-84 through [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and [[Cheshire, Connecticut]] has been beset by cost overruns, delays, and construction defects involving storm drains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2006/10/01/report_i_84_project_plagued_by_defective_drainage_system/ }} {{Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; as state and federal officials have launched criminal investigations stemming from this project. This episode has waned local enthusiasm for a proposed $2 billion reconstruction of the Mixmaster interchange in downtown Waterbury.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfsb.com/news/9930142/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cost estimates for the Mixmaster replacement have increased to $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rep-am.com/story.php?id=25598&lt;/ref&gt; CT Attorney General [[Richard Blumenthal]] has begun a lawsuit against the contractor and an engineering firm in response to threats from the U.S. DOT to withhold funds from the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-i84sue0424,0,2079705.story?coll=hc-headlines-local&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 2007, the ''[[Waterbury Republican-American]]'' reported this area had defective light poles,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rep-am.com/story.php?id=24247&lt;/ref&gt; while Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] released an audit report of the construction disaster.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ct.gov/governorrell/cwp/view.asp?Q=381926&amp;A=2791&lt;/ref&gt; A number of DOT personnel were either fired or reprimanded following the scandal. Meanwhile{{When|date=February 2011}} the FBI and a federal grand jury are investigating the now-defunct construction company and the same DOT officials, which may eventually lead to criminal charges in the case.

==Future==
I-84 now has a direct interchange with the New York State Thruway ([[Interstate 87]]), in the [[Newburgh (town), New York|town of Newburgh]].
