The '''Boise State Broncos''' are the official athletic program of [[Boise State University]]. The Broncos compete in a wide variety of sports. Perhaps the most well-known of these sports is the football program. The program attained a 13-0 season in 2006 capped by a memorable overtime win in the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]] against the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]].  They finished the season as the only major undefeated college football team, yet they became the first team since the 2004-2005 season with an unblemished record to not receive any share of the National Championship. Other notable sports teams include the wrestling team, which competes in the [[Pacific 12 Conference]], the women's basketball team, which won the WAC for the first time ever in 2007 and the [[Boise State Broncos tennis|tennis teams]] which have consistently had nationally ranked players. The Broncos have a very successful athletic program overall, winning the WAC commissioner's cup for the 2005-06 year and 2009-10 year.

The school's football stadium, [[Bronco Stadium]], is famous for its use of a unique blue colored [[artificial turf]] (specifically [[FieldTurf]]) field, instead of traditional green.
