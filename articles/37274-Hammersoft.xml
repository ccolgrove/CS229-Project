'''Wall Street''' refers to the [[Financial District, Manhattan|financial district]] of [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/lucds/mn1profile.pdf Profile of Manhattan Community Board 1], retrieved July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; named after and centered on the eight-block-long street running from [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] to [[South Street (Manhattan)|South Street]] on the [[East River]] in [[Lower Manhattan]].  Over time, the term has become a [[metonym]] for the financial markets of the [[United States]] as a whole, or signifying New York-based financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Wall%20Street Merriam-Webster Online], retrieved July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization of its listed companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-exchanges.org World-exchanges.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, including [[NASDAQ]], the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]], the [[New York Board of Trade]], and the former [[American Stock Exchange]].

===Early years===
There are varying accounts about how the Dutch-named &quot;de Waal Straat&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;let.rug.nl&quot;&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/images/nadam2.gif The street on the map of Nieuw-Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt; got its name. A generally accepted version is that the name of the street name was derived from an earthen wall on the northern boundary of the [[New Amsterdam]] settlement, perhaps to protect against English colonial encroachment or incursions by native Americans. A conflicting explanation is that Wall Street was named after ''[[Walloons]]'' -- possibly a Dutch abbreviation for ''Walloon'' being ''Waal''.&lt;ref name = walloonswallets&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.loc.gov/wiseguide/mar09/wallets.html | title = Walloons and Wallets| date = 2009-03 | accessdate = 2010-09-24 | publisher = the loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first settlers that embarked on the ship &quot;Nieu Nederlandt&quot; in 1624 were 30 Walloon families.

In the 1640s, basic picket and plank fences denoted plots and residences in the colony.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[The History of New York State, Book II, Chapter II, Part IV.] Editor, Dr. James Sullivan, Online Edition by Holice, Deb &amp; Pam.

In these early days, local merchants and traders would gather at disparate spots to buy and sell shares and bonds, and over time divided themselves into two classesâauctioneers and dealers.&lt;ref name=twsJanSb/&gt; The [[Defensive wall|rampart]] was removed in 1699.&lt;ref name = walloonswallets/&gt;

In the late 18th century, there was a [[American sycamore|buttonwood]] tree at the foot of Wall Street under which [[Trader (finance)|traders]] and speculators would gather to trade securities.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; The benefit was being in close proximity to each other.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; In 1792, traders formalized their association with the [[Buttonwood Agreement]] which was the origin of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jan04.html Today in History: January 4 â The New York Stock Exchange] The Library of Congress. Retrieved 2011-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the agreement was to make the market more &quot;structured&quot; and &quot;without the manipulative auctions&quot;, with a commission structure.&lt;ref name=twsJanSb/&gt; Persons signing the agreement agreed to charge each other a standard commission rate; persons not signing could still participate but would be charged a higher commission for dealing.&lt;ref name=twsJanSb/&gt;

In 1789, Wall Street was the scene of the United States' first presidential inauguration when [[George Washington]] took the oath of office on the balcony of [[Federal Hall]] on April 30, 1789. This was also the location of the passing of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill Of Rights]]. In the cemetery of Trinity Church, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who was the first Treasury secretary and &quot;architect of the early United States financial system,&quot; is buried.&lt;ref name=twsJanO53a&gt;{{cite news

===Nineteenth century===
In the first few decades, both residences and businesses occupied the area, but increasingly business predominated. &quot;There are old stories of people's houses being surrounded by the clamor of business and trade and the owners complaining that they can't get anything done,&quot; according to a historian named Burrows.&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt; The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in the early 19th century meant a huge boom in business for New York City, since it was the only major eastern seaport which had direct access by inland waterways to ports on the [[Great Lakes]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally during the 19th century Wall Street developed its own &quot;unique personality and institutions&quot; with little outside interference.&lt;ref name=twsJanSb/&gt;

In the 1840s and 1850s, most residents moved north to midtown because of the increased business use at the lower tip of the island.&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt; The Civil War had the effect of causing the northern economy to boom, bringing greater prosperity to cities like New York which &quot;came into its own as the nation's banking center&quot; connecting &quot;Old World capital and New World ambition&quot;, according to one account.&lt;ref name=twsJanO53a/&gt; [[J. P. Morgan]] created giant trusts; [[John D. Rockefeller]]âs [[Standard Oil]] moved to New York.&lt;ref name=twsJanO53a/&gt; Between 1860 and 1920, the economy changed from &quot;agricultural to industrial to financial&quot; and New York maintained its leadership position despite these changes, according to historian Thomas Kessner.&lt;ref name=twsJanO53a/&gt; New York was second only to London as the world's financial capital.&lt;ref name=twsJanO53a/&gt;

In 1884, [[Charles H. Dow]] began tracking stocks, initially beginning with 11 stocks, mostly railroads, and looked at average prices for these eleven.&lt;ref name=twsJanSa&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the average &quot;peaks and troughs&quot; went up consistently, he deemed it a bull market condition; if averages dropped, it was a bear market.&lt;ref name=twsJanSa/&gt; He added up prices, and divided by the number of stocks to get his Dow Jones average. Dow's numbers were a &quot;convenient benchmark&quot; for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market.&lt;ref name=twsJanSa/&gt; 

In 1889, the original stock report, ''Customers' Afternoon Letter'', became ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Named in reference to the actual street, it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dowjones.com/TheCompany/History/History.htm DOW JONES HISTORY â THE LATE 1800s] 2006 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. Retrieved August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After October 7, 1896, it began publishing Dow's expanded list of stocks.&lt;ref name=twsJanSa/&gt; A century later, there were 30 stocks in the average.

===Twentieth century===
Historian [[John Brooks (writer)|John Brooks]] in his book ''Once in Golconda'' considered the turn of the 20th century period to have been Wall Street's ''heyday''.&lt;ref name=twsJanO53a/&gt; The address of 23 Wall Street where the headquarters of [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|J. P. Morgan &amp; Company]], known as ''The Corner'', was &quot;the precise center, geographical as well as metaphorical, of financial America and even of the financial world.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsJanO53a/&gt;

Wall Street has had changing relationships with government authorities. In 1913, for example, when authorities proposed a $4 tax on stock transfers, stock clerks protested.&lt;ref name=twsJanN213&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-01-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, city and state officials have taken steps through tax incentives to encourage financial firms to continue to do business in the city.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[corporate culture]] of New York was a primary center for the construction of [[skyscraper]]s, and was rivaled only by [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] on the American continent. There were also residential sections, such as the Bowling Green section between Broadway and the [[Hudson river]], and between [[Vesey Street]] and the Battery. The [[Bowling Green (Manhattan)|Bowling Green]] area was described as &quot;Wall Street's [[back yard]]&quot; with poor people, high [[infant mortality]] rates, and the &quot;worst housing conditions in the city.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsJanN412&gt;{{cite news

The [[geology]] of Manhattan is well-suited for tall buildings, with a solid mass of [[bedrock]] underneath Manhattan providing a firm foundation for tall buildings.

On September 16, 1920, close to the corner of Wall and Broad Street, the busiest corner of the financial district and across the offices of the [[23 Wall Street|Morgan Bank]], a [[Wall Street bombing|powerful bomb exploded]]. It killed 38 and seriously injured 143 people.&lt;ref&gt;Beverly Gage, ''The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2009; pp. 160-161.&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators were never identified or apprehended. The explosion did, however, help fuel the [[Red Scare]] that was underway at the time. A report from the ''[[New York Times]]'':

{{cquote|The tomb-like silence that settles over Wall Street and lower Broadway with the coming of night and the suspension of business was entirely changed last night as hundreds of men worked under the glare of searchlights to repair the damage to skyscrapers that were lighted up from top to bottom. ...

The front was pierced in fifty places where the cast iron slugs, which were of the material used for window weights, were thrown against it. Each slug penetrated the stone an inch or two and chipped off pieces ranging from three inches to a foot in diameter. The ornamental iron grill work protecting each window was broken or shattered. ... the Assay Office was a wreck. ...

The [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan years]] were marked by a renewed push for [[capitalism]], [[business]], with national efforts to de-regulate industries such as [[telecommunications]] and [[aviation]]. The economy resumed upward growth after a period in the early eighties of languishing. A report in the ''[[New York Times]]'' described that the flushness of money and growth during these years had spawned a drug culture of sorts, with a rampant acceptance of cocaine use although the overall percent of actual users was most likely small. A reporter wrote:

But as the dealer slipped him a heat-sealed plastic envelope of cocaine and he passed her cash, the transaction was being watched through the sunroof of her car by Federal drug agents in a nearby building.

In 1987, the stock market plunged&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; and, in the relatively brief recession following, lower Manhattan lost 100,000 jobs according to one estimate.&lt;ref name=twsJanN211/&gt; Since telecommunications costs were coming down, banks and brokerage firms could move away from Wall Street to more affordable locations.&lt;ref name=twsJanN211/&gt; The recession of 1990&amp;ndash;1991 were marked by office vacancy rates downtown which were &quot;persistently high&quot; and with some buildings &quot;standing empty.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt; The day of the drop, October 20, was marked by &quot;stony-faced traders whose sense of humor had abandoned them and in the exhaustion of stock exchange employees struggling to maintain orderly trading.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsJanN312&gt;{{cite news

In 1995, city authorities offered the ''Lower Manhattan Revitalization Plan'' which offered incentives to convert commercial properties to residential use.&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt;

Construction of the [[World Trade Center]] began in 1966 but had trouble attracting tenants when completed. Nonetheless, some substantial firms purchased space there. Its impressive height helped make it a visual landmark for drivers and pedestrians. In some respects, the nexus of the financial district moved from the ''street'' of Wall Street to the Trade Center complex. Real estate growth during the latter part of the 1990s was significant, with deals and new projects happening in the financial district and elsewhere in Manhattan; one firm invested more than $24 billion in various projects, many in the Wall Street area.&lt;ref name=twsJanO24&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when the World Trade Center was destroyed on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]], it left an architectural void as new developments since the 1970s had played off the complex aesthetically. The attacks &quot;crippled&quot; the communications network.&lt;ref name=twsJanO35a/&gt; One estimate was that 45% of Wall Street's &quot;best office space&quot; had been lost.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; The physical destruction was immense:

{{cquote|Debris littered some streets of the financial district. National Guard members in camouflage uniforms manned checkpoints.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack hastened a trend towards financial firms moving to midtown and contributed to the loss of business on Wall Street, due to temporary-to-permanent relocation to [[New Jersey]] and further decentralization with establishments transferred to cities like [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. 

After September 11, the financial services industry went through a downturn with a sizable drop in year-end bonuses of $6.5 billion, according to one estimate from a state comptroller's office.&lt;ref name=twsJanN214/&gt; Many brokers are paid mostly through commission, and get a token annual salary which is dwarfed by the year-end bonus.

To guard against a vehicular bombing in the area, authorities built concrete barriers, and found ways over time to make them more aesthetically appealing by spending $5000 to $8000 apiece on ''[[bollards]]'':

{{cquote|To prevent a vehicle-delivered bomb from entering the area, Rogers Marvel designed a new kind of bollard, a faceted piece of sculpture whose broad, slanting surfaces offer people a place to sit in contrast to the typical bollard, which is supremely unsittable. The bollard, which is called the Nogo, looks a bit like one of Frank Gehry's unorthodox culture palaces, but it is hardly insensitive to its surroundings. Its bronze surfaces actually echo the grand doorways of Wall Street's temples of commerce. Pedestrians easily slip through groups of them as they make their way onto Wall Street from the area around historic Trinity Church.

Wall Street itself and the Financial District as a whole are crowded with highrises. Further, the loss of the World Trade Center has spurred development on a scale that hadn't been seen in decades. In 2006, Goldman Sachs began building a tower near the former Trade Center site.&lt;ref name=twsJanO44/&gt; Tax incentives provided by federal, state and local governments encouraged development. A new World Trade Center complex, centered on [[Daniel Liebeskind]]'s [[Memory Foundations]] plan, is in the early stages of development and one building has already been replaced. The centerpiece to this plan is the {{convert|1776|ft|m|0|sing=on}} tall [[1 World Trade Center]] (formerly known as the Freedom Tower). New residential buildings are sprouting up, and buildings that were previously office space are being converted to residential units, also benefiting from tax incentives. A new [[Fulton Street Transit Center]] is planned to improve access.

{{cquote|But the picture is too nuanced simply to dump all the responsibility on financiers. Most Wall Street banks didn't actually go around the US hawking dodgy mortgages; they bought and packaged loans from on-the-ground firms such as Countrywide Financial and New Century Financial, both of which hit a financial wall in the crisis. Foolishly and recklessly, the banks didn't look at these loans adequately, relying on flawed credit-rating agencies such as Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, which blithely certified toxic mortgage-backed securities as solid... A few of those on Wall Street, including maverick hedge fund manager John Paulson and the top brass at Goldman Sachs, spotted what was going on and ruthlessly gambled on a crash. They made a fortune but turned into the crisis's pantomime villains. Most, though, got burned â the banks are still gradually running down portfolios of non-core loans worth $800bn. -- ''[[The Guardian]]'' reporter Andrew Clark, 2010.&lt;ref name=twsJanO12a/&gt;}}

==Buildings: Physical layout==
[[File:Federal Hall NYC1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Federal Hall]], Wall Street.]]
Wall Street's architecture is generally rooted in the [[Gilded Age]], though there are also some [[art deco]] influences in the neighborhood. The layout of streets doesn't have the rectangular grid pattern typical of midtown Manhattan, but small streets &quot;barely wide enough for a single lane of traffic are bordered on both sides by some of the tallest buildings in the city&quot;, according to one description, which creates &quot;breathtaking artificial canyons&quot; offering spectacular views in some instances.&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt; Construction in such narrow steep areas has resulted in occasional accidents such as a crane collapse.&lt;ref name=twsJanN415&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One report divided  lower Manhattan into three basic districts:&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt;

# The financial district properâparticularly along John Street
# South of the World Trade Center areaâthe handful of blocks south of the World Trade Center along [[Greenwich Street (Manhattan)|Greenwich]], Washington and West Streets
# Seaport districtâcharacterized by century-old low-rise buildings and [[South Street Seaport]]; the seaport is &quot;quiet, residential, and has an old world charm&quot; according to one description.&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt;

Landmark buildings on Wall Street include [[Federal Hall]], [[14 Wall Street]] ([[Bankers Trust Company Building]]), [[40 Wall Street]] (The Trump Building) the [[New York Stock Exchange]] at the corner of [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] and the US headquarters of Deutsche Bank at [[60 Wall Street]]. The Deutsche Bank building (formerly the J.P Morgan headquarters) is the last remaining major investment bank to still have its headquarters on Wall Street.

The older skyscrapers often were built with elaborate facades; such elaborate aesthetics haven't been common in corporate architecture for decades. The [[World Trade Center]], built in the 1970s, was very plain and utilitarian in comparison (the [[World Trade Center|Twin Towers]] were often criticized as looking like two big boxes, despite their impressive height). Excavation from the World Trade Center was later used by [[Battery Park City]] residential development as landfill.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; [[23 Wall Street]] was built in 1914 and was known as the &quot;[[JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.|House of Morgan]]&quot; and served for decades as the bank's headquarters and, by some accounts, was viewed as an important address in American finance.

A key anchor for the area is, of course, the New York Stock Exchange. City authorities realize its importance, and believed that it has &quot;outgrown its neoclassical temple at the corner of Wall and Broad streets&quot;, and in 1998 offered substantial tax incentives to try to keep it in the financial district.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; Plans to rebuild it were delayed by the events of 2001.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; In 2011, the exchange still occupies the same site. The exchange is the locus for an impressive amount of technology and data. For example, to accommodate the three thousand persons who work directly on the Exchange floor requires 3,500 kilowatts of electricity, along with 8,000 phone circuits on the trading floor alone, and 200 miles of fiber-optic cable below ground.&lt;ref name=twsJanO18a/&gt;

==Personalities: players and deal-makers==
Persons associated with Wall Street have become famous. Although their reputations are usually limited to members of the [[stock broker]]age and banking communities, several have gained national and international fame. Some earned their fame for their investment strategies, financing, reporting, legal or regulatory skills, while others are remembered for their greed.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2009/1/2009_1_52.shtml John Steele Gordon] &quot;Wall Street's 10 Most Notorious Stock Traders,&quot; ''American Heritage'', Spring 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most iconic representations of the market prosperity is the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture, by [[Arturo Di Modica]]. Representing the [[bull market]] economy, the sculpture was originally placed in front of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and subsequently moved to its current location in [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]].

&lt;!--- Note to Wikipedians: The following paragraph (which was there before, ie, &quot;Wall Street's culture is often criticized...&quot;) strikes me as POV-ish but I'll let others decide; I think we should ONLY keep it if we can find good references for these points. -- tomwsulcer ---&gt;
Wall Street's culture is often criticized as being rigid. This is a decades-old stereotype stemming from the Wall Street establishment's protection of its interests, and the link to the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] establishment. More recent criticism has centered on structural problems and lack of a desire to change well-established habits. Wall Street's establishment resists government oversight and regulation. At the same time, New York City has a reputation as a very bureaucratic city, which makes entry into the neighborhood difficult or even impossible for middle class entrepreneurs.

The seven largest Wall Street firms in the first decade of the 21st century were [[Bear Stearns]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Citigroup Incorporated]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[Lehman Brothers]].&lt;ref name=twsJanN214/&gt; During the recession of 2008&amp;ndash;2010, many of these firms went out of business or were bought up at firesale prices by other financial firms.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as technology progressed, in the middle and later decades of the 20th century, computers and telecommunications replaced paper notifications, meaning that the close proximity requirement could be bypassed in more situations.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; Many financial firms found that they could move to midtown Manhattan four miles away&lt;ref name=twsJanN312a/&gt; or elsewhere and still operate effectively. For example, the former investment firm of [[Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette]] was described as a ''Wall Street firm'' but had its headquarters on Park Avenue in midtown.&lt;ref name=twsJanN212/&gt; A report described the migration from Wall Street:

Nevertheless, a key magnet for the Wall Street remains the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Some &quot;old guard&quot; firms such as [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] (bought by [[Bank of America]] in 2009), have remained &quot;fiercely loyal to the financial district&quot; location, and new ones such as [[Deutsche Bank]] have chosen office space in the district.&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt; So-called &quot;face&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;face&quot; trading between buyers and sellers remains a &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the NYSE, with a benefit of having all of a deal's players close at hand, including [[investment bankers]], [[lawyers]], and [[accountants]].&lt;ref name=twsJanN215a/&gt;

In 2011, the Manhattan [[Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]] is one of the largest business districts in the United States, and second in New York City only to [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] in terms of dollar volume of business transacted.

=== Wall Street versus Main Street ===
[[File:Wall Street &amp; Broadway.JPG|thumb|right|Not just a [[metonym]], Wall Street has a sign post.]]
As a figure of speech contrasted to &quot;[[Main Street]]&quot;, the term &quot;Wall Street&quot; can refer to big business interests against those of small business and the working of middle class. It is sometimes used more specifically to refer to research analysts, shareholders, and financial institutions such as investment banks. Whereas &quot;Main Street&quot; conjures up images of locally owned businesses and banks, the phrase &quot;Wall Street&quot; is commonly used interchangeably with the phrase &quot;[[Corporate America]]&quot;. It is also sometimes used in contrast to distinguish between the interests, culture, and lifestyles of investment banks and those of [[Fortune 500]] industrial or service corporations.

===Wall Street in the public imagination===
[[File:Trinity Church NYC 004b.JPG|thumb|left|[[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity church]] from Wall Street.]]
Wall Street in a conceptual sense represents financial and economic power. To Americans, it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics, and its role has been a source of controversy throughout the nation's history, particularly beginning around the [[Gilded Age]] period in the late 19th century. Wall Street became the symbol of a country and economic system that many Americans see as having developed through trade, capitalism, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:60 Wall Street building.jpg|thumb|right|US headquarters of [[Deutsche Bank]] on Wall Street in 2010.]]
But chief banking analyst at [[Goldman Sachs]], Richard Ramsden, is &quot;unapologetic&quot; and sees &quot;banks as the dynamos that power the rest of the economy.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsJanO12a/&gt; Ramsden believes &quot;risk-taking is vital&quot; and said in 2010:

Others in the financial industry believe they've been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians. For example, Anthony Scaramucci reportedly told President [[Barack Obama]] in 2010 that he felt like a [[piÃ±ata]], &quot;whacked with a stick&quot; by &quot;hostile politicians&quot;.&lt;ref name=twsJanO12a/&gt;

The financial misdeeds of various figures throughout American history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole, and include names such as [[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]], [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]] and [[Jay Gould]] (the latter two believed to have been involved with an effort to collapse the U.S. gold market in 1869) as well as modern figures such as [[Bernard Madoff]] who &quot;bilked billions from investors&quot;.&lt;ref name=twsJanN413/&gt;

In addition, images of Wall Street and its figures have loomed large. The 1987 [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' created the iconic figure of [[Gordon Gekko]] who used the phrase &quot;greed is good&quot;, which caught on in the cultural parlance.&lt;ref name=twsJanN514/&gt; According to one account, the Gekko character was a &quot;straight lift&quot; from the real world junk-bond dealer [[Michael Milkin]],&lt;ref name=twsJanO15a/&gt; who later pled guilty to felony charges for violating securities laws.

Wall Street being historically a commuter destination, much transportation infrastructure has been developed to serve it. Today, [[Pier 11/Wall Street|Pier 11]] at the foot of the street is a busy terminal for [[New York Waterway]] and other ferries.  The [[New York City Subway]] has three stations under Wall Street:
* [[Wall Street (IRT Broadway â Seventh Avenue Line)]] at [[William Street (Manhattan)|William Street]] ({{NYCS Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn}} trains)
* [[Wall Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)]] at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] ({{NYCS Lexington south}} trains)
* [[Broad Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)]] at [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] ({{NYCS Nassau south}} trains)
Motor traffic, particularly during working hours, is often [[traffic congestion|congested]] but driving late at night and on weekends can be easier. The roads are not arranged according to midtown's distinctive rectangular grid pattern with [[Green wave|staggered lights]], but have small often one-lane roads with numerous stoplights and stop signs. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive|A highway]] runs along the East River and the [[Downtown Manhattan Heliport]] serves Wall Street.
