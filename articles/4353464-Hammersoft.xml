The '''Giant Forest Hog''' (''Hylochoerus meinertzhageni'' â the [[monotypic|only member]] of its [[genus]]) is native to wooded habitats in [[Africa]] and generally is considered the largest wild member of the [[Suidae]] (pig family;  a few subspecies of the [[wild boar]] can reach an even larger size). Despite its large size and relatively wide distribution, it was only described by scientists in 1904. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honours [[Richard Meinertzhagen]], who shot the [[type specimen]] in [[Kenya]] and had it shipped to the [[Natural History Museum]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, B.

==Characteristics==
Males reach up {{convert|2.1|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|1.1|m|ft}} in height, and may weigh as much as {{convert|275|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;Novak, R. M. (editor) (1999). ''Walker's Mammals of the World.'' Vol. 2. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. Pp. 1059-1060. ISBN 0-8018-5789-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kingdon&gt;Kingdon, J. (1997). ''The Kingdon Guide to African Mammals.'' Academic Press Limited, London. Pp. 332-333. ISBN 0-12-408355-2&lt;/ref&gt; Females are smaller than males, and the eastern [[nominate subspecies]] is larger than ''H. m. rimator'' of [[central Africa]] and ''H. m. ivoriensis'' of [[west Africa]].&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; The giant forest hog has extensive hairs on its body, though these tend to become less pronounced as the animal ages. It is mostly black in colour on the surface, though hairs nearest the skin of the animal are a deep orange colour. Its ears are large and pointy, and the [[tusk]]s are proportionally smaller than those of the [[Phacochoerus|warthogs]] but bigger than those of the [[bushpig]]. Nevertheless, the tusks of a male may reach a length of {{convert|35|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name=ungulate&gt;Huffman, B. (2004).

==Distribution==
[[Image:Giant Forrest Hog Skull.JPG|thumb|left|The skull of a male giant forest hog]]
Giant forest hogs occur in west and central Africa, where largely restricted to the [[Guinean Forests of West Africa|Guinean]] and [[Congolian forests]]. They also occur more locally in humid highlands of the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and as far east as [[Mount Kenya]] and the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. They are mainly found in forest-grassland mosaics, but can also be seen in wooded savanna and subalpine habitats at altitudes up to {{convert|3800|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Kingdon/&gt; They are unable to cope with low humidity or prolonged exposure to the sun, resulting in them being absent from arid regions and [[habitat]]s devoid of dense cover.&lt;ref name=Kingdon/&gt;

==Habits==
The giant forest hog is mainly a [[herbivore]], but also [[scavenge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dzanga Forest Elephants (2008). ''[http://dzangaforestelephants.wildlifedirect.org/2008/07/28/departures-and-arrivals/ Departures and Arrivals.]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually considered [[nocturnal]], but in cold periods it is more commonly seen during daylight hours, and it has been suggested it is [[Diurnality|diurnal]] in regions where protected from humans.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; They live in herds (sounders) of up to twenty animals consisting of females and their offspring, but usually also including a single old male.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; Females leave the sounder before giving birth and returns with the piglets about a week after the birth. All members of the sounder protect the piglets and they can nurse from all females.&lt;ref name=ungulate/&gt;

As all [[Suidae|suids]] of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the giant forest hog has not been [[domestication|domesticated]], but it is easily tamed and has been considered to have potential for domestication.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; However, in the wild the giant forest hog is more feared than the [[Red River Hog]] and the [[bush pig]] (the two members of the genus ''[[Potamochoerus]]''), as males sometimes attack without warning, possibly to protect their sounder.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; It has also been known to drive [[spotted hyena]]s away from carcasses and fights among males resulting in the death of one of the participants are not uncommon.&lt;ref name=ungulate/&gt;
