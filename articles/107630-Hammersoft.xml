'''El Segundo''' is a [[city]] in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]].  Located on the [[Santa Monica Bay]], it was incorporated on January 18, 1917, and is one of the Beach Cities of Los Angeles County and part of the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] Cities Council of Governments. The population was 16,654 at the 2010 census, up from 16,033 at the 2000 census.

==History==
[[File:ElSegundoFarm1911.jpg|thumb|left|200px|El Segundo Farmland circa 1911]]
[[File:StandardOil1920.jpg|thumb|left|200px|El Segundo and Standard Oil Refinery, c. 1924]]

The El Segundo and Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] (or GabrieleÃ±os) and [[Chumash people|Chumash]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes hundreds of years ago. The area was once a part of [[Rancho San Pedro]] and later became ''[[Rancho Sausal Redondo]]'' (&quot;Round Willow Patch Ranch&quot;). Rancho Sausal Redondo extended from Playa Del Rey in the North to Redondo Beach in the South. Originally a Spanish land grant, the rancho was later purchased by a Scottish baronet named Sir Robert Burnett. After his return to Scotland, the property was purchased by then current manager of the rancho, Daniel Freeman. Daniel Freeman sold portions of the rancho to multiple owners. [[George H. Peck (1856â1940)]] owned the {{convert|840|acre|km2}} of land the Chevron Refinery now sits on. Peck also developed land in neighboring El Porto where a street still stands to his name. The city earned its name (&quot;the second&quot; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) as it was the site of the second [[Standard Oil]] refinery on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] (the first was at [[Chevron Richmond Refinery|Richmond]] in northern California), when [[Chevron Corporation|Standard Oil of California]] purchased the {{convert|840|acre|km2}} of farm land in 1911. The company was renamed [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in 1984, and the El Segundo refinery will soon enter its second century of operation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Eileen Curry. El Segundo Seventy-Five Years'' El Segundo: H2 Limited, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The city was incorporated in 1917.

==Overview==
In 2006, El Segundo won an Eddy award for being the most business-friendly city in L.A.  County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.laedc.org/eddy/2006_Eddy_BL.pdf |format=PDF| title = LAEDC 2006 Eddy Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.laedc.org/newsroom/businessleader/BusinessLeader_200607_Winter.pdf |format=PDF| title = LAEDC Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Segundo is in transition from being a predominantly blue-collar 'company town' to being a 'corporate' town where the tax base relies on a non-resident working population. Pollution and toxic waste cleanup remain issues as El Segundo converts industrial sites to shopping malls and sports facilities. The north and south boundaries of the town are the [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX airport]] and [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], with the [[Pacific Ocean]] as the western boundary. Aircraft noise from LAX is a major issue for residents on the north side of El Segundo. Residents are currently active in tree-planting along [[Imperial Highway]].
