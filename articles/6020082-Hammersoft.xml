The '''IsraeliâLebanese conflict''' describes a series of related military clashes involving [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]], as well as various non-state [[militias]] acting from within Lebanon.

The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) recruited militants in Lebanon from among the families of [[Palestinian refugee]]s who had been expelled or fled due to the creation of Israel in 1948.&lt;ref name=lonelyplanet&gt;{{cite book

==Background==
[[Image:Sykes-Picot-1916.gif|thumb|right|Zones of French and British influence and control imagined by the 1916 [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]]]]
{{See also|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|British Mandate of Palestine|French Mandate of Syria}}

The territory of what would become the states of Israel and Lebanon was once part of the long-lived [[Ottoman Empire]] (1299&amp;ndash;1924) until its defeat in [[World War I]]. As a result of [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] in 1917, the British occupied [[Palestine]] and parts of what would become [[Syria]]. French troops took [[Damascus]] in 1918. The [[League of Nations]] officially gave the French the [[French Mandate of Syria|Mandate of Syria]] and the British the [[Palestine (mandate)|Mandate of Palestine]] after the 1920 [[San Remo conference]], in accordance with the 1916 [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]].

The largely [[Christian]] enclave of the French Mandate became the French-controlled [[Lebanese Republic]] in 1926. Lebanon became independent in 1943 as France was under German occupation, though French troops did not completely withdraw until 1946.

The rise of [[anti-Semitism]] in [[Europe]], culminating in the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], had meant an increase of [[Jew]]ish immigrants to a minority Jewish, majority [[Arab]] Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

(The area of their [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] east of the [[Jordan river]] had already become the independent state of [[Jordan]] in 1946.) The [[United Nations General Assembly]] developed a [[gerrymander]]ed [[1947 UN Partition Plan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Arab armies waited for the end of the Mandate and the withdrawal of British forces, which was set for March 15, 1948.

Israel [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|declared its independence]] on May 14, 1948. The next day, the British Mandate officially expired and, in [[:s:Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the Secretary-General of the United Nations|an official cablegram]], the seven-member [[League of Arab States|Arab League]], including Lebanon, publicly proclaimed their aim of creating a democratic &quot;United State of Palestine&quot; in place of the [[two-state solution]] proposed by the [[United Nations]]. The League soon entered the conflict on the side of the Palestinian Arabs, thus beginning the international phase of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Transjordan]], and [[Iraq]] declared war on the new state of Israel. They expected an easy and quick victory in what came to be called the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The Lebanese army joined the other Arab armies in the invasion. It crossed into the northern [[Galilee]]. By the end of the conflict, however, it had been repulsed by Israeli forces, which occupied [[South Lebanon]]. Israel signed [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice agreement]]s with each of its invading neighbors. The armistice with Lebanon was signed on 23 March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On 8 May 1970, a PLO faction called the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP) crossed into Israel and carried out the [[Avivim school bus massacre]].

In reaction to the 1972 [[Munich massacre]], Israel carried out [[Operation Spring of Youth]]. Members of [[Sayeret Matkal|Israel's elite Special Forces]] landed by boat in Lebanon on 9 April 1973, and with the aid of [[Mossad|Israeli intelligence]] agents, infiltrated the PLO headquarters in Beirut and assassinated several members of its leadership.

In 1974 the PLO altered its focus to include political elements, necessary for a dialogue with Israel. Those who insisted on a military solution left to form the [[Rejectionist Front]], and [[Yassir Arafat]] took over the PLO leadership role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975â1990) was a complex conflict in the form of various factions and shifting alliances between and among Lebanese [[Maronite]] Catholics, Lebanese Muslims, Palestinian Muslims, Lebanese Druze, and other non-sectarian groups. Governmental power had been allotted among the different religious groups by the [[National Pact]] based partially on the results of the [[Demographics of Lebanon|1932 census]]. [[Demographics of Lebanon|Changes in demographics]] and increased feelings of deprivation by certain ethnic groups, as well as Israeli-Palestinian clashes in the south of the county all contributed to the outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mor 2002 192&quot;/&gt;

On 19 March 1978, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]], which called for Israel's immediate withdrawal and the establishment of a [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unifil/background.html|title=Lebanon â UNIFIL Background|year=2005|publisher=United Nations|accessdate= 2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Israel forces withdrew later in 1978, they turned over its positions in Lebanon to the South Lebanon Army which would continue fighting as a proxy for Israel against the PLO until Israel drove the PLO out of Lebanon in 1982.

On 22 April 1979, [[Samir Kuntar]] and three other members of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]], a sometimes faction of the PLO, landed in [[Nahariya|Nahariya, Israel]] from [[Tyre, Lebanon]] by boat. After killing a police officer who had discovered their presence, they took a father and his daughter hostage in an apartment building. After fleeing with the hostages from police back to the beach, a shootout killed one policeman and two of the invaders. Kuntar then executed the hostages before he and the remaining invader were captured.

In April 1981, the United States brokered a cease-fire in southern Lebanon among Israel, Syria and the PLO.

Fighting also occurred between Israel and [[Syria]]. The United States, fearing a widening conflict and the prestige the siege was giving PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]], got all sides to agree to a cease-fire and terms for the PLO's withdrawal on 12 August. The predominantly Muslim [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]] arrived to keep the peace and ensure PLO withdrawal. Arafat retreated from Beirut on 30 August 1982 and settled in [[Tunisia]].

The [[National Assembly of Lebanon]] narrowly chose [[Bachir Gemayel]] as [[president-elect]], but when he was assassinated on 14 September 1982, Israel reoccupied West Beirut and Maronite militias carried out the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]].

In 1983, the United States brokered the [[May 17 Agreement]], a peace treaty between Israel and Lebanon in all but name. The agreement called for a staged Israeli withdrawal over the next eight to twelve weeks and the establishment of a &quot;security zone&quot; to be patrolled by the Lebanese army in southern Lebanon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 1984, the [[Lebanese Army]] collapsed, with many units forming their own militias. The National Assembly of Lebanon, under pressure from Syria and Muslim militias, cancelled the May 17 Agreement on 5 March 1984.&lt;ref name=USSTATE/&gt;

On 16 February 1985, [[Shia]] Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin declared a [[manifesto]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hezbollah&quot;/&gt; in Lebanon, announcing a [[resistance movement]] called [[Hezbollah]], whose goals included combating the Israeli occupation. During the [[1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict]] the Hezbollah militia waged a guerrilla campaign against Israeli forces occupying Southern Lebanon and their [[South Lebanon Army]] proxies. &quot;Throughout the period of 1985-92, there were very few limited exchanges between Israeli and Hezbollah or Amal forces in southern Lebanon&quot;, and &quot;with the exception of 1988, during which twenty-one Israeli soldiers were killed, the number of Israeli fatalities per year over this period was in the single-digit figure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zeev Maoz]] ''Defending the Holy Land'' Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan 2006 &gt;[http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=166167]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1990 the [[Lebanese Civil War]] was effectively over. In March 1991, the [[National Assembly of Lebanon]] passed an amnesty law that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment, and in May 1991, the militiasâwith the important exceptions of Hezbollah and the SLAâwere dissolved, and the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] began to slowly rebuild themselves as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution.

In 1992, Hezbollah won ten out of 128 seats in the Lebanese [[Parliament of Lebanon|National Assembly]].

On 25 July 1993 Israel launched [[Operation Accountability]], known in Lebanon as the Seven-Day War, in retaliation for attacks by both Hezbollah and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command]] which had killed five soldiers in the security zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of buildings were bombed, resulting in 120 dead and 300,000 displaced civilians. Israeli forces also destroyed infrastructure such as power stations and bridges. Hezbollah retaliated with rocket attacks on Israeli villages, though inflicting significantly fewer casualties.

On 11 April 1996 Israel initiated [[Operation Grapes of Wrath]], which Hezbollah calls the April War, subsequent to Hezbollah launching missiles into Israel, which was in turn a response to the killing of two Lebanese by an IDF missile, and the killing of Lebanese boy by a road-side bomb. Israel conducted massive air raids and extensive shelling in southern Lebanon. 106 Lebanese died in the [[1996 shelling of Qana|shelling of Qana]], when a UN compound was hit in an Israeli shelling. The conflict ended on 26 April 1996 with the [[Israeli-Lebanese Ceasefire Understanding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From 1985 through 2000, Israel continued to fund the South Lebanon Army. In January 2000, Hezbollah assassinated the man responsible for day to day SLA operations, Colonel Akel Hashem.&lt;ref&gt;also spelled Aql Hashem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following its declaration of intent to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|UNSC Resolution 425]] on 1 April 1998, and after the collapse of the South Lebanon Army in the face of a Hezbollah onslaught, Israel declared 24 May 2000 that they would withdraw to their side of the UN designated border,&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]], 22 years after the resolution had been approved.

Heavy fire between the sides was exchanged across the length of the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]], with Hezbollah targeting IDF positions near Israeli towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNFIL&quot;/&gt;

Thus began the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. Israel responded with massive airstrikes and artillery fire on targets throughout Lebanon, an air and naval blockade, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. In Lebanon the conflict killed over 1,500 people, mostly civilians, severely damaged infrastructure, displaced about one million people.
