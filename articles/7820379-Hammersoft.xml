Significantly, however, it has never been government policy to create a British astronaut corps&lt;ref name=&quot;BNSC-human&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=UK vision to stay at the forefront of space sector published |url=http://www.bnsc.gov.uk/7203.aspx |accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to place a Briton on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

The UK government does not fund the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0265-9646(01)00039-X |journal=Space Policy |volume=17 |issue=4 |month=Nov |year=2001 |pages=249â255 |first=Duncan |last=Lunan |title=Promoting UK involvement in the ISS: a space station lifeboat?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the British government has changed this lack of emphasis on manned launches{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. The government has also begun backing a [[SSTO]] spaceplane concept called [[Skylon (spacecraft)]].

==Origin of the space programme==
Scientific interest in space travel existed in the [[United Kingdom]] prior to the [[World War II|Second World War]], particularly amongst members of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] (founded in 1933) whose members included Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]], author and conceiver of the geostationary telecommunications satellite, who joined the BIS after World War II.

As with the other post-war space-faring nations, the British government's interest in space was primarily military. Early programmes reflected this interest. As with other nations, much of the rocketry knowledge was obtained from captured German scientists who were persuaded to work for the British.  The British conducted the earliest post-war tests of captured [[V-2 rocket]]s in [[Operation Backfire (WWII)|Operation Backfire]], less than six months after the end of the war in Europe.

Initial work was done on smaller air to surface missiles such as ''[[Blue Steel missile|Blue Steel]]'' before progress was made towards launches of larger orbit-capable rockets.

==British launches==
Britain has launched several rockets and satellites. The [[Ariel space programme|Ariel]] programme developed 6 satellites between 1962 and 1979, all of which were launched by NASA. Development of a British launch system to carry a nuclear device took place from 1950 onwards, both in the United Kingdom and at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] in [[Australia]]. ''[[Falstaff (rocket)|Falstaff]]'', a British hypersonic test rocket, was launched from Woomera between 1969 and 1979.

Rockets were tested on the [[Isle of Wight]] and both tested and launched from Woomera. These included the ''[[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]]'' and ''[[Blue Streak missile|Blue Streak]]'' rockets and the ''[[Black Arrow]]'', a satellite launching rocket based on the ''Black Knight'' rocket. ''Black Arrow'' (R3) launched ''[[Prospero X-3]]'', the only British satellite to be launched using an all-British rocket. Communication with the satellite was terminated in 1996.

==Cancellation of the original government programme and formation of British National Space Centre==

The official British government programme of UK satellite launches was cancelled in the early 1970s{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.  However, UK participation in space continues through working with other space agencies.  In 1985 the [[British National Space Centre]] (BNSC) was formed to coordinate modern UK space activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnsc.gov.uk/5589.aspx |title=BNSC:How we work |accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however since 1986 the UK government has had a policy against human space flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNSC-human&quot;/&gt;

==British contribution to other nations' space programmes==

Communication and tracking of rockets and satellites in orbit is achieved using stations such as [[Jodrell Bank]]. During the [[Space Race]], [[Jodrell Bank]] and other stations were used to communicate with several satellites and probes including [[Sputnik]] and [[Pioneer 5]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

As well as providing tracking facilities for other nations, scientists from the United Kingdom have participated in other nation's space programmes{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, notably contributing to the development of [[NASA]]'s early space programs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Kranz]],  ''Failure is not an Option''&lt;/ref&gt; co-operation with Australian launches{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.  Private UK citizens banded together and partially funded [[Project Juno]] which launched British astronaut, [[Helen Sharman]] OBE on [[Soyuz TM-12]], with the remainder of the financial support coming from the USSR{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.  Through the [[British National Space Centre]] the British government provides 17.4% of the [[European Space Agency]]'s funding for mandatory projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnsc.gov.uk/6185.aspx |title=BNSC and ESA |accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this does not fund the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html |title=
European Participation, ISS Participating States |accessdate=2009-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent British space activities==
A revival of the official national space programme was seen in 1982 when the British government officially backed the HOTOL project, an ambitious attempt at a re-usable space plane using air-breathing rocket engines designed by [[Alan Bond (rocket developer)|Alan Bond]]. Work began at [[British Aerospace]]. However, having classified the engine design as 'top secret' the government then ended funding for the project, terminating it.

In 1985, a London-based government agency was formed to co-ordinate British contributions to civil space flight, the [[British National Space Centre]] (not to be confused with the [[National Space Centre]].)

Britain continues to contribute scientific elements to satellite launches and space projects. The recent British probe [[Beagle 2]], sent as part of the ESA's [[Mars Express]] to study the planet [[Mars]], was lost when it failed to respond. Beagle 2 was controlled from the [[National Space Centre]] in [[Leicester]]. The UK company [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]], considered 'The world's leading builder of micro-satellites', has built and launched over thirty satellites to date.

Interest in space continues in Britain's private sector with several British companies developing new designs for space planes for satellite launching or to cater to the new market in [[space tourism]]. [[Virgin Galactic]], a branch of the British-based Virgin group owned by Sir [[Richard Branson]] intends to sell space flights to the general public using space planes provided by Mojave Aerospace Ventures developed from [[Burt Rutan]]'s [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]]. SpaceShipTwo is scheduled for the first rollout in December 2009.

===2011 budget boost and reforms===
The UK government is proposing reform to the [[List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1980â1999#Public_Acts_7|1986 Outer Space Act]] in several areas, including the liabilities that cover space operations, in order to enable British [[private spaceflight|companies]] space endeavors to better [[competition|compete]] with international competitors.  There is also a proposal of {{currency|10000000|UK}} boost of capital investment that is to be matched by industry.&lt;ref name=bbc20110323&gt;
{{cite news |last=Amos|first=Jonathan |title=UK space given boost from Budget |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12833654 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |newspaper=BBC |date=2011-03-23 |quote=''reforms are designed to lower the sector's insurance costs and to make it easier for future space tourism companies to operate out of the UK.  The government says it has recognised the success the British space sector has achieved in recent years and wants to offer it further support to maintain and grow its global market position.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction Engines Skylon===
The British Government partnered with the [[ESA]] in 2010 to promote a [[single-stage to orbit]] [[spaceplane]] concept called [[Skylon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parabolicarc.com/2010/09/22/uksa-reviews-skylon-sabre/]&lt;/ref&gt; This design was pioneered by [[Reaction Engines Limited]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/faq.html#q6 Reaction Engines Limited FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukspaceagency.bis.gov.uk/19661.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; a company founded by [[Alan Bond (rocket developer)|Alan Bond]] after [[HOTOL]] was cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReactionEngines1&quot;&gt;[http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/ Reaction Engines Ltd 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The Skylon spaceplane has been positively received by the British government, and the [[British Interplanetary Society]].&lt;ref name=gh220211&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theglobalherald.com/space-the-development-of-single-stage-space-flight/11656/ |title= SSTO spaceplane is coming to Great Britain|author=Robert Parkinson |date= 2011-02-22|work=Space:The Development of Single Stage Flight |publisher=The Global Herald |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pending a successful engine test in June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Skylon Test Date|publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmbis/writev/735/73522.htm#Technological Background |author=|date=21 January 2011|accessdate = 2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company will begin Phase 3 of development with the first orders expected around 2011-2013.

==United Kingdom Space Agency==

On 1 April 2010, the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] established the [[UK Space Agency]], an agency responsible for the British space programme. It replaces the [[British National Space Centre]] and takes over responsibility for government policy and key budgets for space and represents the UK in all negotiations on space matters.

==British astronauts==

Because the UK government has never developed a manned spaceflight programme and does not contribute any funding to the manned space flight part of ESA's activities, the few British-born astronauts have launched with either the American or Russian space programmes. Despite this, on October 9, 2008, UK Science and Innovation Minister [[Paul Drayson, Baron Drayson|Lord Drayson]] spoke favourably of the idea of a British astronaut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7662416.stm Minister wants astronaut 'icon']&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, six '''British-born astronauts''' and one '''non-British born UK citizen''' have flown in space:

Dr. [[Anthony Llewellyn]] (born [[Cardiff]]) was selected as a scientist-astronaut by [[NASA]] in August 1967 but resigned in September 1968 having never flown in space.

Lt-Colonel [[Anthony Boyle]] (Army) (born [[Kidderminster]]), Lt-Colonel [[Richard Farrimond]] (Army) (born [[Birkenhead]], Cheshire), [[Christopher Holmes]] (MOD) (born London), Commander [[Peter Longhurst]] (RN) (born [[Staines]], Middlesex), and Squadron Leader [[Nigel Wood]] (RAF) (born York) were selected in February 1984 as payload specialists for the [[Skynet (satellites)|Skynet 4 Program]], which was to launch from the space shuttle. Boyle resigned from the program in July 1984 due to army commitments. Prior to the cancellation of the missions in the wake of the [[Challenger disaster]], Wood was due to fly aboard shuttle mission [[STS-61-H]] in 1986 (with Farrimond serving as his back-up), and Longhurst was due to fly aboard shuttle mission [[STS-71-D]] in 1987 (with Holmes serving as back-up). All resigned in 1986, having not flown.

Major [[Timothy Mace]] (Army Air Corps) (born [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick]], Yorkshire) served as back-up to Helen Sharman for the [[Soyuz TM-12]]/[[Project Juno]] mission in 1991. He resigned in 1991, having not flown.

On May 20, 2009, the [[European Space Agency]] announced that Major [[Timothy Peake]], a test pilot in the Army Air Corps who hails from [[Chichester]], [[West Sussex]], had been accepted into the [[European Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8058601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Europe unveils British astronaut | date=20 May 2009 | accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
