'''Vodafone India''', formerly '''Hutchison Essar''', is one of the largest [[mobile network operator]]s in [[India]] which operates nationally. It is based in [[Mumbai, Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.in/vodafone/Footer/pages/aboutus.aspx |title=Vodafone Essar Ltd: Vodafone India&amp;nbsp;â Mobile Communications worldwide |publisher=Vodafone.in |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2011, [[Vodafone Group]] agreed terms for the buy-out of its partner [[Essar]] from its Indian mobile phone business. The UK firm paid $5.46 billion to its Indian counterpart to take Essar out of its 33% stake in the Indian subsidiary. It will leave Vodafone owning 74% of the Indian business, while the other 26% will be owned by Indian investors, in compliance with Indian law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13996525 Vodafone finalises India mobile subsidiary buyout]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second largest [[mobile phone]] operator in terms of revenue behind [[Bharti Airtel]], and [[List of mobile network operators of the Asia Pacific region#India|third largest]] in terms of customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vodafone India&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/vodafones-india-revenues-rise-despite-tariff-war/539877/ Vodafoneâs India revenues rise despite tariff war]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Vodafone had about 134.5 million customers as of February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecomtalk.info/india-adds-14-5-million-gsm-subscribers-in-march-vodafone-leads/63436/#more-63436 India Adds 14.5 Million GSM Subscribers in March â Vodafone Leads]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February, 2007, Vodafone agreed to acquire the controlling interest of 67% held by [[Li Ka Shing]] Holdings in Hutch-Essar for US$11.1 billion, pipping [[Reliance Communications]], Hinduja Group, and Essar Group, which is the owner of the remaining 33%. The whole company was valued at [[USD]] 18.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/7eaef850-b9e3-11db-89c8-0000779e2340.html |title=/ Companies / Telecoms&amp;nbsp;â Investors welcome Vodafone deal |publisher=Ft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction closed on 8 May, 2007. Despite the official name being Vodafone Essar, its products are simply branded '''Vodafone'''. It offers both [[prepaid]] and postpaid [[GSM]] [[cellular phone]] coverage throughout India with good presence in the metros.

Vodafone Essar provides [[2.75G]] services based on 900&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz digital GSM technology. Vodafone Essar will launch [[3G]] services in the country in the January-March quarter of 2011 and plans to spend up to $500 million within two years on its 3G networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/telecom/Vodafone-to-launch-India-3G-services-in-Q1-2011/articleshow/6786557.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=News By Industry | date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Hutchison Essar (1992-2007)===
In 1992, [[Hutchison Whampoa]] and its Indian business partner â Max Group, established a company that in 1994 was awarded a licence to provide mobile telecommunications services in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) and launched commercial services as Hutchison Max in November 1995. In Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (East), Rajasthan and Haryana, [[Essar Group]] was the major partner. But later Hutch took the majority stake.

By the time of Hutchison Telecom's Initial Public Offering in 2004, Hutchison Whampoa had acquired interests in six mobile telecommunications operators providing service in 13 of India's 23 licence areas and following the completion of the acquisition of BPL Mobile that number increased to 16. In 2006, it announced the acquisition of a company (Essar Spacetel&amp;nbsp;â A subsidiary of Essar Group) that held licence applications for the seven remaining licence areas.

Initially, the company grew its business in the largest wireless markets in India&amp;nbsp;â in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. In these densely populated urban areas it was able to establish a robust network, well known brand and large distribution network â all vital to long-term success in India. Then it also targeted business users and high-end post-paid customers which helped Hutchison Essar to consistently generate a higher [[Average Revenue Per User]] (ARPU) than its competitors. By adopting this focused growth plan, it was able to establish leading positions in India's largest markets providing the resources to expand its footprint nationwide.

In February 2007, Hutchison Telecom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with a subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc to sell its 67% direct and indirect equity and loan interests in Hutchison Essar Limited for a total cash consideration (before costs, expenses and interests) of approximately $11.1 billion.

Hutch was often praised for its award winning advertisements which all follow a clean, minimalist look. A recurrent theme is that its message '''Hi&quot; stands out visibly though it uses only white letters on red background. Another successful ad campaign in 2003 featured a [[Cheeka (dog)|pug named Cheeka]] following a boy around in unlikely places, with the tagline, ''Wherever you go, our network follows.'' The simple yet powerful advertisement campaigns won it many admirers. Ads featuring the pug were continued by Vodafone even after rebranding.  The brand subsequently introduced [[ZooZoo]]s which gained even higher popularity than was created by the Pug. Vodafone's creative agency is O&amp;M while Harit Nagpal was the Marketing Director during the various phases of it's brand evolution.

===Vodafone acquires Essar's Stake===

On March 31, 2011, [[Vodafone|Vodafone Group Plc]] announced that it would buy an additional 33% stake in its Indian joint venture for $5 billion after partner [[Essar Group]] exercised an option to sell the holding in the mobile-phone operator. The deal will raise Vodafoneâs stake to 75%. Essar will exit the company after it implemented a [[put option]] over 22% of the venture. Vodafone exercised its [[call option]] to buy an 11% stake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-31/essar-exercises-option-to-sell-5-billion-stake-in-vodafone-essar-venture.html Vodafone to Buy Additional Essar India Stake for $5 billion â Bloomberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Vodafone granted options to Essar that would enable the conglomerate to sell its entire stake for $5bn, or to dispose of part of the 33 per cent shareholding at an independently appraised fair market value. In January 2011, Vodafone objected to Essarâs plans to place part of its 33% stake in India Securities, a small public company. Vodafone feared the move would give an inflated market value to Vodafone Essar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1c775758-5b6b-11e0-b965-00144feab49a.html#axzz1IB0EtLwd FT.com / Telecoms â Vodafone pays $5bn for Essar stake]&lt;/ref&gt; It had approached the market regulator SEBI and also filed a petition in the Madras High Court.

The final shareholding pattern post this deal was not provided by the company as it was not clear whether Vodafone's stake would exceed the 74 per cent FDI limit. Indian laws don't allow foreign companies to own more than 74% in a local mobile-phone operator. Vodafone has assured it will comply with local rules. Vodafone will have to sell that 1% to some Indian entity, or theyâll have to consider an initial public offering. Vodafone also said that final settlement is anticipated to be completed by November 2011. The completion of the deal would be subject to meeting certain conditions which include [[Reserve Bank of India]]'s permission as well as valuation of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://profit.ndtv.com/news/show/essar-exits-vodafone-essar-joint-venture-for-5-billion-147412 Essar exits Vodafone-Essar joint venture for $5 billion â NDTV Profit]&lt;/ref&gt;


#REDIRECT [[Vodafone-Hutch Deal Tax Case]]
===Vodafone-Hutchison Tax Case===
Vodafone is embroiled in a $2.5 billion tax dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department over its purchase of Hutshison Essar Telecom services in April 2007. It is being alleged by the Indian Tax authorities that the transaction involved purchase of assets of an Indian Company, and therefore the transaction, or part thereof is liable to be taxed in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/19f3ed16-a2f1-11e0-a9a4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1TaRdrI6x]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vodafone Group Plc. entered India in 2007 through a subsidiary based in the Netherlands, which acquired Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltdâs (HTIL) [[Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited]] stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd (HEL)âthe joint venture that held and operated telecom licences in India. This Cayman Islands transaction, along with several related agreements, gave Vodafone control over 67% of HEL and extinguished Hong Kong-based Hutchisonâs rights of control in India, a deal that cost the worldâs largest telco $11.2 billion at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/articles/2011/09/20231941/Deal-with-Hutch-was-8216art.html?atype=tp].&lt;/ref&gt;

The crux of the dispute till now has been whether or not the Indian Income Tax Department has jurisdiction over the transaction. Vodafone has maintained from the outset that it is not liable to pay tax in India, and even if tax were somehow payable, then it should be Hutchison to bear the tax liability.

The Supreme Court of India has concluded the final hearing on the case and the judgment will be issued soon. The verdict is likely to have a bearing on investment flows into India. China has since changed its laws to ensure that transactions of this nature fall within its tax web.

==3G==
On 19 May 2010, the 3G spectrum auction in India ended. Vodafone paid {{INR}} 11617.86 million (the second highest amount in the auctions) for spectrum in 10 circles. The circles it will provide 3G in are [[Delhi]], [[Kanpur]], [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Kolkata]], [[Maharashtra]] &amp; [[Goa]], [[Mumbai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] (East) and [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medianama.com/2010/05/223-3g-auction-india-ends-provisional-winners/ Indiaâs 3G Auction Ends; Operator And Circle-Wise Results â MediaNama]&lt;/ref&gt;
Vodafone also operates 3G services in [[Kerala]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and Uttar Pradesh (West) through an agreement with [[Idea Cellular|Idea]] and in [[Karnataka]] through an agreement with [[Airtel]].. This gives Vodafone a 3G presence in 13 out of 22 circles in India.

On 16 March, 2011, Vodafone launched 3G services in Uttar Pradesh (East) in the city of [[Lucknow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilebusinessbriefing.com/article/vodafone-launches-first-full-3g-service-in-india GSMA Mobile Business Briefing â Telecoms news from around the world]&lt;/ref&gt; Vodafone had already launched limited 3G services in [[Chennai]] and [[Delhi]] earlier, but the Uttar Pradesh (East) launch counts as its first fully commercial launch. This makes Vodafone the fifth private operator (seventh overall) to launch its 3G services in the country following [[Tata Docomo]], [[Reliance Communications]], [[Airtel (India)|Airtel]] and [[Aircel]].

On 23rd June, 2011 Vodafone launched 3G service in Kerala by joining with Idea in an Intra Circle Roaming agreement. Initially Vodafone 3G services will be available in the following cities in Kerala â Ernakulam, Aluva, Calicut, Koyilandy, Alappuzha, Cherthala, Malappuram and Manjeri.
