== History ==
[[Image:Kivett Hall May 2007.png|thumb|left|[[Kivett Hall]], built 1903]]
Campbell University was founded as a community school on January 5, 1887 called Buies Creek Academy.
It was founded  by North Carolina minister [[James Archibald Campbell]], under the conviction that no student should be denied admission because of lack of funds.  In 1926, the school attained [[junior college]] status and changed its name from Buies Creek Academy to Campbell Junior College. In 1961, Campbell became a [[senior college]]. The name was changed to Campbell University on June 6, 1979 with the addition of the [[Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law]].

== Campus ==
[[Image:D Rich Memorial.png|300px|thumb|right|D. Rich Memorial Building]]
Located in the [[Sandhills (Carolina)|Sandhills]] of southeastern [[North Carolina]], the University is nestled in the small unincorporated village of [[Buies Creek, North Carolina|Buies Creek]] near the [[Cape Fear River]].  The Buies Creek [[census-designated place]] population was only 2,215 in the [[2000 census]] and the surrounding area remains rural. However, Buies Creek is approximately {{convert|33|mi|km}} south of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], the state capital, North Carolina's second-largest city, and approximately {{convert|33|mi|km}} north of [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], North Carolina's  sixth-largest city.

The center of campus is Academic Circle, which fronts Leslie Campbell Avenue to the south.  Academic Circle is a grass thoroughfare, laced with sidewalks and magnolia trees that is surrounded on the south by dormitories Kitchin Hall (1955) and Baldwin Hall (1958) and along the north by the Frederick L. Taylor Hall of Religion (1973) ([[Campbell University Divinity School|Divinity School]]), D. Rich Memorial Building (1923), [[Kivett Hall]] (1903) (formerly [[Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law|Law School]]), Wiggins Hall (1993) (formerly [[Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law|Law School]]), Butler Chapel (2009) and Britt Hall (1947) (campus bookstore).

North of Academic Circle the buildings flank the newly developed Fellowship Commons, a series of brick sidewalks and gathering places that connect the campus from the west on T.T. Lanier Street to the east on Main Street.  In this part of campus are Marshbanks Dining Hall (1934), Leslie H. Campbell Hall of Science (1961), J.P. Riddle Pharmacy Center (1991), Maddox Hall (2007) ([[Campbell University School of Pharmacy|Pharmacy School]]), Pearson Hall (1915), Carrie Rich Memorial Library (1925), [[Carter Gymnasium]] (1952) and James A. Campbell Administration Building (1961).

Beyond Fellowship Commons lies the north campus which contains several residence halls along with the Taylor Bott Rogers Fine Arts Center (1984) and the [[Lundy-Fetterman School of Business]] (1999).  East of Main Street are more of Campbell's athletic facilities including, [[Taylor Field (Campbell University)|Taylor Field]] (baseball), Johnson Memorial Natatorium (swimming), and the [[John W. Pope, Jr. Convocation Center]] as well as the [[Buies Creek, North Carolina|Buies Creek]] [[post office]].

== Academics ==
Campbell offers over 100 tracks and concentrations; masterâs programs in business, education, pharmaceutical science, clinical research and divinity; and professional programs in law and pharmacy.  The University also makes study abroad and other special programs available.  Along with Campbell's premier undergraduate programs, the school has also achieved renown for its graduate programs.  Since its establishment in 1986, Campbell University School of Pharmacy has maintained a 99 percent passage rate on both state and national exams.  In ten of the last sixteen years, School of Pharmacy students have achieved a 100 percent passage rate on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX).  

The School of Law Class of 2006 scored a 97% passage rate on Julyâs North Carolina Bar Exam, topping all other law schools in the state. Campbell Universityâs Norman A. Wiggins School of Law was featured in the Princeton Reviewâs 2007 edition of the âBest 170 Law Schoolsâ publication. Graduates of the School of Law have frequently led in passage rates on the North Carolina Bar Exam since the schoolâs establishment in 1976, including a 100 percent passage rate in 1994, the first time all members of a graduation class accomplished that feat in North Carolina history.

The Campbell University Divinity school offers both undergraduate and graduate level degrees. The Divinity School officially opened on August 19, 1996. There thirty-five founding students enrolled the first year of the Divinity school. These students constituted the Charter Class of eighty-four students.

The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business offers a joint MBA with Pharm.D., J.D., and M.Div. students.  Also, undergraduate business students have the option of electing to stay a fifth year to earn a joint BBA/MBA.  Campbell is a dynamic institution in the wealth management industry by offering a one-of-a-kind degree, the Bachelor of Business Administration in Trust and Wealth Management.  Banks and financial institutions from around the country court Campbell students for paid summer internships and for permanent hire upon graduation. The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business also offers one of twenty PGA accredited golf programs in the United States.

Campbell University Board Chairman, Mr. Harold Wells, has announced that at its August 27, 2008 meeting, the Executive Committee of the Universityâs Board of Trustees received a favorable report regarding the addition of a masterâs program in Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS).  Subject to approval of the full Board of Trustees, the University will begin the development and accreditation process for the professional program, anticipating the enrollment of the first class in 2011.
