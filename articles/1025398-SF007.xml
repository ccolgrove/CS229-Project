==Hardware==
{{main|PlayStation}}
[[File:Playstation logo colour.svg|thumb|right|PlayStation brand logo|100px]]

Sony Computer Entertainment produces the [[PlayStation]] family of video game hardware consisting of consoles and handhelds. Sony's first wide home console release, the '''PlayStation''' (codenamed '''PSX''' during development, currently '''PSOne'''), was initially designed to be a [[CD-ROM]] drive add-on for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (a.k.a. Super Famicom in Japan) video game console, in response to [[Sega]]'s [[Sega CD]]. When the prospect of releasing the system as an add-on dissolved, Sony redesigned the machine into a stand alone unit. The PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994 and later in North America on September 9, 1995. 
Currently the highest selling home console of all time, SCE's second home console, the '''PlayStation 2''' ('''PS2''' or '''PSX2''') was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, and later in North America and Europe in October and November 2000, respectively. The PS2 is powered by a proprietary [[central processing unit]], the [[Emotion Engine]], and was the first video game console to have [[DVD]] playback functionality included out of the box. Initially, the system was criticized for its complex development environment, due mainly to the proprietary hardware included, however despite these complaints the PlayStation 2 received widespread support from [[third party developer]]s throughout its lifespan on the market. Today it has sold up to 150 million units world wide.
The '''PlayStation Portable''' ('''PSP''') is SCE's first foray into the small handheld console market, which was and to this date still is dominated by Nintendo. Its development was first announced during SCE's [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3]] conference in 2003, and it was officially unveiled during their E3 conference on May 11, 2004. The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005 and in Europe and Australia on September 1, 2005. The console has since seen two major redesigns, with new features including a smaller size, more internal memory, a better quality LCD screen and a lighter weight. A new design, the '''[[PSP Go]]''', was released on October 1, 2009 for North America and Europe and on November 1, 2009 for Japan. It has a 3.8&quot; [[LCD]] which slides up to reveal the main controls. The PSP Go is 45% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP and does not support UMD. The device does support [[Bluetooth]] and will be completely digital meaning all media must be downloaded or transferred to the device which has 16 GB of internal [[flash memory]].

The newest home console in the PlayStation family, as well as Sony's entry in the seventh-generation of consoles, the '''PlayStation 3''' ('''PS3''') was launched in November 2006. It utilizes a unique processing architecture, the [[Cell microprocessor]], a proprietary technology developed by Sony in conjunction with [[Toshiba]] and [[IBM]]. The graphics processing unit, the [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer']], was co-developed by [[Nvidia]] and Sony. Several variations of the PS3 have been released, each with slight hardware and software differences, each denoted by the varying size of the included hard disk drive.
The newest handheld console in the Playstation family is the '''PlayStation Vita'''.

Since its inception in 1993, SCE has also built up a large stable of third party developers that it often collaborates with in a variety of manners, from publishing to funding to co-development. These companies are however not owned or under contract by SCE, and some, unlike the studios within SCE WWS, also release and develop products in cooperation with competing video game developers and publishers, and for competing handheld and/or home consoles as well.
