The '''Edinger-Westphal nucleus''' is the accessory [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] [[cranial nerve nucleus]] of the [[oculomotor nerve]] ([[cranial nerve]] III), supplying the constricting [[muscle]]s of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. Alternatively, the '''Edinger-Westphal nucleus''' is a term often used to refer to the adjacent population of non-preganglionic neurons that do not project to the [[ciliary ganglion]], but rather project to the [[spinal cord]], [[dorsal raphe nucleus]], and lateral [[septal nuclei]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21452224&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kozicz T, Bittencourt JC, May PJ, Reiner A, Gamlin PD, Palkovits M, Horn AK, Toledo CA, Ryabinin AE |title=The Edinger-Westphal nucleus: A historical, structural and functional perspective on a dichotomous terminology |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. In press. |pmid=21452224 |doi= 10.1002/cne.22580 |url= |year=2011 |volume=519 |issue=8 |pages=1413â34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike the classical preganglionic '''Edinger-Westphal''' neurons that contain [[choline acetyltransferase]],  neurons of the non-preganglionic '''Edinger-Westphal nucleus''' contain various  neuropeptides, such as [[Urocortin]] and [[cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0306-4522(02)00772-8 | last1 = Kozicz | first1 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Neurons colocalizing urocortin and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript immunoreactivities are induced by acute lipopolysaccharide stress in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus in the rat | url = | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 116 | issue = 2| pages = 315â20 | pmid = 12559087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Previously, it had been proposed to rename this group of non-preganglionic, neuropeptide-containing neurons to perioculomotor subgriseal neuronal stream, abbreviated ''pIII&lt;sub&gt;SG&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18186029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=May PJ, Reiner AJ, Ryabinin AE |title=Comparison of the Distributions of Urocortin Containing and Cholinergic Neurons in the Perioculomotor Midbrain of the Cat and Macaque |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=507 |issue=3 |pages=1300â16 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18186029 |pmc=2863095 |doi=10.1002/cne.21514 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, more recently, a final nomenclature has been determined. Preganglionic oculomotor neurons within the Edinger-Westphal nucleus shall be referred to as the ''EWpg'', and the neuropeptide-containing neurons shall be known as the centrally-projecting Edinger Westphal nucleus, or ''EWcp''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21452224&quot;/&gt;

==Location==
The paired nuclei are [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] to the main motor nucleus ([[oculomotor nucleus]]) and anterolateral to the [[cerebral aqueduct]] in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] [[midbrain]] at the level of the [[superior colliculus]]. 

It is the most rostral of the parasympathetic nuclei in the [[brain stem]].

==Function==
The '''Edinger-Westphal nucleus''' supplies [[preganglionic]] parasympathetic fibers to the [[human eye|eye]], [[constriction|constricting]] the [[pupil]], [[accommodation reflex|accommodating]] the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]], and convergence of the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human&quot; EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]].  Chicago: EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been implicated in the [[Mirror neuron|mirroring]] of pupil size in sad facial expressions. When seeing a sad face, participants' pupils dilated or constricted to mirror the face they saw, which predicted both how sad they perceived the face to be, as well as activity within this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = NA | last2 = Wilson | first2 = CE | last3 = Critchley | first3 = HD | title = Processing of observed pupil size modulates perception of sadness and predicts empathy | journal = Emotion (Washington, D.C.) | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 724â9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18039039 | doi = 10.1037/1528-3542.7.4.724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = NA | last2 = Singer | first2 = T | last3 = Rotshtein | first3 = P | last4 = Dolan | first4 = RJ | last5 = Critchley | first5 = HD | title = Pupillary contagion: central mechanisms engaged in sadness processing | journal = Social cognitive and affective neuroscience | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 5â17 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17186063 | pmc = 1716019 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsl006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponym==
The nucleus is named for both [[Ludwig Edinger]], from [[Frankfurt]], who demonstrated it in the [[fetus]] in 1885, and for [[Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal]], from [[Berlin]], who demonstrated it in the [[adult]] in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|893}}&lt;/ref&gt;
