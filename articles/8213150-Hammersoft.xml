{{nihongo|'''Daisuke &quot;Dice&quot; Murakami'''|æä¸ å¤§ä»|Murakami Daisuke|extra=born January 15, 1991, in [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]], [[Japan]]}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[figure skater]] who previously represented the United States in international competition. He is the [[Japan Junior Figure Skating Championships|2009 Japanese Junior bronze medalist]] and the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|2006 U.S. Junior pewter medalist]].

==Personal life==
The Murakami family moved to the United States in 2000 from Japan after winning a green-card lottery to become US residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=35485 Mroz Leaps from 11th to Second; Murakami Finishes Third at JGP Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt; Daisuke, nicknamed &quot;Dice&quot;, began skating soon after. 

Murakami is a two-time recipient of the [[Michael Weiss (figure skater)#Michael Weiss Foundation|Michael Weiss Foundation]] scholarship, which is a scholarship program created to help young American figure skaters.

==Career==
Murakami began skating at age nine.&lt;ref name =st060425&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.skatetoday.com/2006/04/25/japans-loss-is-americas-gain/ | title = Japanâs Loss is Americaâs Gain | last = Mittan | first = Barry | date = April 25, 2006 | publisher = SkateToday | accessdate = August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began competing on the Juvenile level in 2001. He moved up the competition ladder and made his Nationals debut at the 2004 United States Figure Skating Championships, where he won the silver medal. This earned him a trip to the 2004 [[Triglav Trophy]], which he won.

Moving up to the Junior level for the following season, Murakami was given a Junior Grand Prix assignment to [[Beijing]], [[China]], where he placed 11th. At the 2005 Pacific Coast sectional championships, the last step to qualifying for Nationals, Murakami placed 6th and did not qualify for the 2005 Nationals. 

He stayed on the Junior level for the 2005â2006 season. Murakami won both his Regional and Sectional championships and then placed 4th at Nationals, winning the pewter medal. The [[USFSA]] selected the top three Junior skaters that year to go to the [[2006 World Junior Figure Skating Championships]]. Murakami, by placing 4th, would have otherwise been the first alternate. However, one of the skaters who placed ahead of him was not Junior-age-eligible internationally and so Murakami was sent. At the World Junior Championships, Murakami, who is perfectly bilingual in English and Japanese, served as the interpreter for his friend [[Takahiko Kozuka]] at the competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=33392 Bronze for Davis and White at World Junior Championships]&lt;/ref&gt;  He placed 11th at the Junior Worlds. 

In the 2006â2007 season, Murakami moved up to the senior level nationally and won his first international Junior medal, the bronze at the Junior Grand Prix event in [[Mexico City]]. He won the silver medal at sectionals, qualifying him for the 2007 Nationals, where he placed 15th. Murakami was not selected for the 2007 Junior Worlds team.

Following the 2006/2007 season, Murakami was released by the [[USFSA]] to skate for Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/Combined%20ROA%205-7-06%20thru%205-5-07.pdf Combined Report of Action]|169&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 173177 bytes --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murakami has begun competing in Japan nationals-qualifying competitions. While skating for America, he represented the All Year Figure Skating Club.

Murakami began his 2007â2008 season skating at the junior level at the Japanese regional championships, Kinki Regionals. There, he placed second, less than .70 points behind winner [[Yukihiro Yoshida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatingjapan.jp/National/2007-2008/fs/block5/data0390.htm 2007 Kinki Figure Skating Championships]&lt;/ref&gt; He then won Japanese Western Sectionals on the junior level with a score of 163.30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatingjapan.jp/National/2007-2008/fs/west/data0390.htm 2007 Western Junior Championships]&lt;/ref&gt; He placed 2nd in the short program and 5th overall at the [[2007â2008 Japan Figure Skating Championships|2007-2008 Japanese Junior Figure Skating Championships]] with an overall score of 156.97 points&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatingjapan.jp/National/2007-2008/fs/national_jr/data0190.htm ç¬¬76åå¨æ¥æ¬ãã£ã®ã¥ã¢ã¹ã±ã¼ãã¸ã¥ãã¢é¸ææ¨©å¤§ä¼&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was not invited to compete at the senior nationals. In that season, he represented Osaka Skating Club.

In the 2008â2009 season, Murakami made his Junior Grand Prix debut for Japan. He competed at the [[2008â2009 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] event in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. He was second in the short program and fourth in the free skating, placing fourth overall.
