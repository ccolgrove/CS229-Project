'''''Foolproof''''' is a [[2003 in film|2003]] [[Canada|Canadian]] [[heist film]] directed by [[William Phillips (director)|William Phillips]] and starring [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[David Suchet]], [[Kristin Booth]], Joris Jarsky, and James Allodi. It was the first attempt by a Canadian studio to create a heist movie, in the same vein as ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]''. The film was a major financial failure and received mostly mediocre reviews.

The movie was filmed in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], and produced by [[Alliance Atlantis]] Communications and [[Ego Film Arts]] and released theatrically on October 3, 2003, by [[Odeon Films]] in Canada and [[Momentum Pictures]] of the [[United Kingdom]].

In Canada, it was released in 204 theatres, more than any other movie in the past. Under [[Telefilm Canada]] rules stating the movie producers must have a good script and firm distribution deals to get a grant of more than [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1,000,000, Telefilm granted ''Foolproof'' [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3,400,000. The entire budget was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]7,800,000.

== Plot ==
The movie centres around a group of friends: Kevin (played by Reynolds), Sam (Booth) and Rob (Jarsky). They play a game, known as &quot;Foolproof&quot;, in which they create working plans to infiltrate and [[burglary|burgle]] various targets. They do not actually execute these heists, preferring to simply simulate them.

All is fine until a famous criminal, Leo Gillete (Suchet), steals the trio's plans to burglarize a jewelry company and accomplishes the heist. He then [[blackmail]]s the group into designing and executing a plan to steal $20 million in bonds from a bank. Tension escalates within the group as Rob befriends Leo, while Kevin and Sam attempt to hinder his plans.
