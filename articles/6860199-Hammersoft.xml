'''WMYT-TV''' is  the [[MyNetworkTV]]-affiliate in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].  It broadcasts on digital channel 39 and [[virtual channel]] 55. Its branding refers to its position on channel 12 on Charlotte area cable systems.  It is owned by [[Capitol Broadcasting Company]] along with [[WJZY]].  It is licensed to [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]], making it the only commercial station licensed to the South Carolina side of the Charlotte market.  However, it shares a studio with WJZY in northwest Charlotte, and maintains transmitter facilities in [[Dallas, North Carolina]].

==History==
The station began on October 21, 1994 as WFVT, an independent station owned by &quot;Family 55,&quot; an [[Indiana]]-based group.  It was operated by WJZY through a [[local marketing agreement]].  It became a charter WB affiliate in 1995, and shortly after that rebranded itself as ''&quot;WB55&quot;''.  After the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] relaxed ownership restrictions in 2000, WJZY's owners bought the station outright and changed the calls to WWWB in 2001.  Over the years, channel 55 was one of The WB's strongest affiliates. From 2000-2002 the station had a 10 pm newscast produced by [[WCNC-TV]].

Shortly after My Network TV was announced, WWWB was announced as the network's Charlotte affiliate.  Its sister station, WJZY, had already joined [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], a merger of UPN and The WB, effective September that year.[http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=40486] This gave Charlotte the nation's first duopoly of The CW and My Network affiliates. 

On April 28, 2006, WWWB changed its call letters to '''WMYT-TV''', in anticipation of its new affiliation. [http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/entertainment/television/14257209.htm]  WMYT has been the over-the-air home for the NBA's [[Charlotte Bobcats]] starting with the 2006-07 season.

For a time in 2006 and 2007, WMYT erected several advertising signs around the Charlotte area describing several Charlotte landmarks as &quot;my ___.&quot;  In May 2007, it leased one of its [[digital subchannel]]s to [[WGTB-LP]], a low-powered religious station.

Channel 55 had previously been home to a Rock Hill-based low-powered repeater of [[South Carolina Educational Television]] from [[1974]] to [[1978]], when SCETV programming moved to a full-powered satellite, WNSC-TV on channel 30.

==Digital programming==
The station's digital signal is multiplexed. WMYT-TV ended analog operations on June 12, 2009, as part of the [[DTV transition in the United States]]. The station continues broadcasting on UHF channel 39, as channel 55 is to be re-allocated nationwide for [[Qualcomm]]'s [[MediaFLO]] system. However, digital television receivers display its [[virtual channel]]s as 55. In August 2011, it downgraded its HD signal from 1080i to 720p, as MyNetworkTV uses that particular format.
