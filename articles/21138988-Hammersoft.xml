The '''Florida Gators softball''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[softball]].  The Florida Gators compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  The Gators play their home games at [[Katie Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium]] on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Tim Walton]].  In the thirteen-year history of the Gators softball program, the team has won three SEC championships and have made four appearances in the [[Women's College World Series]].

== History ==
=== Ray era: 1997&amp;ndash;2001 ===

On June 13, 1995, the board of directors of the [[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Association]] approved the addition of a women's softball team to the University of Florida's athletic program.  Larry Ray, who would coach the Gators for three seasons, agreed to be the first head coach on September 4, 1995.  After the construction of their new stadium facility, the Gators played their first games in a doubleheader on February 8, 1997 against the [[Stetson Hatters]], both of which they won.

In the inaugural year of the Florida Gators softball program, Ray's team posted an overall win-loss record of 42&amp;ndash;25 and a Southeastern Conference record of 16&amp;ndash;8, and was the runner-up in the [[SEC Softball Tournament]] runner-up, ultimately losing to the second-ranked [[South Carolina Gamecocks softball|South Carolina Gamecocks]] in the title game.  The Gators built on the early success of their first season to win the program's first-ever SEC regular season championship in 1998, and advance to the [[NCAA Division I Softball Championship|NCAA Tournament]].  After the 2001 season, Ray left Florida to return to an assistant coaching position with the [[Arizona Wildcats softball]] team at the [[University of Arizona]], where he previously coached.

=== Johns era: 2001&amp;ndash;2005 ===

For the 2002 season, Ray was replaced by Karen Johns.  Under Johns, the Gators qualified for the NCAA Tournament four of five season, and compiled a record of 192&amp;ndash;131 during her tenure in Gainesville.  After the Gators finished third in the SEC Eastern Division for the fourth straight season, and suffered four consecutive losses in the 2005 SEC Tournament and the opening round of the NCAA tournament, Johns was fired.

=== Walton era: 2006&amp;ndash;present ===

To replace Johns, Florida athletic director [[Jeremy Foley]] hired the then-head coach of the [[Wichita State Shockers]] softball team, [[Tim Walton]], as the Gators' new coach.  Under Walton, the Gators softball team has become a consistent SEC and national title contender.

==== 2008 World Series ====

In his third season as the Gators' head coach, he led the team to an NCAA single season record seventy wins and five losses.  The team also made its first-ever [[2008 Women's College World Series|Women's College World Series]] (WCWS) appearance after beating the [[California Golden Bears]], two games to none, in the Gainesville Super Regional of the NCAA tournament.  After losing its opening game of the WCWS to [[LouisianaâLafayette Ragin' Cajuns|Louisiana Lafayette]], the Gators won three straight against games the [[Virginia Tech Hokies]] and [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies]].  However, in the double-elimination format of the NCAA Tournament, the Gators needed to beat Texas A&amp;M twice in the WCWS semifinals to move into the championship final series.  That second semifinal game went two extra innings before either team scored, and the Aggies earned the 1&amp;ndash;0 victory in the ninth inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Enea Home Runs Force Second Semifinal Game at WCWS|url=http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=14078}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gators pitcher [[Stacey Nelson]] ended the 2008 season with single-season school records in wins (47), strikeouts (363), innings pitched (352.1), and earned run average (0.75).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Gators Single Season Softball Records|url=http://www.gatorzone.com/softball/history/records/season.pdf|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2009 World Series ====

The Gators began their 2009 season ranked No. 1 in the country in both major college softball polls, but finished second after falling 8&amp;ndash;0 and 3&amp;ndash;2 to the [[Washington Huskies]] in the best-of-three-games final championship series of the [[2009 Women's College World Series]].  The Gators compiled an overall record of 63&amp;ndash;5 and completed its SEC regular season with a record of 26&amp;ndash;1.  They also broke the SEC single-season record for home runs (86), and several single-season team records including grand slams (12), total shutouts (39), and consecutive shutouts (11).  Aja Paculba set the single-season stolen base record (27), Francesca Enea broke the career home run record (41) in her junior season, and the Florida pitching staff threw three no-hitters in the regular season (Stephanie Brombacher vs. Coastal Carolina; Stacey Nelson vs. Ole Miss and Arkansas).  Nelson was named the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award winner and the SEC Pitcher of the year for the second straight year.  Nelson was named to the All-American first team (pitcher), and Brombacher (pitcher), Enea (outfielder), Kelsey Bruder (outfielder), and Paculba (second baseman) were named to the second team.

==== 2010 World Series ====

The 2010 Gators softball team again qualified for the NCAA tournament, and advanced to the [[2010 Women's College World Series]].  In the opening game of the Series, the fourth-seeded Gators were decisively defeated 16&amp;ndash;3 by the [[UCLA Bruins]], who ultimately won the 2010 championship.  The Gators recovered to eliminate the ninth-seeded [[Missouri Tigers]] 5&amp;ndash;2, before being edged 3&amp;ndash;2 and eliminated in turn by the sixth-seeded [[Georgia Bulldogs]].

==== 2011 World Series ====

During the 2011 season, the Gators experienced a series of up-and-down streaks, but recovered to win the SEC Eastern Division for the fourth consecutive year.  After being upset by the [[Auburn Tigers]] in the first round of the SEC tournament, the Gators qualified for the NCAA tournament and advanced to the [[2011 Women's College World Series]].  In the World Series semifinals, the Gators twice defeated the SEC champion [[Alabama Crimson Tide]], 16&amp;ndash;2 and 9&amp;ndash;2, to advance to the finals.  The top-ranked [[Arizona State Sun Devils softball|Arizona State Sun Devils]], in turn, swept the Gators, 14&amp;ndash;4 and 7&amp;ndash;2, in the best-of-three championship finals.
