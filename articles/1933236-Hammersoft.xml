==Career==
Shankar began his career as an assistant to film directors like [[S. A. Chandrasekhar]] and [[Pavithran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nilacharal.com&quot;/&gt; His first break in Hindi films was as an assistant director to [[S. A. Chandrasekhar]] in [[Jai Shiv Shankar]] produced by [[Rajesh Khanna]]. In 1993, he made his directional debut through ''[[Gentleman (film)|Gentleman]]''. Starring [[Arjun Sarja]] in the lead role, the film was made with a higher budget in [[Tamil cinema]] during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/features/Interviews/Interview1/html/sankar_interview.html |title=Director Shankar's Interview |publisher=Behindwoods |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. R. Rahman]], the film's composer continued to work with Shankar in his following 6 directorial ventures. His second film ''[[Kadhalan]]'', a romantic-action film was released in the following year, had [[Prabhu Deva]] in the lead role. In 1996, he colloborated with [[Kamal Haasan]] for ''[[Indian (1996 film)|Indian]]''. The film was both critically acclaimed as well as a commercial success. The film was selected as the country's submission for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Following the success of ''Indian'', Shankar began to work on ''[[Jeans (film)|Jeans]]'', yet another high-budgeted film surpassing ''[[Ratchagan]]''. The film released in 1998, enjoyed phenomenal success in India. 

He made his production debut through ''[[Mudhalvan]]'' (1999), was launched with [[Rajinikanth]] playing the lead. After the actor cited schedule conflicts,  [[Arjun Sarja]] joined the project. At the same time, Shankar started to work on his next film which was supposed to be a [[science fiction film]] titled ''Robot'', but the project could not move forward due to an immensely large budget. Instead, he opted to remake ''Mudhalvan'' in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] as ''[[Nayak (2001 film)|Nayak]]'', thus making his [[Bollywood]] debut.

His musical entertainer film ''[[Boys (2003 film)|Boys]]'' was released in 2003, and is his only commercial failure till date. His [[psychological thriller]] ''[[Anniyan]]'', featuring [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]] in three distinct characters was released in 2005 with [[Harris Jayaraj]] as the composer for his film. Shortly after the release of ''Anniyan''', it was reported that Shankar had teamed up with Rajinikanth and [[AVM Productions]] for a film. His renewed his association with A. R. Rahman with the film. [[Sivaji]] was made at a budget of {{INR}} 60 [[crores]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/Movies/Telugu/Sivaji-The-Boss-Now-playing/articleshow/2130888.cms|title=Sivaji â The Boss (Now Playing)|quote=Made on a budget of about Rs 75 Crores...|date=2007-06-18|work=[[Indiatimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most expensive Indian film at that time. After two years of filming, the film released in 2007 with much fanfare and hype across the globe. Ultimately it went on to become the highest grossing Tamil film of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Business Standard |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=290977 |title=Eros buys Tamil film distributor |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Sivaji'', Shankar revisited the possibility of beginning his shelved science fiction venture. After an unsuccessful attempt to bring the project to [[Bollywood]] with [[Shahrukh Khan]] in the lead, he later decided to make the project in [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] with [[Rajinikanth]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]]. The film was produced by South Indian [[media proprietor]], [[Kalanithi Maran]], and was renamed as ''[[Enthiran]]'' and was made on a budget of {{INR}} 132 [[crores]], the [[List of most expensive non-English-language films|most expensive Indian film]]. The film broke [[Sivaji (film)|Sivaji's]] record and became the highest grossing Tamil film as well as the highest grossing Indian film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/142049/rajinikanth-starrer-robot-grosses-rs-375-crore.html |title=Rajinikanth's 'Robot' biggest grosser of all time |publisher=IBN Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/media/entertainment-/entertainment/rajini-adds-30-to-maran-cos-revenue/articleshow/7394423.cms|title=Rajinikanth adds 30% to Kalanithi Maran's Sun TV Network revenue|publisher=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial reports indicating that Shankar's next film is entitled to be with Siddharth, Shankar started to work as the director of ''[[Nanban (film)|Nanban]]'', the Tamil remake of the 2009 Hindi film ''[[3 Idiots]]'' starring [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]], [[Jeeva (actor)|Jeeva]] and [[Srikanth (actor)|Srikanth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/sep-10-01/vijay-kaavalan-rascal-02-09-10.html |title=Vijay - Tamil Movie News - Vijayâs next titled Rascal? - Vijay &amp;#124; Shankar &amp;#124; 3 Idiots &amp;#124; Rascal &amp;#124; Kaavalan |publisher=Behindwoods.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
