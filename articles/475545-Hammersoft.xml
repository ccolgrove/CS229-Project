==Career==
Robinson was drafted by the Orioles as an amateur [[free agent]] in [[1955 Baltimore Orioles season|1955]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=robinbr01 Brooks Robinson: Trades and Transactions]. - Baseball Almanac.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1964 Baltimore Orioles season|1964]], Robinson had his best season offensively, hitting for a .318 [[batting average]] with 28 [[home run]]s and led the league with 118 [[runs batted in]], winning the [[American League]] [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks Robinson at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1964 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1964.shtml#ALmvp 1964 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results]. - [[Baseball-Reference]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the American League MVP voting, he received 18 of the 20 first-place votes, with [[Mickey Mantle]] finishing second.&lt;ref name=&quot;1964 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; In [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|1966]], he was voted the [[1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] Most Valuable Player, and finished second to team mate [[Frank Robinson]] in the American League Most Valuable Player Award voting, as the Orioles went on to win the [[1966 World Series]] against the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Post-season Awards at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/postmvp.shtml Post-season Awards]. - [[Baseball-Reference]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/yr1966as.shtml 1966 All Star Game]. - Baseball Almanac.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1966.shtml#ALmvp 1966 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results]. - [[Baseball-Reference]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1966_WS.shtml 1966 World Series]. - [[Baseball-Reference]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the [[1970 Baltimore Orioles season|1970]] post-season, Robinson hit for a .583 [[batting average]] in the [[1970 American League Championship Series]] against the [[1970 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks Robinson post-season statistics at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinbr01.shtml#batting_postseason Brooks Robinson post-season statistics]. - [[Baseball-Reference]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[1970 World Series]] against the [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], Robinson had a .429 batting average with 2 home runs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks Robinson post-season statistics at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; however, it was his defensive prowess at third base that stood out, making several impressive plays during the series that robbed the Reds of apparent base hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN: Top 10 Plays of All Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Jayson, Stark |url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/stark_jayson/1191205.html |title=Top 10 Plays of All Time |publisher=[[ESPN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Condon, David |date=January 1971  |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WjMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=brooks+robinson+baseball+digest#v=onepage&amp;q=brooks%20robinson%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false |title=The Incomparable Brooks Robinson |journal=Baseball Digest |volume=30| issue =  1 |issn=0005-609X. }}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance won him the [[World Series MVP Award]] presented by [[SPORT (magazine)|''SPORT'']],&lt;ref name=&quot;Post-season Awards at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; as well as the [[Hickok Belt]] as top professional athlete of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/robinsonbrooks.shtml Brooks Robinson at hickok sports]&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1970 World Series, [[Cincinnati Reds]] [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Sparky Anderson]] quipped, &quot;I'm beginning to see Brooks in my sleep.

In his playing career, Robinson was selected for the All-Star team in 15 consecutive years ({{by|1960}}-[[1974 in baseball|74]]), and played in four [[World Series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks Robinson at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He compiled a .267 career batting average with 2,848 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]], 268 home runs and 1357 runs batted in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks Robinson at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Robinson led the American League in [[fielding percentage]] a record 11 times, and at the time of his retirement, his .971 career fielding average was the highest ever for a third baseman.&lt;ref name=OSheiT-BD-1995&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Shei, Tim |date=June 1995 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pCsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=brooks+robinson+baseball+digest#v=onepage&amp;q=brooks%20robinson%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false |title=Tips on Third Base Defense Shared by Brooks Robinson |journal=[[Baseball Digest]] |volume=54| issue =  6 |issn=0005-609X }}&lt;/ref&gt; His totals of 2870 [[games played]] at third base, 2697 career [[putout]]s, 6205 career [[Assist (baseball)|assists]], 8902 career [[total chances]] and 618 [[double play]]s, were records for third basemen at the time of his retirement.&lt;ref name=OSheiT-BD-1995 /&gt; Robinson's 23 seasons with one team set a new major league record, since tied by [[Carl Yastrzemski]]. Only Yastrzemski (3308), [[Hank Aaron]] (3076) and [[Stan Musial]] (3026) played more games for one franchise.&lt;ref name=OSheiT-BD-1995 /&gt; Robinson also hit into four [[triple plays]] during his career, a major league record. He commented, &quot;I wouldn't mind seeing someone erase my record of hitting into four triple plays.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/quobrob.shtml Brooks Robinson Quotes]. - Baseball Almanac.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
When the Orioles started their team Hall of Fame, Brooks and [[Frank Robinson]] were the first two men inducted. Following his retirement as a player, Robinson began a successful career as a [[color commentator]] for the Orioles' [[television]] broadcasts. In 1982, local television WMAR's on air news team in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] [[WMAR-TV#History|went on strike]] and picketed the [[WMAR]] headquarters for the two months approaching the baseball season. When Robinson refused to cross the picket line, WMAR management re-opened the negotiations and the strike ended the next day.

==Honors==

At the conclusion of his final season in [[1977 Baltimore Orioles season|1977]], his jersey number 5 was retired by the Orioles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/bal/history/retired_numbers.jsp Baltimore Orioles retired numbers]. - Major League Baseball. - [[MLB.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], one of only 16 players to have been honored on the first ballot (not including the five charter members chosen in the first election in 1936).&lt;ref name=BR-NBHofF /&gt; Considered among the greatest all-time Orioles, Robinson and the man usually considered the greatest [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colt]] football player, [[Johnny Unitas]], had plaques in their honor in the lobby of Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. When the Orioles played their last game there on October 6, 1991, Robinson and Unitas were invited to throw out the ceremonial first balls. (Unitas threw a football.) After the conclusion of the game, several Oriole players took the field in the uniforms of their time and stood at their old positions on the field, Robinson was chosen to be the first player to come out ([[Cal Ripken Jr.|Cal Ripken, Jr.]] was chosen to be the last). 

In 1999, he ranked Number 80 on [[Sporting News|''The Sporting News'']] list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was elected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ &quot;100 Greatest Baseball Players&quot;]. - ''[[Sporting News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp &quot;The Major League Baseball All-Century Team&quot;]. - Major League Baseball. - [[MLB.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A longtime supporter of [[Scouting]], Robinson served for many years on the executive board of the Baltimore Area Council, [[Boy Scouts of America]] and is a recipient of the [[Silver Beaver Award]]. On December 5, 2006 he was recognized for his accomplishments on and off of the field when he received the [[Bobby Bragan Youth Foundation]] ''Lifetime Achievement Award''. On May 16, 2007, Radio Tower Drive, a road in [[Pikesville, Maryland]] was renamed &quot;Brooks Robinson Drive&quot; in honor of Robinson's 70th birthday. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baltimore County Digest |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=May 16, 2007 |page=4.B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2008, the [[York Revolution|minor league team]] in [[York, Pennsylvania]], where Robinson got his start, held a ceremony honoring him for being voted as a member on the [[Rawlings_Gold_Glove_Award#All-time Gold Glove Team|All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawlingsgoldglove.com/about/all_time_winners &quot;Rawlings All Time Gold Glove Award winners&quot;]. - Rawlings Gold Glove. - [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]].&lt;/ref&gt; The award was created by Rawlings and voted by fans to celebrate the golden anniversary of the award.

On October 22, 2011, a statute was unveiled on Washington Boulevard in downtown Baltimore depicting Robinson preparing to throw out a runner at first base. Robinson was present for the unveiling of the statute and commented that it &quot;gave him more hair than he deserved&quot;. The statute weighs more than 1,500 lbs, is dark gray in color with the exception of a gold colored fielders's baseball glove.  It is located about 300 yards away from the [[Camden Yards]] statute of [[Babe Ruth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-10-22/sports/bal-brooks-robinson-statue-brooks-robinson-immortalized-with-baltimore-statue-20111022_1_washington-boulevard-plaza-statue-babe-ruth-birthplace-foundation

*In 2008, Brooks released a charity wine called Brooks Robinson Chardonnay with all of his proceeds donated to the Baltimore Community Foundation in a fund created in the name of Brooks and his wife Connie Robinson.

*Brooks Robinson currently serves as president of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association (MLBPAA), an organization that assists players and fans to interact off the field. Major League legends [[Bob Boone]], [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]], [[Chuck Hinton]], [[Mike Hegan]], [[Robin Yount]], [[Rusty Staub]], [[Carl Erskine]] and [[Al Kaline]] preside as Vice Presidents. As well as the non-profit missions of the MLBPAA, the organization assists former major-leaguers through its wholly owned for-profit organizations MLAM (Major League Alumni Marketing), and MLAS (Major League Alumni Services). MLAM goals include implementing a player pool and gaining compensation for former players through appearances and endorsements, while protecting the name and likeness of former players from unauthorized uses.

Robinson is one of the investors in the [[Opening Day Partners]] group, of which owns four teams in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. The group named the Brooks Robinson Plaza at the entrance of [[Sovereign Bank Stadium]] in York, Pennsylvania in his honor. In the 1970s, Robinson published his autobiography entitled ''Third Base is My Home''.  

He met his future wife, Constance Louise &quot;Connie&quot; Butcher,&lt;ref name=MoritzC-1974 /&gt; on an Orioles team flight from Kansas City to Boston in July 1959, where she was working as a [[flight attendant]] for United Air Lines.  He was so smitten with her that he kept ordering iced teas from her.  Some of his teammates encouraged him to go talk to her.&lt;ref name=HuntJ-CW-1965 /&gt;  After drinking his third glass, he returned it to her in the galley.  There he told her: &quot;I want to tell you something.  If any of these guys, the Baltimore Orioles, ask you for a date, tell 'em you don't date married men.  Understand?  I'm the only single guy on the team.&quot;  Before the plane landed in Boston the two had made a date to go out.  He was not the only bachelor on the flight, something he lied about to keep her from talking to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Eck, Frank |date=August 11, 1971 |title=Requesting Iced Tea Paid Off For Brooks |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Free LanceâStar]] |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brooks and Constance were married in her hometown of Windsor, Ontario, Canada on October 8, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Eck, Frank |date=October 9, 1960 |title=Brooks Robinson Marries |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2011, Robinson was admitted to [[Greater Baltimore Medical Center]] for emergency surgery after he developed an infection and fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jill|title=Fans wish Orioles legend Brooks Robinson a speedy recovery|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-md-brooks-robinson-update-20110402,0,3183819.story|accessdate=20 April 2011|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the two weeks he spent in the hospital, he received an outpouring of letters and well-wishes from fans around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Tyler|title=Brooks Robinson Released From GBMC, Thanks Fans for Support|url=http://towson.patch.com/articles/brooks-robinson-released-from-gbmc-thanks-fans-for-support|accessdate=20 April 2011|newspaper=Towson, MD Patch|date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had also previously been successfully treated for prostate cancer in 2009. 

Robinson was raised a [[Methodist]], and is now a [[Roman Catholic]], having converted in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1971 |title= |journal=[[Newsweek]] |volume=77 |issue=1â8 |page=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the greatest accolades he received as a player came from his opponents. After the [[1970 World Series]] upon seeing him receive his [[World Series MVP]] award ceremony in which he received a brand new [[Toyota]] as part of his award, [[Cincinnati Reds]] catcher [[Johnny Bench]] said, &quot;Gee! If we had known he wanted a new car that bad, we'd have chipped in and bought him one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN: Top 10 Plays of All Time&quot;/&gt;
