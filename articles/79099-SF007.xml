'''Maple''' is a general-purpose commercial [[computer algebra system]]. It was first developed in 1980 by the Symbolic Computation Group at the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

Since 1988, it has been developed and sold commercially by [[Waterloo Maple|Waterloo Maple Inc.]] (also known as Maplesoft), a [[Canada|Canadian]] company also based in Waterloo, Ontario. The current major version is version 15 which was released in April 2011.

==Overview==
===Core functionality===
Users can enter mathematics in traditional mathematical notation.  Custom user interfaces can also be created. There is extensive support for numeric computations, to arbitrary precision, as well as symbolic computation and visualization.  Examples of symbolic computations are given below.

Maple incorporates a [[Type system#Dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] imperative-style [[programming language]] which resembles [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitwisemag.com/copy/reviews/software/maths/maple10_mathematica52.html Power of two] Bitwise Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The language permits variables of lexical [[scope (programming)|scope]].   There are also interfaces to other languages ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Fortran]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[MATLAB]], and [[Visual Basic]]).  There is also an interface with [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]].

Maple supports [[MathML]] 2.0, a W3C format for representing and interpreting mathematical expressions, including their display in Web pages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maplesoft.com/standards/MathML/info.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Maple is based on a small [[kernel computer science|kernel]], written in [[C (programming language)|C]], which provides the Maple language. Most functionality is provided by libraries, which come from a variety of sources. Many numerical computations are performed by the [[NAG Numerical Libraries]], [[Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software|ATLAS]] libraries, or [[GNU Multi-Precision Library|GMP]] libraries. Most of the libraries are written in the Maple language; these have viewable source code.

Different functionality in Maple requires numerical data in different formats. Symbolic expressions are stored in memory as [[directed acyclic graph]]s. The standard interface and calculator interface are written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].  The classic interface is written in [[C (programming language)|C]].

==Examples of Maple code==
Sample [[imperative programming]] constructs:&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;maple&quot;&gt; not implemented, yet... --&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
myfac := proc(n::nonnegint)
   local out, i;
   out := 1;
   for i from 2 to n do
       out := out * i
   end do;
   out
end proc;
&lt;/source&gt;
Simple functions can also be defined using the &quot;maps to&quot; arrow notation:
 myfac := n -&gt; product( i, i=1..n );

===Integration===
Find
:&lt;math&gt;\int\cos\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)dx&lt;/math&gt;.
 int(cos(x/a), x);
Answer:
:&lt;math&gt;a \sin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
----

===Solution of linear differential equations===
Compute an exact solution to the linear ordinary differential equation &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}(x) - 3 y(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; subject to initial conditions &lt;math&gt;y(0) = 0 ,\quad \left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{x=0} = 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 dsolve( {diff(y(x),x,x) - 3*y(x) = x, y(0)=0, D(y)(0)=2}, y(x) );
Answer: &lt;math&gt;y(x)=\frac{7}{18}\sqrt{3}e^{\sqrt{3}x}-\frac{7}{18}\sqrt{3}e^{-\sqrt{3}x}-\frac{1}{3}x&lt;/math&gt;
----

:&lt;math&gt;
{\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}v \left( x,t
 \right) =-u \left( x,t \right) v \left( x,t \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}v \left( x,t \right) =-v \left( x,t \right) {\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}u
 \left( x,t \right) +v \left( x,t \right)  \left( u \left( x,t
 \right)  \right) ^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}u
 \left( x,t \right) +2\,u \left( x,t \right) {\frac {\partial }{
\partial x}}u \left( x,t \right) -{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial {x}^{2}}}u \left( x,t \right) =0
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;v(x,t)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
 eqn1:= diff(v(x, t), x) = -u(x,t)*v(x,t):
 eqn2:= diff(v(x, t), t) = -v(x,t)*(diff(u(x,t), x))+v(x,t)*u(x,t)^2:
 eqn3:= diff(u(x,t), t)+2*u(x,t)*(diff(u(x,t), x))-(diff(diff(u(x,t), x), x)) = 0:
 pdsolve({eqn1,eqn2,eqn3,v(x,t)&lt;&gt;0},[u,v]): op(%);
Answer: &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;v \left( x,t \right) ={e^{\sqrt {{\it \_c}_{{1}}}x}}{\it \_C3
}\,{e^{{\it \_c}_{{1}}t}}{\it \_C1}+{\frac {{\it \_C3}\,{e^{{\it \_c}_
{{1}}t}}{\it \_C2}}{{e^{\sqrt {{\it \_c}_{{1}}}x}}}}, \  \  u \left( x,t
 \right) =-{\frac {\sqrt {{\it \_c}_{{1}}} \left( {\it \_C1}\, \left(
{e^{\sqrt {{\it \_c}_{{1}}}x}} \right) ^{2}-{\it \_C2} \right) }{{\it
\_C1}\, \left( {e^{\sqrt {{\it \_c}_{{1}}}x}} \right) ^{2}+{\it \_C2}} }

 eqn:= f(x)-3*Integrate((x*y+x^2*y^2)*f(y), y=-1..1) = h(x):
 intsolve(eqn,f(x));
Answer: &lt;math&gt;f \left( x \right) =\int _{-1}^{1}\! \left( -15\,{x}^{2}{y}^{2}-3\,xy \right) h \left( y \right) {dy}+h \left( x \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
&lt;!----This section was created by a COI editor and may not be a neutral point of view ---&gt;
The first concept of Maple arose from a meeting in November 1980 at the [[University of Waterloo]]. Researchers at the university wished to purchase a computer powerful enough to run [[Macsyma]]. Instead, it was decided that they would develop their own computer algebra system that would be able to run on more reasonably priced computers. The first limited version appearing in December 1980 with Maple demonstrated first at conferences beginning in 1982. The name is a reference to Maple's [[Flag of Canada|Canadian heritage]]. By the end of 1983, over 50 universities had copies of Maple installed on their machines.

In 1984, the research group arranged with [[Watcom|Watcom Products Inc]] to license and distribute Maple. In 1988 [[Waterloo Maple]] Inc. was founded. The companyâs original goal was to manage the distribution of the software. Eventually, the company evolved to have an R&amp;D department where much of Maple's development is done today, but significant development of Maple continues at university research labs including: the Symbolic Computation Laboratory at the [[University of Waterloo]]; the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra at the [[University of Western Ontario]]; and labs at other universities worldwide{{Who|date=August 2011}}.

&lt;!----End of questionable neutrality section---&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Maple morphos.png|thumb|300px|Maple V Release 3 for [[Amiga]] (1995), running under [[MorphOS]] ]] --&gt;
In 1989, the first graphical user interface for Maple was developed and included with version 4.3 for the Macintosh. X11 and Windows versions of the new interface followed in 1990 with Maple V. Maple was used in a number of notable applications in science and mathematics ranging from a demonstration of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in number theory, to solutions in [[General Relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. These were showcased in a special issue of a newsletter created by Maple developers called ''MapleTech'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/maple/www/plibrary/mtn/mtn-si94.html MapleTech Special Issue, BirkhÃ¤user-Boston, (1994)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, with the release of Maple 6, Maple included some of the [[NAG Numerical Libraries]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/1870/2001/02/21reviewsmaple.html Maple 6.0] Macworld, Feb 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and made improvements to arbitrary precision arithmetic.

In 2003, the current &quot;standard&quot; interface was introduced with Maple 9. This interface is primarily written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (although portions, such as the rules for typesetting mathematical formulae, are written in the Maple language). The Java interface was criticized for being slow;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwoctnov05review.html Capturing knowledge with pure maths], Scientific Computing World.&lt;/ref&gt; improvements have been made in later versions, although the Maple&amp;nbsp;11 documentation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maplesoft.com/documentation_center/maple11/Install.html Maple 11 Installation Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; recommends the previous (âclassicâ) interface for users with less than 500&amp;nbsp;MB of physical memory. This classic interface is no longer being maintained.

Between the mid 1995 and 2005 Maple lost significant market share to competitors due to a weaker user interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.siam.org/oralhistories/gonnet.htm Interview with Gaston Gonnet, co-creator of Maple], SIAM History of Numerical Analysis and Computing, March 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Maple 10 introduced a new âdocument modeâ, as part of the standard interface.  The main feature of this mode is that math is entered using two dimensional input, so that it appears similar to formulae in a book. In 2008, Maple 12 added additional user interface features found in Mathematica, including special purpose style sheets, control of headers and footers, bracket matching, auto execution regions, command completion templates, syntax checking and auto-initialization regions. Additional features were added for making Maple easier to use as a MATLAB toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/new_features/Aca/index.aspx New in Maple 12] Maplesoft&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 Maple and Maplesoft were acquired by the Japanese software retailer Cybernet Systems.

==Use of the Maple engine==
The Maple engine is used within several other products from [[Maplesoft]]:
* Maple T.A., [[Waterloo Maple|Maplesoft]]âs online testing suite, uses Maple to algorithmically generate questions and grade student responses.
* MapleNet allows users to create [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] pages and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Applets]]. MapleNet 12 and above also allow users to upload and work with Maple worksheets containing interactive components.
* Maple Reader, [[Waterloo Maple|Maplesoft]]âs platform for [[digital rights management|DRM]]-controlled electronic books uses the Standard Maple interface. There are currently no available books using this product.
* [[MapleSim]], an engineering simulation tool.

Listed below are third-party commercial products that no longer use the Maple engine:
* Versions of [[MathCad]] released between 1994 and 2006 included a Maple-derived algebra engine (MKM, aka [[Mathsoft]] Kernel Maple), though subsequent versions use [[MuPAD]].
* Symbolic Math Toolbox in [[MATLAB]] contained a portion of the Maple 10 engine but now uses [[MuPAD]].
* Older versions of the mathematical editor [[Scientific Workplace]] included Maple as a computational engine, though current versions include [[MuPAD]].

==Versions available==
Maplesoft sells student, personal, academic and professional editions of Maple, with a substantial difference in price (US$99, $239cdn{{fact|date=October 2011}}, US$1245, and US$2,275, respectively).  Later student editions (from version 6 onwards) have not placed computational limitations, but rather come with less printed documentation when purchased as a physical product. There is no difference in the product when purchased as an electronic download. Since Maple 14, all versions include the Maple Toolbox for MATLABÂ®, which used to be available as a separate product available only for academic and professional users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maplesoft.com/company/publications/articles/view.aspx?SID=53397 Advanced technology for design, modeling and high-performance simulation saves engineers time and effort]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copy protection==
{{Unreferenced|Section|date=April 2011}}
Single-user editions of Maple are locked to the hardware of the computer they run on. This means that Maple may refuse to start if certain parts of the computer's hardware are removed or replaced. In this case the customer support has to be called, in order to receive a new licence file for the updated hardware.
