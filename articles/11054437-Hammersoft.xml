'''[[Gospel]]s''' are a [[genre]] of [[Early Christian]] literature claiming to recount the life of [[Jesus]], to preserve His teachings, or to reveal aspects of [[God]]'s nature. The [[development of the New Testament canon]] has left four [[canonical Gospels]] which are accepted as the only authentic ones by the great majority of Christians, but many others exist, or used to exist, and are called [[Apocrypha]]l. Some of these have left considerable traces on [[Christian]] traditions, including [[iconography]].

# [[Gospel of Perfection]]
# [[Gospel of Marcion]]
# [[Gospel of Basilides]]
# [[Gospel of Andrew]]
# Gospel of [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]]
# [[Gospel of Cerinthus]]
# Gospel of [[Bardesanes]]
# Gospel of the [[Encratites]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] ascribed a gospel to the sect of [[Encratites]]. It is more probable however, that he referred to the Gospel of [[Tatian]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gospel of the [[Gnostics]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Gnostics]] had various gospels. [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] speaks of their writing &quot;The Revelation of Adam, and other false gospels&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gospel of [[Hesychius]]&lt;ref name=gelasius&gt;This phrase is found in the [[Decretum Gelasianum|Decree of Gelasius]] wherein certain gospels are condemned by that title. What they were is uncertain. [[Jerome]] speaks of &quot;those books which go under the names of Lucian and Hesychius and are esteemed through the perverse humors of some&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gospel of [[Lucius]]&lt;ref name=gelasius/&gt;
# Gospel of [[Longinus]]
# Gospel of [[Mani (prophet)|Manes]]
# Gospel of Merinthus&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of Merinthus is mentioned only by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] as one of those spurious gospels which he supposes were written in the apostles' time and referred to by Luke in Luke 1:1 &quot;as not being a true and genuine account&quot;. [[Johann Albert Fabricius|Fabricius]] supposes that Merinthus and Cerinthus are the same person and that Cerinthus was changed into Merinthus by the way of banter or reproach. Although Epiphanius makes them into two different persons, yet in the heresy of the Cerinthians, he professes himself uncertain. He said &quot;The Cerinthians are also called Merinthians as we see by the accounts we have; but whether this Cerinthus was also called Merinthus, a fellow laborer of his, God knows&quot;(Jones, A new and full method of settling the canonical authority of the New Testament)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Gospel of [[Simon Magus|Simonides]]
# Gospel of [[Tatian]]
# Gospel of [[Thaddaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Decretum Gelasianum|Rejected by Gelasius]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gospel of [[Valentinus]]&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned by [[Tertullian]] in Adversus Valentinianos. According to [[Ireneaus]], it the same as the [[Gospel of Truth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Clementine Gospel
