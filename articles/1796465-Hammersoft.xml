The '''Sweet Sioux Tomahawk''' was presented to the winner of the annual [[American football|college football]] game between [[Illinois]] rivals [[Northwestern University]], located in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], located on the border between the central Illinois cities of [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. The original trophy was a carved wooden &quot;cigar store&quot; Indian, but was stolen and replaced by a replica of a tomahawk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/chi-illinois--northwestern-sweet-sioux,0,4697365.story |title=Sweet Sioux Tomahawk goes the way of Chief Illiniwek |date=November 22, 2008 |publisher=Chicago Tribune}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Northwestern won the Tomahawk first in [[1945]], beating Illinois 13-7 in [[Ryan Field (stadium)|Evanston]]. At the end of the [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008 football season]], when the teams last played for the trophy, Illinois held a 52-45-5 edge in the series overall, and a 33-29-2 lead during the era of the Tomahawk.  Northwestern narrowed the series record in the trophy's final years, winning five of the last six meetings.

The Saturday, November 22, 2008 Illinois-Northwestern football game in Evanston was the final time the two teams played for the Tomahawk, which Northwestern won 27-10. The [[NCAA]] mandated that all Native American imagery deemed hostile and abusive must be removed from college athletics, including the Sweet Sioux Tomahawk. Before the game, the schools agreed that Northwestern would be the trophy's permanent resting place (if Illinois had won the game, it would have surrendered the trophy to Northwestern after the on-field celebration). The teams began competing for a new prize, the [[Land of Lincoln Trophy]], in [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/042509aab.html |title = Illinois and Northwestern Announce Football Series Trophy |date= April 25, 2009 |publisher= NUsports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
