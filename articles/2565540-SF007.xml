'''U-lite Linux''' (originally Ubuntulite) is an [[operating system]] that features [[LXDE]] and lightweight programs based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], but it is not an official project by [[Canonical Ltd.]]  The goal of U-lite Linux is to create a [[Linux distribution|distribution]] based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] that is reasonably fast even on limited [[hardware]].  In contrast to other variants of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], U-lite Linux is focused on providing a trimmed set of [[software]] packages while providing the experience expected by a modern computer user.  Furthermore, the user interface is designed to be usable even at smaller resolutions such as those on older computers and netbooks.

U-lite Linux uses software from the repositories of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] but also includes some more up-to-date packages than those in the repositories to provide bugfixes and features for key programs, such as [[LXDE]], the default desktop environment used in U-lite.  U-lite Linux is promoted, developed and distributed by the U-lite Linux Project, with donations by thankful users and sponsors finance.

== Main characteristics ==
* U-lite Linux focuses on features, speed and efficiency when selecting the default programs to accomplish the most common tasks computer users do.  Thus, U-lite can run on computers that cannot run [[GNOME]], [[Plasma Workspaces]] or [[Xfce]] well.   
* U-lite Linux makes use of the familiar [[Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] as the web browsing and email client respectively. However, users can easily replace most applications with their favorites without breaking updates.
* U-lite Linux is ready for common office tasks because it includes [[Abiword]] for word processing tasks and [[Gnumeric]] for spreadsheets.

== Trademark issues ==
On September 10, 2008 Canonical emailed the Ubuntulite developers complaining the project's use of Canonical's names, URLs and logos violates Canonical's trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ulite.org/node/171 |title=A message from Canonical: Change your name |publisher=ulite.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After multiple surveys, the name U-lite was chosen on November 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ulite.org/node/209 |title=And the winner is . . .|publisher=u-lite.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
