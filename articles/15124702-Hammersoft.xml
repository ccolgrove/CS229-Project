The '''second elections for the [[European Parliament]]''' in [[Italy]] were held on 17 June 1984.

The election took place just a week after the death of [[Communist]] leader [[Enrico Berlinguer]]: this fact hugely influenced the vote, producing an historical result.

==Electoral system==
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] was the traditional electoral system of the Italian Republic since its foundation in 1946, so it had been adopted to elect the Italian representatives to the European Parliament too. Two levels were used: a national level to divide seats between parties, and a constituency level to distribute them between candidates. [[Italian region]]s were united in 5 constituencies, each electing a group of deputies. At national level, seats were divided between party lists using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Hare quota]]. All seats gained by each party were automatically distributed to their local [[open list]]s and their most voted candidates.

==Results==
The public emotion caused by [[Enrico Berlinguer|Berlinguer]]'s death resulted into an extraordinary strength for the [[Italian Communist Party|PCI]]: for the first time in [[Western Europe]] since the [[French legislative election, 1956|French election of 1956]], and for the first time ever in Italian history, a [[Communist]] party received a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] by a democratic vote.

However, in opposition, this result reinforced the [[centrism|moderate]] government ruling the country: the [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] of [[Prime Minister]] [[Bettino Craxi|Craxi]] had maintained its vote, and its major ally, the defeated [[Italian Christian Democracy|Christian Democracy]], did not want to take any chances of a political crisis that could lead to dangerous general election.
