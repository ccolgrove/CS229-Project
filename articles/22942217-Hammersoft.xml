In a interview with HipHop DX, Lord Finesse described &quot;Put It On&quot;:
:[Columbia Records] wanted something with a hook that would be kinda catchy, and something they could get radio play with. Like, everything [L] did was dark, and it was gangsta, and it wasâ¦what was the [popular style at the time]? Horror-core. So they needed something bright, something friendly. And âPut It Onâ just matched everything perfect . . . âPut it on,â the slangâ¦was likeâ¦ âdo your thing.â âPut it on Big L, put it onâ¦â [meaning] you gotta do your thing, you gotta represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=Paul W.|title=Lord Finesse Breaks Down Big L's &quot;Lifestyez ov da Poor and Dangerous|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/editorials/id.1577/title.lord-finesse-breaks-down-big-ls-lifestylez-ov-da-poor-dangerous|work=HipHop DX|accessdate=14 April 2011|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
