Entering the postseason as the NFC's #1 seed, the Falcons began their playoff run at home against the #6 [[Green Bay Packers]], in a rematch of their Week 12 match-up.  Atlanta delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter with a 12-yard touchdown run from running back [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]].  The Packers answered in the second quarter as quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jordy Nelson]], yet the Falcons immediately struck back as wide receiver [[Eric Weems]] returned the ensuing kickoff for a franchise postseason best 102 yards for a touchdown.  Green Bay came right back with fullback [[John Kuhn]] getting a 1-yard touchdown run, Rodgers completing a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]], and cornerback [[Tramon Williams]] returning an interception 70 yards for a touchdown.

The Packers added onto their lead in the third quarter as Rodgers got a 7-yard touchdown run, followed by his 7-yard touchdown pass to Kuhn.  Atlanta tried to rally in the fourth quarter as quarterback [[Matt Ryan]] found wide receiver [[Roddy White]] on a 6-yard touchdown pass, yet Green Bay closed out their dominating night with Crosby getting a 43-yard field goal.
