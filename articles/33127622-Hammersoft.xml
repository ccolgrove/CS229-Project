'''Ian Cook''' is an English artist. He became famous for painting pictures using the wheels of [[radio-controlled car|remote-control car]]s. He is also the founder, director, and artist for PopBang Colour, a company based in Birmingham which helps him publicise his art.

==Early life==
Cook studied at Langley Secondary School, [[Solihull]] from 1990â1999. He then went to [[Sutton Coldfield College]], where he would later teach, to study a BTEC National Diploma, for Illustration. Finally, he attended [[Winchester School of Art]] for Fine art, and a BA Hons for painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ian-cook/33/69/349 |title=Ian Cook |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He studied at the Latvian art academy in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]] for a three-month period.&lt;ref name=&quot;myartspace&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myartspace.com/artistInfo.do?populatinglist=home&amp;subscriberid=4k79vlzv59x55sr4 |title=Artist Profile Page |publisher=myartspace|date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there he first created the idea of using vehicles within his work. In Latvia he produced artwork associated with [[Range Rover]] through photography and collected merchandise.&lt;ref name=&quot;myartspace&quot; /&gt;

He is a lecturer in fine art and visual studies at [[Sutton Coldfield College]]'s design centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmail&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Suart |first=Paul |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/birmingham-news/2008/07/21/birmingham-teacher-ian-cook-paints-a-winning-f1-picture-97319-21379173/ |title=Birmingham teacher Ian Cook paints a winning F1 picture â Birmingham News â News |publisher=Birmingham Mail |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Cook dips the cars' tyres in [[acrylic paint]]. He then creates the brush strokes by driving the small vehicles in short bursts over the canvas. This is known as an Auto Drawing.&lt;ref name=&quot;skynews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/15133321 |title=Lewis Hamilton Painting, Artist Ian Cook Uses Cars Instead Of Brushes &amp;#124; UK News &amp;#124; Sky News |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also uses full-size car tyres for large blocks of colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;gizmodo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=John Mahoney |url=http://gizmodo.com/5029115/british-artist-paints-using-rc-cars-as-his-brushes |title=British Artist Paints Using RC Cars As His Brushes |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first began using this artwork style when one [[Boxing Day]] he just got a large canvas, placed it on the floor, and applied some paint to a toy car. He then moves the car's wheels until the painting is done.&lt;ref name=&quot;wheels&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowwheels.com/2009/07/artist-ian-cook-paints-the-cars/ |title=Artist Ian Cook paints the cars |publisher=Yellowwheels.com |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook has also used a large truck to create the larger solid lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;metro&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/829578-artist-uses-motor-vehicles-to-create-giant-image-of-a-racing-car |title=Artist Ian Cook uses motor vehicles to create giant image of a racing car |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2010-06-06 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He creates some pieces in his studio, and others in public places for shows or promotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;solihull&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=UK |url=http://www.solihull.gov.uk/gallery/popbang.htm |title=Solihull Council â Popbang@solihull â Artist Ian Cook |publisher=Solihull.gov.uk |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous pieces==
Cook's artwork has been featured on [[Blue Peter]] and [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]. He has a studio at the Heritage Motor Centre, [[Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hmotorcentre&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rallybuzz&quot;&gt;http://www.rallybuzz.com/popbang-colour-heritage-motor-centre/&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Cook made a portrait of [[Formula 1]] racing driver [[Lewis Hamilton]] the size of two London double-decker buses, which was unveiled by [[Tower Bridge]], London. Cook used up to 50 different cars dipped in coloured paints to create the image, which is eight metres high and 12 metres wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;skynews&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motormorph.com/?p=2733 |title=Pop art with Popbang Colour |publisher=motormorph.com |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 Cook featured on the [[ITV]] breakfast show [[Daybreak (ITV)|Daybreak]], where he created a portrait of [[Adrian Chiles]] and [[Christine Bleakley]] as well as the Daybreak logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;hmotorcentre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage-motor-centre.co.uk/exhibitions/temporary-exhibitions/pop-bang-art/ |title=Ian Cook â Popbang Colour |publisher=Heritage Motor Centre |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
