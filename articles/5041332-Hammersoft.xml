'''Daniele Bonera''' (born 31 May 1981) is an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a defender for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. 

==Club career==
===Brescia===
Bonera started his career for [[Brescia Calcio]], making his first team debut in 1999â2000, in [[Serie B]] league. After two more impressive seasons with Brescia, which even led him to be capped for the [[Italy national football team]], making his debut in a friendly match played September 5, 2001 against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], Bonera moved to Parma in 2002â03.

On the 28 July 2006, Bonera moved to [[A.C. Milan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11876_2385167,00.html|title=Milan bag Bonera|first=Nadia|last=Carminati|date=2006-07-28|accessdate=2010-05-13|work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; for â¬3.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilanciomilan.it/2007/HTML/2006/HTML/PDF/bilancio.pdf|title=AC Milan 2006 Annual Report|date=ca. April 2007|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=AC Milan|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milan===
[[File:Mesut Ãzil and Daniele Bonera.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mesut Ãzil]] and Daniele Bonera during the match between [[Real Madrid CF]] and [[AC Milan]]]]
His [[UEFA Champions League]] debut was against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], 17 October 2006, in which he received a [[Penalty_card#Red_card|red card]] after receiving a second yellow in the 47th minute for what, in the referees view, was petulantly kicking the ball away as Anderlecht waited to take a free kick. After struggling at right back, Bonera was moved to centre back after several defenders were injured and the acquisition of [[Massimo Oddo]] from [[S.S. Lazio]] in January, a natural right back. Bonera slotted in well at centre back, becoming one of Milan's better players.

Bonera struggled with a niggling injury in the second half of the 2008â09, joining [[Alessandro Nesta]] and [[Kakha Kaladze]] on the treatment table. In September 2009, he signed a contract extension which will last until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1067167.html|title=Bonera boost for Milan|agency=PA|date=2009-06-06|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 10 month lay-off, Bonera made a successful 45minute comeback against Novara in the Coppa Italia on 13 January 2010. Because of Milan's great central defensive partnership of [[Alessandro Nesta]] and [[Thiago Emiliano da Silva|Thiago Silva]], Bonera was deployed at his former position, right back. Bonera slotted in well at right back, playing much better in that position than when he first joined Milan. Because of this Bonera became Milan's starting right back but when [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Luca Antonini]] and [[Massimo Oddo]] all returned from injury, he lost his place as starting right back. However when [[Alessandro Nesta]] once again found himself on the treatment table, coach [[Leonardo AraÃºjo|Leonardo]] chose Bonera to fill in for him. However, after a string of poor performances, Bonera was again demoted to the bench.

==International career==
At youth level he capped for both [[2002 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2002]] and [[2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]. He also played at the 2000 [[Toulon Tournament]].  He has been capped 34 times at U-21 international level.

He has been capped 16 times for [[Italian national football team|Italy]]. After made his senior debut on September 5, 2001 against Morocco, he made his non-friendly debut under [[Marcello Lippi]] at [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2006 FIFA World Cup qualification]].

He was call-up to [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] squad as reserve player, but after [[Gianluca Zambrotta]] was confirmed he was fit, Bonera was sent home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11876_2379869,00.html|title=Azzurri release Bonera|first=Simon|last=Fudge|work=Sky Sports|date=2006-06-11|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 06 World Cup, he was re-called for the first time under [[Roberto Donadoni]], for Euro 2008 Qualifier against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], a match scheduled for 28 March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=517673.html|title=Uncapped duo handed Italy chance|first=Paolo |last=Menicucci|publisher=UEFA.com|date=2007-03-18|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had to withdraw due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11866_2409326,00.html|title=Italy drop four from squad|first=Mark|last=Buckingham|date=2007-03-23|accessdate=2010-05-13|work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October and November 2007 he was called-up again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=599877.html|title=Montolivo earns Italy call-up|first=Paolo |last=Menicucci|publisher=UEFA.com|date=2007-10-07|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=618019.html|title=Palladino in, Del Piero out for Italy|date=2007-11-11|accessdate=2010-05-13|first=Paolo |last=Menicucci|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which he played against 10 World Cup host [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] with experimental squad and substituted [[Fabio Cannavaro]] against [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. He was not selected to [[UEFA Euro 2008]].

After Lippi became Italy coach for the second time, he was re-called in the first few matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ita/news/newsid=739675.html|title=Gilardino leads list of Lippi recalls|date=2008-08-16|accessdate=2010-05-13|first=Roberta|last=Radaelli|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1018296.html|title=Lippi welcomes back Buffon and Pirlo|date=2009-02-07|agency=AFP|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the injury, he was call up to the last friendly before the formal announcement of [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] squad, against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.figc.it/it/204/23668/2010/02/News.shtml|title=Amichevole Italia-Camerun.
