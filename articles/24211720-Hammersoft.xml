&quot;'''Left My Heart in Tokyo'''&quot; is a song by British [[girl group]] [[Mini Viva]], co-written by Norwegian singer [[Annie (Norwegian singer)|Annie]] and remixer [[Fred Falke]] and produced by [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]] and his production team  [[Xenomania]]. The song was released as Mini Viva's debut single in September 2009. [[NME]] called the song &quot;the catchiest single of 2009.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=15&amp;p=6827&amp;more=1&amp;c=1 Mini Viva Are About To Release The Catchiest Single Of 2009, NME, 25 Jul 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The single was originally released as a 10&quot; vinyl single in December 2008 on World's Finest Records, featuring two mixes by [[Fred Falke]].

==Critical reception==
Nick Levine of [[Digital Spy]] gave the song 4/5, stating: &quot;...Make no mistake, their debut single sounds like a chart invader. With its swooning chorus, inventive, disco-tinged production and lyrics that sound great even when they don't quite make sense, 'Left My Heart in Tokyo' is vintage Xenomania.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a173854/mini-viva-left-my-heart-in-tokyo.html&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser McAlpine of [[BBC]]'s &quot;Chart Blog&quot; also rated the song 4/5: &quot;What sets this apart from other generic acts of dance-pop [...] is the infectious energy that singers Frankee and Britt bring to it: whether it's snarling out the verses, purring the bridge, or vamping the chorus, I can't help thinking that recording this single sounds like it was a lot of fun, and it's the sort of fun that they're generously passing on to all of our ears.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2009/09/mini_viva_i_left_my_heart_in_t.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The song was placed on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s A-list.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Left My Heart in Tokyo&quot; was filmed during early June 2009 in [[Los Angeles]] and was directed by [[Ray Kay]]. It features the duo dancing and singing in various scenes to the backdrop of [[time-lapse]] images of daily life in the city of [[Tokyo]].
