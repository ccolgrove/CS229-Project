The '''Italian general election''' of '''2 June 1946''' was the first Italian election after [[World War II]] and elected 556 deputies to a [[Constituent Assembly]]. Theoretically, the deputies to be chosen were 573, but the election didn't take place in [[Julian March]] and in [[South Tyrol]], which were under military occupation by the [[United Nations]].

For the first time, Italian women were allowed to vote in a national election. Electors had two votes: one to elect the representatives, and one to choose the institutional form of the State.

==Electoral system==
To emphatize the restoration of democracy after the fascist era, a pure [[party-list proportional representation]] was chosen. [[Italian province]]s were united in 31 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;The number of seats for each constituency had a range from 1 for [[Aosta Valley]] to 36 for [[Milan]].&lt;/ref&gt; At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with the [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at national level, where special [[closed list]]s of national leaders received the last seats using the [[Hare quota]].

==The race==
At the end of World War II, Italy was governed under transitional laws as a result of agreements between the [[National Liberation Committee]] (CLN) and the royal [[Luogotenente|Lieutenant General of the Realm]] [[Umberto II of Italy|Humbert II]]. No democratic elections having taken place for more than twenty years, [[legislative power]] was given to the government but, after the first election, the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Italian Council of Ministers]] would have to receive a [[vote of confidence]] by the newly-elected Constituent Assembly.

The three main contestants were: the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|
 Christian Democracy]], the [[Italian Socialist Party|
Socialist Party]], and the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party]]. Smaller parties included the [[Italian Liberal Party]], heir of the pre-fascist and conservative ruling class, which proposed an alliance called [[National Democratic Union (Italy)|National Democratic Union]], monarchists groups that created [[National Bloc of Freedom]], and the social liberal [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] and [[Labour Democratic Party]].

==Results==
[[File:AC46.png|thumb|250px|right|The Constituent Assembly]]
The election gave a large majority to the government formed by the three leaders of the CLN, which were briefly joined by the Republican Party after the exile of Humbert II. The alliance lasted for a year.

Here are the results of the Italian Constituent Assembly election of 1946.

Together with the election, a constitutional referendum took place. Italian electors had to choose if they wanted to continue the reign of [[Umberto II of Italy|Humbert II of Savoy]] or to turn Italy into a republic. While all regions of [[Northern Italy]] as far as [[Tuscany]] and [[Marche]]s gave a majority to the republic, all regions of [[Southern Italy]] from [[Latium]] and [[Abruzzo]] voted to maintain the monarchy.
