'''Yu Dafu''' ({{zh|s=éè¾¾å¤«|t=ééå¤«|p=YÃ¹ DÃ¡fÅ«|w=Yu Ta-fu}}) (December 7, 1896âSeptember 17, 1945). Born in [[Fuyang, Zhejiang|Fuyang]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]], was a modern [[China|Chinese]] short story writer and [[poet]].

==Early years==

Yu Dafu's father died when he was three, leaving the family poverty-stricken and destitute. He received a number of scholarships through the Chinese government and went on to receive a traditional Chinese education in [[Hangzhou]]. Chronologically he studied in Jiangxing-Fu Middle School (before he came to Hangzhou), Hangzhou-Fu Middle School, Yuying Academy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wendian.com.cn/poemzh/n0006/zz_jj.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (è²è±å­¦å , formerly of Zhejiang University). 

In 1912, he entered [[Hangchow University Historic Site|Hangchow University]] (later its major part merged into [[Zhejiang University]]) preparatory through examination. He was there only for a short period before he was expelled for participation in a student strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/14153.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

He then moved to [[Japan]], where he studied [[economics]] at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] between 1913 and 1922, where he met other Chinese intellectuals (namely, [[Guo Moruo]], [[Zhang Ziping]] and  [[Tian Han]]). Together, in 1921 they founded the ''Chuangzao she'' åµé ç¤¾ (&quot;Creation Society&quot;), which promoted vernacular and modern literature. One of his earlier works ''Chenlun'' æ²æ·ª, also his most famous, published in Japan in 1921. The work had gained immense popularity in China, shocking the world of [[Chinese literature]] with its frank dealing with sex, as well as grievances directed at the incompetence of Chinese government at the time.  

In 1922, he returned to China as a literary celebrity and worked as the editor of ''Creation Quarterly'', editing journals and writing short stories. In 1923, after an attack of [[tuberculosis]], Yu Dafu directed his attention to the welfare of the masses.

In 1927, he worked as an editor of the ''Hongshui'' [[literary magazine]]. He later came in conflict with the [[Communist Party of China]] and fled back to Japan.

==Second Sino-Japanese war==
After the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]], he returned to China and worked as a writer of anti-Japanese [[propaganda]] in Hangzhou, and later in [[Zhejiang]]. From 1938 to 1942, he worked as a literary editor for the newspaper [[Sin Chew Jit Poh]] in [[Singapore]]. 

In 1942 when the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] [[Battle of Singapore|invaded Singapore]], he was forced to flee to [[Sumatra]]. Known under a different identity, he settled there among other [[overseas Chinese]] and began a brewery business with the help of the locals. Later he was forced to help the [[Kempeitai|Japanese military police]] as an interpreter when it was discovered that he was one of the few &quot;locals&quot; in the area who could speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. 

In 1945, he was arrested by the Kempeitai when his true identity was finally discovered. It is believed that he was executed by the Japanese shortly after the [[surrender of Japan]].
