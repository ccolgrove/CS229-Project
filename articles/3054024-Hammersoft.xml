'''East Tamaki''' is a [[suburb]] of [[Auckland, New Zealand|Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. This is a mixed residential, light industry and retail area which is growing rapidly. Prior to the 1960s this was largely a dairy farming area. A landmark is Smales Mountain which in 2010 has the remains of an old Pa, a stone field garden, an early church, and farm homestead. The area is under governance of the [[Auckland Council]], and is located to the south-east of the Auckland city centre.
