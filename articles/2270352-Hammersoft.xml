'''Woodrow Wilson Woolwine &quot;Woody&quot; Strode''' (July 25, 1914 â December 31, 1994) was a [[decathlon|decathlete]] and [[American football|football]] star who went on to become a pioneering black American film actor.  He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award for best supporting actor for his role in ''[[Spartacus (1960 film)|Spartacus]]'' in 1960. He served in the US Army during World War II.

==Early life and athletic career==
Strode was born in [[Los Angeles, California]]. He attended college at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], where he was a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.  His world-class decathlon capabilities were spearheaded by a {{convert|50|ft|m|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} plus [[shot put]] (when the world record was {{convert|57|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) and a {{height|ft=6|in=4}} high jump (the world record at time was {{height|ft=6|in=10}}). Strode posed for a nude portrait, part of [[Hubert Stowitts]]'s acclaimed exhibition of athletic portraits shown at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]] (although the inclusion of black and Jewish athletes caused the [[Nazi]]s to close the exhibit).&lt;ref&gt;Stowitts, Hubert Julian. American champions; fifty portraits of American athletes by Stowitts, Tiergartenstrasse 21a, Berlin, 9.-15. September 1936, unter dem Protektorat des Amerikanischen Botschafters und Mitwirkung der Vereinigung Carl Schurz, anlÃ¤sslich der XI. Olympiade, special sport exhibition. Stowitts, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

Strode, [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]] and [[Jackie Robinson]] starred on the 1939 [[UCLA Bruins football]] team, in which they made up three of the four backfield players.&lt;ref&gt;B.J. VIOLETT - [http://www.today.ucla.edu/1997/970425TeammatesRecall.html TEAMMATES RECALL JACKIE ROBINSONâS LEGACY]. UCLA Today magazine, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Ray Bartlett]], there were four African-Americans playing for the Bruins, when only a few dozen at all played on other college football teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9389095 &quot;Kenny Washington]&quot; ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; They played eventual conference and national champion [[USC Trojans football team|USC]] to a 0â0 tie with the [[1940 Rose Bowl]] on the line. It was the first [[UCLAâUSC rivalry]] football game with national implications.

Strode and fellow UCLA alumnus [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]] were two of the first [[African-American]]s to play in major college programs and later the modern [[National Football League]], playing for the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in 1946.  No blacks had played in the NFL from 1933 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;NFL 2001 Record and Fact Book, Workman Publishing Co, New York,NY, ISBN 0-7611-2480-2, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA teammate Jackie Robinson would go on to break the color barrier in [[Major League baseball]] (in fact, all three had played in the semi-professional [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] earlier in the decade). In 1947,1948 and 1949, he played for the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] in Canada, retiring due to injury in 1949. 

In 1941 had dabbled for several months in [[professional wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the end of his football career in 1949, he returned to wrestling part-time between acting jobs until 1958, wrestling the likes of [[George Wagner|Gorgeous George]].&lt;ref&gt;Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, pp. 171-179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
As an actor, the 6' 4&quot; (1.93 m) Strode was noted for film roles that contrasted with the stereotypes of the time. He is probably best remembered for his brief Golden Globe-nominated role in ''[[Spartacus (1960 film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) as the Ethiopian [[gladiator]] Draba, in which he fights [[Kirk Douglas]] to the death. 

Strode made his screen debut in 1941 in ''[[Sundown (film)|Sundown]]'', but became more active in the 1950s, eventually in roles of increasing depth. He played an African warrior in ''The Lion Hunters'' in [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]]'s ''Bomba the Jungle Boy'' series in 1951.  He played dual roles (billed as &quot;Woodrow Strode&quot;) in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 movie)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956) as an [[Ethiopia]]n king as well as a slave, and in 1959 portrayed the cowardly Private Franklin in ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]''. He appeared once on [[Johnny Weismuller]]'s 1955-1956 [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Jungle Jim (TV series)|Jungle Jim]]''.

He became a close friend of director [[John Ford]], who gave him the title role in ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960) as a member of the Ninth Cavalry falsely accused of rape and murder; he appeared in smaller roles in Ford's later films ''[[Two Rode Together]]'' (1961), ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962) and ''[[Seven Women]]'' (1966).  Strode was very close to the director.  During Ford's declining years, Strode once spent four months sleeping on the director's floor as his caretaker, and he was later present at Ford's death.&lt;ref&gt;Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, pp. 215-218, 249&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strode played memorable villains opposite three screen [[Tarzan]]s.  In 1958, he appeared as Ramo opposite [[Gordon Scott]] in ''[[Tarzan's Fight for Life]]''.  In 1963, he was cast opposite [[Jock Mahoney]]'s Tarzan as both the dying leader of an unnamed Asian country and that leader's unsavory brother, Khan, in ''[[Tarzan's Three Challenges]]''.  In the late 1960s, he appeared in several episodes of the [[Ron Ely]] ''[[Tarzan (NBC series)|Tarzan]]'' television series.

Strode played a heroic sailor on a sinking ship in the 1960 film ''[[The Last Voyage]]''.  In 1966, he landed a major starring role in ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]'', a major box-office success which established him as a recognizable star.  Another notable part was as a gunslinger in the opening sequence of [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968); after this, he appeared in several other [[spaghetti Western]]s of lesser quality.  His starring role as a thinly disguised [[Patrice Lumumba]] in ''Seduto alla sua destra'' (released in the U.S. as '' [[Black Jesus (film)|Black Jesus]]'') garnered Strode a great deal of press at the time, but the film is largely forgotten now.  He remained a visible [[character actor]] throughout the '70s and '80s, and has become widely regarded (along with [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Brock Peters]]) as one of the most important black film actors of his time. His last film was ''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'' (1995).

==Personal life==
Strode was the son of a [[Creek people|Creek]]-[[Blackfoot]]-[[Black people|black]] father and a [[Black people|black]]-[[Cherokee]] mother.&lt;ref&gt;Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, pp. 1-3)&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife was Princess Luukialuana Kalaeloa (aka Luana Strode), a descendant of [[Liliuokalani]], the last queen of [[Hawaii]]. They were married until her death in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Strode was a dedicated martial artist under the direction of Frank Landers in the art of [[SeishinDo Kenpo]].&lt;ref&gt;Fighting Stars Magazine - July 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seishindokenpo.com/ska/index.php/Seishindo_Kenpo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Strode died of [[lung cancer]] on December 31, 1994, in [[Glendora, California]], aged 80. He is buried at [[Riverside National Cemetery]] in [[Riverside, California]].
