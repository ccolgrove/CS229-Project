'''Interstate 395''' (abbreviated '''I-395''') is a 67-mile-long north&amp;ndash;south [[Interstate Highway]] that begins at [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] in [[East Lyme, Connecticut]] and ends at [[Interstate 90]] in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]], where it becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]]. The original designation for the freeway was '''Route 52'''. Route 52 was slated to become an extension of Interstate 290 before it received the I-395 designation in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;State Ordered To Lift Ban on Tandem Trucks.&quot; ''Hartford Courant'', June 14, 1983. The article lists &quot;I-290 (formerly Route 52)&quot; as one of the highways the lifting of the ban applies to.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its southern terminus to its intersection at Exit 90 in [[Plainfield, Connecticut]] with [[State Road 695 (Connecticut)|State Road 695]], I-395 is also part of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]].

==Route description==

From [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] to [[Plainfield, Connecticut]], I-395 is part of the '''[[Connecticut Turnpike]]''' (the '''Gov. John Davis Lodge Turnpike'''). From Plainfield to [[Thompson, Connecticut]], I-395 is named '''The American Ex-Prisoner of War Memorial Highway'''.
