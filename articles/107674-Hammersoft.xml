'''Rosemead''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]].  As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 53,764.  Rosemead is part of a cluster of cities, along with [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], [[Temple City, California|Temple City]], [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]], [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], and [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], in the west [[San Gabriel Valley]] with a growing Asian population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacsla.org/API_demographics.html PACS | Asian Pacific Family Center | Asian Youth Center | Chinatown Service Center | Korean Youth and Community Center | Search to Involve Pilipino Americans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the area around Rosemead was populated by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], or as the Spaniards renamed them, the [[Gabrielino]]s.  In 1771, the Spanish founded the first [[Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel|San Gabriel mission]] in the area that is now known as [[Whittier Narrows]] on the border between [[Montebello, California|Montebello]] and Rosemead. In 1775, the mission  moved to avoid the spring floods that ruined the first crops, to its present location in [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiamissionsonline.com/missions/mission_san_gabriel_arcangel.html Mission San Gabriel Arcangel - History, Photos &amp; Models&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Colonial]] era, the area that is now the City of Rosemead, was part of the land administered by the [[San Gabriel Mission]].  As part of the Mexican government's [[Secularization]] Act of 1833, the land, formerly held by the Mission, was generously distributed to private citizens, requiring only that they build a house and graze cattle,  brought to an end the Mission Era &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfact.com/auction-lot/autographs:-the-revolutionary-secularization-act-1-c-u5zxjrqcbj Lot 40: Autographs: The Revolutionary Secularization Act of 1833 Broadside Signed in Type by President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (CALIFORNIA) Rare Early - Early American | A...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Mexican-American War]] and the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe]] which transferred sovereignty over the territory now known as the State of [[California]] to the United States, Anglo-American immigration began to flow to the area.  The southern part of Rosemead was part of [[Rancho Potrero Grande]] (Large Pasture) which was originally granted to a Native American man named Manuel Antonio, {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} who was a &quot;mayordomo&quot; (overseer) at the San Gabriel Mission.  The {{convert|4431|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} ranch was later transferred to Juan Matias SÃ¡nchez.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1852, John and Harriet Guess  moved cross-country in an ox drawn wagon, to the [[San Gabriel Valley]] from Conway County, Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;[http://www.cityofrosemead.org/index.aspx?page=196 City of Rosemead : Rosemead History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1855, the couple camped where present-day Savannah Elementary School is located on Rio Hondo Avenue. They rented the land until 1867, John Guess purchased {{convert|100|acre|km2|1}} of a {{convert|1164|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} ranch and named it Savannah. The land stretched from [[Valley Boulevard]] to Marshall Street, and from [[Rosemead Boulevard]] to the [[Eaton Wash]].

Other pioneers, Frank Forst and Leonard J. Rose, also settled in this valley. Rose and his wife Amanda bought about {{convert|600|acre|km2|1}} of land between what is now Rosemead Boulevard and Walnut Grove Avenue. Rose bred and trained horses for a living. He named his ranch &quot;Rose's Meadow&quot; which was eventually shortened to   Rosemeade and gave the city its name.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;  Rosemeade  was once again shortened to Rosemead.  The  peaceful, pastoral community  flourished with small truck farms and rabbit and chicken farms. Settlers moved in and also raised vegetables, fruits, grain and feed for the animals.
It wasn't until August 4, 1959, the citizens elected to incorporate Rosemead into a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;
===Rosemead Airport===
Rosemead Airport is one of the vanished former airports  which once were spread all throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area.  Western Air College  operated the airport.  The airport at this location in Rosemead was apparently built at some point between 1940-42, as it was not depicted on  a 1940 LA street map.
The earliest depiction of this airport was on a 1942 street map, which labeled the field as the Western Air College Airport.  At some point between 1942-44 the airport was renamed Rosemead, as that is how it was labeled on the 1944 LA Sectional Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of John Voss).
A flying school was also operated at Rosemead Airport.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/airfields_freeman/CA/Airfields_CA_LA_E.htm#rosemead&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fletcher Aviation]] sold to AJ Industries in the 1960s,  AJ immediately sold the portion of the land from Rio Hondo Avenue almost to Rosemead Boulevard to AeroJet Corporation and they built a large facility there.  It was named Flair Park and the roadway that parallels [[Interstate 10|I-10]] was named Flair Drive.

===Recent history===
Demographics in Rosemead changed significantly in the 1990s.  Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants in large numbers started moving in and opening businesses: ethnic restaurants and stores. The [[Whittier Daily News]] stated &quot;The atmosphere certainly became more urban, in a Hong Kong way.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;R2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.whittierdailynews.com/editorial/ci_17275415 Our View: Low, Alarcon for Rosemead City Council - Whittier Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The small town ambience changed dramatically.  The formerly conservative government changed when young [[John Tran]] was elected to the city council. The more seasoned portion of the city council supported  keeping a safe and secure quality in the small town while rejecting some of Tran's more radical ideas such as a five story city hall, high density development and ushering out the Sheriff's Department and establishing a Rosemead Police Department, a move that would have cost the city millions of dollars, especially during the recession that followed during that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2011&quot;/&gt; Tran also supported a ballot initiative to change to a [[Charter city]],  (like Bell, CA.), which the voters soundly rejected. Tran lost in the next city election by one vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2011&quot;/&gt;

==Demographics==
Rosemead is part of a cluster of cities (along with [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], [[Temple City]], [[Monterey Park]], [[San Marino]], and [[San Gabriel]]) in the west [[San Gabriel Valley]] with a growing Asian population. Rosemead  has a significant  population from [[Mexico]], among other [[Latino]] nationalities. Less than 1% of the population is [[African-American]] or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].

===Politics and Wal-Mart===
Controversies over the development of a [[Wal-Mart]] Supercenter, in a residential section in the southern portion of the city, had been bitterly longstanding.  After some political maneuvering, it opened on September 13, 2006. A recall election to remove two council members that supported the Wal-Mart, Jay Imperial and Gary Taylor, was held on September 19, 2006. The voters defeated the recall in a 60 to 40 percent majority vote.  However, in the general elections that followed shortly thereafter on March 6, 2007,  Polly Low defeated incumbent and former recall target,  Jay Imperial, garnering the highest vote count among the five candidates vying for the two open seats on the council.

==City Council==
Elections for the four year terms, are held every two years in the odd-numbered years. The Council elects from its membership a Mayor to serve as its presiding officer for a one-year term.   [[Margaret Clark]], Steven Ly, and Sandra Armenta, swept the election in March 2009.  In March 2011,  Gary Taylor, who sat on the City Council for 37 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosemead-info.4t.com/ Articles regarding the City of Rosemead, California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  retired after serving his fourth term as mayor,&lt;ref&gt;www.mercurynews.com/california/ci_17570639&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Ly then became mayor and Sandra Armenta, mayor pro-tem. Polly Low was re-elected and William Alarcon, formerly of the Rosemead Planning Commission, came on board as city councilman.

2011 election results:
* Steven Ly
*Sandra Armenta-Mayor pro-tem
* [[Margaret Clark]]
*Polly Low
* William &quot;Bill&quot; Alarcon
* Jeff Allred- City Manager
* Matt Hawkesworth- Assistant city manager

===Savannah Pioneer Cemetery===
Before the Civil War, many Southern families settled in [[El Monte]], then
called Lexington. The community of Rosemead, then called Savannah, {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is located adjacent to El Monte and is situated above the water table. The slightly elevated land made it the logical alternative as the burial site for residents of swampy Lexington. The first known burial was in 1846, five years before most of the settlers arrived. Today the 51/2 acre cemetery, with 200 plots remaining of its original 3,000, is  privately owned by
the El Monte Cemetery Association.  When the City of Rosemead started to widen [[Valley Boulevard]] in the 1920s, construction crews unearthed dozens of corpses outside the fence of the cemetery. The majority of the skeletons were reburied in a mass grave inside the cemetery proper, but some were so deteriorated that the  workers left them
undisturbed and simply paved over them so that  there are more graves scattered under Valley Boulevard and beneath adjacent area businesses. The area also was an Indian burial ground before the bodies of settlers filled the cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgennet.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state/El_Monte_Cemetery_Rpt.htm California Saving Graves&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
