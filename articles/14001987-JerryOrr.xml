==History==

Lincoln Hospital was originally founded in 1839 as the &quot;Home for the Relief of Aged Indigent Black Persons&quot; by a group of prominent philanthropists.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.lincolnemresidency.com/lincolnhospitalhistory
|title= History of Lincoln Medical Center
|accessdate= 2008-01-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital's function gradually became the most important aspect of the operation, and in 1882, the name was changed to &quot;The Colored Home and Hospital.&quot;&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt;

In 1895, after more than half a century of occupying various sites in [[Manhattan]], the Board of Trustees purchased a large lot in the South Bronxâthen a semi-rural area of the cityâat the corner of 141st Street and Southern Boulevard. A new hospital was built; its facilities included the latest developments in medical care.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt; The dedication took place on April 29, 1899. The hospital became a general hospital open to all people without regard to color or creed, although it maintained its founding connection as an institution dedicated to the relief and advancement of the Black people. During the hospital's reorganization and eventual occupation of the new site, its name was changed to Lincoln Hospital, to honor the Great Emancipator.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt;

Because of the increasing demand for services required by a more densely populated South Bronxâand a decreasing supply of philanthropic fundsâin 1925 the Board of Trustees decided to sell Lincoln Hospital to the Department of Public Welfare of the City of New York.  The great outflow of physicians to the Armed Forces during World War II and the drastic socioeconomic decline in the area that followedâerosion of the middle class and great immigration from the southern regions of the United States, the Caribbean, and countries of Latin Americaâtook their toll on Lincoln Hospital. However, the hospital enjoyed a resurgence in the 1970s as one of the finest institutions for the care of the sick and the training of professionals in the newly formed New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt;

In the 1990s, Lincoln became part of the North-Manhattan/South Bronx &quot;Generations Plus Network&quot; together with Metropolitan Hospital, Morrisania Diagnostic and Treatment Center, and Segundo Ruiz Belvis Diagnostic and Treatment Center. In spite of dire predictions, this network continues to strive to provide quality care to a diverse, multiethnic urban population in this era of managed care.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt;

==Lincoln Medical Center today==

In 1976, a new facility was dedicated about two miles from the &quot;Old Lincoln,&quot; at a construction cost of 220 million dollars.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt; The present hospital building incorporates some of the most advanced concepts in hospital design and sophisticated equipment.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt; It occupies five full city blocks, providing health care to the entire South Bronx community, as well as parts of Upper Manhattan.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt; Lincoln also administers the Substance Abuse Division, located at 349 East 140th Street.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt;

As of 2007, Lincoln has a capacity of 342 beds.&lt;ref name=lincoln-site /&gt; Although it constitutes 9% of the beds in the region, Lincoln caters to 31% of the health care visits of this community, where there is fewer than one primary care physician for every 4,000 people.&lt;ref name=lincoln-history /&gt;

Over the last decade, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center has successfully transformed itself to a highly respected medical facility.  Past criticisms about its quality of service&lt;ref name=kozol&gt;{{cite book
