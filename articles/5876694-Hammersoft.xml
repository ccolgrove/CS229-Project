'''''ESPN Major League Baseball''''' is a promotion of [[Major League Baseball]] on [[ESPN]] and [[ESPN2]], with simulcasts on [[ESPNHD]] or [[ESPN2HD]]. ESPN's MLB coverage debuted on April 9, 1990 with three [[Opening Day]] telecasts. ''ESPN Major League Baseball'' is guaranteed to remain on air until 2013.

The title is derived from the fact that it may come on a night when ESPN doesn't have a scheduled game (i.e. Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday). The different weekly regular season games that ESPN presents (as of 2007): ''[[Sunday Night Baseball|Sunday Night Baseball presented by Taco Bell]]'', ''[[Monday Night Baseball|Monday Night Baseball presented by Bank of America]]'' and ''[[Wednesday Night Baseball|Wednesday Night Baseball presented by Goodyear]]'', and formerly ''[[ESPN DayGame|ESPN DayGame presented by Fruit of the Loom]]'' and ''[[Thursday Night Baseball|Thursday Night Baseball powered by Castrol]]''. 

In addition to regular season games, ESPN also airs 10 [[spring training]] games entitled ''[[spring training|ESPN Spring Training]]'' and formerly aired [[Division Series]] playoff games entitled ''The Division Series on ESPN''. [[ESPN]] also airs a daily highlight show called ''[[Baseball Tonight]]'' at 10 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|ET]] and 12 a.m. ET.

[[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]] has also been airing Major League Baseball since [[1998 in baseball|1998]] (succeeding [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS Radio]]), broadcasting ''Sunday Night Baseball'' as well as select other regular-season games, the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] and [[Home Run Derby]], and the entire postseason including the [[Division Series]], [[League Championship Series]], and [[World Series]].  ESPN Radio's current contract runs through the 2010 season.

==History==
Since ESPN first received MLB telecast rights, it has become traditional for the network to make an effort to cover live historic moments in the sport. For example, in [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007]], ESPN and ESPN2 added several telecasts when [[Barry Bonds]] chased [[Hank Aaron]]'s record for most home runs in a MLB career. ESPN had the national telecasts on August 4 when Bonds tied Aaron with number 755 and on August 7, 2007 when he hit number 756. ESPN was also the broadcaster of the final game at the original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as a part of ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' with [[Jon Miller]] and Hall of Famer [[Joe Morgan]]. It also showed [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]]'s 18-inning homer to end the [[2005 National League Division Series|2005 NLDS]].

Also, the network has been given permission to interrupt regular programming, when allowed, to show attempts at new records or significant milestones live. Examples include three cut-ins from its coverage of the first [[X Games]] in 1995 until [[Eddie Murray]] recorded his 3000th hit, live coverage of [[Sammy Sosa]]'s 600th home run in 2007, and a number of no-hitters, including the Buchholz feat mentioned earlier. Although it cannot show any historic attempts live during the [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] or [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] exclusive windows, it was allowed to show an in-progress highlight of [[Alex Rodriguez]]' 500th career home run in August 2007, as this was on a Saturday afternoon before Fox went on the air with its game coverage.

===1990s===
On January 5, 1989, [[Major League Baseball]] signed a [[United States dollar|$]]400 million deal with [[ESPN]], who would show over 175 games beginning in [[1990 in baseball|1990]]. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'', ''[[ESPN Wednesday Night Baseball|Wednesday Night Baseball]]'' and [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]]s on Tuesdays and Fridays), as well as multiple games on [[Opening Day]], [[Memorial Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], and [[Labor Day]].

On April 15, 1990, ESPN's ''Sunday Night Baseball'' debuted with the experienced [[play-by-play]] announcer [[Jon Miller]] joining retired [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] player [[Joe Morgan]] in the broadcast booth. In its first year, ''Sunday Night Baseball'' averaged a 3.0 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]. That was double the number that ESPN as a whole was averaging at the time (1.5). By [[1998 in baseball|1998]], ESPN enjoyed its largest baseball audience ever (a 9.5 Nielsen rating) as [[Mark McGwire]] hit his 61st home run of the season. When ESPN first broadcasted ''Sunday Night Baseball'', they would show at least one game from every ballpark. Also, every team was guaranteed an appearance. It was essentially, the television equivalent to a cross country stadium tour.

In {{by|1994}}, ESPN renewed its baseball contract for six years (through the {{by|1999}} season). The new deal was worth [[United States dollar|$]]42.5 million per year and $255 million overall. The deal was ultimately voided after the {{by|1995}} season and ESPN was pretty much forced to restructure their contract. In {{by|1995}}, ESPN broadcast the [[1995 American League West tie-breaker game|American League West tie-breaker game]] between the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] and [[1995 California Angels season|California Angels]] with [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]] making the call.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIPreGame&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1995/9510020028.asp|title=JOHNSON'S TASK TODAY: BEST ANGELS, OR M'S STAY HOME|last=Street|first=Jim|date=1995-10-02|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{by|1996}}, ESPN began a five year contract with Major League Baseball worth [[United States dollar|$]]440 million and about $80 million per year. [[ESPN]] paid for the rights to a Wednesday night doubleheader and ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'', as well as Opening Day and holiday telecasts and all postseason games not aired on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] or [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]. Major League Baseball staggered the times of first-round games to provide a full-day feast for viewers: ESPN could air games at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 11 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EDT]], with the broadcast networks telecasting the prime time game.

In {{mlby|1998}}, ESPN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cubs Even With Giants; Sosa Still at 66; Cubs Keep Pace With Giants; Cubs 3, Astros 2|date=September 27, 1998|first=William|last=Gildea|newspaper=Washington Post|page=D01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Baseball takes bite out of football audience|date=September 29, 1998|first=Josh|last=Dubow|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast the [[1998 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game|National League Wild Card tie-breaker game]] between the [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] and [[1998 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]].

===2000s===
ESPN and ESPN2 had contracts (which were signed in {{by|2000}} and ran through {{by|2005}}) to show selected weeknight and ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' games, along with Opening Day and holiday games and selected Division Series playoff games. The contracts with [[ESPN]] were worth [[United States dollar|$]]141.8 million per year and $851 million overall.

After [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] bought [[ABC Family|Fox Family]] (who from 2000&amp;ndash;{{by|2001}} aired Thursday night games) in {{by|2002}} to become [[ABC Family]] the Division Series games aired on [[ABC Family]] (with ESPN's announcers, graphics, and music) for one year. ESPN then added these games, along with the Thursday night games (subsequently shifted to weekday afternoon [[ESPN DayGame|&quot;DayGame&quot;]] broadcasts), to its package.

====2005====
[[Versus (TV channel)|OLN]] was briefly considering picking up the rights to the Sunday and Wednesday games, which expired after the 2005 season. On September 14, 2005 however, ESPN, then the current rights holder, signed an eight year contract with [[Major League Baseball]], highlighted by the continuation of ESPN's ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' series with additional, exclusive team appearances. The key details of the agreement were:
*Up to 80 regular-season telecasts per year;
*No blackout restrictions on exclusive ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]''; ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]'', with [[ESPN]] mostly coexisting with local carriers
*Up to five appearances per team per year on the exclusive ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' series, up from 11 over three years;
*Daily ''[[Baseball Tonight]]'' programs â one of ESPN's most popular seriesâincluding the continued right to show in-progress highlights and live cut-ins;
*[[Home Run Derby]], ESPN's highest-rated program of the summer and one of cable's best, and additional All-Star programming;
*Continuation of season-long Wednesday baseball on ESPN and [[ESPN2]];
*For the first time, the 11 p.m. ET ''[[SportsCenter]]'' will present a nightly ''Baseball Tonight'' update featuring in-progress highlights;
*Select games and MLB All-Star events on ESPN2 throughout the season;
*10 [[spring training]] games and several [[Opening Day]] games per year;
*Telecast rights for [[ESPNHD]], [[ESPN2HD]], [[ESPN Deportes]] and [[ESPN International]];
*Ability to include Major League Baseball programming as part of the delivery of the ESPN networks via cable, satellite and other new or developing technologies, such as cell phones and wireless devices;
*Archival footage and game programming and &quot;Instant Classic&quot; rights for [[ESPN Classic]].
*[[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]] also maintains exclusive terrestrial rights.

The weekday afternoon &quot;DayGame&quot; telecasts that ESPN and ESPN2 had previously aired were eliminated in the new pact, along with the late (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday night game (although ESPN can elect to show a late game instead of an early one should it so desire), and the coverage of [[Memorial Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], and [[Labor Day]] games (except for games that fall under the regular Monday-night slot).

ESPN's Monday and Wednesday telecasts remain mostly nonexclusive, meaning the games also can be televised by each club's local broadcasters. In fact, Wednesday games are [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] on ESPN unless a participating team's local broadcaster does not choose to televise the game. The Sunday games remain on ESPN only, and with ESPN gaining the rights to ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' telecasts, it looks likely that ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' will run uninterrupted on ESPN throughout the season, except on Opening Night (when it will air on ESPN2, since it usually conflicts with the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Women's Basketball Final Four]]).

Alternate telecasts for home-team markets which are blacked out have also been phased out, either in an effort to save costs or in an effort to allocate more satellite space for high-definition broadcasts on ESPNHD. Those who get ESPN via cable get [[ESPNEWS]] instead, and those who get the channel via satellite see a blank picture and a blackout notice.

MLB will receive, on average, [[United States dollar|$]]296 million a year under the new agreement, a television and a baseball official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement in the deal. ESPN will pay baseball $273.5 million in [[2006 in baseball|2006]], $293.5 million in each of the following four years, $308.5 million in 2011 and $306 million in each of the final two seasons.

====2006====
On July 25, 2006, [[Harold Reynolds]] was fired from ESPN. The ESPN spokeswoman confirmed that Reynolds &quot;is no longer with the network&quot; but did not give a reason for the departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Three people who work at ESPN and familiar with the case said the cause was a pattern of sexual harassment.&quot; Reynolds confirmed that an accusation of sexual harassment was the reason for his departure but called it &quot;a total misunderstanding&quot; and that &quot;I gave a woman a hug and I felt like it was misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2008, ESPN and Reynolds reached an [[out-of-court settlement]].

Weeks later, [[Peter Gammons]] was sidelined with a [[brain aneurysm]]. Gammons returned to ESPN in early [[September 2006|September]].

ESPN telecasts in [[2006 in television|2006]], posted an average of 1,115,000 household impressions, up 27% when compared to 2005's 875,000. The corresponding 1.2 rating this year marks a 20% increase over the 1.0 average in 2005. ESPN2's baseball telecasts have averaged 704,000 households, an increase of 34% over 2005's 525,000. Ratings on ESPN2 went up 33% (0.8 vs. 0.6).

After the [[2006 Division Series (disambiguation)|2006 Division Series]], ESPN lost the rights to broadcast playoff games on TV. All postseason games, from possible one-game playoffs to the [[World Series]], have aired on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Sports]] and [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] since 2007. Games remained on [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]]. ESPN also lost rights to ''[[ESPN DayGame|ESPN DayGame presented by Fruit of the Loom]]'' and ''[[Thursday Night Baseball|Thursday Night Baseball powered by Castrol]]''.

The play-by-play commentators for ''ESPN DayGame'' were [[Gary Thorne]] or [[Jon Sciambi]], along with [[Steve Phillips]], and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] as color analysts. The program was sponsored by [[Fruit of the Loom]] in 2006. The game generally aired on Wednesday or Thursday. The final game to date was aired on [[September 30]], [[2006 in baseball|2006]].

====2007====
Because of the reduction of ESPN's weekly schedule from five games to three, ESPN released numerous commentators from the network, including [[Jeff Brantley]], [[Tino Martinez]], [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] and [[Eric Karros]].

With the new deal coming into play this year, several things changed with the Monday and Wednesday night games in particular. For ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]'', the telecast will now co-exist with teams' local carriers up to three times per year, up from two times in previous years. ''[[Wednesday Night Baseball]]'' also changed slightly. Now, in addition to the featured game that night, they will also have some live cut-ins to other games across the nation and discuss some the hot topics in the major leagues.

On April 1, for the season-opening game between the [[2007 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] and the [[2007 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], ESPN changed its on-screen graphics to the version that debuted with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in [[2006 NFL season|2006]] and was later adopted by its [[NBA on ESPN|NBA coverage]] at the start of the [[2006-2007 NBA season|2006-07 season]]. The previous graphics dated back to the advent of [[ESPN HD]] in [[2004 in television|2004]].

During the week of the [[2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], ''Baseball Tonight'' and ''[[SportsCenter]]'' did not travel to the game site as it normally does; the 2007 site was [[AT&amp;T Park]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The reason was that MLB stripped ESPN of its on-site credentials for its studio crew as punishment for leaking the rosters of the All-Star teams before [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] did. TBS' announcement, which was billed as exclusive, was scheduled for 4 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern time]] but was delayed for nearly two hours, by which point ESPN, in apparent violation of its contract with MLB, went ahead and revealed the rosters anyway. ESPN later agreed to promote playoff coverage on TBS and Fox (alongside its own radio coverage) in return for ''Baseball Tonight'' going on the air shortly after each night's games concluded.

ESPN pre-empted part of the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]]&amp;ndash;[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] [[college football]] game on September 1 to show the end of the [[no-hitter]] thrown by [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] pitcher [[Clay Buchholz]].

====2008====
ESPN2 showed the season-opening games in Tokyo between the [[2008 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] and the [[2008 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. Unfortunately, due to a [[transponder]] failure, viewers on [[DirecTV]] reliant on the [[standard-definition]] feed missed the first of the two games. ([[ESPNHD]] was unaffected.)

On March 30, ESPN showed the first-ever game at [[Nationals Park]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The [[2008 Washington Nationals season|Nationals]] defeated the [[2008 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] on a walk-off home run by [[Ryan Zimmerman]].

On May 4, ESPN introduced enhanced updates targeting viewers who play [[fantasy baseball]]. It shows season batting statistics for the current batter on each potential count and updates batting average and other selected stats after the at-bat concludes.

===2010s===
====2010====
Starting with the April 3 season opener between the [[Yankees â Red Sox rivalry|New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox]], ESPN began using the same graphics package which debuted with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in {{nfly|2009}}. The score banner was converted to a score box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. And instead of numbers to represent the balls, strikes and outs, dots were represented for each: three green dots for balls, two yellow dots for strikes, and two red dots for outs. The pitch count was also introduced, adopted from the [[New York Yankees]]' broadcasts on the [[YES Network]], as well as [[NESN]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]].  College baseball and softball broadcasts, however, continued to use the previous (2007) graphics for the [[2010 College World Series]] telecasts.  ESPN's coverage of the [[2010 Little League World Series|Little League World Series]] also retained the 2007 graphics until midway through, and then adopted the current (2010) graphics package.

''[[Baseball Tonight]]'', a daily highlight show aired on ESPN during the baseball season, likewise introduced new graphics adopted from ''[[SportsCenter]]'' in June 2010.

====2011====
The ''ESPN Major League Baseball'' score box was slightly modified beginning with the opening day game between the [[2011 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] and the [[2011 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. Numbers indicating the ball, strike and out counts replace the dots used last year; the out dots were adopted by [[Fox Sports Net]] on their local broadcasts as well as ''[[Major League Baseball on Fox]]''. The pitch speed and count are now fixed below the bases graphic. Also, the area around the bases graphic and ball, strike, and out counter is slightly translucent.

Beginning with the [[Sunday Night Baseball]] [[interleague play|interleague]] game between the New York Yankees and the [[2011 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] on June 19, the graphics were slightly adjusted to fit in with the [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] for [[high-definition television|HD]] broadcasts, similar to what [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Saturday Baseball]], [[Root Sports]] and [[Fox Sports Net]] have done for their baseball coverage. [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] would follow suit in adjusting their graphics to the 16:9 aspect ratio.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:espnmlbkzone1.jpg|thumb|250px|''K Zone 1.0'']] --&gt;
Through the years, [[ESPN]] has enhanced its Major League Baseball coverage with the introduction and implementation of innovative technology. Which include:
*'''April [[1995 in baseball|1995]]'''- ESPN debuted in-game box scores during [[Major League Baseball]] telecasts. Hitting, pitching and fielding stats from the game are shown along the bottom of the screen three times per game.
*'''May/June [[1997 in baseball|1997]]'''- ESPN debuted ''MaskCam'' on an umpire at the [[1997 College World Series|College World Series]], adding it to major league coverage the following year.
*'''April [[1998 in baseball|1998]]'''- ESPN debuts ''BatTrack'', which measures the bat speed of hitters.
*'''April 15, 2001'''- ''ESPN Dead Center'' debuted on ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' with [[2001 Texas Rangers season|Texas]] vs. [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]]. This new camera angle, directly behind the pitcher, is used to provide true depiction of inside/outside pitch location and is used in certain parks in conjunction with ''K Zone''.
*'''July 1, 2001'''- ''K Zone'' officially debuted on ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]''.
*'''April 7, 2002'''- ESPN became the first network to place a microphone on a player during a regular-season baseball game. &quot;Player Mic&quot; was worn by [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]] catcher [[Ramon Hernandez]] (who also wore &quot;MaskCam&quot;) and taped segments were heard.
*'''May 26, 2002'''- &quot;UmpireCam&quot; debuted, worn by [[Matt Hollowell]] behind the plate in the [[2002 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] at [[2002 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] telecast.
*'''March 30, 2003'''- ESPNHD, a [[high-definition television|high-definition]] simulcast service of ESPN, debuted with the first regular-season MLB game of the season - [[2003 Texas Rangers season|Texas]] at [[2003 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim]].
*'''April [[2004 in baseball|2004]]'''- ESPN's ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' telecasts added a [[fantasy baseball]] bottom line, updating viewers on the stats for their rotisserie league players at 15 and 45 minutes after the hour.
*'''April 10, 2005'''- &quot;SkyCam&quot; premiered during ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]''. &quot;SkyCam&quot; is mounted more than 20 feet above the stands in foul territory and travels down a designated base path (first or third base line, from behind home plate to the foul pole), capturing overhead views of the action. The remote-controlled camera can zoom, pan and tilt.
*'''April 2, 2006'''- A handheld camera brings viewers closer to the action for in-game live shots of home run celebrations, managers approaching the mound and more.
*'''May 1, 2006'''- 'K Zone 2.0' debuted on ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]''.
