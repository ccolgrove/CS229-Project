The '''1996 Alabama Crimson Tide football team''' represented the [[University of Alabama]] for the [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|1996â97 college football season]], competing in the Western Division in the [[Southeastern Conference]]. [[Gene Stallings]] led the Crimson Tide to a 10â3 record in his final year with the program. The team played their home games at [[Bryant-Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], and [[Legion Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].

Alabama's loss to Mississippi State broke a 15 game winning streak Alabama had in the series and was their first loss to the Bulldogs since a dramatic upset MSU posted over the #1 ranked Tide in 1980.

Following a victory in the annual [[Iron Bowl]] on November 23, head coach Gene Stallings announced his retirement, which would go into effect at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Tide prevails; Stallings retires: Auburn Bama both blow leads| publisher=The Atlanta Journal| pages=F1| date=1996-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
