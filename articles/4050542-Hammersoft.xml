'''PCU ''Gerald R. Ford'' (CVN-78)''' is to be the [[lead ship]] of [[Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier|her class]] of [[United States Navy]] [[supercarrier]]s.  As announced by the U.S. Navy on 16&amp;nbsp;January 2007, the ship will be named after the 38th [[President of the United States]], the late [[Gerald R. Ford]], whose [[World War II]] naval service included combat duty aboard the [[light aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26|2}} in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=10399 Navy Names New Aircraft Carrier USS Gerald R.

==Design and development==

The [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class aircraft carrier]] has been an integral part of United States power projection strategy since ''Nimitz'' was first commissioned. Displacing approximately 100,000 tons when fully loaded, a ''Nimitz''-class carrier is capable of steaming faster than thirty [[Knot (unit)|knots]], self-sustaining for up to ninety days, and launching aircraft to strike targets hundreds of miles away.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ship Information.&quot; USS ''Nimitz'' Homepage. 4&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The endurance of this class is exemplified by [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)|USS ''Theodore Roosevelt'']], which spent 159&amp;nbsp;days underway in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] without the need to visit a port or be refueled.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Our Ship.&quot; USS ''Theodore Roosevelt'' (CVN&amp;nbsp;71) Web Page. 4&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the lifespan of the class many new technologies have been successfully integrated into the design of this vessel. However, with the technical advances made in the past decade the ability of the US Navy to make improvements to this class of ship has become more limited. âThe biggest problems facing the ''Nimitz''-class are the limited electrical power generation capability and the upgrade-driven increase in ship weight and erosion of the center of gravity margin needed to maintain ship stability.â&lt;ref&gt;Schank, John. Modernizing the U.S. Aircraft Carrier Fleet: Accelerating CVN&amp;nbsp;21 Production Versus Mid-Life Refueling. Santa Monica: Rand Corporation, 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt;

With these constraints in mind the Navy developed what was initially known as the &quot;CVN-21&quot; program, which ultimately evolved into CVN-78, ''Gerald R. Ford''. Improvements were made through developing technologies and more efficient design. Major design changes include a larger [[flight deck]], improvements in weapons and material handling, a new propulsion plant design that requires fewer personnel to operate and maintain, and a new smaller island that has been pushed aft. Technological advances in the field of electromagnetics have led to the development of an [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System|Electromagnetic Aircraft Launching System]], (EMALS), and an Advanced [[Arresting gear|Arresting Gear]], (AAG). An integrated warfare system has been developed to support flexibility in adapting the infrastructure of the ship to future mission roles. The new Dual Band Radar (DBR) combines [[S-band]] and [[X-band]] radar in a single system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larrabee, Chuck 2008&quot;&gt;Larrabee, Chuck. &quot;DDG 1000 Dual Band Radar (DBR).&quot; Raytheon. 1&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With new design and technology the Ford will have a 25% increase in [[sortie]] generation, threefold increase in electrical generating capacity, increased operational availability, and a number of quality of life improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Aircraft Carriers - CVN 21 Program.&quot; The US Navy -- Fact File. 8&amp;nbsp;October 2007. 4&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements for a higher sortie rate of around 160 exits a day with surges to a maximum of 220 sorties a day in times of crisis and intense air warfare activity, has led to design changes in the flight deck, which enable greater aircraft launch capabilities.

===Flight deck===
Changes to the flight deck are the most visible of the differences between the ''Nimitz'' and ''Gerald R. Ford'' classes. Several sections have been altered from the layout of the ''Nimitz'' class flight deck to improve aircraft handling, storage, and flow. Catapult number four on the ''Nimitz'' class cannot launch fully loaded aircraft because of a deficiency of wing clearance along the edge of the flight deck.&lt;ref&gt;Schank, John. ''Modernizing the U.S. Aircraft Carrier Fleet'', p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;  CVN-78 will have no catapult-specific restrictions on launching aircraft, but still retains 4 catapults, 2 bow and 2 waist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4200&amp;tid=250&amp;ct=4] Navy Fact File for CVN-21 program&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of aircraft lifts from hangar deck to flight deck level is also reduced from the earlier ships from 4 to 3. The design changes to the flight deck are instrumental in the maximization of [[sortie]] generation.

The route of weapons to the aircraft stops on the flight deck has been replanned to accommodate higher re-arming rates, and in turn higher potential sortie rates. 

Another major change: a smaller, redesigned island will be pushed further back relative to the older classes of carriers. Moving the island creates deck space for a centralized re-arming and re-fueling location. This reduces the number of times that an aircraft will have to be moved after landing before it can be launched again. Fewer aircraft movements require, in turn, fewer deck hands to accomplish them, reducing the size of the ship's crew.  A similar benefit is realized by altering the path and procedures for weapons movement by [[Modern United States Navy carrier air operations#Flight Deck Crew / Key Personnel|redshirts]] from storage to flight deck, again potentially allowing the new ship to support a higher sortie rate than the Nimitz class ship while using fewer crew members than the Nimitz requires. On ''Nimitz''-class carriers the time that it takes to launch a plane after it has landed is defined by the time necessary to re-arm and re-fuel. To minimize this time, [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] will be moved by [[Robotics|robotic devices]] from storage areas to the centralized re-arming location via re-located weapons elevators. The new path that ordnance follows does not cross any areas of aircraft movement, thereby reducing traffic problems in the hangars and on the flight deck. According to Rear Admiral Dennis M. Dwyer these changes will make it theoretically possible to re-arm the airplanes in &quot;minutes instead of hours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keeter, Hunter. &quot;New carrier island is a heart of higher sortie rates for CVN&amp;nbsp;21.&quot; BNET Business Management Network. 4&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power generation===
The propulsion and power plant of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers was designed in the 1960s. Technological capabilities of that time did not require the same quantity of electrical power that modern technologies do. &quot;New technologies added to the ''Nimitz''-class ships have generated increased demands for electricity; the current base load leaves little margin to meet expanding demands for power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schank, John. ''Modernizing the U.S. Aircraft Carrier Fleet'' p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;    Increasing the capability of the U.S. Navy to improve the technological level of the carrier fleet required a larger capacity power system.

The new [[A1B reactor]] plant is a smaller, more efficient design that provides approximately three times the electrical power of the ''Nimitz''-class [[A4W reactor]] plant. The modernization of the plant led to a [[Energy Density|higher core energy density]], lower demands for pumping power, a simpler construction, and the use of modern electronic controls and displays. These changes resulted in a two thirds reduction of watch standing requirements and a significant decrease of required maintenance.&lt;ref name=RAND&gt;{{cite web

A larger power output is a major component to the [[Electronic Warfare|integrated warfare system]]. Engineers took extra steps to ensure that integrating unforeseen technological advances onto a ''Gerald R. Ford''-class aircraft carrier would be possible. The ''Gerald R. Ford''-class will be an integral component of the fleet for a total of nearly ninety years. One lesson learned from that is that for a ship design to be successful over the course of a century, a great deal of foresight and flexibility is required. Integrating new technologies with the ''Nimitz'' class is becoming more difficult to do without any negative consequences. To bring the ''Gerald R. Ford'' class into dominance during the next century of [[naval warfare]] requires that the class be capable of seamlessly upgrading to more advanced systems.

===Launch systems===
The ''Nimitz''-class aircraft carriers use steam-powered catapults to launch aircraft. [[Aircraft catapult|Steam catapults]] were developed in the 1950s and have been exceptionally reliable. For over fifty years at least one of the four catapults has been able to launch an aircraft 99.5% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Schank, John. ''Modernizing the U.S. Aircraft Carrier Fleet'', p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of drawbacks. âThe foremost deficiency is that the catapult operates without [[Control Theory|feedback control]]. With no feedback, there often occurs large [[Transient (oscillation)|transients]] in tow force that can damage or reduce the life of the airframe.â&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael, Douglas  Samuel, Thomas Conway, and Robert Klimowski. &quot;Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System - EMALS.&quot; Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. 1&amp;nbsp;March. p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The steam system is massive, inefficient (4â6%),&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael, &quot;Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System - EMALS.&quot; p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; and hard to control.

Control problems with the system results in minimum and maximum weight limits. The minimum weight limit is above the weight of all [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s. An inability to launch the latest additions to the [[Modern US Navy carrier air operations|Naval Air Forces]] is a restriction on operations that cannot continue into the next generation of aircraft carriers. The [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System|Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS)]] provides solutions to all these problems. An electromagnetic system is more efficient, smaller, lighter, more powerful, and easier to control. Increased control means that [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System|EMALS]] will be able to launch both heavier and lighter aircraft than the steam catapult. Also, the use of a controlled force will reduce the stress on airframes, resulting in less maintenance and a longer lifetime for the airframe. Unfortunately the power limitations for the ''Nimitz'' class make the installation of the recently developed EMALS impossible.

Electromagnetics will also be used in the new Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) system. The current system relies on hydraulics to slow and stop a landing aircraft. While effective, as demonstrated by more than fifty years of implementation, the AAG system offers a number of improvements. The current system is unable to capture UAVs without damaging them due to extreme stresses on the airframe. UAVs do not have the necessary mass to drive the large hydraulic piston used to trap heavier manned planes. By using electromagnetics the energy absorption is controlled by a turbo-electric engine. This makes the trap smoother and reduces shock on airframes. Even though the system will look the same from the flight deck as its predecessor, it will be more flexible, safer, more reliable, and require less maintenance and manning.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Carmelo. &quot;Launch and Recovery Testing.&quot; ITEA-SAN. Turboelectric Arresting Gear. Mission Valley Hotel, San Diego. 16&amp;nbsp;June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===
Another addition to ''Gerald R. Ford'' class is an integrated search &amp; tracking radar system. The Dual-band radar is being developed for both the [[DDG 1000]] ''Zumwalt'' class of guided missile destroyers and the ''Gerald R. Ford'' class of aircraft carriers. The island can be kept smaller by replacing six to ten radar antennas with a single six-faced radar. The DBR works by combining the X-Band AN/SPY-3 Multi-Function Radar with the S-Band Volume Search Radar.&lt;ref&gt;Larrabee, Chuck. &quot;Raytheon Successfully Integrates Final Element of Dual Band Radar for DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer.&quot; Raytheon News Release. 4&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The three faces dedicated to the X-band radar are responsible for low altitude tracking and target illumination, while the other three faces dedicated to the S-band are responsible for target search and tracking regardless of weather. âOperating simultaneously over two electromagnetic frequency ranges, the DBR marks the first time this functionality has been achieved using two frequencies coordinated by a single resource manager.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Larrabee, Chuck 2008&quot;/&gt;  This new system has no moving parts, therefore minimizing maintenance and manning requirements for operation.

===Possible upgrades===
Each new technology and design feature integrated into the ''Ford''-class aircraft carrier improves sortie generation, manning requirements, and operational capabilities. Preparing for the future is a trademark of ''Gerald R. Ford''. New defense systems, such as [[free electron laser]] [[directed-energy weapon]]s, dynamic armor, and tracking systems will require more power. âOnly half of the electrical power-generation capability on CVN&amp;nbsp;78 is needed to run currently planned systems, including EMALS. CVN&amp;nbsp;78 will thus have the power reserves that the ''Nimitz'' class lacks to run lasers and dynamic armor.â&lt;ref&gt;Schank, John. ''Modernizing the U.S. Aircraft Carrier Fleet'' p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of new technologies, power systems, design layout, and better control systems results in an increased sortie rate of 25% over the ''Nimitz'' class and a 25% reduction in manpower required to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Leslie. &quot;CVN&amp;nbsp;21 MS&amp;A Overview.&quot; NDIA. 7&amp;nbsp;June 2006. 1&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakthrough waste management technology will be deployed on the new Gerald R. Ford.  Co-developed with the US Navy, PyroGenesis Canada Inc, in 2008, was awarded the contract to outfit the ship with a Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS). This compact system will treat all combustible solid waste generated onboard the ship.  After having completed factory acceptance testing in Montreal, the system is scheduled to be shipped to the Huntington Ingalls shipyard in late 2011 where it will be installed on the carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite | title = The Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System to Reduce Waste Aboard CVN-78, pg. 13

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
On 10 September 2008 the US Navy signed a $5.1&amp;nbsp;billion contract with [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]], to design and construct the carrier.  Northrop had begun advance construction of the carrier under a $2.7&amp;nbsp;billion contract in 2005.  The carrier is being constructed at the Northrop Grumman Newport News shipbuilding in [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], which employs 19,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Kathy, &quot;Newport News Shipyard Gets $5.1B Contract For Carrier Ford&quot;, ''[[Norfolk Virginian-Pilot]]'', September&amp;nbsp;11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The keel of the new warship was ceremonially laid on November 14, 2009 in Dry Dock 12&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|37.0014|-76.4462 |format=dms |region:US-VA_scale:2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales.  Said Bales in a speech to the assembled shipworkers and DoD officials, &quot;Dad met the staggering challenges of restoring trust in the presidency and healing the nation's wounds after Watergate in the only way he knew how â with complete honesty and integrity. And that is the legacy we remember this morning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Peter, &quot;Shipyard Lays Keel Of Carrier In Solemn Tribute To Gerald R. Ford&quot;, ''[[Newport News Daily Press]]'', November 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, the carrier was reported to be approximately &quot;half completed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/aug/18/navys-next-aircraft-carrier-halfway-complete/&lt;/ref&gt;
