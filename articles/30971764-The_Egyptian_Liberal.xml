The '''2011 Omani protests''' were a series of  protests in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf]] country of [[Oman]]. They were a part of the [[revolutionary wave]] popularly known as the [[Arab Spring]]. It's the first protest to be ended among the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brecorder.com/world/global-business-a-economy/19759-oman-budget-gap-rises-to-658mn-in-q1-spending-up.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other protests in the region, Omanâs demonstrators have emphasised their loyalty to their ruler, while voicing their dissatisfaction on  corrupt officials. The sultan responded to most of the demands which focus largely on more jobs and higher minimum salaries for Omanis, in addition to more power for the legislative council and the removal of several corrupt ministers.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.gulfnews.com/news/gulf/oman/protesters-in-oman-happy-with-qaboos-decision-to-give-council-of-oman-powers-1.776309&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Protesters demanded salary increases and lower costs of living. On 20 February 2011, protesters welcomed a move by the government to increase the [[minimum wage]].&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera. Headlines.&lt;/ref&gt; The wage increase targets Omani workers in the private sector. Public sector Omani employees have received wage increases in the past, but the private sector was so far overlooked. The [[Government of Oman]] raised minimum wages for an estimated 150,000 private sector employees to $520 from $364 a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110226-oman-boosts-student-benefits |title=Oman boosts student benefits |publisher=France24 |date=|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As protests continued in Sohar the demands were still jobs and political reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;1mar&quot;/&gt; The protesters also want more jobs, [[freedom of expression]], less government control over the media,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;/&gt; political reforms, better living conditions, an abolition of taxes and the trial of all ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;/&gt;

Protesters in Muscat also demanded cabinet ministers not serve more than four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Al |first=Saleh |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/19/us-oman-protests-idUSTRE71I0V920110219 |title=Oman protesters call for political reform, pay rise |publisher=Reuters |date=19 February 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several other protests, Omanis also demanded the reduction of foreign workers in order to provide more jobs for Omani citizens by private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Omanization|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/pay-raise-ends-walkout-by-workers-at-300-firms-in-industrial-park-in-oman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-government protests==
About 200 protesters marched on 17 January demanding salary increases and lower costs of living.

After reports of multiple deaths, the minister of health of Oman claimed only one person had been killed and 20 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/01/3151369.htm One dead as protests spread to Oman - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, The [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] issued a statement saying that complaints were filed by some citizens about acts of rioting, vandalism and breach of public order, and destruction of public and private properties and obstructing business transactions and easy movement of people on the streets. Based in these complains, Public Prosecution give orders to crackdowns by competent authorities. The Omani army stormed the [[Globe Roundabout]] in Sohar clearing blockades and arrested a number of protesters ending a month-old sit-in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasiareview.com/oman-soldiers-use-force-to-end-one-month-sit-in-29032011/ Oman: Soldiers Use Force To End One Month Sit-In&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jCx0tMQLB9ylW1Ng9XB3MDM00ggg?docId=CNG.34a222e35c6a2e98d03744cee3b43b05.621 AFP: Omani army ends pro-reform sit-in&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/March/middleeast_March485.xml&amp;section=middleeast Omanâs Public Prosecution orders arrest of protesters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/03/29/Oman-forces-crack-down-on-protesters/UPI-89971301402206/ Oman forces crack down on protesters - UPI.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE72S0LO20110329?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 | work=Reuters | title=Oman army clears roadblocks in Sohar pay protest | date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of force to clear the roundabout occurred after protesters had blocked traffic at the roundabout for nearly five weeks. The protests at the roundabout also coincided with several acts of forced shut down of government and private sector offices and arson in Sohar and Ibri which finally forced the Omani authorities to take tougher action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Stories-Files/Ministry-of-Manpower-shut-down-forcibly-in-Sohar/%28language%29/eng-GB Ministry of Manpower shut down forcibly in Sohar - Oman News|Muscatdaily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April, following Friday prayers, hundreds of protesters took to streets in Sohar demanding the release of people detained in the Public Prosecution crackdowns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gHKIGxf2JZ3o5w-LiUjdo0NE-Zhw?docId=6432720] {{Dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 50 protesters were detained by security forces.

On 2 April, dozens of protesters staged a sit-in in Muscat, outside the chief prosecutor's office, to demand probes into alleged state abuses after clashes with security forces a day earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJOman2Apr&quot;/&gt;

On 5 April, the public prosecutor of Oman announced that it had apprehended individuals who were preparing petrol bombs and were gathering weapons. It stated that they probably planned to use these weapons in a demonstration in the northern industrial city of Sohar on Friday (8 April).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jWiOn6yAppzR7KYiZQ408HJqGZQg?docId=6469194] {{Dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April, the public prosecutor's office release details and photographs of others who were arrested including one which went by the fancy name of 'Dragon Gang'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Stories-Files/Dragon-Gang-head-arrested-in-Sohar/%28language%29/eng-GB âDragon Gangâ head arrested in Sohar - Oman News|Muscatdaily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the arrest of these individuals the situation in Sohar calmed down.

On 8 April after rumours had abounded that a large number of protesters, including women and children, would take to the streets of Sohar after the Friday prayers, nothing untoward was reported by the local media. The Omani army took control of the city setting up multiple checkpoints and arresting a few wanted individuals. The situation in the port city has been calm since that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Stories-Files/Sohar-peaceful-under-heavy-security-cover/%28language%29/eng-GB Sohar peaceful under heavy security cover - Oman News|Muscatdaily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May, protesters returned to the streets in [[Salalah]] after Friday prayers. The protesters called for democratic reform and an end to corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/news/hundreds-call-for-reform-end-to-graft-in-oman Hundreds call for reform, end to graft in Oman - TrustLaw&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The activists and protesters have reiterated their demands for the sacked ministers to be investigated. This was the fourth consecutive Friday to be marked by protests in Salalah.

Police broke up a protest camp in Salalah on 12 May, arresting an unknown number of protesters, possibly over 100. Several dozen more protesters were attacked by baton-wielding [[gendarmerie|gendarmes]] and arrested in Salalah on 13 May and early 14 May while demanding jobs and higher pay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/newswires/920067-omani-forces-arrest-protesters-after-clashes/ Omani forces arrest protesters after clashes]&lt;/ref&gt; Omani newspaper [[Muscat Daily]] reported that protesters clashed with the army on Salalah's central Al Nahda street following the first wave of arrests.

==Pro-government rallies==
On 1 March a rally was organised in Muscat to show support for the Sultan and his government. There were accusations that the government itself organised the rally, though at least some support was a &quot;part genuine outpouring of affection for the sultan.&quot; However, multiple [[sms]]' were sent from the state-owned [[Omantel]] network during the nights precedeing the protests urging loyalists to attend.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller |first=Thomas |title=Rallies in Oman Steer Clear Of Criticism of Its Leader |work=The New York Times |page=8 |date=2 March 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/world/middleeast/02oman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February, the Sultan reshuffled the cabinet&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; in response to recent protests. The 84-member [[Consultative Assembly of Oman|Shura council]] is elected by voters across 61 districts, but works in a purely advisory capacity and has no legislative powers. The cabinet reshuffle saw [[Mohammed bin Nasser al-Khasibi]] named commerce and industry minister, [[Hamoud bin Faisal al-Bousaidi]] as civil service minister and [[Madiha bint Ahmed bin Nasser]] as education minister. Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Harthy]], the outgoing civil service minister, was appointed to head the environment ministry, while [[Maqboul bin Ali bin Sultan]] will be the new transport minister and [[Mohsen bin Mohammed al-Sheikh]] becomes tourism minister. Protesters had called upon the Sultan to remove [[Maqbool Bin Ali Bin Sultan]] from the post of commerce minister as they viewed him as corrupt and inadequate for the task of running the ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/oman/sultan-qaboos-reshuffles-oman-cabinet-1.768277 |title=Sultan Qaboos reshuffles Oman cabinet |publisher=gulfnews |date=|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan also announced benefits for the students of [[Higher College of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/February/middleeast_February780.xml&amp;section=middleeast |title=Oman takes measures to address public grievances |publisher=Khaleejtimes.com |date=|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students whose homes are 100&amp;nbsp;km away from the place of study, will be now given 90 [[Omani rial]] allowances while those living at a less than 100-km distance would get 25-rial allowance.
