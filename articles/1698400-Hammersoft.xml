==Biography==
Cornelia Funke was born in 1958 in the town of Dorsten in Westphalia, Germany&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of World Biography [http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ca-Ge/Funke-Cornelia.html]:&lt;/ref&gt; to Karl-Heinz and Helmi Funke. As a child, she wanted to become an astronaut and/or a [[Aviator|pilot]], but then decided to study [[pedagogy]] at the University of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=fembio&gt;[http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/cornelia-funke/ Cornelia Funke Biografie]&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing her studies, Funke worked for three years as a social worker. During her social work she focused on working with children who came from deprived backgrounds.&lt;ref name=bookbrowse&gt;[http://www.scholastic.com/corneliafunke/bio.htm Cornelia Funke biography], Scholastic.com&lt;/ref&gt; She had a stint illustrating books, but soon began writing her own stories,&lt;ref name=fembio/&gt; inspired by the sorts of stories that had appealed to the deprived children she had worked with.&lt;ref name=bookbrowse/&gt; During the late 1980s and the 1990s, Funke established herself in Germany with two children's series, namely the fantasy-oriented ''GespensterjÃ¤ger'' (Ghosthunters) and the ''Wilde HÃ¼hner'' ([[Wild Chicks]]) line of books. Funke has been called &quot;the [[J. K. Rowling]]&quot; of Germany; although she was highly successful in Germany, the first of her books to be translated into English was ''Herr der Diebe'' in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of World Biography&quot;&gt;[http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ca-Ge/Funke-Cornelia.html Encyclopedia of World Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently released as ''[[The Thief Lord]]'' by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of World Biography&quot;/&gt; and made it to the number 2 spot on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholastic.com/corneliafunke/bio.htm Scholastic]&lt;/ref&gt; The fantasy novel ''[[Dragon Rider (novel)|Dragon Rider]]'' (2004) stayed on the New York Times Best Seller list for 78 weeks.&lt;ref name=magazined&gt;[http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/issue/PhantasieFunke_5-06_ENG_E1.php Cornelia Funke]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of ''The Thief Lord'' and ''Dragon Rider'', her next novel was ''[[Inkheart]]'' (2003), which won the 2004 ''BookSense Book of the Year Children's Literature'' award.&lt;ref name=bsby&gt;[http://www.bookweb.org/btw/awards/BSBY BookSense Book of the Year Children's Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inkheart'' was the first part of a trilogy which was continued with ''[[Inkspell]]'' (2005), which won Funke her second ''BookSense Book of the Year Children's Literature'' award (2006).&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/2005/time100/artists/100funke.html The 2005 Time 100: Cornelia Funke]&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy was concluded in ''[[Inkdeath]]'' (published in Germany in 2007, English version Spring 2008, American version Fall 2008).

==On writing==
On her personal homepage, Funke states that the vital starting point for a good book is an &quot;idea&quot;, and if that idea is worth it, to research on interesting topics which support the idea, and to search for appropriate places and characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-86.html How do you begin your writing process?]&lt;/ref&gt; She said of ideas that &quot;they come from everywhere and nowhere, from outside and inside. I have so many, I won't be able to write them down in one lifetime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-42.html How do you come up with all the ideas for your books? ]&lt;/ref&gt; The characters, Cornelia Funke elaborates, &quot;Mostly they step into my writing room and are so much alive, that I ask myself, where did they come from. Of course, some of them are the result of hard thinking, adding characteristics, manners, etc., but others are alive from the first moment they appear&quot;, and pointed out that Dustfinger from &quot;Inkheart&quot; was one of the most vivid characters who ever popped into her mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-82.html How do you come up with all the characters?]&lt;/ref&gt; For aspiring authors, Funke says: &quot;Read â and be curious. And if somebody says to you: 'Things are this way. You can't change it' - don't believe a word.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-61.html What is your advice for aspiring authors?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Funke married printer Rolf Funke in 1981. Their daughter, Anna, was born in 1989 and their son, Ben, in 1994.&lt;ref name=fembio/&gt; The Funke family lived in Hamburg for 24 years,&lt;ref name=fembio/&gt; until they moved to [[Los Angeles]] in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;
