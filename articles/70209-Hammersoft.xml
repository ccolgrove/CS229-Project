'''Cinema of Australia''', more commonly referred to as the '''Australian film industry''', refers to the system of [[film production|production]], distribution, and exhibition of films in [[Australia]]. Film production commenced in Australia in 1906 with the production of ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', the earliest feature film made. Since then, many films have been produced in Australia, a number of which have received international recognition. Many actors and filmmakers started their careers in Australian films, a large number of whom have acquired international reputations, and a number of whom have found greater financial benefits in careers in larger film producing centers, such as Hollywood.

Commercially successful Australian films have included [[Paul Hogan]]'s ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'',  [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and [[Chris Noonan]]'s ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]''. Other award winning productions include ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'', ''[[The Tracker]]'', ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'' and ''[[Ten Canoes]]''. Australian trained actors of renown include [[Errol Flynn]], [[Peter Finch]], [[Rod Taylor]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]].

== History ==
The Australian film history has been characterised as one of 'boom and bust' due to the unstable and cyclical nature of its industry; there have been deep troughs when few films were made for decades and high peaks when a glut of films reached the market.&lt;ref&gt;David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Sydney: Pan Macmillan, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneer days (1890s-1910)===
In October, 1896, the first movie was shown in Australia in the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athanaeum Hall]] in Collins Street, Melbourne. The earliest [[feature length]] [[narrative film]] in the world was the Australian production ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906), also shown at the Athenaeum. 

Arguably one of the world's first film studios, the [[Limelight Department]], was operated by The Salvation Army in Melbourne, Australia, between 1897 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/limelight/docs/lime/default.htm Information at ABS website]&lt;/ref&gt; The Limelight Department produced evangelical material for use by the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]], as well as private and government contracts. In its 19 years of operation, the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it the largest film producer of its time. The major innovation of the Limelight Department would come in 1899 when Herbert Booth and Joseph Perry began work on ''Soldiers of the Cross'', described by some as the first feature length film ever produced. ''Soldiers of the Cross'' fortified the Limelight Department as a major player in the early film industry. However, ''Soldiers of the Cross'' would be dwarfed when the Limelight Department was commissioned to film the Federation of Australia.

=== Boom and bust (1910s-1920s) ===
[[File:Buladelah.jpg|thumb|left|The old Pacific Cinema at Bulahdelah, NSW, a classic example of an early small country town cinema]]

The first &quot;boom&quot; in Australian film occurred in the 1910s. After beginning slowly in the years from 1900, 1910 saw 4 narrative films released, then 51 in 1911, 30 in 1912, and 17 in 1913, and back to 4 in 1914, the beginning of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900â1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 1 â 49&lt;/ref&gt; While these numbers may seem small, Australia was one of the most prolific film-producing countries at the time. That is, between 1910 and 1912, almost 90 narrative films were made; between 1906 and 1928, 150 narrative feature films were made.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Moran &amp; Errol Vieth, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema'', Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2005, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various explanations for the subsequent demise of the industry; some historians have pointed to falling audience numbers, a lack of interest in Australian product and narratives, and the decision to participate in World War I. However, a major reason lay in the official banning of bushranger films in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Eric (1970) ''Australian Silent Films: A Pictorial History of Silent Films from 1896 to 1926''. Melbourne: Lansdowne Press, 59. See also [http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/18/oz_western.html Routt, William D. More Australian than Aristotelian:The Australian Bushranger Film,1904-1914. ''Senses of Cinema'' 18 (January-February), 2002]. The banning of bushranger films in NSW is fictionalised in [[Kathryn Heyman]]'s 2006 novel, ''Captain Starlight's Apprentice''.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking for alternative products, Australian cinema chains realised that Australian films were much more expensive than imported films from the [[United States]], which could be purchased cheaply as production expenses had already been recouped. To redress this decline, the federal government imposed a tax on imported film in 1914, but this was removed by 1918. By 1923, U.S. films dominated the Australian exhibition sector, with 94% of all films coming from that country.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Moran &amp; Errol Vieth, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema'', Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2005, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation is concerned with [[Exclusive dealing|anti-competitive behavior]] between film distributors and cinemas. Between 1906 and 1912 Australia's burgeoning film industry produced more feature-length films than Britain or the USA, but in 1912 [[Greater Union|Australasian Films and Union Theaters]] established a monopoly over production, distribution and exhibition and shut out smaller producers. That opened the way for US distributors in the 1920s to sign exclusive deals with Australian cinemas to exhibit only their products, thereby crippling the local film industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian screen'', http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/picture-show-man/clip1/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s-1960s===

[[File:Diane Cilento with Peter Finch.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Finch]], who also debuted in Australia in the 1930s. He went on to star in classics such as ''[[The Rats of Tobruk]]'' and became the first Australian to win an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], posthumously in 1976.]]

In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'' was directed by [[Charles Chauvel (film maker)|Charles Chauvel]], who cast Tasmanian born [[Erroll Flynn]] as the leading actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/ In the Wake of the Bounty (1933) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood, and starred in 1938's ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''. Chauvel directed a number of successful Australian films, including 1944's World War Two classic ''[[The Rats of Tobruk (1944 film)|The Rats of Tobruk]]'' which starred [[Peter Finch]] and [[Chips Rafferty]] and 1955's ''[[Jedda]]'', which was notable for being the first Australian film to be shot in colour, and the first to feature Aboriginal actors in lead roles and to be entered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html Festival de Cannes - From 11 to 22 may 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/ Kokoda Front Line! (1942) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, Hall was in charge of Australia's leading domestic studio, [[Cinesound Productions]], and was particularly successful with a series of comedies based on the popular writings of author [[Steele Rudd]], which featured the adventures of a fictional Australian farming family, the Rudds, and the perennial father-and-son duo, '[[Dad and Dave]]'.

[[Chips Rafferty]] and [[Peter Finch]] were prominent international stars of the period. Rafferty's onscreen image as a lanky, laconic bushman struck a chord with film goers and he appeared in such iconic early Australian films as ''[[Forty Thousand Horsemen]]'', ''[[The Rats of Tobruk (1944 film)|The Rats of Tobruk]]'', ''[[The Overlanders (film)|The Overlanders]]'' and ''[[Eureka Stockade (film)|Eureka Stockade]]'' (''Overlanders'' and ''Eureka'' were part of a series of Australian themed films produced by Britain's iconic [[Ealing Studios]]). In Hollywood, Rafferty also appeared in Australian themed films, including ''[[The Desert Rats (film)|The Desert Rats]]'', ''[[The Sundowners]]'' and ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. Similarly, Peter Finch starred in quintessentially Australian roles (such as ''Digger'' or stockman) through a series of popular films and had a successful and diverse screen career in Britain and the United States.

[[Rod Taylor]] began his acting career in Australia, appearing in such Australian films as 1954's [[Long John Silver (film)|Long John Silver]] before transferring to the United States to become a Hollywood leading man of the 1960s and 70s, with starring roles in ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).

Several notable films based on stories from [[Australian literature]] (generally with strong rural themes) were made in Australia in the 1950s - but by British and American production companies, including: 1956's ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'' which starred  [[Virginia McKenna]] and Peter Finch; 1957's ''[[The Shiralee (1957 film)|The Shiralee]]'' also starring Peter Finch with Australian actors  [[Charles Tingwell]], [[Bill Kerr]] and [[Ed Devereaux]] in supporting roles; ''[[Robbery Under Arms (1957 film)|Roberry Under Arms]]'', again starring Finch in 1957; and 1959's ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'', starring [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[John Mills]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]; and in 1960, ''[[The Sundowners]]'' was  shot in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of [[New South Wales]] with foreign leads [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Robert Mitchum]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] but a supporting cast including Australians Chips Rafferty, [[John Meillon]] and [[Leonard Teale]].

The inaugural [[Australian Film Institute Awards]] were held in 1958, yet Australian cinema was reaching a low ebb with few notable productions produced during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&amp;Section=Past_Winners The Australian Film Institute &amp;#124; Past Winners]&lt;/ref&gt; 1966's comedy ''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'', starring  [[Walter Chiari]], [[Chips Rafferty]] and [[Clare Dunne]] was a rare hit of the period which also documented something of the changing face of Australian society: telling the story of a newly arrived Italian immigrant who, working as a labourer in Sydney, becomes mates with his co-workers, despite some difficulties with [[Australian slang]] and culture. The film foreshadowed the successful approaching &quot;[[Australian New Wave|New Wave]]&quot; of Australian cinema of the 1970s that would often showcase colloquial Australian culture.

Signs of life for the appeal of Australian actors in Hollywood as &quot;action-men&quot; continued with the casting of Australian [[George Lazenby]] to replace [[Sean Connery]] portraying the superspy [[James Bond]] in the 1969 film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.

=== Film renaissance - 1970s and 1980s ===

[[File:Crocodile dundee poster.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', 1986, remains Australia's most successful film at the international box office.]]

The [[Australian New Wave]] was an era of resurgence in worldwide popularity of Australian cinema, particularly in the [[United States]]. It began in the early [[Australian films of the 1970s|1970s]] and lasted until the mid-late [[Australian films of the 1980s|1980s]]. The era also marked the emergence of the &quot;[[Ozploitation]]&quot; style - characterised by the exploitation of colloquial Australian culture.

[[John Gorton]] was [[Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1968â1971 and initiated several avenues of Government support for film and the arts, establishing the [[Australian Council for the Arts]], the [[Australian Film Development Corporation]] and the [[National Film and Television Training School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/in-office.aspx In office - John Gorton - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] continued to support Australian film. The [[South Australian Film Corporation]] was established in 1972 to promote and produce films, while the [[Australian Film Commission]] was created in 1975 to fund and produce internationally competitive films.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afc.gov.au/profile/about_us/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;nbsp;generation of directors and actors emerged who told distinctively Australian stories. Films such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' ([[Peter Weir]], 1975) and ''[[Sunday Too Far Away]]'' ([[Ken Hannam]], 1975) made an impact on the international arena. The 1970s and 80s are regarded by many as a 'golden age' of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the dark science fiction of ''[[Mad Max]]'' ([[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]], 1979) to the romantic comedy of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' ([[Peter Faiman]], 1986) and the emergence of  such film directing auteurs as [[Gillian Armstrong]], [[Phillip Noyce]] and [[Bruce Beresford]].

A major theme of Australian cinema which matured in the 1970s was one of survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A&amp;nbsp;number of thrillers and horror films dubbed &quot;outback gothic&quot; have been created, including ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'', ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' and ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' in the 1970s, ''[[Razorback (film)|Razorback]]'' and ''[[Shame (1988 film)|Shame]]'' in the 1980s, and ''[[Japanese Story]]'', ''[[The Proposition]]'' and the world-renowned ''[[Wolf Creek (film)|Wolf Creek]]'' in the 21st century. These films depict the Australian bush and its creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths. These are combined with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max series]].

1971's [[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]] was a British film set in Australia which was a forerunner to many Australian films related to indigenous themes and introduced [[David Gulpilil]] to cinematic audiences. 1976's [[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]] directed by [[Fred Schepisi]] was an award winning historical drama from a book by [[Thomas Keneally]] about the tragic story of an Aboriginal [[Bushranger]]. Classic stories from [[Australian literature]] and [[Australian history]] continued to be popular subjects for cinematic adaptation during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Gillian Armstrong]]'s ''[[My Brilliant Career]]'' (1979) featured [[Judy Davis]] and [[Sam Neill]] in early lead roles. 1982's ''[[We of the Never Never]]'' followed up on the theme of the female experience of life in the [[Australian bush]]. 1982's ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' starring [[Tom Burlinson]] and [[Sigrid Thornton]] dramatised the classic [[Banjo Paterson]] poem of that name and became one of the all time box-office successes of Australian cinema.

In addition to the serious historical dramas popular in the 1970s, a number of films celebrating and satirizing Australian colloquial culture were produced over the decade, including: ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]'' (1972), ''[[Alvin Purple]]'' (1973), and ''[[Barry McKenzie Holds His Own]]'' (1974). The Barry McKenzie films saw performing-artist and writer [[Barry Humphries]] collaborating with director [[Bruce Beresford]].

In 1976, [[Peter Finch]] was awarded a posthumous [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role in the American satire ''[[Network (film)|Network]]'', becoming the first Australian to win an Oscar for best actor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/australian_productions/F_A_Success/Academy_42_89.asp {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1980's ''[[Breaker Morant]]'' starring [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Bryan Brown]] dramatised the controversial trial of an Australian soldier during the [[Boer War]] and was followed by 1981's [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] drama ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' directed by [[Peter Weir]] and starring [[Mel Gibson]]. These films, now considered classics of Australian cinema explored contemporary Australian identity through dramatic episodes in Australian history.

Gibson went on to further success in 1982's ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' before transferring to pursue his Hollywood career as an actor and director. Many other Australian stars would follow his path to international stardom in the coming decades. ''The Year of Living Dangerously'' was directed by Peter Weir, who also made a successful transition to Hollywood. Weir contributed to the screenplay along with its original author Christopher Koch, and playwright [[David Williamson]]. Williamson rose to prominence in the early 1970s, and has gone on to write several other original scripts and screenplays  made into successful Australian films including: ''[[Don's Party]]'' (1976); ''Gallipoli'' (1981), ''[[Emerald City (play)|Emerald City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Balibo (film)|Balibo]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[[IMDbName:0932011|David Williamson - IMDb]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor/comedian [[Paul Hogan]] wrote the screenplay and starred in the title role in his first film, ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986), about a down-to-earth hunter who travelled from the Australian Outback to New York City. The movie became the most successful Australian film ever, and launched Hogan's international film career. Following the success of Crocodile Dundee Hogan starred in the sequel, ''[[Crocodile Dundee&amp;nbsp;II]]'' in 1988.

1988 also saw the release of the drama ''[[Evil Angels (film)|Evil Angels]]'' about the [[Lindy Chamberlain]] saga, in which a baby was taken by a [[dingo]] at [[Ayers Rock]] and her mother was accused of having murdered the child.

[[Nicole Kidman]] began appearing in Australian children's TV and Film in the early 1980s - including starring roles in ''[[BMX Bandits (film)|BMX Bandits]]'' and ''[[Bush Christmas]]''. During the 1980s, she appeared in several Australian productions, including ''[[Emerald City (play)|Emerald City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Bangkok Hilton]]'' (1989), and in 1989, Kidman starred in ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' alongside [[Sam Neill]] and [[Billy Zane]]. The thriller garnered strong reviews and Hollywood roles followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790280.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 Dead Calm]. Variety.com. 1 January 2007.

The 1990s proved a successful decade for Australian film and introduced several new stars to a global audience. Low budget films such as the comedy/drama ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'', starring [[Toni Collette]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/muriels-wedding/ Murielâs Wedding (1994) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; the gently satirical suburban comedy ''[[The Castle (film)|The Castle]]'' directed by [[Rob Sitch]] (which cast [[Eric Bana]] in his first prominent film role), and [[Baz Lurhmann]]'s flamboyant ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/strictly-ballroom/ Strictly Ballroom (1992) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; each attained commercial and critical success, and explored quirky characters inhabiting contemporary Australian suburbia - marking something of a departure from the [[Outback]] and historical sagas which obtained success in the 1970s and 1980s. [[Stephan Elliott]]'s 1994 film ''[[Priscilla Queen of the Desert]]'' mixed traditional outback cinematography and landscape with contemporary urban sub-culture: following three [[drag queen]]s on a road trip to Central Australia.

While a number of major international stars gained early prominence in Australia over the period, an important stable of established and emerging local stars with prodigious film credits remained prominent, including screen veterans [[Charles Tingwell]], [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]], [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Bryan Brown]] and [[Chris Haywood]].

The [[World War II]] drama ''[[Blood Oath (film)|Blood Oath]]'' (1990) debuted both [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Jason Donovan]], in minor cinematic roles. Crowe demonstrated his versatility as an actor in this early period of his career by starring soon after as a street gang Melbourne [[skinhead]] in 1992's ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' and then as an inner-Sydney working class gay man in 1994's ''[[The Sum of Us (film)|The Sum of Us]]'' before transferring to the USA to commence his Hollywood career.

George Miller's ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' (1995) employed new digital effects to make a barnyard come alive and went on to become one of Australia's highest grossing films. The 1996 drama ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'' achieved an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] award for [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Gregor Jordan]]'s 1999 film ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'' gave [[Heath Ledger]] his first leading role. After Ledger's successful transition to Hollywood, Jordan and Ledger collaborated again in 2003 with Ledger playing the iconic [[bushranger]] title role in the film ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]'', which co-starred Australian actress [[Naomi Watts]].

The canon of films related to [[Indigenous Australians]] also increased over the period of the 1990s and early 21st Century, with [[Nick Parson]]'s 1996 film ''[[Dead Heart (film)|Dead Heart]]'' featuring [[Ernie Dingo]] and [[Bryan Brown]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/dead-heart/ Dead Heart (1996) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolf de Heer]]'s ''[[The Tracker]]'', starring [[Gary Sweet]] and [[David Gulpilil]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/tracker/ The Tracker (2002) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Phillip Noyce]]'s ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/rabbit-proof-fence/ Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002. In 2006, Rolf de Heer's ''[[Ten Canoes]]'' became the first major feature film to be shot in an indigenous language and the film was recognised at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and elsewhere.

The shifting demographics of Australia following post-war multicultural immigration was reflected in Australian cinema through the period and in successful films like 1993's [[The Heartbreak Kid (1993 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]; 2000's [[Looking for Alibrandi]]; 2003's [[Fat Pizza]]; the [[Wog Boy]] comedies and 2007's [[Romulus, My Father (film)|Romulus, My Father]] which all dealt with aspects of the migrant experience or Australian subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rob Sitch]] and [[Working Dog Productions]] followed the success of ''The Castle'' with period comedy ''[[The Dish]]'', which was the highest grossing Australian film of the Year 2000 and entered the top ten list of highest grossing Australian films. Big budget Australian-international co-productions ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' ([[Baz Lurhmann]], 2001) and [[Happy Feet]] (which won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] for filmmaker [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] in 2006) also entered the top ten list during the first decade of the new century. Baz Lurhmann directed a series of international hits and returned to Australia for the production of 2008's ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'', which showcased a host of Australian stars including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[David Wenham]] and went on to become the second highest grossing film in Australian cinematic history.

''[[Lantana (film)|Lantana]]'', directed by [[Ray Lawrence (film director)|Ray Lawrence]] attained critical and commercial success in 2001 for its examination of a complex series of relationships in suburban Sydney, and events surrounding a mysterious crime. It won seven [[Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI Awards]] including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for [[Anthony LaPaglia]] and Best Actress for [[Kerry Armstrong]].

Emerging star [[Sam Worthington]] had early lead roles in the 2002 mobster black comedy ''[[Dirty Deeds (2002 film)|Dirty Deeds]]'' and 2003's crime caper ''[[Gettin' Square]]''. ''Gettin Square'' also featured rising star [[David Wenham]] who demonstrated versatility with a string of critically acclaimed roles including the title role in [[Paul Cox]]'s 1999 biopic ''[[Molokai: The Story of Father Damien]]'' and the 2001 thriller ''[[The Bank (2001 film)|The Bank]]'', directed by the politically conscious film director [[Robert Connolly]].

In 2005, ''[[Little Fish (film)|Little Fish]]'' marked a return to Australian film for actress [[Cate Blanchett]] and won five [[Australian Film Institute Awards]] including Best Actor for [[Hugo Weaving]], Best Actress for Blanchett and Best Supporting Actress for screen veteran [[Noni Hazlehurst]].

In 2008, the documentary film celebrating the romps of the [[Australian New Wave]] of 1970s and 1980s low-budget cinema: ''[[Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!]]'' The film was directed by Mark Hartley and interviews filmmakers including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Dennis Hopper]], George Miller and [[Barry Humphries]].

The early 2000s were generally not successful years for Australian cinema, with several confronting dramas proving unpopular at the box office. In 2008, no Australian movies made $3 million at the box office, but a conscious decision by film-makers to broaden the types of films being made as well as the range of budgets produced a series of box-office hits at the close of the decade. Strong box office performances were recorded in 2009-10 by [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Mao's Last Dancer (film)|Mao's Last Dancer]]''; the Aboriginal musical ''[[Bran Nue Dae (film)|Bran Nue Dae]]'' the dramatization of [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]]'s novel ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)|Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''; and the crime drama ''[[Animal Kingdom (film)|Animal Kingdom]]'' which featured major Australian screen stars [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Jackie Weaver]]. ''Animal Kingdom'' achieved success at the 2010 [[Australian Film Institute Awards]] and was acclaimed at film festivals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/good-year-for-australian-films-as-they-switch-bleak-for-broad-20101210-18sss.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Garry | last=Maddox | title=Good year for Australian films as they switch bleak for broad | date=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' became the highest-grossing domestic film of 2010 and it was nominated for nine Australian Film Institute Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watchoutfor.com.au/tomorrow-when-the-war-began-biggest-film-of-2010-movie-news|title=Tomorrow When The War Began Biggest Film Of 2010|first=Sean|last=Lynch|work=watchoutfor.com.au|date=17 September 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=11828&amp;Section=AFI_Award_Winners_and_Nominees|title=The Australian Film Institute &amp;#124; AFI Award Winners and Nominees Ceremony|publisher=Afi.org.au|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable films of the period included ''[[Balibo (film)|Balibo]]'' (2009) starring [[Anthony LaPaglia]]; the animated feature [[Mary and Max]]; and the 2010 [[World War I]] drama ''[[Beneath Hill 60]]'', directed by [[Jeremy Sims]] and starring [[Brendan Cowell]].

[[John Gorton]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1968â1971, initiated several forms of Government support for Australian film and the arts, establishing the [[Australian Council for the Arts]], the [[Australian Film Development Corporation]] and the [[National Film and Television Training School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/in-office.aspx In office - John Gorton - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] continued to support Australian film. The [[South Australian Film Corporation]] was established in 1972 to promote and produce films, while the [[Australian Film Commission]] was created in 1975 to fund and produce internationally competitive films. 

The Federal Australian government had supported the Australian film industry through the funding and development agencies of [[Film Finance Corporation Australia]], the [[Australian Film Commission]] and [[Film Australia]]. In 2008 the three agencies were consolidated into [[Screen Australia]].

The Australian film industry continues to produce a reasonable number of films each year, but in common with other English-speaking countries, Australia has often found it difficult to compete with the American film industry{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, the latter helped by having a much larger home market. The most successful Australian actors and film-makers are easily lured by [[Hollywood]] and rarely return to the domestic film industry.

After [[Rupert Murdoch]], the head of [[Fox Studios]] and an Australian, saw the new Fox studios were moved to Sydney, some US producers have chosen to film at Fox's state of the art facilities as production costs in Sydney are well below US costs. Studios established in Australia, like [[Fox Studios Australia]] and [[Village Roadshow Limited#Warner Roadshow Studios|Warner Roadshow Studios]], host large international productions like ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Star Wars II]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|III]]''.

=== Debate over government support ===
There is an ongoing debate of the need and role of government support for the Australian film industry. Some argue in favour of government support as being the only way that the local film industry can compete against the hegemony of Hollywood. The argument against government support is that the industry is viable without support and will become stronger if increasingly globalised market forces are allowed full and untrammeled play. Others argue that a film industry in itself has little value. The history of the industry in Australia is to some extent a result of the ascendancy of one position over the other.
