This is a '''list of [[scandal]]s related mostly to American [[evangelical]] Christians.''' (Roman Catholic clergy and high-profile leaders from [[New Religious Movements]] are not within the scope of this list.)

==List of evangelical Christians involved in scandals==
===Aimee Semple McPherson, 1920sâ40s===
{{seemain|Aimee Semple McPherson}}
One of the most famous evangelist scandals involved Canadian-born Aimee Semple McPherson in the 1920s, who allegedly faked her own death. She later claimed that she had been kidnapped, but a grand jury adjourned with no indictment, saying it had not enough evidence to proceed. [[Roberta Semple Salter]], her daughter from her first marriage, became estranged from Semple McPherson and successfully sued her mother's attorney for slander during the 1930s. As a result of this she was cut out of her mother's will. Aimee Semple McPherson died in 1944 from an accidental overdose of [[barbiturates]].

===Lonnie Frisbee, 1970sâ1980s===
{{seemain|Lonnie Frisbee}}
Lonnie Frisbee was an American closeted gay Pentecostal evangelist and self-described &quot;seeing prophet&quot;  in the late 1960s and 1970s who despite his &quot;hippie&quot; appearance had notable success as a minister and evangelist. Frisbee was a key figure in the [[Jesus Movement]] and was involved in the rise of two worldwide denominations ([[Calvary Chapel]] and the [[Vineyard Movement]]). Both churches later disowned him because of his active homosexuality, removing him first from leadership positions, then ultimately firing him. He died of AIDS-related complications in 1993.

===Marjoe Gortner, early 1970s===
{{seemain|Marjoe Gortner}}
Gortner rose to fame in the late 1940s as a child preacher, but he had simply been trained to do this by his parents and he had no personal faith. He was able to perform &quot;miracles&quot; and received large amounts of money in donations. After suffering a crisis of conscience, he invited a film crew to accompany him on a final preaching tour. The resulting film, ''[[Marjoe]]'', mixes footage of revival meetings with Gortner's explanations of how evangelists manipulate their audiences. It won the 1972 [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]], but was not shown widely in the Southern United States due to fears that it would cause outrage in the [[Bible Belt]].&lt;ref&gt;References for this section can be found in the main article on [[Marjoe Gortner]] and the film ''[[Marjoe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billy James Hargis, early 1970s===
{{seemain|Billy James Hargis}}
Hargis was a prolific author and radio evangelist. Hargis formed [[American Christian College]] in 1971 to teach fundamentalist Christian principles. However, a [[sex scandal]] erupted at the College, involving claims that Hargis had sex with male and female students. Hargis was forced out of American Christian College's presidency as a result.  Further scandals erupted when members of Hargis' youth choir, the &quot;All American Kids&quot;, accused Hargis of sexual misconduct as well. The college eventually closed down in the mid-1970s. Hargis denied the allegations publicly.

===Jimmy Swaggart, Marvin Gorman, and Jim &amp; Tammy Bakker, 1986 and 1991===
{{seemain|Jimmy Swaggart|Jim Bakker}}
In 1986, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart began on-screen attacks against fellow televangelists Marvin Gorman and Jim Bakker.  He uncovered Gorman's affair with a member of Gorman's congregation, and also helped expose Bakker's infidelity (which was arranged by a colleague while on an out-of-state trip).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0507/14/lkl.01.html|title = Transcript: Interview with Jessica Hahn|work=[[Larry King Live]]|publisher=CNN|date = 14 July 2005|accessdate =17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These exposures received widespread media coverage.  Gorman retaliated in kind by hiring a private investigator to uncover Swaggart's own adulterous indiscretions with a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title = Swaggart Is Barred From Pulpit for One Year|work=New York Times|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D7143EF933A05750C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|date = 30 March 1998|accessdate =17 April 2008|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swaggart was subsequently forced to step down from his pulpit for a year and made a tearful televised apology in February 1988 to his congregation, saying &quot;I have sinned against you, my Lord, and I would ask that your precious blood would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of God's forgiveness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D71F30F931A15751C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|title = Swaggart Says He Has Sinned; Will Step Down|first = Wayne|last = King|date = 22 February 1998|accessdate =17 April 2008|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jswaggartapologysermon.html|title = Reverend Jimmy Swaggart: Apology Sermon|accessdate =25 January 2007|last = Swaggart|first = Jimmy|publisher=americanrhetoric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaggart was caught again by California police three years later in 1991 with another prostitute, Rosemary Garcia, who was riding with him in his car when he was stopped for driving on the wrong side of the road.  When asked why she was with Swaggart, she replied, &quot;He asked me for sex. I mean, that's why he stopped me. That's what I do. I'm a prostitute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Swaggart Plans to Step Down|date = 15 October 1991|url  = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DA1E3BF936A25753C1A967958260|work=The New York Times|accessdate =17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Popoff, 1987===
{{seemain|Peter Popoff}}
A self-proclaimed prophet and faith healer in the 1980s, Popoff's ministry went bankrupt in 1987 after magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] and [[Banachek|Steve Shaw]] [[debunker|debunked]] his methods by showing that instead of receiving information about audience members from [[supernatural]] sources, he received it through an in-ear receiver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randi&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Randi | first = James | authorlink = James Randi | year = 1989 | title = [[The Faith Healers]] | publisher=Prometheus Books | isbn = 0-87975-535-0 page 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morris Cerullo, 1990s===
{{seemain|Morris Cerullo}}
A number of incidents involving California-based televangelist [[Morris Cerullo]] caused outrage in the United Kingdom during the 1990s. Cerullo's claims of faith healing were the focus of particular concern. At a London crusade in 1992, he pronounced a child cancer sufferer to be healed, yet the girl died two months later. Multiple complaints were upheld against satellite television channels transmitting Cerullo's claims of faith-healing, and a panel of doctors concluded that Cerullo's claims of miraculous healing powers could not be substantiated. Cerullo also produced fund-raising material which was condemned as unethical by a number of religious leaders, as it implied that giving money to his organisation would result in family members becoming Christians.&lt;ref&gt;References for this section can be found in the main article on [[Morris Cerullo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melissa Scott, 1992===
{{seemain|Melissa Scott (pastor)}}
Melissa Scott [known then as Melissa Pastore] married in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] her first husband, Paul J. Pastore, where they lived in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/melissa-scott-porn-pastor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://melissascott123.blogspot.com/2008/02/melissa-scott_5520.html&lt;/ref&gt; She starred with the name '''Babri Bridges''' in affiliation with [[Vivid Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glamourfantasy.com/preview/barbibridges.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later married to Dr. Eugene Scott, who died from prostate cancer 5 years after, she received his large amounts of assets.&lt;ref&gt;http://users.lmi.net/arden/lang/en/g/Gene_Scott.html&lt;/ref&gt; She has fought many legal battles to end her images &amp; videos circulating the internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://lukeford.net/blog/?p=8163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://users.lmi.net/arden/lang/en/g/Gene_Scott.html#Barbi_Bridges&lt;/ref&gt; She has fought many legal battles to end her images &amp; videos circulating the internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chemistrydaily.com/chemistry/Melissa_Pastore&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mike Warnke, 1991===
{{seemain|Mike Warnke}}
Warnke was a popular Christian evangelist and comedian during the 1970s and 1980s. He claimed in his autobiography, ''[[The Satan Seller]]'' (1973), that he had once been deeply involved in a Satanic cult and was a Satanic priest before converting to Christianity. In 1991, [[Cornerstone magazine]] launched an investigation into Warnke's life and testimony. It investigated Warnke's life, from interviews with over one hundred personal friends and acquaintances, to his ministry's tax receipts. Its investigation turned up damaging evidence of fraud and deceit. The investigation also revealed the unflattering circumstances surrounding Warnke's multiple marriages, affairs, and divorces. Most critically, however, the investigation showed how Warnke could not possibly have done the many things he claimed to have done throughout his nine-month tenure as a Satanist, much less become a drug-addicted dealer or become a Satanic high priest.

===Robert Tilton, 1991===
{{seemain|Robert Tilton}}
Tilton is an American televangelist who achieved notoriety in the 1980s and early 1990s through his paid television program ''[[Success-N-Life]]''. At its peak, it aired in all 235 American TV markets. In 1991, [[Diane Sawyer]] and [[ABC News]] conducted an investigation of Tilton. The investigation, broadcast on ABC's Primetime Live on 21 November 1991, found that Tilton's ministry threw away prayer requests without reading them, keeping only the money or valuables sent to them by viewers, garnering his ministry an estimated $80&amp;nbsp;million US$ a year. In the original investigation, one of Tilton's former prayer hotline operators claimed that the ministry cared little for desperate followers who called for prayer, saying that Tilton had a computer installed in July 1989 to make sure that the phone operators were off the line in seven minutes.  Tilton sued ABC for libel in 1992, but the case was dismissed in 1993, and Tilton's show was off the air by 30 October 1993.

===W. V. Grant, 1996 and 2003===
{{seemain|W. V. Grant}}
Grant was investigated by [[James Randi]] regarding his faith healing claims. He was then imprisoned for tax evasion in 1996. After restarting his ministry upon release, TV news investigations in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, and [[Richmond, Virginia]], investigated his revival meetings and concluded his healing claims were false. A 2010 program on the British [[Channel 4]] station also concluded that Grant's claimed supernatural abilities were fake.&lt;ref&gt;References for this section can be found in the main article on [[W. V. Grant]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bob Moorehead, 1998===
Moorehead, pastor of the [[Overlake Christian Church]] from the 1970s to June, 1998 was arrested in July, 1996 on a charge of indecent exposure in a public restroom in Daytona Beach, Florida. He stepped down amid allegations of molestation of adult members during baptism and wedding ceremonies that went as far back as 20 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{seemain|Roy Clements}}

He had written a number of well-received books which were withdrawn from sale when the news broke.&lt;ref&gt;References for this section can be found in the main article on [[Roy Clements]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Paulk, 2000===
{{seemain|John Paulk}}
John Paulk (no relation to [[Earl Paulk]]) is a former leader of [[Focus on the Family]]'s Love Won Out conference and former chairman of the board for [[Exodus (organization)|Exodus International North America]]. His claimed shedding of homosexuality is also the subject of his autobiography ''Not Afraid to Change''. In September 2000, Paulk was found and photographed in a Washington, D.C. gay bar, and accused by opponents of flirting with male patrons at the bar. Later questioned by gay rights activist [[Wayne Besen]], Paulk denied being in the bar despite photographic proof to the contrary. Initially, FoF's Dr. [[James Dobson]] sided with Paulk and supported his claims. Subsequently, Paulk, who himself had written about his habit of lying while he openly lived as a homosexual, confessed to being in the bar, but claimed he entered the establishment for reasons other than sexual pursuits. Paulk retained his Board seat for Exodus, however he did so while on probation. Paulk did not run again for chairman of the board of Exodus when his term expired.

===Paul Crouch, 2004===

{{seemain|Paul Crouch}}

Paul Crouch is the founder and president of the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], or TBN, the world's largest [[evangelical Christian]] television network, as well as the former host of TBN's flagship variety show, ''[[Praise the Lord]]''. In September 2004, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a series of articles raising questions about the fundraising practices and financial transparency of TBN, as well as the allegations of a former ministry employee, [[Enoch Lonnie Ford]], that he had a homosexual affair with Crouch during the 1990s. TBN denied the allegations, claiming that Ford's claims were part of an [[extortion]] scheme and that the ''Times'' was a &quot;left-wing and anti-Christian newspaper.&quot; In 2005, Ford appeared at the taping of the [[ION Television]] show [[Lie Detector (TV series)|Lie Detector]]. The show's producers decided not to air the show, and the outcome of the lie detector test was never released. Consequently, none of the allegations were substantiated.

===Douglas Goodman, 2004===
Douglas Goodman, an evangelical preacher, and his wife Erica were pastors of Victory Christian Centre in London, England. The church was one of the largest in the United Kingdom. He came into notoriety when he was jailed for three and a half years for the sexual assault of four members of his congregation in 2004. VCC was closed by the [[Charity Commission]], but his wife Erica started a new church, Victory to Victory, in Wembley. Douglas has upon his release resumed full pastoral ministry alongside his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Kent Hovind, 2006===
{{seemain|Kent Hovind}}
Kent Hovind is an American Baptist minister and [[Young Earth creationist]]. He is most famous for &quot;creation science&quot; seminars, in which he argues for Young Earth creationism, using his self-formulated &quot;Hovind Theory.&quot; He has been criticized by both the mainstream scientific community and other creationists.  In 2006, Hovind, who also has a reputation as a tax protestor, was charged with falsely declaring bankruptcy, making threats against federal officials, filing false complaints, failing to get necessary building permits, and various tax-related charges. He was convicted of 58 federal tax offenses and related charges, for which he is currently serving a ten-year sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCM2006-143&quot;&gt;''Hovind v. Commissioner'', T.C.

===Ted Haggard, 2006===
{{seemain|Ted Haggard}}
Ted Haggard was the pastor of the [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and was the president of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE) from 2003 until November 2006. Haggard's position allowed him occasional access to President [[George W. Bush]]. In 2006 it was alleged that Haggard had been regularly visiting a male prostitute who also provided him with [[methamphetamine]]. Haggard admitted his wrongdoing and resigned as pastor of New Life church and as president of the NAE. The high-profile case was significant also because it immediately preceded the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]] and may have even affected national voting patterns{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. In January 2009, Haggard admitted to a second homosexual relationship with a male church member on CNN-TV and other national media, and when asked, would not directly answer a question about his other possible homosexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/01/29/lkl.ted.haggard/ Disgraced pastor Haggard admits second relationship with man]&quot;, CNN-TV Larry King, 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ted Haggard has recently started a new church.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/news/28337-ted-haggard-starts-new-church-in-colorado-]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{seemain|Paul Barnes (pastor)|l1=Paul Barnes}}
Paul Barnes is the founder and former senior minister of the evangelical church Grace Chapel in Douglas County, Colorado.

This scandal was notable because it was similar to Ted Haggard's (above), it occurred in the same state (Colorado) and around the same time (late 2006).

===Lonnie Latham, 2006===
{{seemain|Lonnie Latham}}
In 2006, Latham, the senior pastor of South Tulsa Baptist Church and a member of the powerful [[Southern Baptist Convention]] Executive Committee, was arrested for &quot;offering to engage in an act of lewdness&quot; with a male undercover police officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpnews.com/2669.article Lonnie Latham scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilbert Deya, 2006===
{{seemain|Gilbert Deya}}
Kenyan-born Deya moved to the United Kingdom in the 1990s and started a number of churches. He claims to have supernatural powers that allow him to make infertile women become pregnant and give birth. However, police investigations in the UK and [[Kenya]] concluded that Deya and his wife were stealing Kenyan babies. Deya was arrested in London during December 2006, and following a long legal process it was reported in September 2011 that he would be [[extradition|extradited]] to Kenya to face child abduction charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Douglas |first=Jon |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14992891 |title=BBC News â 'Miracle babies' pastor to be extradited to Kenya |publisher=BBC   |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earl Paulk, 2007===
{{seemain|Earl Paulk}}
Earl Paulk (no relation to [[John Paulk]]) was the founder and head pastor of Chapel Hill Harvester Church in [[Decatur, Georgia]] from 1960 until the 1990s. A number of women from the congregation came forward during the 1990s and 2000s, claiming that Paulk had sexual relations with them; charges of [[child molestation]] were also made. Some of these claims have subsequently been proven correct.  Moreover, Donnie Earl Paulk, the current senior pastor of the church and nephew of Earl Paulk, had a court-ordered DNA test in 2007 which showed that he was Earl's son, not his nephew, which means that Earl and his sister-in-law had had a sexual relationship which led to Donnie's birth.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===George Alan Rekers, 2010===
{{main|George Alan Rekers}}
Penn Bullock and Brandon K. Thorp of the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' reported on 4 May 2010, that on 13 April 2010, Christian leader [[George Alan Rekers]] was photographed at Miami International Airport returning from an extended overseas trip with a twenty-year-old &quot;[[Male prostitution|rent boy]]&quot;, or gay male prostitute, known as &quot;Lucien&quot; (later identified as Jo-Vanni Roman). Given his opinion on homosexuals and homosexual behavior, the scandal surrounds Rekers' decision to employ a homosexual escort as a traveling companion, and how that runs contrary to Rekers' public stances on such issues.

Rekers claimed that Lucien was there to help carry Rekers' luggage as Rekers had allegedly had recent surgery, yet Rekers was seen carrying his own luggage when he and Lucien were spotted at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-05-06/news/christian-right-leader-george-rekers-takes-vacation-with-rent-boy/1]''Miami New Times'', &quot;Christian right leader George Rekers takes vacation with &quot;rent boy&quot;&quot;, 4 May 2010 issue&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, Rekers denied having sex with the man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://professorgeorge.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/misleading-internet-reports-about-professor-george-rekers/|title=MISLEADING INTERNET REPORTS ABOUT PROFESSOR GEORGE REKERS|date=5 May 2010|accessdate=6 May 2010|publisher=WordPress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In subsequent interviews, Roman said Rekers had paid him to provide nude massages daily, which included genital touching.

===Eddie L. Long, 2010===
{{main|Eddie L. Long}}
In September 2010 several civil complaints were filed against Bishop Eddie L. Long by men that stated Mr. Long used his position as the church leader to entice or coerce the men into consensual sexual relationships in exchange for money, travel and goods. At a press event on 26 September 2010 Bishop Long stated he would fight the civil complaints in court and would not comment on the allegations.  On 27 May 2011, Bishop Long settled the matter out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney |first=Mike |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27pastor.html |title=Pastor Takes Pulpit and Rejects Sex Claims |location=Georgia |work=The New York Times  |date=26 September 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canadian documentary series, Sex Scandals In Religion covered the Long case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthbook.tv/religion/channelhome/channelhome/150/ |title=Sex Scandals In Religion â Channel Frontend Home |publisher=Earthbook.tv |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcus Lamb, 2010===
In December 2010, televangelist [[Marcus Lamb]], the founder of the [[Daystar Television Network]], admitted on television that he had been involved in an extramarital affair several years prior. He further alleged an extortion scheme against him. In late 2010 and early 2011, three former Daystar employees filed a series of lawsuits against Lamb and his wife, Joni, making allegations ranging from financial mismanagement in relation to the affair, to [[sexual harassment]], and to [[wrongful termination]].

=== Vaughn Reeves, 2010===

Special Judge Dena Martin ordered former pastor Vaughn Reeves to serve consecutive six-year terms for each of nine fraud counts, in a scheme that cost about 2,900 investors $13.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=tribune-star-vaughn-reeves-sentenced&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among aggravating factors, Martin found Reeves targeted people over age 65 and used religion to influence them. Reevesâ attorney plans to appeal.

Investigators said Reeves and his three sons used their now-defunct company, Alanar, to trick about 11,000 investors into buying bonds worth $120&amp;nbsp;million secured by mortgages on church construction projects.&lt;ref name=atlanta-journal-constitution&gt;{{cite news

Instead, Reeves and his sons diverted money from new investments to pay off previous investors, pocketing $6&amp;nbsp;million and buying luxuries.&lt;ref name=atlanta-journal-constitution/&gt;
