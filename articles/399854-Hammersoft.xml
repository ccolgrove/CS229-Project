The '''Irish general election of 1954''' was held on 18 May 1954. The newly elected [[members of the 15th DÃ¡il]] assembled at [[Leinster House]] on 2 June when the new [[Taoiseach]] and [[Government of Ireland|government]] were appointed.

The general election took place in [[Parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland|40 parliamentary constituencies]] throughout [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for 147 seats in the lower house of parliament, [[DÃ¡il Ãireann]].

==Campaign==
The general election of 1954 was caused by the loss of an overall majority for the ruling [[Fianna FÃ¡il]] party in the DÃ¡il.  Rather than be voted down on a vote in the DÃ¡il, [[Ãamon de Valera]] decided to call a general election and let the people decide.

Fianna FÃ¡il had the most to lose, their campaign concentrated on providing political stability for the next five years. They also put forward strong arguments against coalition governments. However, this would not suffice when the country's economy was worsening and unemployment and emigration were increasing.

On the other hand the opposition parties of [[Fine Gael]], the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] and the other minor parties offered the electorate an alternative to three years of Fianna FÃ¡il rule. While they could not solve the economic problems facing the country, they could provide fresh ideas.
