===1969â1990: Early life===
Peniston was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in [[United States]], but she would spend the majority of her formative years in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where she was raised since the age of nine. As a daughter of an ex-military father, Ronald Peniston (born 1934, married Barbara Anne in 1960), she started singing at church&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagodefender&quot;&gt;

She attended [[Trevor G. Browne High School]], class of 1987, in Phoenix,&lt;ref&gt;

Peniston began writing pop lyrics already at school. The words of her international hit &quot;[[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)|Finally]]&quot;  were purportedly penned during a chemistry class, while thinking about dating in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;saywhatnews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===1990â1991: ''Female Preacher''===
{{Quote box|width=294px|align=right|quote=
&quot;You know what's so funny is I was always the one that came in and slowed it down. That's what's so ironic about me putting out &quot;Finally&quot;, because I was always the R&amp;B person, the balladeer when I came in and did everything. Back then, there was a female rapper [Overweight Pooch] who was on A&amp;M, and I was asked to do some background vocals. I came over, did the background vocals for her and the label heard it. They were like &quot;We really like your flow, why don't you get your own single together?&quot; Well at the time, I was writing poetry. So I took one of the poems, &quot;Finally&quot;. I was thinking about dating in college, and how I hadn't found that Mr. Right. We went to the studio, finished it up, sent it off to the label and they loved it. And that's how everything got started. I came up with the melody and the lyrics to &quot;Finally&quot; and then R.K. [Jackson] and Felipe [Delgado], the guys I was working with at the time, put the music to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;5Mag&quot;/&gt;  |source=âsaid by the singer interviewed by ''5 Chicago'' in 2006}}

Her music career began in January 1991, when [[Felipe Delgado|Felipe &quot;DJ Wax Dawg&quot; Delgado]], her friend and a record producer based also in Phoenix, asked Peniston to record back-up vocals for [[Tonya Davis]], a black female rapper known after her childhood nickname as [[Overweight Pooch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deseretnews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;penistonbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;&gt;

Davis, headed in a direction of a &quot;new&quot; [[Monie Love]], was searching for a singer to add vocals to the title track of her album ''[[Female Preacher]]'', which was to be released on [[A&amp;M Records]] that summer. She would remember meeting at a talent show a woman named [[Malaika (singer)|Malaika LeRae Sallard]], but when it came time to get Sallard into the studio, the rapper found she'd lost her future label mate's number. When Delgado, who'd preferred Peniston instead, brought his favorite in to do background part, the response from everyone would be immediate, but would not move the Pooch to invite Peniston back for more vocals â unless she was successful to locate Sallard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;/&gt;

Later on, as it became clear that the singer was leaping from the Overweight Pooch's album to the top of the charts, rumor had it the Pooch was stewing over Peniston's using ''Female Preacher'' as her springboard. Tonya Davis, pregnant at the time of recording her album, would swear though, she harbored no Peniston envy. &quot;''There's no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn't give her a voice,''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;/&gt; the rapper insisted for [[Phoenix New Times]] in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. ''&quot;I feel like anything's possible and I know one thing. If I wasn't at this spot, I still would be achieving to get to this spot.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;/&gt; Ironically enough, Sallard would eventually throw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, &quot;You Win, I Win, We Lose&quot;, while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album ''Sugar Time'' scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the [[US Dance]] chart, including the No.1 single &quot;[[Gotta Know (Your Name)]]&quot;) would mention the Pooch's name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying ''&quot;thanks for letting me be a part of Female Preacher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=Finally (Liner Notes) |albumlink=Finally (CeCe Peniston album) |artist=CeCe Peniston |year=1992 |first=CeCe |last=Peniston |authorlink=CeCe Peniston |format=Compact Disc |publisher=[[A&amp;M Records]] |p |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Overweight Poochâs album flopped on the market, and A&amp;M was the first major label for Delgado himself, who was facing contractual disputes with the record company. After [[Manny Lehman]] (a former DJ, then A&amp;M [[Art Director]] and one of the [[executive producer]]s of ''Female Preacher'') also noticed the powerful voice of a still back-up vocalist, he would offer Delgado a second chance, and commissioned him to produce a track for Peniston herself as a solo artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;penistonbio&quot;/&gt; Not looking to lose his major deal connections, Delgado called on a hometown friend and music producer too, [[Rodney K. Jackson]] (they two met through mutual friends in Arizona), who was brought then to A&amp;M family to help co-produce the Penistonâs single, which was soon to be recognized as â[[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)|Finally]]â.&lt;ref&gt;

Peniston was 22 years old when her debut single &quot;[[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)|Finally]]&quot; was successfully released. The song burst on to the US club scene in the fall of 1991, where became an instant dance anthem peaking, in October,&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; at the top of the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] for two weeks, while achieving a respectful starting position (at No.#29)&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; overseas.

After her first song climbed the international charts, Peniston was headed into the studio to record a full length album. However, she &quot;''had two months to pull the whole album together''&quot; and &quot;''didnât realize the impact the record was having until it reached the top five''&quot;. She also described how difficult it was to begin her career at such an extreme pace, but &lt;ref name=&quot;penistonbio&quot;/&gt; the result was a solidly produced ten track collection entitled ''[[Finally (CeCe Peniston album)|Finally]]'', issued in January of the following year.

Both, the single and album entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]], as well as the [[UK Top 75]] chart (at No.#5&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; and No.#2 for single,&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; respectively at No.#70&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; and at No.#10 for album release&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt;), and ultimately earned Peniston a gold, or silver certification in both countries. By the end of 1992 her debut (in Europe re-released in 1997 with a bonus remix &quot;[[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)#Finally 1997|Finally '97]]&quot;) sold over 540,000 in United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;finally LP sale&quot;/&gt;

&quot;[[We Got a Love Thang]]&quot;, the second single (co-written by [[Chantay Savage]]), with a videoclip in heavy rotation on TV music channels skyrocketed to No.#1 in the US Dance chart in February (No.#20 in the Hot 100),&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; and in England (where &quot;Finally&quot; would skip to No.#2 eventually&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt;) &quot;We Got a Love Thang&quot; peaked at No.#6.&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; Might the only controversional question regarding the title remains who'd provided backgroung vocals on the record. While on her album ''Finally'' [[Donell Rush|Darnnel Rush]] was credited, on its single release the name of [[Kym Sims]] (who was a co-writer of &quot;[[Keep On Walkin' (song)|Keep On Walkin']]&quot;) appeared as one of back-up vocalists actually.&lt;ref&gt;

With another hit record on the charts, the singer began a year of touring clubs and small theaters in the USA in support of her album. Her travels would start with a series of shows in Philippines, Japan, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, and Italy, and after her return back to the States, Peniston would continue with such R&amp;B acts as [[Joe Public]], the [[Cover Girls]], [[R.

While on tour, &quot;Keep On Walkin'&quot;, a hip-hop swinging composition, joined the list of Peniston's three consecutively running hits, bringing the singer in June her third No.1 in the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart (No.#15 in the Hot 100),&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; and another Top 10 hit in UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; Later in August, that would be also her highest outing in the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|US R&amp;B]] chart, scoring at No.#3.

On October 17, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine announced that Peniston was the leading nominee in the Billboard Music Awards, being nominated in four categories. Three times in the dance category with &quot;Finally&quot; (Best New Artist, Best Female Artist and Best Director), and one in the R&amp;B/Rap category (Best Female Artist) for her urban hit Keep On Walkin'.&lt;ref&gt;

Additional songs taken from album ''Finally'' achieved the [[Top 40]] status at least on the Hip-Hop/R&amp;B field. The grieving lyrics of her percolating ballad &quot;[[Inside That I Cried]]&quot;, co-written by the Peniston's then-husband, Malik Byrd (who appeared also in its video), and produced in conjunction with [[Anita Baker]]'s cohort, Steve Lindsey, peaked at No.#10 in the US R&amp;B (No.#94 in the Hot 100&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; and No.#42 in UK Top 75&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt;). The fifth single, a midtempo, &quot;[[Crazy Love (CeCe Peniston song)|Crazy Love]]&quot;, climbed to No.#31 (No.#97 in the Hot 100&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; and No.#44 in UK&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt;).

By the end of the year, the singer would receive several awards for her achievements in the music industry for 1992. Among them, one [[Billboard Music Award]] (as Best New Artist â Dance, the second went to the video director Claude Borenzweig), three [[ASCAP Awards]] (for Song of The Year, Most Performed Song of The Year, and Pop Songwriter of The Year), another three awards (as Best New Dance Artist, Best Dance Solo Artist, and for Best 12&quot; Dance Record) at the [[Winter Music Conference|Annual Winter Music Conference]], and the [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI Urban Award of Achievement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;firstclassent&quot;/&gt; The album itself was nominated on a [[1993 Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award '93]] in the [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Album, Female|Best R&amp;B/Soul Album â Female]] category.&lt;ref&gt;

===1993â1995: ''Thought 'Ya Knew''===
Within a year, Peniston was back in the studios to record her sophomore release, and the particular challenge for the vocalist would be not getting pigeonholed into the dance genre. For that reason, several ballads would be arranged to appear on the final set (in the front with &quot;Forever In My Heart&quot;, produced by [[Brian McKnight]]), of which, however, none would be chosen for a single release. This time around, Peniston co-authorized three of thirteen tracks (&quot;Whatever It Is&quot;, &quot;Give What Iâm Givin&quot; and &quot;Maybe It's The Way&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;penistonbio&quot;/&gt; a ballad about her father&lt;ref name=&quot;saywhatnews.com&quot;/&gt;), and along with Manny Lehman and Damon Jones, who would become the singer's manager, she was also credited as an executive producer of her scheduled album release, ''[[Thought 'Ya Knew]]''. Apart from others, also fellow Ohio-born singer [[Norma Jean Wright]] joined the session.&lt;ref&gt;

&quot;I guess the title tells you where I'm coming from with the new album. It's like I ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' I could do it, that I was coming right backatcha, real and honest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;penistonbio&quot;/&gt; |source= âthe singer stated in her A&amp;M biography}}
After a certain level of hesitation over the first single, &quot;[[I'm in the Mood]]&quot; (originally produced by [[Soulshock &amp; Karlin]]) was picked to be the final leaderâthough as support for &quot;[[Searchin' (CeCe Peniston song)|Searchin']]&quot;, which would be separately delivered on vinyl only to DJs. &quot;I'm in the Mood&quot; did well by itself, and with a video accompanied by a hip-hop remix from [[M-Doc]] &amp; Jere M.C. (better known as In Da Soul) the title was on singles reproduced by [[David Morales]] for the dance floor.  The song spawned Peniston's forth No. 1&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; (dethroning from the top of the US Dance chart [[Aretha Franklin]]'s &quot;A Deeper Love&quot;) and peaked at No. 16 in UK&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; (#32 in the Hot 100&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt;).

On January 25, 1994, the album ''Thought 'Ya Knew'', which was to represent the singer's musical zenith at that time, arrived on all available formats, including [[digital compact cassette]]s. However, as the record promptly entered the music charts, it was soon to be evident ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' was not enjoying the high-profile success of her previous set ''Finally''. After its progress had stalled in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at No. 96,&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' climbed to No. 31 in UK,&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; but the album would chart for only two short weeks in England.

Not certain about the second single either, &quot;[[Keep Givin' Me Your Love]]&quot; was accepted to become the British follow-up. But the track, remixed by [[Eddie Gordon]]'s West End production team, had no supporting music video, and after peaking at No. 36 in April in UK,&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; an alternative title (&quot;[[I'm Not Over You]]&quot;) was chosen for the US market as the second cut from the ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' album.

&quot;I'm Not Over You&quot; (written by [[Steve Hurley]], [[Jamie Principle]], and M-Doc) might have missed the highest position of the US Dance chart, but only by about one point (at No. 2),&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; and the single would be later classified in the overall ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart as the ninth most successful track of 1994 (leaving &quot;[[I'm in the Mood]]&quot; far behind, at #44). However, although the song had sealed the Top 10 of the US R&amp;B chart, it did not succeed in the Hot 100 that much, failing to crack Top 40 (No.# 41).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Year in Music&quot;&gt;

|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that expectations of A&amp;M Records company must have been bigger than a club play sale of the singer's singles, &quot;I'm Not Over You&quot; was released in UK only on [[B-side]] of the &quot;[[Hit by Love]]&quot; release.

&quot;Hit by Love&quot; was to be the third song taken from the album. As with her previous releases, the song (with additional remixes by David Morales) became Peniston's next US Dance hit in a line of her No. 1s, but while on the top of the chart &quot;Hit by Love&quot; would stay for another week, the single stuck at No.# 33 in the UK Top 75,&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; as well as on the bottom positions of the American Hot 100 chart (at No.# 90).&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt;

Along with &quot;Hit by Love&quot; in the charts, A&amp;M issued a rare compilation, ''[[Remix Collection (CeCe Peniston album)|Remix Collection]]'', in Japan with nine alternate versions of her songs previously available only on vinyl, which tracked Peniston's music career since the &quot;Keep On Walkin'&quot; release. A similar remixed collection, however, consisted of only two singles (&quot;Finally&quot; and &quot;We Got a Love Thang&quot;) was earlier issued in Japan as a [[Extended play|remix EP]] album under the title ''[[Finally/We Got a Love Thang: Remix Collection]]'' featuring overall eight remixed versions.

At the end of the year Peniston was named the No. 1 ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play Artist,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Year in Music&quot;/&gt; summarizing all her songs released in 1994 (&quot;I'm Not Over You&quot; #9, &quot;Hit by Love&quot; #24, and I'm in the Mood&quot; #44). While A&amp;M would be listed as the sixth best dance label in the ''Billboard'' Year-End chart, the singer was also rated as the 5th Top R&amp;B Singles Female Artist (behind [[Janet Jackson]], [[Tony Braxton]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Mariah Carey]]).&lt;ref&gt;

In addition, a remix of &quot;Keep Givin' Me Your Love&quot; was popularized on the original motion picture soundtrack of the ''[[PrÃªt-Ã -Porter|PrÃªt-Ã -Porter (Ready To Wear)]]'' film, and released in the U.S. after a one-year delay, scoring No. 4 in the US Dance charts in March 1995. &quot;Keep Givin' Me Your Love&quot; became Peniston's first song not to enter the Hot 100 chart (No.#101),&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; possibly as the result of appearing as a B-side on her previous release, and sharing its sales with the single &quot;Hit by Love&quot;.

Between releases, Peniston made a jazzy cameo &quot;Don't Forget the Love&quot; with words and music by a [[Grammy Award]]-nominated composer, [[Jeff Lorber]], and [[Eric Benet]] (also a later Grammy Award nominee) for his album ''[[West Side Stories]]''. The title of the Lorber's album was his response to residing the [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles|West Side of L.A.]] (not his adaptation of songs from the [[West Side Story (Original Broadway Cast)|Broadway musical]] or ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' film), and after its issue in November 1994, the studio record peaked at No.#5 in the ''Billboard's'' list of [[Top Contemporary Jazz]] albums.&lt;ref&gt;

As a member of the gospel quintet called [[Sisters of Glory|The Sisters of Glory]], which included [[Thelma Houston]], [[Phoebe Snow]], Lois Walden, [[Albertina Walker]], and herself, Peniston would also record a spiritual album, ''[[Good News in Hard Times]]'', that featured two solo traditionals (&quot;[[How I Got Over]]&quot; and &quot;[[Precious Memories (hymn)|Precious Memories]]&quot;) performed by the singer, four standards with her solo part (&quot;Rough Side of the Mountain&quot;, &quot;[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]&quot;, &quot;I Won't Be Back No More&quot; and &quot;[[Oh Happy Day]]&quot;), as well as her chorus vocals on additional nine tracks. ''Good News in Hard Times'' (produced by Jennifer Cohen and Lois Walden) was released in August 1995 on [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]], and the album brought Peniston an entry also in the ''Billboard'' [[Top Gospel Albums]] list, where it reached in October No.#29, remaining in the chart for 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;

===1996â1998: ''I'm Movin' On'' and ''The Best Of'' album===
In February 1996, the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' posted information that singer was putting the finishing touches to her new studio album, ''[[I'm Movin' On (CeCe Peniston album)|I'm Movin' On]]'', slated for its release in May. Judging from the magazineâs earlier preview of several cuts, the ''Billboard'' published that Peniston was about to explore more mature jeep-soul fare a la [[Faith Evans]], and that she has never sounded so assured and convincingly soulful.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=220px|align=right|quote=

&quot;[[Movin' On (CeCe Peniston song)|Movin' On]]&quot;, the song considered as the strongest track to reach core R&amp;B listeners with potential across several genres, was produced by [[Dave Hall (record producer)|Dave &quot;Jam&quot; Hall]], the hit maker behind [[Mariah Carey]]'s &quot;[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]&quot;, whose earlier work included also the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]'' album. The song cracked the Top 40 on the US R&amp;B/Hip Hop at No.#29, but failed to show up in the UK chart, while scoring at weak No.#83 in the Hot 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt;

On September 9, ''I'm Movin' On'', the record with evident absence of her ever dependable club workouts finally arrived. Peniston contributed to the set with three songs she co-wrote (except the title's track, the ballad &quot;The Last To Know&quot; and a club potential, &quot;Don't Know What To Do&quot;, that would not be promoted). After peaking at No.#48 on the US R&amp;B,&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; the album passed by the ''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums chart, and soon largely felt victim to mismarketing.

Despite insistence from the Peniston's management to release &quot;[[Somebody Else's Guy]]&quot; as a follow-up, A&amp;M label preferred an alternate composition, &quot;[[Before I Lay]]&quot;, which featured the singerâs then-beau [[JoJo Hailey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-08-18/entertainment/18020780_1_cece-peniston-movin-bits-and-pieces|title=The New Look of Cece Peniston|first=Denene|last=Millner|date=1996-08-18|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|at=articles.nydailynews.com|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|page=1|accessdate=2011-07-20|quote=One of the songs is actually an R&amp;B duet with her new boyfriend, Jodeci's JoJo Hailey}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of [[K-Ci and JoJo]]) who was supposed to help establish Peniston as an R&amp;B artist. But the duet reached its top in the US R&amp;B already at No.#52,&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; with no entry in the Hot 100 chart (No.#121) or in England.

However, Peniston herself seemed to be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed at the time of ''I'm Movin' On'' release by ''Billboard: &quot;When you're first coming out as an artist, many times label executives have their own vision for you. But as you move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as youâre honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that youâre doing,&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;

After only two singles released from her R&amp;B set, A&amp;M did not decide to select a song that would cater to another music format, and capitulated to progress with ''I'm Movin' On'' album that Peniston would promote also during the [[Bill Clinton]]'s election campaign, on which she performed several track from the set.&lt;ref name=&quot;camp lo&quot;&gt;

In September, A&amp;M re-released the single &quot;Finally&quot; that successfully entered the [[UK Top 75]] back again (No.#26&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt;), and in addition also her debut album on CD enhanced with the new remix, [[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)#Finally 1997|Finally (Classic Funk Radio Mix)]], both re-issued only in the overseas.

In February 1998, a David Morales' remix of &quot;Somebody Else's Guy&quot;, originally popularized by [[Jocelyn Brown]] and recorded for the album ''I'm Movin' On'', became a surprising hit in Europe, where it reached No.#13 in the UK Top 75 (as her last entry to date in England),&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats&quot;/&gt; as well as in April No.#26 in Japan, after being picked to promote the singerâs import greatest hits collection simply entitled ''[[The Best of CeCe Peniston]]''. The black and white photographs for its booklet were done by Daniela Federici, whose art work was noticed already on ''I'm Movin' On'' release, and later also on album and single covers of other female recording artists, such as [[CÃ©line Dion]], [[Toni Braxton]], or [[Pink (singer)|Pink]].

After her departure from A&amp;M Peniston contributed with two songs to the [[MC Magic]]'s compilation of various Phoenix-based artists called ''[[Desert Funk: Soundtrack]]'' that was issued on Nastyboy Records.

Rumors about the singer working in Chicago on a new album with [[Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley]] sprung up after &quot;[[Nobody Else (CeCe Peniston song)|Nobody Else]]&quot;, a gospel-infused sirene and her debut on the producer's label, saw its official release in 1998.

To make things surrounding her potential comeback even worst, ferocious house groove &quot;Nobody Else&quot;, which was premiered at the 5th Annual Billboard Dance Music Summit on the stage at the [[Green Dolphin Street]], failed to enter the music charts, despite favorable reviews of the ''Billboard'' that rated the song ''&quot;among the artist's strongest recordings&quot;, &quot;a sure to-thrill die hards,&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;

;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Lifetime to Love&quot;&lt;/big&gt;
While looking for alternative options for the cancelled production of her album, Peniston decided to make a step back and record a cover version of &quot;[[Lifetime to Love]]&quot;, written by Steven Nikolas and Brendon Sibley, for her ex-major label producer and the Manny Lehman's compilation ''[[Circuit Sessions 00.1 (Manny Lehman compilation)|Circuit Sessions 00.1]]''. The composition would almost revive the singer's No.1 status in February 2001, returning the singer back into the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play list, and delivering her a Top 3 entry also in the millennium (No.#2).&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;/&gt; Although, the song was at the end of the year classified as the 30th most successful US Dance track of 2001,&lt;ref&gt;

Following the millennium Peniston, not longer part of the mainstream that brought her success in the early '90s, would spend the first decade by supporting numerous recording artists of various musical styles and influences who would keep her in music industry and in the eye of public mostly as a guest, but prominent vocalist.
&lt;br /&gt;In 2001, she collaborated with [[Ella Mae Saison]], a singer from Philippines, on a common track. The duet partially mixed in France, and partially in N.Y.C., was sponsored by a multiple world champion boxer, [[Evander Holyfield]], and released on his record label, named after his nickname [[Real Deal Records|Real Deal]] in April.

Accompanied by a line-up of seven other female vocalists coming from both sides of the Atlantic, diva herself joined [[Full Flava|Rob Derbyshire]] and [[Full Flava|Paul 'Solomon' Mullings]], the [[Birmingham]]âs R&amp;B production duo known as [[Full Flava]], to record lead vocals for their album ''[[Colour of My Soul]]''. The modern soul set was to be made in England, released on [[DÃ´me Records]] in 2003, and one of the compositions performed by Peniston, &quot;[[For My Baby]]&quot;, was later given also a treatment for the dance floor with stand-out house mixes from [[The Str8jackets|Dave &quot;Leggz&quot; Longmore]] and Sam Junior Bromfield known as Ruff âNâ Tumble, and the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] duo KT &amp; C.&lt;ref&gt;

;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Eternal Lover&quot;&lt;/big&gt;
Her next steps afterwards led to Better Days Studios in Paris where, for a change, singer was supposed to work with a French producer, FrÃ©deric Tharreau alias BIBI, on exclusively import single &quot;[[Eternal Lover]]&quot;. In addition to being released in France on RLPMix Records, the song was also issued in Australia and New Zealand on the domestic premier dance label, Vinyl Pusher Records, in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;

During each program five former pop stars would sing their biggest hit plus a cover version of one contemporary hit, and every week the winner, picked by the studio audience, would get a donation of $20,000 in their name to a charity of free choice. Peniston competed on the show performing âFinallyâ plus a [[Faith Hill]]'s song, &quot;[[There You'll Be]]&quot;, in favor of a hip-hop group, [[Arrested Development (band)|Arrested Development]] (the final winner of the program that night).

;&lt;big&gt;''Pastor Jones'' and ''Don't Touch if You Ain't Prayed''&lt;/big&gt;
In the first half of 2005, the singer wrapped up shooting an independent film called ''[http://www.maverickentertainment.cc/movies/158/don-t-touch-if-you-ain-t-prayed Don't Touch if You Ain't Prayed]''. Her character was a forty year old Christian woman saving herself for marriage, and the film featured gospel music performed by herself. In addition, Peniston would take a small part in another urban Gospel film appealing to Christian market, ''[http://www.maverickentertainment.cc/movies/154/pastor-jones Pastor Jones]''.

On September 19, 2005, Peniston was invited to appear at [[Manhattan Center]], Grand Ballroom, NYC, to be present at the 2nd Annual [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]] Induction Ceremony, along with [[Wanda Dee]] (of KLF), [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Freddie Jackson]], and [[Kathy Sledge]].&lt;ref&gt;

An awards ceremony announcing the inductees in the event would take place annually at a formal dinner event in New York, but due to financial differences among the Board members, the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceased operations after its second ceremony (in 2005).

;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Deeper Love&quot;&lt;/big&gt;
The singer's following music project was a common duet with [[David Longoria]], a trumpet player whose work was previously noticed on records of for example [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] or [[George Michael]]. The union would show up to be successful, when a composition combining jazz and dance music, &quot;[[Deeper Love]]&quot;, written by Longoria, after six weeks on the chart climbed to No.#14 in the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play (on November 19),&lt;ref&gt;

On August 26, 2007, one year after her interview for ''5 Chicago Mag'', the singer would mention again her plans regarding a new album project also for ''Say What News'', however she would not go further this time. When asked, with whom from the industry she would like to once collaborate, she named the winner of twenty-two Grammy Awards, [[Stevie Wonder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;saywhatnews.com&quot;/&gt;

;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Still I&quot;&lt;/big&gt;
[[File:Penistondelgado2007.jpg|thumb|left|Peniston with Delgado after their reunion in 2007 at Chaton Studios, Glendale, AZ, where the album ''Finally'' was recorded.]]
Originally, the potential release of an [[R&amp;B]] song after a lengthy absence, &quot;[[Still I]]&quot;, was to be cancelled, but the final record actually leaked out after [[Rodney K. Jackson]], one of the producers, allowed the Adrenaline Music company to distribute the song.
&lt;br /&gt;Behind the song's production would be soon recognized the singer's former folks from Arizona, [[Felipe Delgado]] and Jackson (both in charge of her initial hit, âFinallyâ, from 1991) who reunited in 2005 to form a new production crew, collectively known as SandWorx, altogether with Nick &quot;Cello&quot; Valentine (which joined them in the spring of the following year). Though Peniston herself, who supported the trio by performing live in the Next In club in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], did not consider the record as a strong enough to be offered for sale, &quot;Still I&quot; was eventually released as a four track virtual single in September 2007, and the session that was supposed to rejoin the former producers with the singer ended up with an apparent contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;

However, the year of 2008 would also pass with no significant news regarding her new solo studio project, the following June Peniston released &quot;[[Above Horizons]]&quot;, a national [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] anthem as a tribute to the families, teachers and communities who help children reach their dreams through the PTA, Parent Teacher Association, which resulted from her role being a National Ambassador of the US largest volunteer child advocacy organization. The ballad was written by Byron V. Garrett, Peniston, Erric Carrington, Essej and Marcus L. Barnum, and the CD promo release, issued on [[National PTA Recordings]], included overall four versions. Among others, also two mixes from a Detroit house music producer and DJ, [[Aaron-Carl Ragland]], who would list one of the singer's compositions (&quot;Nobody Else&quot; from 1998) as one of his musical influences.&lt;ref&gt;

On June 17, 2009, ''Chicago Defender'' interviewed the artist, who would declare that after over a decade she was about to finish recording her comeback album. Although, she did not concrete its release date, Peniston revealed that she was working with such likes as Track Kingz West, Vudu, Status (&quot;Above Horizons&quot;), David Givens, [[Montell Jordan]] (on their common duet &quot;He Say, She Say&quot;), [[Mateo]] (on &quot;Piece of That&quot;), Isalene Elliot, and Ragland. ''âOnce I reach an agreement and sign with a record company, the album will drop,â''&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagodefender&quot;/&gt; she added. One month later, Peniston would confirm information regarding her new studio album live as a guest of the [[Wendy Williams]] birthday show, during which she performed &quot;Finally&quot;. Subsequently, the diva allowed to prelisten a few of her brand new recordings to her community via her web-site at [[myspace.com]]. Among them, the song &quot;[[Runway (CeCe Peniston song)|Runway]]&quot; met with instant positive feedback due to its hip-hop/dance sound comparable to the [[Timbaland]]'s production. After a New York correspondent, Kenya Thomas, questioned Peniston for ''Skinny'', she wished to subtitle the album ''[[CeCe (album)|CeCe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

;&lt;big&gt;&quot;In Love with a DJ&quot;&lt;/big&gt;
In June 2010, ''Hip-Hop Press'' posted information about [[Ron Carroll]] launching his own independent record label called Electricity, which is to be part of One Entertainment company that will specialize in marketing and promoting concerts, fashion shows and club events all over the world, and signing Electronic, Hip-Hop/R&amp;B and gospel artists. According to the producer himself, Carroll's goal with the label (which has a major distribution deal with [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]) is to focus on artist development, music education and ensuring that Electricity creates a solid foundation for the music industry in the [[City of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;

In an interview for ''Great British Life'', Carroll would say that he &quot;''wanted to make a song that gives the perspective of a woman groovinâ to my music, and loving me enough make her night complete.''â&lt;ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1992, subsequent to the release of the debut album ''Finally'', Peniston was shortly married&lt;ref name=&quot;penistonbio&quot;/&gt; to Malik Byrd, who co-wrote &quot;Inside That I Cried&quot; and appeared by her side also in its video.&lt;ref&gt;

Peniston is childless, sharing her home in [[Glendale, Arizona]], with two pit bulls and a chihuahua.&lt;ref name=&quot;5Mag&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagodefender&quot;/&gt;

==Controversies==
===Overweight and plastic surgery===
With the exception of her formative years when she was crowned a beauty queen, Peniston was struggling with being overweight constantly. ''&quot;When I first got in this business, I was actually heavier and I was comfortable with who I was, but that was an issue for the record company,&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;5Mag&quot;/&gt; she disclossed in 2006. ''&quot;But see in this day and age where I'm at, it wouldn't be a problem for the record company, I'm going to make sure that it's not. But for somebody who's getting into the business, realize that you're a commodity, and if the record company's investing in you, make sure you that you invest in yourself. Look is important because people see the physical first,&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;5Mag&quot;/&gt; she was advising up comers in the ''5 Magazine'' interview.

However three years later, in November 2009, Peniston herself was spotted in [[Culver City, California]] posing for ''[[Inside Edition]]'' (produced daily at the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] in N.Y.C.), which first revealed details about her radical physical makeover and tumescent liposuction she, reportedly, got recommended by her new record executives.&lt;ref name=&quot;surgery&quot;&gt;

In addition, she was featured in several national celebrity news and fashion magazines, including the National ''[[US Weekly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;

The surgery was a âhitâ for Peniston, who then claimed to ''&quot;feel great&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;surgery&quot;/&gt; after having liposuction, a tummy tuck, fat removed from her neck and a host of other procedures at the Infini Cosmetic Associates clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;

===Monica versus CeCe===
In August 2008, Necole Bitchie interviewed American R&amp;B singer [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], whose first two singles made her the youngest recording act to ever have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&amp;B Singles chart in 1995. The younger singer outspokenly talked about her professional life, upcoming wedding as well as her past relationships. During the interview she also highlighted a devastating moment she had with Peniston when she was a child:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;I remember years ago when I was like 10, I went to an expo and my manager-cousin Melinda asked CeCe Peniston, who was huge at that time, if I could sing for her. She did everything she possibly could while I sang and I remember her being so rude. She was so horrible to me that I was devastated and I never forgot that&quot;'',&lt;ref name=&quot;monica&quot;&gt;

|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; said Monica.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A friend of Peniston had brought the article to her attention later, and she would respond to Monica via the social networking website [[MySpace.com]]:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:white; padding:1em; border:1px solid #999;&quot;&gt;
{{cquote|Hello, Monica. I donât even know where to begin. A good friend of mine called me yesterday and told me about the interview you did for &quot;Necole Bichie&quot;. I actually read it myself and my heart just dropped. I wanted to apologize from the bottom of my heart for anything that I may have said or done to make you feel that way. I honestly donât remember this, so for that reason I canât deny it. I absolutely LOVE children, thatâs why Iâve been wrecking my brain to remember this. Iâve always encouraged and supported children in their dreams and aspirations, especially when theyâve wanted to demonstrate a talent to me. You said in the interview that I did everything I could do to stay busy while you were singing. The only thing I can assume is that maybe at that time I had a lot of people pulling me in a hundred different directions and I should have told them to wait while you were singing. At that time I was young and still pretty new to the industry myself, and so I hadnât learned how to balance everything just yet. It really hurts me that I made you feel like that. Iâve always prided myself on staying grounded, being real to people and loving my fans. But after reading the interview it showed me that I wasnât always on top of my game and I am very sorry for that. As an artist you know that youâre always expected to be at 100%, but we both know that we just canât deliver that all the time. I want you to know that Iâm very proud of the woman youâve become and everything youâve accomplished both professionally and personally. I hate that at such a young age thatâs the memory you have of me. Stay blessed in everything you do and I wish you all the best with your new album. Sincerely, CeCe &lt;ref name=&quot;monica&quot;/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After Monica reached the Penistonâs comment on the issue, she would react as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;CeCe, with all my heart I believe what you are saying. I was only 11 years old and it had an affect on me in a positive way, especially as an artist. It was great for me because to fans I donât say no to things that are fair or within my reach. But only a REAL woman would care about the story after all the years have passed. I never told the story with the intent of hurting you. Iâm nothing like some of these messy chicks that recklessly speak and then back down, but I did it to make a point to the many new artists that I meet who clearly feel they owe fans nothing and clearly, CeCe, you donât feel that way to have even addressed it after 17 years. So thank you, CeCe, at 28years old it still meant a lot to me that you addressed ME directly, and at this point I feel that story should never be told again because the second greatest point this ENTIRE story makes is that artist is still human. Thank you very much for even caring about my feelings. All my love, Monica and my entire family (who were all there that day) say we thank you and love you.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;monica&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;LOTS alias CeCe Peniston Youth Foundation
Originally in 1997, singer, along with her friend Heather, founded the CeCe Peniston Youth Foundation to help raise funds for many other organizations, particularly those concerned with HIV/AIDS, women and children in need, hunger and the equality of mankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;saywhatnews.com&quot;/&gt; After the [[September 11, 2001]] tragedy, [[Michael Jackson]] requested her presence for his &quot;United We Stand&quot; concert to benefit the families of [[9/11]]. She has also blazed two tracks (&quot;[[The Christmas Song]]&quot; and &quot;[[What a Wonderful World]]) on the albums ''[[Merry Arizona II: Desert Stars Shine at Christmas|Merry Arizona II]]'' and ''[[Merry Arizona 97: Desert Stars Shine at Christmas|Merry Arizona 97]]'', with proceeds going to [[Multiple Sclerosis]].  She had been requested to perform for U.S. troops on the U.S.S. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1993, and has continued to travel to entertain the U.S. troops overseas since.&lt;ref name=&quot;firstclassent&quot;/&gt;

Later in 2006, the foundation was to be re-named as the LOTS Foundation (Lifting Others To Succeed), after her statement in the interview for ''5 Mag'' in June the same year, and she was planning doing a benefit for cancer research, because of her father, a cancer survivor.&lt;ref name=&quot;5Mag&quot;/&gt;

;National PTA Ambassador
In October 2008, singer was along with [[Dara Torres]] named a [[Ambassador|National Ambassador]] for the [[Parent Teacher Association]], which is the largest volunteer child advocacy organization with more than 5 million members. In her new role, she would visit with hundreds of children across the country to reinforce the importance of an arts education and pursuing their dreams. She would also join parents and educators to work toward improving the lives of children, as well as urging families to be more involved.&lt;ref&gt;
