See also [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1312.htm Hosea 12:5].&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob's twelve sons became the ancestors of the [[Israelites]], also known as the ''Twelve Tribes of Israel'' or ''Children of Israel''.  Jacob and his sons had lived in [[Canaan]] but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations until [[Moses]], a great-great grandson of [[Jacob]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:16â20|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the [[Israelites]] back into [[Canaan]] in the &quot;[[The Exodus|Exodus]]&quot;.

The area is also known as the [[Holy Land]], being holy for all [[Abrahamic religions]] including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith]]. Prior to the 1948 [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]], the whole region was known by various other names including [[Southern Syria]], [[Syria Palestina]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Iudaea Province]], [[Coele-Syria]], [[Retjenu]], [[Canaan]] and, particularly, Palestine.

According to the [[Torah]], God promised the land to the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]] of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;From the ''[[King James Version of the Bible]]'': &quot;And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.&quot; ([[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], 30:5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From the ''[[King James Version of the Bible]]'': &quot;But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.&quot; ([[Nehemiah]], 1:9).&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of scripture, the period of the three Patriarchs has been placed somewhere in the early 2nd millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[Jewish Legion]], a group primarily of Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British conquest of Palestine in 1917. Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the [[1920 Palestine riots]] and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the [[Haganah]] (meaning &quot;The Defense&quot; in Hebrew), from which the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], or [[Stern Gang]], paramilitary groups later split off.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scharfstein|1996|p=269}}. &quot;During the First and Second Aliyot, there were many Arab attacks against Jewish settlements...

In May 1967 a number of Arab states began to mobilize their forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segev|2007|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel saw these actions as a ''[[casus belli]]''.  On 5 June 1967, Israel launched a [[preemptive war|pre-emptive strike]] against Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq.  In a [[Six-Day War]], Israeli military superiority was clearly demonstrated against their more numerous Arab foes. Israel succeeded in capturing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Golan Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2006|p=126}}. &quot;Nasser, the Egyptian president, decided to mass troops in the Sinai...casus belli by Israel.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem's boundaries were enlarged, incorporating [[East Jerusalem]], and the 1949 [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] became the administrative boundary between Israel and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]].

In the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, Israel defeated the combined armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Following the war, Israel faced much internal resistance from the Arab Palestinians. Most important among the various Palestinian and Arab groups was the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), established in 1964, which initially committed itself to &quot;armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/magazine/13PALESTINIANS.html?pagewanted=2|title=The Interregnum|last=Bennet|first=James|date=13 March 2005|work=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/33+The+Palestinian+National+Covenant-+July+1968.htm |title=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs â The Palestinian National Covenant- July 1968 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Palestinian fedayeen|Palestinian groups]] launched a [[Palestinian political violence|wave of attacks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |unused_data=page=256 |title=Research on terrorism: trends, achievements &amp; failures |last=Silke |first=Andrew |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0714653112 |page=149 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rSpfNJQ4CbAC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=palestinian+terror+1970s&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q= |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |unused_data=page=164 |title=The Routledge Atlas of the ArabâIsraeli conflict: The Complete History of the Struggle and the Efforts to Resolve It |last=Gilbert|first=Martin |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415281164 |page=82 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=UNvJ1FOwiAwC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=palestinian+terror+1970s&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q= |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Israel and Jewish targets around the world,&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Edmund L. and John Kifner.[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/world/middleeast/27habash.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=9767c2c5b87668e6&amp;ex=1359090000&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss &quot;George Habash, Palestinian Terrorism Tactician, Dies at 82.&quot;] ''[[The New York Times]]''. 27 Jan 2008.

The war ended on 26 October with Israel successfully repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but suffering significant losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/6/newsid_2514000/2514317.stm |publisher=The BBC |title=1973: Arab states attack Israeli forces |work=On This Day |accessdate=15 July 2007 | date=6 October 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Agranat Commission|internal inquiry]] exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war, but public anger forced Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/agranat_eng.htm |title=Agranat Commission |publisher=Knesset |year=2008 |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1976 Israeli commandos carried out a [[Operation Entebbe|daring mission]] which succeeded in rescuing 95 hostages who were being held by PLO guerillas at [[Entebbe International Airport]] close to [[Kampala]], Uganda.

The [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 Knesset elections]] marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party took control from the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bregman|2002|pp=169â170}} &quot;In hindsight we can say that 1977 was a turning point...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Egyptian President [[Anwar El Sadat]] made a trip to Israel and spoke before the [[Knesset]] in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bregman|2002|pp=171â174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the two years that followed, Sadat and [[Menachem Begin]] signed the [[Camp David Accords]] (1978) and the [[IsraelâEgypt Peace Treaty]] (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bregman|2002|pp=186â187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bregman|2002|pp=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the [[Coastal Road Massacre]], in which 35 Israeli civilians were killed and 75 injured.  Israel responded by launching an [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|invasion of southern Lebanon]] to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River.  Most PLO fighters withdrew, but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over.  However, the PLO soon resumed its policy of resistance to Israel.  In the next few years the PLO infiltrated back south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground.

Meanwhile, Begin's government actively encouraged Israelis to [[Israeli settlements|settle]] in the occupied West Bank, leading to increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A history of the modern Middle East |last=Cleveland |first=William L. |year=1999 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0813334899 |page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jerusalem Law|Basic Law: Jerusalem, the Capital of Israel]], passed in 1980, was believed by some to reaffirm Israel's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|reignited international controversy]] over the [[Positions on Jerusalem|status of the city]]. However, there has never been an Israeli government act which defined what it considers to be the extent of the territory of Israel and no act which specifically included East Jerusalem therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=[[Ian Lustick]] |month=January | year= 1997 | title=Has Israel Annexed East Jerusalem?| journal=Middle East Policy | volume=V | issue=1|id=|url=http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol5/9701_lustick.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080801164123/http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol5/9701_lustick.asp|archivedate=1 August 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2007 |postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the majority of UN member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by Israel to settle its citizens in the West Bank, and impose its laws and administration on East Jerusalem are illegal and have no validity.&lt;ref&gt;See for example UN General Assembly resolution 63/30, 2009 Jan 23, passed 163 for, 6 against [http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/79A7B2136E555A5B852575520052B339]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 1981, the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq's sole nuclear power plant, which was under construction just outside Baghdad.

Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon once again to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel [[1982 Lebanon War|First Lebanon War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bregman|2002|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first six days of fighting, the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians. An Israeli government inquiry â the [[Kahan Commission]] â would later hold Begin, Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacres]].  In 1985 Israel responded to a PLO terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunis.  Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986, but maintained a [[Israeli Security Zone|borderland buffer zone]] in southern Lebanon until 2000. The [[First Intifada]], a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A History of the IsraeliâPalestinian conflict |last=Tessler |first=Mark A. |year=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0253208736 |page=677}}&lt;/ref&gt; broke out in 1987 with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence occurring in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.  Over the following six years, the Intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation.  More than a thousand people were killed in the violence, many of them stone-throwing youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|Zenner|1994|p=246}}. &quot;Toward the end of 1991,... were the result of internal Palestinian terror.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to continuing PLO guerilla raids into northern Israel, Israel launched another punitive raid into southern Lebanon in 1988.  Amid rising tensions over the Kuwait crisis, Israeli border guards fired into a rioting Palestinian crowd near the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.  20 people were killed and some 150 injured.  During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the PLO supported [[Saddam Hussein]] and Iraqi Scud [[Gulf War#Iraq launches missile strikes|missile attacks against Israel]].  Despite public outrage, Israel heeded US calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DB173EF93AA35751C1A967958260|title=After 4 Years, Intifada Still Smolders |work=The New York Times |date=9 December 1991 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |last=Haberman |first=Clyde}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mowlana|Gerbner|Schiller|1992|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel is located at the eastern end of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], bounded by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest. It lies between latitudes [[29th parallel north|29Â°]] and [[34th parallel north|34Â° N]], and longitudes [[34th meridian east|34Â°]] and [[36th meridian east|36Â° E]].

The sovereign territory of Israel, excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], is approximately {{convert|20770|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}} in area, of which two&amp;nbsp;percent is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |work=The World Factbook |accessdate=20 July 2007 |date=19 June 2007 |title=Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total area under Israeli law, when including [[East Jerusalem]] and the [[Golan Heights]], is {{convert|22072|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st01_01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Area of Districts, Sub-Districts, Natural Regions and Lakes |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |work=Statistical Abstract of Israel |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the total area under Israeli control, including the military-controlled and partially [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian-governed]] territory of the [[West Bank]], is {{convert|27799|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc-geo&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/iltoc.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |date=7 May 2009 |title=Israel (Geography) |work=Country Studies |accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite its small size, Israel is home to a variety of geographic features, from the [[Negev]] desert in the south to the mountain ranges of the [[Galilee]], [[Mount Carmel|Carmel]] and toward the [[Golan Heights|Golan]] in the north. The [[Israeli Coastal Plain]] on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to seventy percent of the nation's population. East of the central highlands lies the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], which forms a small part of the {{convert|6500|km|mi|0|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Great Rift Valley]].

The [[Jordan River]] runs along the Jordan Rift Valley, from [[Mount Hermon]] through the [[Hulah Valley]] and the [[Sea of Galilee]] to the [[Dead Sea]], the lowest point on the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/4/FOCUS%20on%20Israel-%20The%20Living%20Dead%20Sea |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=20 July 2007 |date=1 April 1999 |title=The Living Dead Sea|isbn=0826404065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south is the [[Arabah]], ending with the [[Gulf of Aqaba|Gulf of Eilat]], part of the [[Red Sea]].

Temperatures in Israel vary widely, especially during the winter. The more mountainous regions can be windy, cold, and sometimes snowy; [[Jerusalem]] usually receives at least one snowfall each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldreich|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, coastal cities, such as [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Haifa]], have a typical [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers.

Four different [[phytogeographic]] regions exist in Israel, due to the country's location between the temperate and the tropical zones, bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the desert in the east. For this reason the flora and fauna of Israel is extremely diverse.

There are 2,867 known species of plants found in Israel. Of these, at least 253 species are [[List of adventive wild plants in Israel|introduced]] and non-native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flora.huji.ac.il/browse.asp?action=browse&amp;group=1070 |title=Flora of Israel Online |publisher=Flora.huji.ac.il |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2007, there are 190 Israeli nature reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.org.il/BuildaGate5/general2/data_card.php?Cat=~~~660964978~Card13~&amp;ru=&amp;SiteName=parks&amp;Clt=&amp;Bur=351331723 |title=The Israel Nature and Parks Authority-×¨×©××ª ××××¢ ×××× ×× |publisher=Parks.org.il |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The knesset illuminated.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Knesset]] building, home to the Israeli parliament]]
Israel operates under a [[parliamentary system]] as a democratic republic with [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; A [[Member of Parliament|member of parliament]] supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]]âusually this is the chair of the largest party. The prime minister is the [[head of government]] and head of the [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1996, direct elections for prime minister were inaugurated, but the system was declared unsatisfactory and the old one reinstated.

Membership of the Knesset is based on [[proportional representation]] of [[List of political parties in Israel|political parties]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_beh.htm |publisher=The Knesset |accessdate=8 August 2007 |title=The Electoral System in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Politics of Israel#Electoral system|2% electoral threshold]], which in practice has resulted in coalition governments.

Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years, but unstable coalitions or a [[motion of no confidence|no-confidence vote]] by the Knesset can dissolve a government earlier.
The [[Basic Laws of Israel]] function as an [[uncodified constitution]]. In 2003, the Knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazie|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal system===
{{Main|Israeli judicial system}}

[[File:Elyon.JPG|thumb|The Israeli Supreme Court, [[Givat Ram]], Jerusalem]]
Israel has a [[Israeli judicial system|three-tier court system]]. At the lowest level are [[magistrate]] courts, situated in most cities across the country. Above them are [[district court]]s, serving both as [[appeal|appellate]] courts and [[trial court|courts of first instance]]; they are situated in five of Israel's six [[Districts of Israel|districts]]. The third and highest tier is the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], located in Jerusalem; it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the [[Supreme Court of Israel#High Court of Justice|High Court of Justice]]. In the latter role, the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, allowing individuals, both citizens and non-citizens, to petition against the decisions of state authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;judiciary&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Branches%20of%20Government/Judicial/The%20Judiciary-%20The%20Court%20System |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 August 2007 |date=1 August 2005 |title=The Judiciary: The Court System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/editorial/view.bg?articleid=1030205 |publisher=The Boston Herald |title=Israelâs high court unique in region |accessdate=15 September 2007 |date=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Israel supports the goals of the [[International Criminal Court]], it has not ratified the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], citing concerns about the ability of the court to remain free from political impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/6/Israel%20and%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court| title=Israel and the International Criminal Court| publisher=Office of the Legal Adviser to the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's legal system combines three legal traditions: [[English law|English]] [[common law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[Halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; It is based on the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (precedent) and is an [[adversarial system]], where the parties in the suit bring evidence before the court. Court cases are decided by professional judges rather than juries.&lt;ref name=&quot;judiciary&quot; /&gt; Marriage and divorce are under the jurisdiction of the religious courts: [[Beth din|Jewish]], [[Sharia|Muslim]], Druze, and Christian. A committee of Knesset members, Supreme Court justices, and Israeli Bar members carries out the election of judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/State/THE+STATE-+Judiciary-+The+Court+System.htm |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=9 August 2007 |date=1 October 2006 |title=The State&amp;nbsp;â Judiciary&amp;nbsp;â The Court System}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Administration of Israel's courts (both the &quot;General&quot; courts and the Labor Courts) is carried by the Administration of Courts, situated in Jerusalem. Both General and Labor courts are paperless courts: the storage of court files, as well as court decisions, are conducted electronically.

Israel's [[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty]] seeks to defend [[Human rights in Israel|human rights and liberties in Israel]].

===Israeli-occupied territories===
{{Main|Israeli-occupied territories}}

[[File:Is-wb-gs-gh v3.png|thumb|250px||Map of Israel showing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights]]In 1967, as a result of the [[Six-Day War]], Israel gained control of the [[West Bank]] (Judaea and Samaria), [[East Jerusalem]], the [[Gaza Strip|Gaza strip]] and the [[Golan Heights]]. Israel also took control of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]].

Following Israel's capture of these territories, [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] consisting of Israeli citizens were established within each of them. Israel applied civilian law to the [[Golan Heights Law|Golan Heights]] and [[Jerusalem Law|East Jerusalem]], incorporating them into its sovereign territory and granting their inhabitants permanent residency status and the choice to apply for citizenship. In contrast, the [[West Bank]] has remained under [[military occupation]], and Palestinians in this area cannot become citizens. The [[Gaza Strip]] is independent of Israel with no Israeli military or civilian presence, but Israel continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters. The Gaza Strip and the West Bank are seen by the Palestinians and most of the international community as the site of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|future Palestinian state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Solana: EU aims to establish a Palestinian state at the earliest possible moment within the 1967 borders. |first=Adar |last=Primor |newspaper=Haaretz |date=24 October 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1123034.html}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/11/132434.htm |title=United States: &quot;an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps&quot; |date=25 November 2009 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be &quot;null and void&quot; and continues to view the territories as occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/418/84/IMG/NR041884.pdf?OpenElement |title=Golan Heights: UNSC Res. 497 |year=1981 |publisher=UN |accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/dde590c6ff232007852560df0065fddb?OpenDocument |title=East Jerusalem: UNSC Res. 478 |year=1980 |publisher=UN |accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Court of Justice]], principal judicial organ of the United Nations, asserted, in its [[International law and the ArabâIsraeli conflict#Ruling of the ICJ|2004 advisory opinion]] on the legality of the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Arabs will ask UN to seek razing of Israeli wall |publisher=MSNBC |date=9 July 2004 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5400559/ |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult hurdle in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians, as Israel views it as its sovereign territory, as well as part of its capital. Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]], which emphasises &quot;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war&quot;, and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states, a principle known as &quot;[[Land for peace]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Olmert: Willing to trade land for peace |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date =16 December 2006 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3340641,00.html |accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Syria ready to discuss land for peace |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=12 June 2007 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181570258086&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071121060510/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181570258086&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archivedate=21 November 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Egypt: Israel must accept the land-for-peace formula |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=15 May 2007 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1173879095966 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080501231415/http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1173879095966 |archivedate=1 May 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1948, following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine. Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since [[Israel-Jordan peace treaty#cite note-0|ceded]] its claim to the territory to the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]. The West Bank was occupied by Israel in 1967.

The [[Gaza Strip]] was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967]] and then by Israel after 1967.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Israel}}

Israel has two official languages, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken by the majority of the population, and Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority. Many Israelis communicate reasonably well in English, as many television programs are broadcast in this language and English is taught from the early grades in elementary school. As a country of [[aliyah|immigrants]], many languages can be heard on the streets. Due to mass immigration from the former Soviet Union and [[Aliyah from Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] (some 120,000 [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] live in Israel),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLG256423 Israel may admit 3,000 Ethiopia migrants if Jews].

Israel and the [[Palestinian territories]] comprise the major part of the [[Holy Land]], a region of significant importances to all [[Abrahamic religions]] â Jews, Christians, Muslims and [[Baha'is]].

The religious affiliation of [[Israeli Jews]] varies widely: A Social Survey for those over the age of 20 indicates that 55% say they are &quot;traditional&quot;, while 20% consider themselves &quot;secular Jews&quot;, 17% define themselves as &quot;[[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]]&quot;; 8% define themselves as &quot;[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/relinisr-consensus.htm |title=Religion in Israel: A Consensus for Jewish Tradition |last=Elazar |first=Daniel J. |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |accessdate=6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 5% of Israel's population in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0709/The-other-Israeli-conflict-with-itself The other Israeli conflict: with itself]&quot;, CSMonitor.com, 9 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the ultra-Orthodox, or Haredim, are expected to represent more than one-fifth of Israel's Jewish population in 2028.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/at-the-edge-of-the-abyss-1.3538 At the edge of the abyss]&quot;, Haaretz.com, 24 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Making up 16% of the population, Muslims constitute Israel's largest religious minority. About 2% of the population are Christian and 1.5% are [[Druze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton56/st02_01.pdf |title=Population, by religion and population group |accessdate=6 August 2007 |first=Government of Israel |last=Central Bureau of Statistics |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian population primarily comprises [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Arab Christians]], but also includes post-Soviet immigrants and the Foreign Labourers of multi-national origins and followers of [[Messianic Judaism]], considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity.&lt;ref name=bassok&gt;{{Citation| last = Bassok| first = Moti| title = Israel's Christian population numbers 148, 000 as of Christmas Eve| work=Haaretz| accessdate =29 July 2008| date = 25 December 2006| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/805277.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of many other religious groups, including [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Hindu]]s, maintain a presence in Israel, albeit in small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton53/st_eng02.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Population Estimates |accessdate=6 August 2007 |page=27 |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Jerusalem]] is of special importance to Jews, Muslims and Christians as it is the home of sites that are pivotal to their religious beliefs, such as the Israeli-controlled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] that incorporates the [[Western Wall]] and the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Jerusalem: its sanctity and centrality to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |last=Levine |first=Lee I. |year=1999 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0826410245 |page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other locations of religious importance in Israel are [[Nazareth]] (holy in Christianity as the site of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]), [[Tiberias]] and [[Safed]] (two of the [[Four Holy Cities]] in Judaism), the [[White Mosque (Ramla)|White Mosque]] in [[Ramla]] (holy in Islam as the shrine of the prophet [[Saleh]]), and the [[Church of Saint George, Lod|Church of Saint George]] in [[Lod]] (holy in Christianity and Islam as the tomb of [[Saint George]] or [[Al Khidr]]).

A number of other religious landmarks are located in the [[West Bank]], among them [[Joseph's tomb]] in [[Shechem]], the [[Church of the Nativity|birthplace of Jesus]] and [[Rachel's Tomb]] in [[Bethlehem]], and the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]].

The administrative center of the [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith]] and the [[Shrine of the BÃ¡b]] are located at the [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ World Centre]] in [[Haifa]] and the leader of the faith is buried in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Apart from maintenance staff, there is no BahÃ¡'Ã­ community in Israel, although it is a destination for [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ pilgrimage|pilgrimages]].

===Literature===

{{Main|Israeli literature}}
[[File:Agnon.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] was one of the central figures of modern Hebrew fiction, he won the 1966 [[Nobel prize in literature]]]]
[[Israeli literature]] is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew, as part of the renaissance of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as a spoken language since the mid-19th century, although a small body of literature is published in other languages, such as English. By law, two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://jnul.huji.ac.il/eng/lgd.html |publisher=Jewish National and University Library |title=Depositing Books to The Jewish National &amp; University Library |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 85&amp;nbsp;percent of the 8,000 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://jnul.huji.ac.il/eng/lgd-statistics-2007.html |publisher=Jewish National and University Library |accessdate=12 August 2007 |title=Israeli Book Statistics for 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Book Week]] ([[Hebrew language|He:]] {{Hebrew|×©×××¢ ××¡×¤×¨}}) is held each June and features book fairs, public readings, and appearances by Israeli authors around the country. During the week, Israel's top literary award, the [[Sapir Prize]], is presented.

In 1966, [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] with German Jewish author [[Nelly Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1966/index.html |publisher=Nobel Foundation |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1966 |accessdate=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading Israeli poets have been [[Yehuda Amichai]], [[Nathan Alterman]] and [[Rachel Bluwstein]]. Internationally famous contemporary Israeli novelists include [[Amos Oz]] and [[David Grossman]].

Israel has also been the home of two leading Palestinian poets and writers: [[Emile Habibi]], whose novel ''The Secret Life of Saeed the Pessoptimist'', and other writings, won him the Israel prize for Arabic literature; and [[Mahmoud Darwish]], considered by many to be &quot;the Palestinian national poet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7551918.stm BBC News] 9 August 2008 ''Palestinian 'national poet' dies''&lt;/ref&gt; Darwish was born and raised in northern Israel, but lived his adult life abroad after joining the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].

Modern dance in Israel is a flourishing field, and several Israeli choreographers such as [[Ohad Naharin]], Rami Beer, [[Barak Marshall]] and many others, are considered to be among the most versatile and original international creators working today. Famous Israeli companies include the [[Batsheva Dance Company]] and the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company.

Israel is home to many Palestinian musicians, including internationally acclaimed [[oud]] and violin virtuoso Taiseer Elias, singer [[Amal Murkus]], and brothers Samir and [[Wissam Joubran]].  Israeli Arab musicians have achieved fame beyond Israel's borders: Elias and Murkus frequently play to audiences in Europe and America, and oud player Darwish Darwish (Prof. Elias's student) was awarded first prize in the all-Arab oud contest in Egypt in 2003. The [[Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance]] has an advanced degree program, headed by Taiseer Elias, in Arabic music.

===Cinema and theatre===

[[File:Diamond Theatre.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Diamond Theatre.]]
Nine Israeli films have been final nominees for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[Academy Award]]s since the establishment of Israel. The 2009 movie ''[[Ajami (film)|Ajami]]'' was the third consecutive nomination of an Israeli film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=âAjamiâ nominated for Oscar |first=Hannah |last=Brown |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=2 February 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Entertainment/Article.aspx?id=167582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing the strong [[Yiddish theatre|theatrical traditions]] of the Yiddish theater in Eastern Europe, Israel maintains a vibrant theatre scene. Founded in 1918, [[Habima Theatre]] in Tel Aviv is Israel's oldest [[repertory]] theater company and national theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} {{Citation |url=http://www.habima.co.il/ |title=××ª××××¨×× ×××××× ××××× |publisher=Habima National Theatre |accessdate=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian Israeli filmmakers have made a number of films, some of them very controversial, dealing with the Arab-Israel conflict and the status of Palestinians within Israel. [[Mohammed Bakri]]'s 2002 film [[Jenin, Jenin]], about an Israeli military action in the West Bank town of Jenin, won the Best Film award at the Carthage International film festival, but was widely criticized within Israel for distorting the story of the battle. [[Ajami]], a 2009 film about violence and discrimination in a mixed Jewish-Arab neighborhood in south Tel Aviv-Jaffa, was written and directed jointly by Palestinain Scandar Copti and Jewish Israeli Yaron Shani. It won an honorable mention in the Cannes Film Festival. [[The Syrian Bride]], about a Druze wedding between families on opposite sides of the Israel-Syrian ceasefire line in the Golan Heights, was directed by a Jewish Israeli (Eran Riklis), but had an almost completely Druze cast.

Sports and physical fitness have not always been paramount in Jewish culture. Athletic prowess, which was prized by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], was looked down upon as an unwelcome intrusion of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] values. This changed in the 19th century from the physical culture campaign of [[Max Nordau]], and in the early 20th century when the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], declared that &quot;the body serves the soul, and only a healthy body can ensure a healthy soul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/sports.html |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=13 August 2007 |title=Sports in Israel |month=June |year=1999 |last=Griver |first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli [[cuisine]] comprises local dishes and [[Immigrant cuisine|dishes brought to the country]] by Jewish immigrants from around the world. Since the establishment of the State in 1948, and particularly since the late 1970s, an Israeli [[fusion cuisine]] has developed.

Israeli cuisine has adopted, and continues to adapt, elements of various styles of the [[Jewish cuisine]], particularly the [[Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]], [[Cuisine of the Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]], and [[Ashkenazi cuisine|Ashkenazi]] styles of cooking, along with [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan Jewish]], [[Iraqi Jews|Iraqi Jewish]], [[Ethiopian Jewish]], [[Indian Jewish]], [[Iranian Jews|Iranian Jewish]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemeni Jewish]] influences. It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in the [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine]]s, as [[falafel]], [[hummus]], [[shakshouka]], [[couscous]], and [[za'atar]] have become essential dishes in Israel.

|{{note|capital-disp}}The [[Jerusalem Law]] states that &quot;Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel&quot; and the city serves as the seat of the government, home to the President's residence, government offices, supreme court, and [[Knesset|parliament]]. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] (20 Aug. 1980; 14â0, U.S. abstaining) declared the Jerusalem Law &quot;null and void&quot; and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem. The United Nations and all member nations refuse to accept the Jerusalem Law (see {{harvnb|Kellerman|1993|p=140}}) and maintain their embassies in other cities such as Tel Aviv, [[Ramat Gan]], and [[Herzliya]]&lt;small&gt; (see the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html CIA Factbook] and [http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/israel.pdf Map of Israel])&lt;/small&gt;. The U.S. Congress subsequently adopted the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which said that the U.S. embassy should be relocated to Jerusalem and that it should be recognized as the capital of Israel. However, the US Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the act &quot;invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional&quot;. Since passage of the act, all Presidents serving in office have determined that moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. The [[Palestinian Authority]] sees [[East Jerusalem]] as the capital of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|future Palestinian state]]. The city's final status awaits future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (see [http://web.archive.org/web/20060514191731/http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/IPPP/Fall97Report/negotiating_jerusalem.htm &quot;Negotiating Jerusalem&quot;, University of Maryland]).
