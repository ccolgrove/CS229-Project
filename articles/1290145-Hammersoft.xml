'''Microsoft Office XP''' is a [[office suite|productivity suite]] written and distributed by [[Microsoft]] for their [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system. Released on March 5, 2001, it is the successor to [[Office 2000]] and the predecessor to [[Microsoft Office 2003|Office 2003]], and was known as '''Office 10''' in the early stages of its development cycle.  Despite the &quot;XP&quot; branding, Office XP does not require Windows XP or higher; rather, &quot;XP&quot; was a marketing term for its era.

The '''[[Office Assistant]]''', included in Microsoft Office 97 and subsequent versions until [[Office 2007]], is disabled by default in Office XP. A key element of Microsoft's advertising campaign for Office XP was the removal of Clippit (Clippy) and other [[Office assistant]]s.

==Overview==
Office XP was [[Release to Manufacturing|released to manufacturing]] (RTM) on March 5, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2001/Mar01/03-05SupportPR.mspx Microsoft press release March 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; It has received three service packs during its lifetime. Mainstream support for Office XP ended on July 11, 2006 and extended support ended on July 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifean21 Office XP support ends]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming conventions===
Microsoft Office XP was released in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], although the latter was not launched until October of the same year.  Despite their naming similarities, Office XP is compatible not only with Windows XP, but also with [[Windows NT 4.0]] (Service Pack 6a), [[Windows 98]], [[Windows 98 SE]], [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows Me]], [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]. It is not compatible with [[Windows 95]] as Office 2000 is the last supported version.

It is also the last version with support for [[Windows 98]], [[Windows 98 SE]], [[Windows Me]], and [[Windows NT 4.0]].

The individual components within Office XP are assigned the &quot;2002&quot; suffix rather than &quot;XP,&quot; e.g., [[Microsoft Word 2002|Word 2002]] and [[Microsoft Excel 2002|Excel 2002]].

==Features==
Microsoft Office XP, released in 2001, is a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes.
*'''[[Safe Mode]]''': This feature allows applications such as [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] to start when they might otherwise fail. Safe Mode enables Office to detect and either repair or bypass the source of the problem, such as a corrupted [[Windows registry|registry]] or a misbehaving add-in.
*'''[[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]]''': New technology delivered with Office XP. Some smart tags operate based on user activity, such as helping with [[typing error]]s. These smart tags are supplied with the products, and are not programmable. For developers, though, there is the ability to create custom smart tags. In Office XP, custom smart tags could work only in [[Microsoft Word|Word]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]].
*'''[[Product Activation]]''': Office XP incorporates product activation technology to prevent [[software piracy]]. This feature is also implemented in Windows XP (and later versions of Windows and Office).
*'''[[Speech recognition|Speech]] and [[handwriting recognition]]''' are features new to Office XP, shared among all Office applications as well as Internet Explorer and Outlook Express.  The speech recognition feature encompasses two different functions, ''Dictation'' and ''Voice Command''. Dictation provides users the ability to dictate words that will be transcribed into typed text in an Office program, while Voice Command is used to invoke menu options and [[command (computing)|command]]s via [[voice]]. Handwriting recognition allows users to enter text by writing instead of typing.
*'''[[Text Services Framework]]''' support: Office XP, specifically, Word 2002 supports the [[Text Services Framework]] making it possible for services implemented using TSF to be used in Word. Office's speech recognition, handwriting recognition and tablet PC ink support and ink correction are such services.
*'''[[Clipboard]]''' functionality has been greatly improved. The clipboard now stores up to 24 items and is located in the task pane. The Clipboard task pane also displays a [[thumbnail]] view of a copied item, whether it consists of text, numbers, or a graphic.
*A major change to the Office XP application environment is the introduction of [[task pane]]s. A task pane is a multi-purpose windowpane that appears on the right side of the window of an Office application. A task pane is basically used to house a number of features that were formerly controlled using [[dialog box]]es, such as opening a new file or inserting [[clip art]] into an application document.
*Office XP sports a streamlined, flatter look compared to previous versions of [[Microsoft Office]]. It was designed to be used in combination with Windows Whistler's ''Watercolor'' theme, which was abandoned in favor of [[Luna (theme)|Luna]] when [[Windows XP]] was released.

==Components==
*[[Microsoft Word 2002|Word 2002]]
*[[Microsoft Excel 2002|Excel 2002]]
*[[Microsoft Outlook 2002|Outlook 2002]]
*[[Microsoft PowerPoint 2002|PowerPoint 2002]]
*[[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher 2002]]
*[[Microsoft Access 2002|Access 2002]]
*[[Microsoft Front Page|Front Page 2002]]
*[[Microsoft Project|Project 2002]]
*[[Microsoft Visio|Visio 2002]]

==Editions==
The component products were packaged together in various suites.  Some of these editions were available as retail packages in either ''full'' or ''upgrade'' versions, others as full [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] versions for inclusion with new PCs, and still others as volume license versions that required no [[product activation|activation]].  All editions provided the core components of Word, Excel, and Outlook, and all editions except the Small Business edition provided PowerPoint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/uk/press/content/presscentre/releases/2001/04/pr02562.mspx Microsoft press release 4 April 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
