'''Avira Operations GmbH &amp; Co. KG''' is a German [[antivirus software]] company. When founded, the company was called &quot;H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH&quot;. Its antivirus applications are based on the AntiVir scan engine also known as &quot;Luke Filewalker&quot; (referring to [[Luke Skywalker]]), first launched in 1988. For aesthetic reasons, the name was changed to Avira. Avira's engine has been licensed to [[Ashampoo]], [[Ad-Aware]], and [[Webroot Software|Webroot]] WebWasher.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Avira is one of the most widely used antivirus programs in the world, with 100 million users worldwide {{As of|2009|09|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avira.com/en/company/100_million_avira_users.html |title=In the Internet the world is just a village. Ours has a population of 100 million. |publisher=Avira.com |date=|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company supports the Auerbach Stiftung, a foundation created by the company's founder and CEO, Tjark Auerbach. It supports charitable, social, cultural, and science projects.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

&quot;Avira security software&quot; refers to a range of antivirus and [[Internet security]] software for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] [[computing platform]]s by Avira.

On October 17, 2008, a major update to the search engine was released, which increased scanning speed by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avira.com/en/press-details/nid/372/news/avira+speeds+up+its+virus+scanner&lt;/ref&gt;

Avira Operations periodically &quot;cleans out&quot; the virus definition files, by replacing specific signatures with generic ones, which results in a general increase in performance and scanning speed. A database clean-out was made on October 27, 2008, which caused problems to AntiVir Personal users when updating because of its large size (15 [[Megabyte|MB]]) and because of AntiVir Personal's slow servers. For that reason Avira added an additional 6 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of bandwidth{{Clarify|date=November 2011|reason=GB/second, or what?}} to the AntiVir Personal Servers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avira.com/en/press-details/nid/439/news/nvdf+update&lt;/ref&gt; and changed the updating process: Nowadays there are 32 smaller definition files which are updated regularly to avoid peaks in the download of updates.

==Products==

''Avira AntiVir Personal'' is for personal use only and free of charge. Like much antivirus software, it can run a scan to check disks for [[malware]], and can also run as a background process which checks every file opened or downloaded. It can detect and possibly remove some [[rootkit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;feature comparison&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Avira Products|url=http://www.avira.com/en/for-home|accessdate=28 October 2009|publisher=Avira GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; It updates its virus definitions over the [[Internet]], daily by default, also opening a window with an advertisement suggesting that the user purchase ''Avira AntiVir Premium'' or ''Avira Premium Security Suite''. Avira updated all its products to version 10.0 in March 2010.

Avira offers a rescue CD image which may be downloaded as an [[ISO file]] free of charge and used to write a [[Booting|bootable]] CD. The CD has its own [[Linux]]-based [[operating system]] so it does not depend on the host PC's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avira.com/en/support-download-avira-antivir-rescue-system Avira Rescue CD download (.ISO image)&lt;/ref&gt;; it can be used to clean an unbootable PC, and may be able to find malware which uses the host's operating system to hide (e.g., some [[rootkit]]s). The CD image contains the AntiVir program and the virus database current as of the time of download; it boots the machine into the AntiVir program, then scans for and removes malware, possibly also restoring normal boot and operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avira AntiVir Rescue System|url=http://www.avira.com/en/support-download-avira-antivir-rescue-system|accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Avira AntiVir Premium'' has several improvements over the free version, including:
* Email scanning (POP3 and SMTP)&lt;ref name=&quot;feature comparison&quot; /&gt;
* WebGuard to block access to malicious sites&lt;ref name=&quot;feature comparison&quot; /&gt;

''Avira AntiVir Premium Security Suite'' has some more improvements over both versions, including:
* Anti Spam for [[E-mail]]
* Firewall blocks [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]]
* Backup System to protect and secure important data&lt;ref name=&quot;feature comparison&quot; /&gt;
* AntiBot prevents dangerous [[botnet]]s from taking over your system&lt;ref name=&quot;feature comparison&quot; /&gt;
* Parental Controls blocks unsuitable websites for Children and Teens&lt;ref name=&quot;feature comparison&quot; /&gt;

No antivirus software can detect all malware, particularly new versions; known viruses can be detected by characteristic file or memory content, and programs capable of carrying out suspicious but sometimes legitimate activities such as finding passwords or terminating processes can be flagged for attention.

==Reviews==
AV-Comparatives awarded Avira AntiVir Premium with the highest score, the &quot;Advanced+&quot; distinction, in February, May, and August 2008, earning it the 2008 &quot;AV Product of the Year&quot; award. This large-scale comparative test saw Avira achieve an &quot;excellent&quot; score for its proactive detection performance. In the &quot;Speed&quot; category, Avira made it to the winnerâs podium. In the &quot;Summary Report 2010&quot; it received the Silver award for 99.5% detection rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Report 2010|url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/images/stories/test/summary/summary2010.pdf|publisher=av-comparatives.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Avira AntiVir was given a rating of 6.5 out of 8 in tests for detection and removal of rootkits and 71% for proactive virus detection by Anti-Malware Test Lab; both scores qualified for &quot;gold&quot; status, the highest award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-malware-test.com/ |title=Anti-Malware Test Lab |publisher=Anti-malware-test.com |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avira achieved the highest Malware Detection rate, along with G-DATA Antivirus, 98%, and was one of five products that achieved a 90% or higher spyware detection rate in the latest AV-Test performed in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virusbtn.com/news/2008/09_02 &quot;AV-Test release latest results&quot;] (2 September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; AV-Comparatives also awarded Avira with an Advanced+ rating (the highest) in their latest test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=152/ |title=AntiVirus Programs Test |publisher=Av-comparatives.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avira had the highest signature and proactive detection rates in all major independent antivirus tests.{{When|date=November 2009}} In April 2009, ''[[PC Pro]]'' awarded Avira Premium Security Suite 9 six out of six stars and a place on its A-list for Internet security software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/251831/avira-premium-security-suite-9 &quot;Avira Premium Security Suite 9 review&quot;] at ''[[PC Pro]]'' (27 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Avira AntiVir Personal Antivirus achieved a 98.9% percent overall malware detection rate, and was the fastest for both on-demand scans and on-access scans conducted by ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'', who ranked it first on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/product/290836/review/antivir_personal.html &quot;Avira AntiVir Personal&quot;] by Erik Larkin, ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' (24 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Neil J. Rubenking from ''[[PC Magazine]]'' gave the latest version of Avira (version 10) 3.5 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2361868,00.asp &quot;Avira AntiVir Personal 10&quot;] by Neil J. Rubenking, ''[[PC Magazine]]'' (26 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Avira was among the first companies to receive [[OESIS OK]] Gold Certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avira.com/en/company/awards.html |title=Awards for Avira products |publisher=Avira.com |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that both the antispyware and antivirus components of several of their products have achieved the maximum compatibility score with widespread network technologies (like [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] [[Virtual private network|VPN]] and [[Network Access Control]]) from [[Juniper Networks]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[SonicWALL]] and others.

Avira has also received VB100 awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/results?vendor=VE37 |title=Virus Bulletin: VB100 results â Avira |publisher=Virusbtn.com |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}} (free registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent in April 2011 (Avira AntiVir Personal).

==Rogue software (with similar name)==
In July 2010, a [[Rogue security software|rogue security program]] called &quot;Antivir Solution Pro&quot; was reported as a threat; it is probably from the family known as [[AV Security Suite]]. This software had nothing to do with nor had any affiliation with Avira, but used a similar name to Avira's software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-antivir-solution-pro &quot;Antivir Solution Pro Information and Removal&quot;] (September 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ask.com toolbar controversy==
During summer 2011, Avira added to an update of their freeware AntiVir Personal the [[Ask.com#Ask Toolbar_browser add-on controversy|ask.com]] toolbar, often considered to be malware or spyware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghacks.net/2011/06/29/beware-avira-partners-with-ask-and-uniblue/] (August 31, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
