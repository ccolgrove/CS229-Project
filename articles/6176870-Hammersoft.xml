'''''Who Knows?''''' is the first live [[Andrew W.K.]] [[DVD]], released on February 7, 2006.
The DVD contains 16 live songs, various strange clips, and bonus footage. There is some confusion over the DVD. Three covers exist. One has a blue tint, and says &quot;Live 1992-2004&quot;. Another has the same blue tint, though darker, and says &quot;Live Footage 1992-2004&quot;. The last cover says &quot;Live 2000-2004&quot;, and has a reddish tint to it. Only the 2000-2004 version has been actually found, and is considered the &quot;official&quot; cover of the DVD cover, while the other covers might have been created for shock value, or could have possibly been working covers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The DVD was made using a state-of-the-art process called sync-stacking, in which many video and audio clips of many  different concerts can be spliced together into one video without losing the flow of the song, and without sounding different.

Five screenings of the DVD were presented in New York City and Hollywood, in February and April, [[2006]] by Andrew. His father presented a screening of the movie in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]] at the [[University of Michigan Law School]]. Although Andrew's father, law professor [[James E. Krier]] was said to be the host of the event, Andrew was present at the screening also.

On January 27, 2007 the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] radio station, EemLandRTV.nl, played the whole movie's audio, as well as other A.W.K tracks.
