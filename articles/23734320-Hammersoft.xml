== Bomb Scare ==
On Friday, April 23, 2010, the school had a bomb scare. Four juveniles entered the school property around 2 am and vandalized the exterior of the school with spray paint.

The suspects left obscene messages including drawings of genitalia, vulgar insults, and racist messages. A student had left a car overnight, which was vandalized and had smashed windows.

Upon arrival to school students were greeted by these images. Word spread of a bomb threat spray painted in several spots. It warned of a 10:45 bomb. Subsequently hundreds of students left the building by either being picked up by parents or leaving on their own accord (albeit without school consent). However, the school officials made no acknowledgment of the bomb threat. A couple hundred students remained in the school at 10:45. No bomb ever did go off, and none was ever found.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsatlanta.com/news/23247318/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hometowntimes.com/cumminghome/news50000/news/vandalism-and-bomb-threat-at-west-forsyth-high-sch~email.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wsbradio.com/localnews/2010/04/school-vandalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;
