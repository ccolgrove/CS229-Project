'''WBIN-TV''' is an [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] licensed to [[Derry, New Hampshire]] and serving the [[Boston]] market. Its transmitter is located on Merrill Hill in [[Hudson, New Hampshire]]. Owned by Carlisle One Media, the station has studios on A Street in Derry. Additional offices are located on the 51st floor of the [[John Hancock Tower]] in downtown Boston.

[[Television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on the station includes: ''[[Family Feud]]'', ''[[Better (TV series)|Better]]'', ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'', ''[[Judge Karen|Judge Karen's Court]]'', ''[[Judge Mathis]]'', ''[[The People's Court]]'', and ''[[Cheaters]]''. WBIN can generally be seen on [[Comcast]] cable channel 18 (outside of downtown Boston) and [[Verizon FiOS]] cable channel 6 (506 in HD). It is offered on cable systems throughout New Hampshire, southern [[Vermont]] and southern [[Maine]], as well as on [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] within the Boston market.

==History==
===WXPO===
{{main|WXPO-TV}}
Channel 50 first appeared early in October 1969 as [[WXPO-TV]], from two studios.  Its offices and master production facilities were located on Dutton Street in downtown [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]; however, its transmitter and &quot;main&quot; studio was on Governor Dinsmore Road in [[Windham, New Hampshire]] to comply with [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations requiring that a station's transmitter be located within 15 miles of the city of license. 

However, the station's coverage in many parts of [[Greater Boston]] was spotty at best.  The station's Lowell studios were located less than 1,000 feet from the transmitter of [[WLLH]], making high-quality production impossible during the day due to [[Electromagnetic interference|RF interference]] with the cameras.  Advertisers were scared off when the ''[[Lowell Sun]]'' blacklisted anyone who advertised on the station.  Bills went unpaid for several months.

By early 1970, the vast majority (90%) of the staff was removed from the payroll, although many continued with the station, believing it could pull through. The Lowell studio was closed that spring; finally, in June the power company pulled the plug at the Windham studios during a ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' rerun, taking WXPO off the air.

On July 17, 1973, channel 50 returned to the air with a test transmission, with plans to return the station to the air later that year, possibly as New Hampshire's [[CBS]] affiliate. Those plans were never realized, and the WXPO-TV license was deleted in 1975.

===WNDS===
[[Image:Wnds04.png|thumb|right|The final WNDS logo, used from circa 2004 until September 26, 2005. It is a modified version of a logo that was introduced in 1998.]]
The current iteration of channel 50 began broadcasting on September 5, 1983&lt;ref name=by1995&gt;{{cite book|title=Broadcasting &amp; Cable Yearbook 1999|year=1999|page=B-51|url=http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive-BC-YB/1999/B-TV-BC-YB-1999..pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''WNDS''', an [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] known on-air as &quot;The Winds of New England.&quot; It was owned by CTV of Derry, a company not related to the [[CTV Television Network]] in [[Canada]]. The station acquired some of the assets of [[WNHT (TV)|WNHT]] (channel 21, now occupied by [[WBPX-TV|WPXG-TV]]) in 1989 after that station's closure on March 31; the deal did not include the channel 21 license or WNHT's CBS affiliation.&lt;ref name=b-wndswnht&gt;{{cite news|title=WNHT(TV) Concord, N.H. goes off the air|url=http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive-BC-IDX/89-OCR/BC-1989-04-10-Page-0073.pdf|page=73|accessdate=June 30, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting|date=April 10, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1997, CTV of Derry attempted to sell the station to the Global Shopping Network (GSN). That network operated channel 50 from April to June with a [[home shopping]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-970410.html | title = North East RadioWatch | date = April 10, 1997 | last = Fybush | first = Scott | authorlink = Scott Fybush | publisher = The Boston Radio Archives | accessdate = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, GSN soon ran into financial problems;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-970605.html | title = North East RadioWatch | date = June 15, 1997 | last = Fybush | first = Scott | publisher = The Boston Radio Archives | accessdate = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after it missed a payment for the station, CTV of Derry canceled the sale and reverted WNDS to its previous general entertainment programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-970612.html | title = North East RadioWatch | date = June 12, 1997 | last = Fybush | first = Scott | publisher = The Boston Radio Archives | accessdate = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, CTV sold channel 50 again, this time to Shooting Star Broadcasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;nerw-ssbuy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2004/040517/nerw.html|title=Remembering Nick Berg|last=Fybush|first=Scott|date=May 17, 2004|work=NorthEast Radio Watch|accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WZMY===
Soon after assuming control, in August 2005, Shooting Star Broadcasting announced that WNDS would change its [[call letters]] to WZMY-TV and its branding to ''&quot;My TV&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050805/BUSINESS/108050017/-1/ENTERTAINMENT | title = WNDS focuses lens on viewers | last = Kennedy | first = Eileen | work = [[Nashua Telegraph]] | publisher = Telegraph Publishing Company | date = August 5, 2005 | accessdate = January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the station overhauled its schedule, based on viewer responses on the old WNDS website.  The changes were implemented on-air on September 26, 2005.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-mytvlaunch&gt;{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|title='My TV' Launches In Boston|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/158319-_My_TV_Launches_In_Boston.php|accessdate=June 29, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=September 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Network affiliation====
[[Image:WZMYMNTV.PNG|thumb|150px|left|WZMY's first logo as a MyNetworkTV affiliate (its second as &quot;My TV&quot;), used from September 5, 2006 through May 26, 2011.]]
On February 22, 2006, [[News Corporation]] announced that it would start up a new network called [[MyNetworkTV]], in response to the merger of [[UPN]] and [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] to form [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]. Since WZMY had already filed a trademark in mid-2005 for use of the MyTV name, it was speculated that WZMY would take legal action with News Corporation over its similar name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://business.bostonherald.com/businessNews/view.bg?articleid=127585 |title=TV show: Whose station is it?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately on July 21, 2006, WZMY's ''My TV Club'' newsletter announced that the station would become the region's MyNetworkTV affiliate, later revealed on July 24 to the media and visitors to WZMY's website, and to the general public on July 26.  Until the announcements were made, Boston and Southern New Hampshire had been the largest market without a stand-alone MyNetworkTV affiliate.

MyNetworkTV is the first television network that channel 50 has ever affiliated with in its history.  With network affiliation beginning with the network's launch (which happened on September 5, 2006), the station continued to use its &quot;My TV&quot; branding, though the logo was changed to reflect the MyNetworkTV logo (a different logo had been in use in the year following the 2005 relaunch).

In December 2009, the station laid off seven employees as part of strategy change to streamline operations and change some of the programming options to be more hyper local. Operation of WZMY was taken over by New Age Media, LLC, making it a sister station to [[WPXT]] and [[WPME]] in [[Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvnewscheck.com/articles/2010/01/11/daily.15/&lt;/ref&gt; The station added a [[digital subchannel]] affiliated with [[Universal Sports]] in June 2010.&lt;ref name=mn-wzmyunivsports&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Mike|title=Universal Sports Sets June Launch In Boston On WZMY-TV|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/452488-Universal_Sports_Sets_June_Launch_In_Boston_On_WZMY_TV.php|accessdate=September 12, 2011|newspaper=[[Multichannel News]]|date=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===WBIN===
On March 3, 2011, [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]-based Carlisle One Media, Inc., a company controlled by [[Bill Binnie]], announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase WZMY-TV.&lt;ref name=tvnc-saletobinnie&gt;[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/03/04/49565/exsenate-candidate-buying-wzmy-boston Ex-Senate Candidate Buying WZMY Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;  The sale was completed on May 17;&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-carlisle1buycomplete&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=WZMY Sells for $9.25M|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/468458-WZMY_Sells_for_9_25M.php|accessdate=May 18, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ten days later, the call letters were changed to '''WBIN-TV'''.&lt;ref name=tvnc-saletobinnie/&gt;&lt;ref name=fcc-callsigns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=14682&amp;Callsign=WBIN-TV|title=Call Sign History|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also dropped the ''&quot;My TV New England&quot;'' branding (becoming one of a number of MyNetworkTV affiliates to not feature the programming service's branding), and now refers to itself using its call letters.  Binnie had indicated that the station would retain its affiliations with MyNetworkTV and Universal Sports;&lt;ref name=tvnc-saletobinnie/&gt; however, the station announced on June 15 that it would leave MyNetworkTV and revert to being independent as part of an increased local emphasis, with the service's programming moving to [[WSBK-TV]] on September 19,&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-wbinnomntv&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=Boston-Area MyNet WBIN Going Independent|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/469784-Boston_Area_MyNet_WBIN_Going_Independent.php?rssid=20065|accessdate=June 15, 2011|newspaper=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tvnc-wbinnomntv&gt;{{cite news|title=MNT Moving From WBIN To WSBK In Boston|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/06/15/51899/mnt-moving-from-wbin-to-wsbk-in-boston|accessdate=June 15, 2011|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-wsbkmntv&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=WSBK Boston Partners With MyNet|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/470021-WSBK_Boston_Partners_With_MyNet.php|accessdate=June 20, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Universal Sports will end its affiliations with its over-the-air affiliates (including WBIN) in January 2012 and become a cable and satellite channel.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-nounivsportsota&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=Universal Sports Spikes Over-the-Air Model|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/473670-Universal_Sports_Spikes_Over_the_Air_Model.php|accessdate=September 12, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the station added an additional subchannel, carrying [[TheCoolTV]], in October 2011.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-wbincooltv&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=WBIN Brings CoolTV Subchannel to Boston Region|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/475086-WBIN_Brings_CoolTV_Subchannel_to_Boston_Region.php|accessdate=October 13, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBIN will be the flagship of a group that will also include [[WYCN-LP]] (channel 13) in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] and several New Hampshire radio stations.&lt;ref name=tvnc-wbinplans&gt;{{cite news|last=Bednarski|first=P.J.|title=Binnie's WBIN Goal: Hyperlocal Powerhouse|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/07/11/52424/binnies-wbin-goal-hyperlocal-powerhouse|accessdate=July 13, 2011|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|date=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newscasts===
[[Image:Wzmy weather.JPG|thumb|right|WZMY's former Chief Meteorologist Al Kaprielian. Al is known all across New England for his unique personality and friendliness.]]

Soon after going on the air in the fall of 1983, WNDS began nightly newscasts at both 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM.  The news team included news anchor Larry Sparano, sportscaster [[Doug Brown (sportscaster)|Doug Brown]], and meteorologist [[Al Kaprielian]].  The weekend newscasts were cut in 1985, and the nightly newscasts were off the air by 1986.

On September 28, 1998, WNDS began the ''News Now'' local newscasts weeknights at 7 and 10 p.m.,&lt;ref name=nerw-newsnowstart&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=WNNZ Sold to Clear Channel|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-981001.html|accessdate=June 29, 2011|newspaper=North East RadioWatch|date=October 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as weekend afternoon newscasts (which were dropped by early 2002).  By 2003, the 11:57 a.m. weekday news update was expanded into a full half-hour newscast at noon.  Shortly after Shooting Star bought the station, the noon broadcast was discontinued, and the 10 p.m. edition was cut down to 10 minutes.&lt;ref name=nerw-10pm10min&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=K-Rock, WBBF Change Directions|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2005/050411/nerw.html|accessdate=June 30, 2011|newspaper=NorthEast Radio Watch|date=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the full newscasts, some news / weather updates as well as stand-alone weather updates from chief meteorologist Al Kaprielian were provided throughout the day.

When the station was relaunched as WZMY, the 10 p.m. newscast was dropped entirely; the early evening newscast was renamed ''MyTV Now'' and aired weeknights from 7:30 to 8 p.m. An additional 60-minute news and commentary program, ''MyTV Prime'', aired from 9 to 10 p.m.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-mytvlaunch /&gt; On March 10, 2006, however, the two programs were consolidated into a new, 90-minute version of ''MyTV Prime'' that aired from 8 to 9:30 p.m.  News was no longer provided outside of that program.  By July 2006, channel 50 had discontinued ''MyTV Prime'' in favor of sitcom [[rerun]]s.  Weather updates from Al Kaprielian were still provided each hour from noon to midnight; for a time, these were accompanied by news updates that used the ''MyTV Now'' title.

WZMY dissolved its news department completely (with the exception of weather) in November 2007, after Nicole Papageorge and Mike DeBlasi (the longest-tenured on-air employee after Al Kaprielian) departed the station. As a result, WZMY eliminated all daily news cut-ins, political commentary, and locally-produced public affairs programming.

Channel 50, as WNDS and WZMY, was well known in [[New England]] for Al Kaprielian. His quirky, offbeat style made him a minor celebrity in Southern New Hampshire.  As a result of his popularity, he was a &quot;Guest Meteorologist&quot; on [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]'s ''[[Abrams &amp; Bettes: Beyond the Forecast]]'' on November 10, 2006. He had worked for WNDS/WZMY for his whole career.  However, as a result of the station's December 2009 cutbacks, Al was laid off from the station, with his final day on-air December 31; as a result, the station no longer broadcast weather updates.&lt;ref name=&quot;cm-consolidationportland&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091228/FRONTPAGE/912280311&amp;template=single|title=The gale before the storm|last=Duckler|first=Ray|date=December 28, 2009|work=[[Concord Monitor]]|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bh-allaidoff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/media/view.bg?articleid=1219195&amp;srvc=business&amp;position=recent|title=Weathermanâs TV reign to end|last=Heslam|first=Jessica|date=December 16, 2009|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2011, WBIN-TV sponsored a [[Charlie Rose]]-moderated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States presidential election debate|presidential debate]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in association with [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=tvnc-wbinplans /&gt;&lt;ref name=ph-wbinplans&gt;{{cite news|last=McCord|first=Michael|title=WBIN: Businessman Binnie buys N.H. television station|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20110627-BIZ-106270302?cid=sitesearch|accessdate=June 29, 2011|newspaper=[[The Portsmouth Herald]]|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the sale to Carlisle One, the station announced plans to re-establish a local news department, including a bureau at Carlisle One's headquarters in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. Rival [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WMUR-TV]] also maintains a bureau in that city at Harbor Place. On September 29, 2011, WBIN debuted a new thirty minute weeknight broadcast. Known as ''The News at 10 on WBIN'', the show is produced in partnership with the [[Independent News Network]] (INN) of [[Davenport, Iowa]]. The news anchor and [[meteorologist]] are provided by the centralized news operation and other personnel from INN can fill-in as necessary. WBIN maintains two local reporters who contribute relevant Southern New Hampshire content. 

All of the broadcasts are recorded in advance (in high definition except for packaged reports and the weather forecast) and originate from INN's facility on Tremont Avenue in Davenport. There is no regularly-scheduled sports report. The station maintains additional partnerships with ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' (provides headlines through an on screen ticker) and Bloomberg. According to published reports, WBIN plans on further expanding its newscast offering although specific details are unknown at this time. It remains to be seen how much a dent in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] this station will make against longtime favorite and established outlet WMUR (owned by [[Hearst Television]]).&lt;ref name=tvnc-wbinplans /&gt;&lt;ref name=ph-wbinplans/&gt;&lt;ref name=nerw-newsat10debut&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=Nassau Stares Down Chapter 7|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2011/111003/nerw.html|accessdate=October 3, 2011|newspaper=NorthEast Radio Watch|date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nhbr-wbinnewsdebut&gt;{{cite news|last=Callahan|first=Kathleen|title=Newly launched WBIN-TV hopes to take a bite out of WMUR's market|url=http://www.nhbr.com/news/935099-395/newly-launched-wbin-tv-hopes-to-take-a.html|accessdate=October 7, 2011|newspaper=[[New Hampshire Business Review]]|date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other local programs===
During its first year on the air, WNDS ran an impressive number of locally produced programs, including a cooking show (''The Yankee Gourmet''), a children's show (''Just Kidding Around'') and a weekly prime-time variety show (''The Best of New Hampshire'').  All of these shows were cancelled by the end of 1985, which in the case of ''Just Kidding Around'', was largely due to one child in the audience during a live broadcast misquoting the title in a lewd manner.  The station also covered live local sports, including high school football, college hockey and minor league baseball.  WNDS also ran a [[candlepin bowling]] show each weekend at noon called ''Candlepin Stars and Strikes'', which aired from 1984&lt;ref name=bg-s&amp;sstart&gt;{{cite news|last=Vellante|first=John|title=Winds of change will affect WNDS|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8406275.html|accessdate=June 29, 2011|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=January 18, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; until August 2005.&lt;ref name=nerw-s&amp;send&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=NorthEast Radio Watch|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2005/050808/nerw.html|accessdate=June 30, 2011|date=August 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the switch to Global Shopping Network in April 1997, WNDS also ran three additional shows: ''High School Sports Review'' (which looked at high school sports news in the station's broadcast region), ''Sports Wrap'' (a [[Sports radio|Sports Talk]] show discussing Boston sports), and ''WNDS News Up Front'' (a local [[newsmagazine]]).  When regular programming was restored in June, these three shows were not resurrected.

In addition, during the early 2000s, channel 50 ran a public affairs program titled ''Capitol Ideas'' hosted by [[Deborah Arnie Arnesen|Arnie Arnesen]].

''Friday Night Chaos'', a 30-minute weekly show from independent wrestling promotion [[Chaotic Wrestling]], aired on WNDS from 2001 to 2002.  The station also aired a locally-produced talk show hosted by singer-comedian Bucky Lewis.

After the station became WZMY, much of its local programming consisted of visits to businesses around the region, in a format known as &quot;My Shows&quot;.  The original show for this format was ''My New England'',&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-mytvlaunch /&gt; but variants focusing on specific topics were subsequently added, such as ''My Premier Bride'' and ''My Good Health'' and ''My Home and Garden''.  Additionally, several local businesses (particularly car dealerships, but sometimes other businesses such as ''Dollar Bill's Discount World'') produce programs that appear on weekend mornings; those programs had also appeared on WNDS.  At the time of the relaunch, two other local programs also existed: a talk show entitled ''MyTV Prime''&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-mytvlaunch /&gt; (which originally aired from 9 to 10 p.m.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-mytvlaunch /&gt; and later from 8 to 9:30 p.m.), and ''Wild World'' (a review of [[action sports]] around the region, which was produced by Dan Egan).  However, the station has subsequently discontinued these shows from its lineup (although ''Wild World'' is still produced for other outlets).

In its later years as ''&quot;My TV&quot;'', the station adopted a &quot;Branded Entertainment&quot; model, focusing on local product placement.  Most of the station's local programming during this time, in addition to the remaining &quot;My Shows&quot;-formatted programs, have included 30-minute wrestling show from the Massachusetts-based &quot;Big Time Wrestling&quot; promotion (which aired on the station from May 1, 2009 until moving to [[WMFP]] in December 2010), ''Scorch's PFG-TV'' (a talk show hosted by [[WGIR-FM]] personality Scorch), ''The Chef's Plate'' (which showcases New Hampshire's top chefs creating their signature dishes), '[[Steve Katsos|'The Steve Katsos Show']]' (also aired on sister station [[WPME]] in Portland), ''Debra Crosby's Talent Quest TV Show'', ''Quiet Desperation'' (a reality comedy TV show based in [[Allston, Massachusetts]]), ''Inside the Revolution'' (a spotlight on the [[New England Revolution]]. ''AFO Proving Grounds'', ''Animation Nation'', ''Boston Ruit'', ''theGreenScreen.tv'', and ''AsianBoston TV''.  Many of these programs were produced in collaboration with independent production companies through what the station referred to as &quot;MyTV New England Studios.&quot;  Some of these programs continue to be shown on WBIN-TV, though ''Quiet Desperation'' was dropped following the sale to Carlisle One due to concerns over the program's content.&lt;ref name=bp-wbinnoquietd&gt;{{cite news|last=Faraone|first=Chris|title=Quiet D silenced?|url=http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/121530-quiet-d-silenced/|accessdate=June 29, 2011|newspaper=[[The Phoenix (newspaper){{!}}The Boston Phoenix]]|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station intends to offer increased coverage of high school, college, and professional sports;&lt;ref name=ph-wbinplans /&gt; this includes telecasts of [[New Hampshire Wildcats]] hockey and basketball (produced by the [[University of New Hampshire]] in association with Pack Network)&lt;ref name=nhul-wbinwildcats&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessels|first=Allen|title=Allen Lessels on College Hockey: Notre Dame will join Hockey East for 2013-14 season|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20111006/SPORTS/710069953|accessdate=October 6, 2011|newspaper=[[New Hampshire Union-Leader]]|date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merrimack Warriors men's ice hockey|Merrimack Warriors hockey]],&lt;ref name=nap-wbinmw&gt;{{cite news|title=Merrimack College and WBIN-TV Announce Hockey Broadcast Partnership|url=http://northandover.patch.com/articles/merrimack-college-and-wbin-tv-announce-hockey-broadcast-partnership|accessdate=October 9, 2011|newspaper=[[Patch Media{{!}}North Andover Patch]]|date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UMass Minutemen]].&lt;ref name=tbg-wbinumass&gt;{{cite news|last=Finn|first=Chad|title=Anik gets shot calling MMA|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2011/11/04/anik_takes_shot_with_mma_as_ufcs_play_by_play_man/?page=full|accessdate=November 5, 2011|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
