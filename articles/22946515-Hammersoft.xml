The '''GeForce 300 Series''' is a family of [[graphics processing unit]]s developed by [[Nvidia]]. The first card of this series was launched in November 2009. Similar to the GeForce 100 series, the GeForce 300 series consists of re-branded video cards from the previous generation available only for OEMs. With the exception of the GT 330&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_family.html NVIDIA GeForce Family]&lt;/ref&gt;, all GPUs of the series support Direct3D 10.1.

== History ==

On 27 November 2009, Nvidia released its first GeForce 300 series video card, the GeForce 310. However, this card is a re-brand of one of Nvidia's older models (the GeForce 210) and not based on the newer Fermi architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=21369&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 2 February 2010, Nvidia announced the official titles of the new generation GF100 (Fermi) cards, the GeForce GTX 470 and the GeForce GTX 480.&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomshardware.com/news/GeForce-GTX-470-480-Fermi,9572.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=7129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evga.com/forums/tm.aspx?&amp;m=179809&amp;mpage=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month the company announced the release of the GeForce GT 320, GT 330 and GT 340, available to [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]] only.&lt;ref name=&quot;softpedia&quot;&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/NVIDIA-Launches-GeForce-GT-340-GT-330-and-GT-320-135698.shtml NVIDIA Launches GeForce GT 340, GT 330 and GT 320] - Softpedia News, Feb 22nd 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Geforce GT 340 is simply a rebadged GT 240, sharing exactly the same specifications, while the GT 320 and 330 are new cards (albeit still based on the previous generation GT200b and G92b architecture).&lt;ref name=&quot;softpedia&quot;/&gt;
