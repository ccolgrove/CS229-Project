==Main characters==
[[File:ATHFmain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|From the left: [[#Carl Brutananadilewski|Carl Brutananadilewski]], [[#Master Shake|Master Shake]], [[#Meatwad|Meatwad]], and [[#Frylock|Frylock]].]]

===Master Shake===
{{main|Master Shake}}

Voiced by [[Dana Snyder]], Master Shake is a white-skinned milkshake who has a pink straw and yellow hands. He is often greedy, lazy, and cruel to everyone around him. When the Aqua Teens solved crimes, Shake claimed to be the leader.

===Frylock===
{{main|Frylock}}

Voiced by [[Carey Means]], Frylock is a floating box of French fries who has laser lenses, dental braces, and a beard. He is easily the show's smartest and straightest character. He is somewhat of a father figure to Meatwad and often saves Shake and Meatwad from danger.

===Meatwad===
{{main|Meatwad}}

Voiced by [[Dave Willis]], Meatwad is a large meatball with only one tooth. He is very childlike and naive. Frylock tries to be a good father figure to Meatwad, but Shake often tortures and pranks Meatwad, although in many episodes, Meatwad manipulates Shake into causing harm to himself and others. Often, Meatwad shows more intelligence than some of the characters, but for the most part remains childlike and immature.

===Carl Brutananadilewski===
{{main|Carl Brutananadilewski}}

Voiced by Dave Willis, Carl Brutananadilewski is the quick tempered, over weight, sarcastic, balding, moustachioed neighbor of the Aqua Teens. Carl loves everything about pornography, sports, his car, and sex. He hates it when the Aqua Teens are in his pool. Nevertheless, possibly because he doesn't appear to have any friends of his own, he'll occasionally socialize with them to an extent - particularly when they share a common goal, such as barbecuing or playing trivia games at a sports bar.

==Supporting==
===Dr. Weird===
Voiced by [[C. Martin Croker]], Dr. Weird is a [[mad scientist]] who lives in an abandoned [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] on the perpetually rainy [[Jersey Shore]] that shows up at the cold openings of the first two seasons. Dr. Weird did not appear on the show again until [[Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1 (season 8)|the eighth season]], but some episodes have a picture of him and Frylock in Frylock's room. The [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters|movie]] explains that it was Dr. Weird who created the Aqua Teens for the purpose of watching them crash into a brick wall, but this idea never became a reality. But in the end's twist, Dr. Weird was revealed to have been created by Frylock. Although, in 2010 during the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Live&quot;, series creator Dave Willis confirmed that Dr. Weird was indeed the creator of the Aqua Teens, making them brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8NuvQbsgNA Aqua Teen Hunger Force Q&amp;A at Aqua Teen Hunger Force Live in 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Weird's voice was heard in the &quot;[[Last Last One Forever and Ever]]&quot; episode, but he wasn't seen. Dr. Weird also has a non-speaking cameo in episode &quot;[[One Hundred (Aqua Teen Hunger Force)|One Hundred]]&quot;. Dr. Weird made his final appearance in the first episode to premiere under the ''Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1'' name, &quot;Allen Part 1&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned by series co-creator [[Matt Maiellaro]] in a [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumper]], which aired on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]], right before the original debut of &quot;Allen Part 1&quot; on May 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steve===
Steve, also voiced by C. Martin Croker, is Dr. Weird's assistant. [[Red hair]]ed, wearing a [[white coat|lab coat]] and science goggles, is normally pictured holding and staring at a [[test tube]]. Steve often becomes the victim of mishaps with Weird's experiments, many resulting in his death or some kind of negative reaction. He is clearly smarter than Dr. Weird, and he usually questions Weird's crazy actions. In the movie, it is revealed that he has a wife. Although Dr.  Weird made his final appearance in &quot;Allen Part 1&quot;, Steve can still be seen as a cashier wearing a red shirt in the intro used as of 2011.

===George Lowe===
George Lowe is a recurring character voiced by a [[George Lowe|voice actor with the same name]] who is best known for providing the voice of [[Space Ghost]] on ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''. George made his first appearance in &quot;Mail Order Bride&quot; as a wedding [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. In the majority of his appearances he appears as a cop, although in &quot;Antenna&quot; he appears as himself. He's also in &quot;Gee Whiz&quot; as a [[standards and practices]] spokesperson, in &quot;Eggball&quot; he appears as a [[pinball machine]] repair man named Gorge, in &quot;Dirtfoot&quot; he was a private detective named Bruno Sardine on a TV show, his voice is used for a gum commercial in &quot;The Marines&quot;, and in &quot;Juggalo&quot; he appears as a [[Lawyer]]. Lowe also makes a non-speaking cameo as himself, then later a cop in &quot;A PE Christmas&quot;. Lowe also had a brief cameo in the movie, as his most notable role, Space Ghost. On April 6, 2011 it was confirmed by Dave Willis via [[Twitter]], that George Lowe will appear in every episode from now on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.com/DaveWillis2/status/55840886390669313 Message from Dave Willis on Twitter] posted on April 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Allen Part 2&quot;, he appears once again as himself. He is revealed to have been a slum lord before Allen forced everyone to be good or face death by lightning, forcing Lowe to move into Carl's old house along with his mother. He is later killed by Allen after he criticizes Allen. As of season eight, he introduces the title for each episode.

==Recurring==
[[File:Recurring Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters.png|thumb|250px|right|From the left: [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future|Cybernetic Ghost]], [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Oglethorpe and Emory|Oglethorpe]], [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Oglethorpe and Emory|Emory]], [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Ignignokt and Err|Ignignokt]] (bottom), and [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Ignignokt and Err|Err]].]]

===Ignignokt &lt;small&gt;and&lt;/small&gt; Err===
Ignignokt, who is voiced by [[Dave Willis]], and Err, who is voiced by [[Matt Maiellaro]], are two-dimensional aliens from Earth's [[moon]], they are both the most popular and well-known Mooninites.  Ignignokt is the taller, calmer, green leader and Err is the shorter, quick-tempered, pink sidekick.  They have eyebrows that almost never move.  They often rob stores, spray graffiti, corrupt Meatwad, and annoy the Aqua Teens and Carl, justifying their actions by claiming that their society is highly advanced and does not need rules or manners. While they do possess &quot;advanced&quot; laser weaponry, it is flawed due to the bullet being very slow-moving. In the episode &quot;Mayhem of the Mooninites&quot;, one of the bullets hit Carl in his  back and it transported him to the moon, while in &quot;Remooned&quot;, it generated sparks when it hit Carl.  The Mooninites can also lock in by attaching at the top of their heads (with Ignignokt on top), upon which they can combine their four laser blasts into the &quot;Quad Laser&quot;, although it is even slower.  In this form, they can also duplicate their faces to take the appearance of a giant gun (with the real Mooninites forming the handle) and fire an incredibly large and slow bullet called the &quot;Quad Laser&quot;, though Err can only support the weight of their gun body for less than a minute before his legs break.  In their debut episode, &quot;Mayhem of the Mooninites&quot;, they also shown the ability to spin around while glowing and turn into the third dimension the appear invisible.  In &quot;The Last One&quot;, (which contains their only use of the Quad Laser so far) they led the evil team &quot;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday&quot; in an attempt to destroy the Aqua Teens. They are the main antagonists in six episodes of the show; however, in Spacecataz, they are one of the main protagnists. They also appear in the ''[[Spacecataz]]'' cold openings of [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 3)|season three]] and make an appearance in the movie. Light up devices displaying images of the characters caused the [[2007 Boston bomb scare]].

===Oglethorpe &lt;small&gt;and&lt;/small&gt; Emory===
Oglethorpe, who is voiced by [[Andy Merrill]], and Emory, who is voiced by [[Mike Schatz]], are two spiked aliens from [[Pluto]]. Oglethorpe is the fat, orange, dumber, leader (who resembles a slice of cheese) and Emory is the green, smarter one (who resembles a shred of lettuce); however, their Master Shake &quot;clone&quot;, Major Shake, states the obvious fact that &quot;they're [both] really stupid.&quot;  Oglethorpe speaks with an [[Austrian German]] accent and Emory speaks like a stereotypical [[Southern California]] American. Oglethorpe often comes up with crazy, mean-spirited schemes that do not make sense and Emory usually goes along with it. They are very advanced in teleportation and cloning technology. The episode &quot;The Last One&quot; shows that they are enemies of the Mooninites. They are the main antagonists in three episodes of the show; however, in Spacecataz, they are one of the main protagnists. They also appear in the ''Spacecataz'' cold openings of season three and they make brief appearances in the movie when they're with the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future come to Aqua Teens' house to steal the missing piece of the Insanoflex. The characters may be named for two [[Atlanta]]-area colleges: [[Oglethorpe University]] and [[Emory University]].

===MC Pee Pants===
Voiced by [[mc chris]], MC Pee Pants is a mentally insane rapper who wears a shower cap and a diaper. His various schemes begin with the release of a [[hip hop music|rap]] CD, which is continuously played by Meatwad, who is often his biggest fan. His schemes are unusually complicated and completely nonsensical. Inevitably, Frylock gets involved at some point, and he typically engineers the wannabee rap star's demise and return to Hell and subsequent reincarnation into a different form. In all of his forms, he is recognizable due to his voice, shower cap, large yellow and red eyes, and diaper. He was the main antagonist in three episodes and he also makes a brief appearance in ''The Last One'' episode and the movie. He has been a spider, cow, worm, old man (who later becomes a vampire), and housefly.

===Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future===
Voiced by [[Matt Maiellaro]], Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, is a crazy robot that starts long stories with &quot;thousands of years ago...&quot; He thinks he knows everything about the past and future, but the movie revealed he just randomly strings words together to make up stories that never happened and never will. He was the main antagonist in one episode and makes a brief appearance in three others and the movie when he teams up with the Plutonians, he is shown to be attracted to Oglethorpe, much to their embarrassment. The episode called &quot;The Dressing&quot; has a character similar to the Cybernetic Ghost called Turkatron. He appears briefly at the end of the episode &quot;Larry Miller Hair System&quot;, speaking to an army of robots (who resemble the robots seen in the opening theme).

===Dr. Wongburger===
Voiced by [[Tommy Blacha]], Dr. Wongburger is an insane alien scientist. He appears in the episodes &quot;Dickesode&quot;, &quot;Creature from Plaque Lagoon&quot;, and &quot;Hands on a Hamburger&quot;. In his first appearance, he was a penis and the owner of Wong Burger, seeking out penises, including Carl's. At his restaurant, Wong Burger, Carl ripped off the bottom of his medium drink to reveal his prize when it only said &quot;tonight you will get your dick ripped off&quot;. Wongburger states that from this purchase that Carl has automatically signed a binding contract that enables them to rip off his dick. He was last seen in that episode being sued and he tried to escape in his dick spaceship but crashed into a building that was also made of dicks. In his next appearance, he was a tooth who took the form and the credit card of the Creature from Plaque Lagoon to get lots of teeth, and in his last appearance, he was a hamburger who was being touched by people who wanted to eat him (they did not know he was alive). Every time he appears on the show he attempts to visit the homeplanet of his species and Frylock calls him a madman (except for Hands on a Hamburger). The second time he was called a madman he said &quot;I know that&quot;. His latest appearance was a non-speaking cameo role in &quot;One Hundred,&quot; where he appeared as his original penile form in Hannah-Barbara-like animation.

* '''Drewbacca''' ([[Scott Adsit]]) - A [[wookiee]] who pretended to be a [[werewolf]]. He offered to cut the Aqua Teens' lawn if they helped him blow up the moon, but he ended up annoying Frylock very much. At one point in the episode Drebacca turned into a werewolf (though this is later revealed to just be his Wookiee hair growing back), and killed Carl. He is later revealed to be a shaved Wookiee (and a fan of Star Trek) who plays in a [[Star Trek]] tribute band (which was revealed by Frylock). Drewbacca's only appearance on the show was &quot;2-And-A-Half Star Wars Out of Five&quot;.&lt;ref name=PinkMan&gt;{{Cite episode |title=2-And-a-Half-Star Wars Out of Five |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force  |network=Adult Swim |airdate=May 10, 2009 |season=6 |number=7 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Freedom Cobra''' - A living tattoo of a cobra, Shake got to pick up chicks. It was the tattoo artist cheapest tattoo and had to be &quot;''installed''&quot; during a lightning storm. It gives its wearer an appetite for human flesh. At first Shake managed to convince him to start off with Meatwad's dog Bobby (which was originally Shake's dog before it started attack him in response to his abuse), but later ending up eating Carl, after Freedom Cobra suggested they eat Meatwad (who Shake didn't want to eat out of fear of getting into trouble). Shake later told Frylock and Meatwad the truth after Frylock discovered Carl's hand. They took Shake to the doctor to get the tattoo surgically removed, but Freedom Cobra forced the doctor to cut off his hands so he and Shake could eat them. He also had the doctor give Shake plastic surgery apparently so no one can tell Shake's sad, after he's done eating them. It appears in the episode &quot;''Freedom Cobra''&quot;. In &quot;Lasagna&quot; it is revealed he is also Carl's doctor (or is simply a local doctor that both Carl &amp; the Aqua Teens go to). In the episode he reveals Carl that all his bones have fused into a single &quot;''superbone''&quot; and that his condition is the result of his consuming a &quot;''bone-restoring milkshake''&quot; (which Catl got from a guy he befriended in anger management, after he pushed Carl off the roof of Carl's  causing Carl to break every bone in his body) made by &quot;''ScamWow''&quot;. He tells Carl that the milkshake is not medicine but in his typical fashion Carl dismisses him (thinking he knows better). Despite telling Carl not drink the milkshake, the doctor is later seen drinking it (after Carl falls out the hospital window trying to get some of Master Shake's lasagna) and yells to Carl that his milkshake tastes great (and just like his reation to his hands being cut off in &quot;''Freedom Cobra''&quot;, he is unfazed that his patients fall out the hospital's window (however it is possible that his reaction could be due to having possibly treated Carl in the past for his various injures he has received living next to the Aqua teens and these Carl's fall from the window would be nothing new).&lt;ref name=FreedomCobra&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Freedom Cobra |series=Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1  |network=Adult Swim |airdate=June 5, 2011 |season=8 |number=4 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Handbanana''' ([[Dave Willis]]) - A yellow dog Frylock made for Meatwad using a software called Make Your Own Dog 2.0. Although nice and friendly to everyone else he &quot;mindlinks&quot; with Carl and rapes him repeatedly throughout the episode. Handbanana was made from radioactive waste and Shake's hand and has a close resemblance to a [[banana]], hence how he got his name. He has a non-speaking cameo in &quot;One Hundred&quot;. He also appears in the Aqua Unit Patrol Squad-1 intro, as a leather jacket wearing thug fighting with Frylock.&lt;ref name=Handbanana&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Handbanana |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |airdate=October 29, 2006 |season=4 |number=5 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Happy Time Harry''' ([[David Cross]]) - A mean, cynical and depressed doll Frylock bought him for Meatwad due to his low price, only $3.99. His bad attitude affects all the Aqua Teens especially Meatwad who after trying to play with him, adopts his cynical demeanor. Happy Time Harry suffers from [[alcoholism]], [[Cirrhosis of the liver]], and a pill addiction.  He is also suicidal and when threatened by Master Shake and Frylock, begs them to put him out of his misery. He has a [[receding hairline]] and wears only a pair of boxers and little red dancing shoes. He has a retractable knife in place of his missing hand, which he claims his father gave him. He was thrown of a cliff by Master Shake at the end of &quot;Dumber Dolls&quot;&lt;ref name=DumberDolls&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Dumber Dolls |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |airdate=November 3, 2002 |season=1 |number=10 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later killed by Frylock in &quot;The Last One&quot;.&lt;ref name=LastOne/&gt;

* '''Hoppy Bunny''' ([[Scott Adsit]]) - A [[furry fandom|furry]] who wears a large [[pink]] [[rabbit|bunny]] head with a crown on it.  When Carl's new recorder started taking control of him, Hoppy Bunny ordered Carl to put on an elfish garb and play the recorder for the amusement of him and his fellow [[furry fandom|furries]]. In his day job, he's a surgeon.&lt;ref name=HoppyBunny&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Hoppy Bunny |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |airdate=February 17, 2008 |season=5 |number=6 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Inflatable Hitler''' ([[Bill Hader]]) - [[Adolf Hitler]] in the form of a Balloon, the result of an attempt to smuggle his Nazi Memorabilia in a balloon placed in his rectum, the balloon's pop killing him and fusing his soul into it. Frylock worked for him for a brief time, somewhat unaware of his identity, until he found out that Hitler planned to get rid of Jews with an army Ayran Ballons (armed with the biological weapon Frylock designed to target Jews that he was having Frylock develop). Frylock and Master Shake try to pass off ballons filled with Shake's farts as the bio-weapon Frylock developed, but Hitler discovers their deception (having converted Meatwad to the Jewish faith in order to test the weapon out on him) and unleases his balloon army on them, however Frylock defeats them easily by popping them with the sharp end of his fry. Hilter then tells his origin story before the Aqua Teens manage to convince him to stop hating the Jews when he found out [[Adam Sandler]] (along several celebrities he liked) is a Jew, causing him to accept the Jews, even hugging Jewish Meatwad. However, he is popped and killed by Frylock when he redirects his hatred from the Jews to gay people. His only appearance on the show was in &quot;Der Inflatable Fuhrer&quot;.&lt;ref name=DerInflatableFuhrer&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Der Inflatable Fuhrer |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |airdate=May 24, 2009 |season=6 |number=9 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Insane-O-Flex''' - A transforming exercise machine created by Walter Melon. In the feature film, Carl sits in it when it is still in the form of a normal exercise machine. After Carl sits down, the machine transforms into a monster that straps Carl to it, and forces him to do an innumerable amount of reps, leaving Carl with a gigantic, chiseled body. The Insane-o-flex creates havoc throughout the whole town. However its one weakness is horrible music through which it cannot &quot;feel&quot; rhythm. Master Shake destroys the Insane-o-flex by playing a horribly mediocre song called &quot;Nude Love&quot; from his new album. The Insane-o-flex is probably a girl, because it lays eggs. First appeared in [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters|the movie]].

* '''Love Mummy''' ([[Tom Clarke]]) - A mummy who demands expensive goods and threatens the Aqua Teens with a curse if they fail to comply. Eventually, Frylock discovers that the &quot;curse&quot; is simply a tactic to manipulate the Aqua Teens to do his bidding, and simply throws him out with the garbage.&lt;ref name=LoveMummy&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Love Mummy |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |airdate=November 24, 2002 |season=1 |number=13 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Love Mummy also appears as a &quot;piece of junk&quot; in later episodes. His crown hat turns the lower half of anyone who wears it into a snake tail, as it did to Carl.

* '''Marcula''' ([[Matt Maiellaro]]) - the landlord of the Aqua Teens and Carl. He is a vampire. In the first couple of episodes of [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 5)|season five]], Marcula had demons kidnap the Aqua Teens, because he refused to fix a gas leak, so they refused to pay for October's rent. In those episodes Carl received new neighbors that irritated Carl, and, in the same breath, overjoyed Marcula. Marcula also has the power to mutate living things by biting them. Marcula was eventually killed by Carl with a bottle of garlic champagne in the episode &quot;Couples Skate&quot; exclaiming &quot;Open wide, jackass!&quot;. He was 4040 years old. In the very next episode (Reedickyoulus), Frylock said &quot;Finally, I keep telling and telling our landlord&quot; even though Marcula was dead at the time. Somehow Marcula survived, because he shows up in a season 8 episode in which he and a bunch of bats have a virus that affects Carl, but not Shake.

* '''Merle''' ([[Andy Merrill]]) and '''Flargon''' ([[Scott Hilley]]) - Two leprechauns (plus one more named Dingle) who trick people by sending spam emails to go to the park and stay in the rainbow, but in reality, they steal their valuables. They use a rainbow machine which they stole from Dr. Weird. The leader is dim-witted, while his partner is slightly more intelligent. The gender of the extra one is unknown and all he says are &quot;Feet&quot; and &quot;No Feet&quot;.&lt;ref name=EscapefromLeprechaupolis&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Escape from Leprechaupolis |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |airdate=September 9, 2001 |season=1 |number=2|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were killed trying to reach the Moon in &quot;The Last One&quot; in an accident that also destroys the trees.&lt;ref name=LastOne/&gt;
