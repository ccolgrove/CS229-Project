'''Edgard FÃ©lix Pierre Jacobs''', (30 March 1904 - 20 February 1987), better known under his [[pen name]] '''Edgar P. Jacobs''', was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[comic book creator]] (writer and artist), born in [[Brussels, Belgium]]. He was one of the founding fathers of the [[European comics]] movement, through his collaborations with [[HergÃ©]] and the [[graphic novel]] series that made him famous, ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''.

==Biography==
Edgar Pierre Jacobs was born in [[Brussels]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=Weyer&gt;De Weyer, Geert (2005). &quot;Edgar Pierre Jacobs&quot;. In BelgiÃ« gestript, pp. 129-131. Tielt: Lannoo.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs remembered having drawn for as far back as his memory would go. His real love though was for the dramatic arts and the opera in particular. In 1919 he graduated from the commercial school where his parents had sent him, and privately swore he would never work in an office. He kept on drawing in his spare time, focusing his greatest attention on musical and dramatic training. He took on odd jobs at the opera, including decoration, [[scenography]], and painting, and sometimes got to work as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]].&lt;ref name=Weyer/&gt; In 1929 he received the annual Belgian government medal for excellence in classical singing. Financial good fortune did not follow, since the [[Great Depression]] hit the Brussels artistic community very hard.

After a career as extra and [[baritone]] singer in [[opera]] productions between 1919 and 1940 in [[Brussels]] and [[Lille]], punctuated by small drawing commissions, Jacobs turned permanently to [[illustration]], drawing commercial illustrations and collaborating in the ''Bravo'' review until 1946, after he was introduced there by [[Jacques Laudy]].&lt;ref name=Or&gt;{{cite book |last=de Grand Ry |first=Michel |authorlink= |coauthors=Nizette, AndrÃ©; and Lechat, Jean-Louis |title=Le livre d'or de la bande dessinÃ©e |year=1986 |publisher=Centre de la bande dessinÃ©e Belge |location=[[Brussels]] |pages=16â17 |chapter=E.P. Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review or periodical was a smashing success, hitting a circulation of 300,000 at times.

When the American [[comic strip]] ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' was prohibited in Belgium by the German forces of [[Military occupation|occupation]] during World War II, he was asked to write an end to the comic in order to provide a [[denouement]] to the readers. German [[censorship]] banned this continuation after only a couple of weeks. Jacobs subsequently published in ''Bravo'' his first comic strip, ''[[Le Rayon U]]'' (''The U Ray''), largely in the same ''Flash Gordon'' style.&lt;ref name=Or/&gt;

Around this time, he became a stage painter for a theatre adaptation for [[HergÃ©]]'s ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''. Although the play was only a modest success, it brought him into contact with HergÃ© and the two quickly become friends. As a direct result, he assisted HergÃ© in colorizing the black and white strips of ''[[The Shooting Star]]'' from Le Soir in preparation for book publication in 1942, and from 1944 on he helped him in the recasting of his earlier albums ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', ''[[Tintin in America]]'', ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' and  ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' for color book publication. After the project, he continued to contribute directly in the drawing as well as the storyline for the new Tintin double-albums ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]''/''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]''. Jacobs, as a fan of [[opera]], decided to take HergÃ© with him to a concert. HergÃ© did not like opera, however, and for decades he would gently lampoon his friend Jacobs through the device of opera singer [[Bianca Castafiore]], a supporting character in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''. HergÃ© also gave him tiny cameo roles in ''Tintin'' adventures, sometimes under the name Jacobini, for example in ''[[The Calculus Affair]]'' where Jacobini is the name of an opera singer advertised as starring alongside La Castafiore in [[Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', and as a mummified egyptologist on the cover of ''Cigars of the Pharaoh'', as well as in the rewritten version.

In 1946, he was part of the team gathered by [[Raymond Leblanc]] around the new [[Franco-Belgian comics magazines|comics magazine]] ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Le Journal de Tintin]]'', where his story ''Le secret de lâEspadon'' (''[[The Secret of the Swordfish]]'') was published on September 26, the first of the ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BDO-46&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=BDoubliÃ©es|title=Tintin annÃ©e 1946|url= http://bdoubliees.com/tintinbelge/annees/1946.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Jacobs asked to share the credit with HergÃ© on ''The Adventures of Tintin''. When HergÃ© refused, their collaboration suffered a bit of a setback. HergÃ© still remained a friend however, and as before ''Blake et Mortimer'' continued to be serialised in ''Tintin'' magazine. In 1950, Jacobs published ''The Mystery of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]''. Many others soon followed.  Jacobs finally published in 1970 the first volume of ''The Three formulas of Professor Sato'', which was staged in Japan.

In 1973 he restyled his first full-length album, ''Le Rayon U'', and wrote his autobiography under the title ''Un opÃ©ra de papier: Les mÃ©moires de Blake et Mortimer''. He then wrote the scenario for the second episode of ''Les Trois Formules du Professeur Sato'', but the artwork remained unfinished at the time of his death. [[Bob de Moor]] was drafted in to complete the album, which was published in 1990.

Jacobs had not one but two stone [[sphinx]]es to commemorate him.  One of them is in the ''Bois des Pauvres'' near Brussels, where his home used to stand, and the other one is over his tomb at the Lasne cemetery, also near Brussels. The cemetery sphinx has a &quot;collar&quot; beard, and his face looks a lot like Philip Mortimer, the protagonist of most of the Jacobs albums.

Jacobsâ style varies greatly from one album to another. There are however many common threads, such as the theme of subterranean descent and the consistent [[Ligne claire]] drawing style.
