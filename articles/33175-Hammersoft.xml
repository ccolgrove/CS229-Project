'''William Blake''' (28 November 1757&amp;nbsp;â 12 August 1827) was an [[English people|English]] poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. His prophetic poetry has been said to form &quot;what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D. ''Collected Works of Northrop Frye''. 2006, pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; His visual artistry has led one contemporary art critic to proclaim him &quot;far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jones, Jonathan| month= April | title= Blake's heaven |work=[[The Guardian]] | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/critic/feature/0,1169,1469584,00.html |date=25 Apr. 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he lived in London his entire life except for three years spent in [[Felpham]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Edward. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=bilDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Literary+Pilgrim+in+England A Literary Pilgrim in England]''. 1917, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; he produced a diverse and symbolically rich corpus, which embraced the imagination as &quot;the body of God&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Butler Yeats|Yeats, W. B.]] ''The Collected Works of W. B. Yeats''. 2007, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Human existence itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mona. ''The Life of William Blake''. The Nonesuch Press, 1927. p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered mad by contemporaries for his [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] views, Blake is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of both the [[Romantic movement]] and &quot;Pre-Romantic&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge''. 2004, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; for its large appearance in the 18th century. Reverent of the Bible but hostile to the [[Church of England]] - indeed, to all forms of organised religion - Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the [[French revolution|French]] and [[American revolution]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William. ''Blake's &quot;America, a Prophecy&quot; ; And, &quot;Europe, a Prophecy&quot;''. 1984, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by such thinkers as [[Jakob BÃ¶hme]] and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Kazin, Alfred | year=1997 | title= An Introduction to William Blake |url=http://www.multimedialibrary.com/Articles/kazin/alfredblake.asp |accessdate=23 Sep. 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th century scholar [[William Rossetti]] characterised Blake as a &quot;glorious luminary,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William and Rossetti, William Michael. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=fGYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=%22The+Poetical+Works+of+William+Blake:+Lyrical+and+Miscellaneous%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 The Poetical Works of William Blake: Lyrical and Miscellaneous]''. 1890, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and as &quot;a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William and Rossetti, William Michael. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=fGYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=%22The+Poetical+Works+of+William+Blake:+Lyrical+and+Miscellaneous%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 The Poetical Works of William Blake: Lyrical and Miscellaneous]''. 1890, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:William-blake-plaque.jpg|thumb|A plaque at William Blake House, a modern block of flats at 28 Broadwick St where Blake was born and lived until he was 25.]]
William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street (now Broadwick St) in the [[Soho]] district of [[London]]. He was the third of seven children,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/116 poets.org/William Blake, retrieved online 13 June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bent&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, page 34-5.&lt;/ref&gt; two of whom died in infancy. Blake's father, James, was a [[hosier]].&lt;ref name=bent /&gt;  William attended school only long enough to learn reading and writing, leaving at the age of ten, and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Wright Armitage Blake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raine&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Raine, Kathleen |title=World of Art: William Blake |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=1970 |isbn=0-500-20107-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blakes were [[Dissenter]]s, and are believed to have belonged to the [[Moravian Church]]. The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake, and would remain a source of inspiration throughout his life.

Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father, a practice that was then preferred to actual drawing. Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Marten Jacobszoon Heemskerk van Veen|Marten Heemskerk]] and [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]]. His parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but was instead enrolled in drawing classes. He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake was also making explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]] and [[Edmund Spenser]].

===Apprenticeship to Basire===
[[File:Sconfitta (William Blake).jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]
On 4 August 1772, Blake became apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], for the term of seven years.&lt;ref name=bent /&gt; At the end of this period, at the age of 21, he was to become a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship. However, [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake was later to add Basire's name to a list of artistic adversariesâand then cross it out.&lt;ref&gt;43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aside, Basire's style of engraving was of a kind held to be old-fashioned at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, page xix.&lt;/ref&gt; and Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.

After two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies, and varicoloured waxworks.  Ackroyd notes that &quot;...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd&lt;/ref&gt; In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by the boys of [[Westminster School]], one of whom &quot;tormented&quot; Blake so much one afternoon that he knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, &quot;upon which he fell with terrific Violence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cSxDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+William+Blake:+Together+with+a+Life&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 The Letters of William Blake: Together with a Life]''. 1906, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake beheld more visions in the Abbey, of a great procession of monks and priests, while he heard &quot;the chant of [[plain-song]] and [[chorale]].&quot;

===Royal Academy===
On 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of &quot;general truth&quot; and &quot;general beauty&quot;. Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the &quot;disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind&quot;; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that &quot;To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd edition |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=http://www.english.uga.edu/~nhilton/Blake/blaketxt1/home.html}} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by &quot;E&quot; and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable oil painting, Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]].

David Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held history painting to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather &quot;against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, D. &quot;Blake as a Painter&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.

Blake became friends with [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69â76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gordon Riots===
Blake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, A, ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; They attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during this attack. These riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, later came to be known as the [[Gordon Riots]]. They provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], as well as the creation of the first police force.

Despite Gilchrist's insistence that Blake was &quot;forced&quot; to accompany the crowd, some biographers have argued that he accompanied it impulsively, or supported it as a revolutionary act.&lt;ref&gt;Erdman, David, ''Prophet Against Empire'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Jerome McGann argues that the riots were reactionary, and that events would have provoked &quot;disgust&quot; in Blake.&lt;ref&gt;McGann, J. &quot;Did Blake Betray the French Revolution&quot;, ''Presenting Poetry: Composition, Publication, Reception'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and early career===

Blake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782. At the time, Blake was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, &quot;Do you pity me?&quot; When she responded affirmatively, he declared, &quot;Then I love you.&quot; Blake married Catherine â who was five years his junior â on 18 August 1782 in [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an 'X'. The original wedding certificate may still be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake  | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she would prove an invaluable aid to him, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.

Blake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction of 1783 edition: [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, ISBN 978 185437 768 5&lt;/ref&gt; After his father's death, William and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some of the leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and Anglo-American revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French revolution and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake also composed his unfinished manuscript ''An Island in the Moon''.

Blake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788; 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving without doubt that they actually met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfillment.

===Relief etching===

In 1788, at the age of 31, Blake began to experiment with [[relief etching]], a method he would use to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and final products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscripts]]. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).

This is a reversal of the normal method of [[etching]], where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method.  [[Relief etching]] (which Blake also referred to as &quot;[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]&quot; in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blakeâs innovation was, as described above, very different.  The pages printed from these plates then had to be hand-coloured in water colours and stitched together to make up a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and ''[[Jerusalem: The Emanation of The Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi, J. ''Blake and the Idea of the Book''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993; Phillips, M. ''William Blake: The Creation of the Songs'', London: The British Library, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engravings===
Although Blake has become most famous for his relief etching, his commercial work largely consisted of [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio engraving]], the standard process of engraving in the eighteenth century in which the artist would incise an image into the copper plate. This was a complex and laborious process, with plates taking months or years to complete, but as Blake's contemporary, [[John Boydell]], realised, such engraving offered a &quot;missing link with commerce&quot;, enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and so becoming an immensely important activity by the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Eaves, Morris. ''The Counter Arts Conspiracy: Art and Industry in the Age of Blake''. Ithaca and London: [[Cornell University Press]], 1992. Pp. 68-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake also employed intaglio engraving in his own work, most notably for the [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations of the Book of Job]], completed just before his death. Most critical work has tended to concentrate on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study draws attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: these demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as &quot;[[repoussage]]&quot;, a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Sung, Mei-Ying. ''William Blake and the Art of Engraving''. London: Pickering and Chatto, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and career==
[[File:William Blake House in Felpham.JPG|thumb|right|The cottage in Felpham where Blake lived from 1800 till 1803.]]
Blake's marriage to Catherine remained a close and devoted one until his death. Blake taught Catherine to write, and she helped him to colour his printed poems.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, G. E, ''Blake Records'', p 341&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilchrist refers to &quot;stormy times&quot; in the early years of the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, ''Life of William Blake'', 1863, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; Some biographers have suggested that Blake tried to bring a [[concubine]] into the marriage bed in accordance with the beliefs of the more radical branches of the [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgian Society]],&lt;ref&gt;Schuchard, MK, ''Why Mrs Blake Cried'', Century, 2006, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars have dismissed these theories as conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Felpham===
In 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]] in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]) to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: a Poem]]'' (the title page is dated 1804 but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem  beginning &quot;And did those feet in ancient time,&quot; which became the words for the anthem, &quot;[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]&quot;. Over time, Blake came to resent his new patron, coming to believe that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with &quot;the meer drudgery of business&quot; (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that &quot;Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies.&quot; (4:26, E98)

Blake's trouble with authority came to a head in August 1803, when he was involved in a physical altercation with a soldier called John Schofield.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Thomas. ''Life of William Blake''. 2003, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake was charged not only with assault, but also with uttering seditious and treasonable expressions against the King. Schofield claimed that Blake had exclaimed, &quot;Damn the king. The soldiers are all slaves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/williamblake1.html The Gothic Life of William Blake: 1757-1827]&lt;/ref&gt; Blake would be cleared in the [[Chichester]] [[assize]]s of the charges. According to a report in the Sussex county paper, &quot;The invented character of [the evidence] was ... so obvious that an acquittal resulted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucas, E.V.|authorlink=E. V. Lucas|title=Highways and byways in Sussex|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Highways_and_Byways_in_Sussex|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|year=1904 |id=ASIN B-0008-5GBS-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schofield was later depicted wearing &quot;mind forged manacles&quot; in an illustration to ''Jerusalem''.&lt;ref&gt;Peterfreund, Stuart,
''The Din of the City in Blake's Prophetic Books'', ELH - Volume 64, Number 1, Spring 1997, pp. 99-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to London===
[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]
Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate ''[[Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]'' (1804â1820), his most ambitious work. Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing that Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned that he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He also set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in the [[Soho]] district of London. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result he wrote his [[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|''Descriptive Catalogue'']] (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] has called a &quot;brilliant analysis&quot; of Chaucer. It is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings.

The exhibition itself, however, was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[Examiner|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, &quot;Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back&quot;, The Times Saturday Review, 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Also around this time (circa 1808) Blake gave vigorous expression of views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[British Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, &quot;To Generalize is to be an Idiot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750-1850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1818 he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (1792)|John Linnell]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366â367&lt;/ref&gt; Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. This group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. At the age of 65 Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]''. These works were later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job, a masque for dancing|Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.

Later in his life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to Thomas Butts, a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.

====Dante's ''Divine Comedy''====
[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12-28, The Minotaur XII]]

The commission for [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through [[John Linnell (painter)|Linnell]], with the ultimate aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 would cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of the watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have evoked praise:

:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, David. &quot;Blake as a Painter&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy|''Inferno'']]]]
Blake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.

Because the project was never completed, Blake's intent may itself be obscured. Some indicators, however, bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would themselves take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, &quot;Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All &amp; the Goddess Nature &amp; not the Holy Ghost.&quot; Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).

At the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.&lt;ref&gt;''Blake Records'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death====
[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|right|Monument near Blake's unmarked grave at [[Bunhill Fields]] in London]]

On the day of his death, Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, &quot;Stay Kate! Keep just as you are â I will draw your portrait â for you have ever been an angel to me.&quot; Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389&lt;/ref&gt; At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the same house, present at his expiration, said, &quot;I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed angel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1863, 405&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Richmond]] gives the following account of Blake's death in a letter to [[Samuel Palmer]]:

{{quote|He died ... in a most glorious manner. He said He was going to that Country he had all His life wished to see &amp; expressed Himself Happy, hoping for [[Salvation]] through [[Jesus Christ]] â Just before he died His Countenance became fair. His eyes Brighten'd and he burst out Singing of the things he saw in Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Grigson, ''Samuel Palmer'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Catherine paid for Blake's funeral with money lent to her by Linnell. He was buried five days after his death â on the eve of his forty-fifth wedding anniversary â at the [[Dissenter]]'s burial ground in [[Bunhill Fields]], where his parents were also interred. Present at the ceremonies were Catherine, [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]], [[George Richmond]], [[Frederick Tatham]] and John Linnell. Following Blake's death, Catherine moved into Tatham's house as a housekeeper. During this period, she believed she was regularly visited by Blake's spirit. She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings, but would entertain no business transaction without first &quot;consulting Mr. Blake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 390&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of her own death, in October 1831, she was as calm and cheerful as her husband, and called out to him &quot;as if he were only in the next room, to say she was coming to him, and it would not be long now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Blake Records'', p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

On her death, Blake's manuscripts were inherited by [[Frederick Tatham]], who burned several he deemed heretical or politically radical. Tatham was an [[Edward Irving|Irvingite]], one of the many fundamentalist movements of the 19th century, and was severely opposed to any work that smacked of blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; Also, John Linnell erased sexual imagery from a number of Blake's drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Keith Schuchard, ''Why Mrs Blake Cried: Swedenborg, Blake and the Sexual Basis of Spiritual Vision'', pp. 1-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1965, the exact location of William Blake's grave had been lost and forgotten, while gravestones were taken away to create a new lawn. Nowadays, Blakeâs grave is commemorated by a stone that reads &quot;Near by lie the remains of the poet-painter William Blake 1757-1827 and his wife Catherine Sophia 1762-1831&quot;. This memorial stone is situated approximately 20&amp;nbsp;metres away from the actual spot of Blakeâs grave, which is not marked. However, members of the group Friends of William Blake have rediscovered the location of Blake's grave and intend to place a permanent memorial at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Friends of Blake homepage |publisher=Friends of Blake |url=http://www.friendsofblake.org/home.htm |accessdate=31 Jul. 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coming up - William Blake |publisher=BBC ''Inside Out'' |date=9 Feb. 2007 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/london/series11/week5_healthy_living_working.shtml |accessdate=1 Aug. 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake is now recognised as a saint in the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]]. The [[Blake Prize for Religious Art]] was established in his honour in Australia in 1949. In 1957 a memorial was erected in Westminster Abbey, in memory of him and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tate UK | year= | title= William Blake's London | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learning/learnonline/blakeinteractive/lambeth/london_05.html |accessdate=26 Aug. 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Blake was not active in any well-established political party. His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was both concerned about senseless [[wars]] of kingdoms, and the blighting effects of the [[industrial revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims that Blake was disillusioned with these revolutions, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism. Erdman also notes that Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes that some poems of Blake read primarily as championing &quot;[[free love]]&quot; have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.&lt;ref&gt;Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more recent (and very short) studies of Blake, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), has classified Blake as one of the forerunners of modern [[anarchism]], along with Blake's contemporary [[William Godwin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marshall&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised Edition|isbn=0900384778}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Marxist]] historian [[E.P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson's]] last finished work was a study on William Blake, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), and it shows how far Blake was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the English Civil War.

==Development of Blake's views==
Because Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The recent Vintage anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.

The earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protestation against dogmatic religion. This is especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' in which the figure represented by [[Satan]] is virtually the hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In the later works such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.

Psychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas that were first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests that the later works are in fact the &quot;Bible of Hell&quot; promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, she writes: &quot;[T]he promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, John Middleton Murry notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a &quot;sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason&quot;, the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Middleton characterises the later Blake as having found &quot;mutual understanding&quot; and &quot;mutual forgiveness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==
===19th century &quot;free love&quot; movement===
Since his death, William Blake has been claimed by various movements who apply his complex and often elusive use of symbolism and allegory to the issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hayes, &quot;William Blake's AndrogYnous EGO-Ideal,&quot; ''ELH'', 71(1), 141-165 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Blake is sometimes considered (along with [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and her husband [[William Godwin]]) a forerunner of the subsequent 19th century &quot;[[free love]]&quot; movement, a broad reform tradition starting in the 1820s that held that marriage is slavery, and advocated for removal of all state restrictions on sexual activity such as homosexuality, prostitution, and adultery, culminating in the birth control movement of the early 20th century. Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned today notably by the Blake scholar Magnus AnkarsjÃ¶ who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th century &quot;free love&quot; movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was &quot;legal prostitution&quot; and was monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early [[feminism|feminist]] movements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html MSU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).

Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue. At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house. His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws.  Poems such as &quot;Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?&quot; and &quot;Earth's Answer&quot; seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. His poem &quot;London&quot; speaks of &quot;the Marriage-Hearse&quot;. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the &quot;frozen marriage-bed&quot;. In ''Visions'', Blake writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Till she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound
In spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain
Of life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 19th century famed poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a full-length book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises &quot;sacred natural love&quot; that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a &quot;creeping skeleton&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;  Swinburne also notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the &quot;pale religious letchery&quot; of advocates of traditional norms.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Another 19th century free love advocate, Edward Carpenter (1844â1929), was also influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'' p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo that of Mary Wollstonecraft celebrating joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,&lt;ref&gt;Berger pp. 188-190&lt;/ref&gt; the former being the true measure of purity.&lt;ref&gt;Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; Irene Langridge notes that &quot;in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William Blake: a study of his life and art work  By Irene Langridge p. 11 &amp;131&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Davis' 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human âfallennessâ. S. Foster Damon has noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Wright's  1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,&lt;ref&gt;Wright p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;Berger p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have noted both that Blake's views on âfree loveâ are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus AnkarsjÃ¶ notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying &quot;Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by AnkarsjÃ¶ on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''&lt;/ref&gt; AnkarsjÃ¶ also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' AnkarsjÃ¶ thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,&lt;ref&gt;''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus AnkarsjÃ¶ p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.&lt;ref&gt;AnkarsjÃ¶ p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; AnkarsjÃ¶ records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall has recently read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.&lt;ref&gt;David Worrall, &quot;Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject&quot;, in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of &quot;self-denial&quot;, though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; Berger (moreso than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,&lt;ref&gt;Berger p.112, 284&lt;/ref&gt; and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus' mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.

==Religious views==
[[File:Blake ancient of days.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''Ancient of Days''. The &quot;[[Ancient of Days]]&quot; is described in Chapter 7 of the [[Book of Daniel]].]]
Although Blake's attacks on conventional religion were shocking in his own day, his rejection of religiosity was not a rejection of religion ''per se''. His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', a series of texts written in imitation of Biblical prophecy.  Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', amongst which are the following:

*Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.
*As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)

In ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
If he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,
He'd have done anything to please us:
Gone sneaking into Synagogues
And not us'd the Elders &amp; Priests like Dogs,
But humble as a Lamb or Ass,
Obey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].
God wants not Man to Humble himself (55-61, E519-20)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jesus, for Blake, symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: &quot;All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.&quot; (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)

Blake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his prophetic books. Within these Blake describes a number of characters, including 'Urizen', 'Enitharmon', 'Bromion' and 'Luvah'.  This mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible and in Greek mythology,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology&quot;; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, page 265.&lt;/ref&gt; and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.

|}

One of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:

{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have &lt;curbed &amp;&gt; governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion but Realities of Intellect from which All the Passions Emanate &lt;Uncurbed&gt; in their Eternal Glory. (E564)}}

One may also note his words concerning religion in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
All Bibles or sacred codes have been the causes of the following Errors.
:1. That Man has two real existing principles Viz: a Body &amp; a Soul.
:2. That Energy, calld Evil, is alone from the Body, &amp; that Reason, calld Good, is alone from the Soul.
:3. That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.
But the following Contraries to these are True
:1. Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.
:2. Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy.
:3. Energy is Eternal Delight. (Plate 4, E34)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Blake-Abel.jpg|thumb|right|''The Body of [[Cain and Abel|Abel]] Found by Adam and Eve'', c. 1825. Watercolour on wood.]]

Blake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the 'discernment' of the senses.  Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul. Elsewhere, he describes Satan as the 'state of error', and as beyond salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Damon |first=Samuel Foster |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A Blake Dictionary (Revised Edition) |year=1988 |publisher=Brown University Press |location= |page=358 |isbn=0874514363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake opposed the [[sophistry]] of [[theology|theological]] thought that excuses pain, admits evil and apologises for injustice. He abhorred self-denial,&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, Saree. ''William Blake and the Impossible History of the 1790s''. 2003, page 226-7.&lt;/ref&gt; which he associated with religious repression and particularly sexual repression:&lt;ref&gt;Altizer, Thomas J.J. ''The New Apocalypse: The Radical Christian Vision of William Blake''. 2000, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Prudence]] is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity. / He who desires but acts not, breeds [[pestilence]].&quot; (7.4-5, E35) He saw the concept of 'sin' as a trap to bind menâs desires (the briars of ''Garden of Love''), and believed that restraint in obedience to a moral code imposed from the outside was against the spirit of life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Abstinence sows sand all over
The ruddy limbs &amp; flaming hair
But Desire Gratified
Plants fruits &amp; beauty there. (E474)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He did not hold with the [[doctrine]] of God as Lord, an entity separate from and superior to mankind;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake|first=Gerald Eades Bentley |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=William Blake: The Critical Heritage |year=1975 |publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul |location=London |page=30 |isbn=0710082347}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is shown clearly in his words about Jesus Christ: &quot;He is the only God ... and so am I, and so are you.&quot; A telling phrase in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is &quot;men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast&quot;. This is very much in line with his belief in liberty and social equality in society and between the sexes.

===Enlightenment philosophy===

Blake had a complex relationship with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy. Due to his visionary religious beliefs, Blake opposed the [[Isaac Newton#Effect on religious thought|Newtonian]] view of the universe. This mindset is reflected in an excerpt from Blake's ''[[Jerusalem (Blake)|Jerusalem]]'':

[[File:Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[Newton (Blake)|Newton]]'' (1795) demonstrates his opposition to the &quot;single-vision&quot; of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|scientific materialism]]: Newton fixes his eye on a compass (recalling [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8:27, an important passage for [[John Milton|Milton]])&lt;ref&gt;Baker-Smith, Dominic. ''Between Dream and Nature: Essays on Utopia and Dystopia''. 1987, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt; to write upon a scroll that seems to project from his own head.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Christopher B. ''Creational Theology and the History of Physical Science''. 1997, page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I turn my eyes to the Schools &amp; Universities of Europe
And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire
Washd by the Water-wheels of Newton. black the cloth
In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel Works
Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other: not as those in Eden: which
Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony &amp; peace. (15.14-20, E159)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blake also believed that the paintings of Sir Joshua Reynolds, which depict the naturalistic fall of light upon objects, were products entirely of the &quot;vegetative eye&quot;, and he saw Locke and Newton as &quot;the true progenitors of Sir Joshua Reynolds' aesthetic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Ackroyd |first= Peter|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Blake |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1995 |month= |publisher=Sinclair-Stevenson |location=London |isbn=1-85619-278-4 |oclc= |doi=  |page=285 |chapter= |chapterurl= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular taste in the England of that time for such paintings was satisfied with [[mezzotint]]s, prints produced by a process that created an image from thousands of tiny dots upon the page. Blake saw an analogy between this and Newton's particle theory of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Quote|a Line or Lineament is not formed by Chance a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s] Strait or Crooked It is Itself &amp; Not Intermeasurable with or by any Thing Else Such is Job. (E784)}}

Despite his opposition to Enlightenment principles, Blake thus arrived at a linear aesthetic that was in many ways more similar to the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] engravings of John Flaxman than to the works of the Romantics, with whom he is often classified.

Therefore Blake has also been viewed as an enlightenment poet and artist, in the sense that he was in accord with that movement's rejection of received ideas, systems, authorities and traditions. On the other hand, he was critical of what he perceived as the elevation of reason to the status of an oppressive authority. In his criticism of reason, law and uniformity Blake has been taken to be opposed to the enlightenment, but it has also been argued that, in a [[dialectical]] sense, he used the enlightenment spirit of rejection of external authority to criticise narrow conceptions of the enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, C.

==Assessment==
===Creative mindset===
[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes that Blake &quot;himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'.  Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fearfulsymmetry&quot;&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, [[Princeton University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BLAKE12.JPG|thumb|right|Blake's &quot;A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows&quot;, an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J. G. Stedman's]] ''Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam'' (1796).]]
Blake abhorred slavery and believed in racial and sexual equality. Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: &quot;As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)&quot;. In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns &quot;to bear the beams of love&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
When I from black and he from white cloud free,
And round the tent of God like lambs we joy:
Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear,
To lean in joy upon our fathers knee.
And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
And be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blake retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church.  His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.

===Visions===
From a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first of these visions may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist &quot;saw God&quot; when God &quot;put his head to the window&quot;, causing Blake to break into screaming.&lt;ref name=bent78&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, page 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen &quot;a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.&quot;&lt;ref name=bent78 /&gt; According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported this vision, and he only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber. On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.&lt;ref name=bent78 /&gt;

[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819-1820. Having informed painter-astrologer [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] of his visions of apparitions, Blake was subsequently persuaded to paint one of them.&lt;ref name=langr&gt;Langridge, Irene. ''William Blake: A Study of His Life and Art Work''. 1904, page 48-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Varley's anecdote of Blake and his vision of the flea's ghost became well-known.&lt;ref name=langr /&gt;]]

Blake claimed to experience visions throughout his life. They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and therefore may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits.  Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works.  God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration.  In addition, Blake believed that he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by those same Archangels. In a letter to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, Blake writes:

{{quote|I know that our deceased friends are more really with us than when they were apparent to our mortal part.  Thirteen years ago I lost a brother, and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit, and see him in my remembrance, in the region of my imagination.  I hear his advice, and even now write from his dictate.}}

In a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake writes:

{{quote|[The town of] Felpham is a sweet place for Study, because it is more spiritual than London.  Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates; her windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard, &amp; their forms more distinctly seen; &amp; my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses.  My Wife &amp; Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive.  In my Brain are studies &amp; Chambers filled with books &amp; pictures of old, which I wrote &amp; painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; &amp; those works are the delight &amp; Study of Archangels. (E710)}}

In a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake writes:

{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, &amp; that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams &amp; prophecy &amp; speak Parables unobserv'd &amp; at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}

In ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake writes:

{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up &amp; then &amp; not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation &amp; that to me it is hindrance &amp; not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me. What it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty I question not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a Window concerning a Sight I look thro it &amp; not with it. (E565-6)}}

Aware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, &quot;There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more deferential vein, writing in his ''A short biographical dictionary of English literature'', [[John William Cousins]] wrote that Blake was &quot;a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few&quot;, who &quot;led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary Of English literature  |last= Cousin |first=John William |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1933  |publisher=Plain Label Books |location= |isbn=1603036962, 9781603036962 |page=81 |pages=456  |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General cultural influence==
{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}
[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]
Blake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and was almost forgotten when [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. It was in the twentieth century, however, that Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid twentieth-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], Northrop Frye, [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley, Jr.

While Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry also came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works.  Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] has also set several of Blake's poems, including ''[[The Tyger]]'' and ''[[The Lamb]]''.

Many such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], although Jung dismissed Blake's works as &quot;an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Nanavutty, 11 Nov 1948, quoted by Hiles, David. ''Jung, William Blake and our answer to Job'' 2001. [http://www.psy.dmu.ac.uk/drhiles/pdf%27s/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Jung%20paper.web.pdf DMU.ac.uk]. Retrieved 13 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although less popularly, Diana Hume George has claimed that Blake can be seen as a precursor to the ideas of Sigmund Freud.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Hume George. ''Blake and Freud.'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake had an enormous influence on the beat poets of the 1950s and the counterculture of the 1960s, frequently being cited by such seminal figures as beat poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], songwriters [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jim Morrison]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://zoamorphosis.com/2011/03/how-much-did-jim-morrison-know-about-william-blake/ zoamorphosis.com, ''How much did Jim Morrison know about William Blake''] Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Van Morrison]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/oct/22/classics.williamblake Neil Spencer, The Guardian, October 2000, ''Into the Mystic,'' ''Visions of paradise to words of wisdom... an homage to the written work of William Blake.''] Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/20/arts/the-pop-life-105142.html Robert Palmer, NY Times, March 1985, ''The Pop Life''] Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and English writer [[Aldous Huxley]]. Much of the central [[conceit]] of [[Phillip Pullman]]'s fantasy trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' is rooted in the world of Blake's ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. After World War II, Blake's role in popular culture has come to the fore in a variety of areas such as popular music, film, and the [[graphic novel]], leading Edward Larrissy to assert that &quot;Blake is the Romantic writer who has exerted the most powerful influence on the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Larrissy. ''Blake and Modern Literature''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2006. p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
