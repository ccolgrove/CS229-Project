The '''kazoo''' is a [[wind instrument]] which adds a &quot;buzzing&quot; [[timbre|timbral]] quality to a player's voice when the player vocalizes into it. The kazoo is a type of ''[[mirliton]]'', which is a [[membranophone]]{{ndash}}, a device which modifies the sound of a person's voice by way of a [[vibration|vibrating]] [[membrane]].

'''&quot;Kazoo&quot;''' was the name given by Warren Herbert Frost to his invention in Patent #270,543 issued on January 9, 1883. In the text of the patent he refers to it as &quot;This instrument or toy, to which I propose to give the name 'kazoo' &quot;. This first kazoo was not the familiar 'submarine' shape. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=Ey5zAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=270543+frost&lt;/ref&gt;
==Playing==
While ''blowing'' is the term typically used to describe the technique required to play a kazoo, a more accurate term would be ''humming'' into the kazoo. Blowing with the lips closed around the mouthpiece of the kazoo will not make sound{{ndash}} one must vibrate air from one's lungs by humming into the instrument to produce any sound. Increased air flow and harder blowing will result in a louder sound.

Instead of just humming (hmmmmm); different sounds can be made by singing different syllables, such as doo, who, rrrrr, brrrr, into the kazoo.

==History==  	 
Such instruments have been used in [[Africa]] for hundreds of years, to disguise the sound of somebody's voice or to imitate animals, often for various ceremonial purposes. According to legend, it was on such an instrument that the kazoo, invented in the 19th century by an [[African American]] named [[Alabama Vest]] in [[Macon, Georgia]], [[United States]], is based. The first kazoo was manufactured to Vest's specifications by [[Thaddeus Von Clegg]], a German [[clockmaker]] in Macon. The kazoo was first publicized at the Georgia State Fair in 1852, where it was presented as the &quot;Down-South Submarine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kassinger, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no documentation to support this.

The submarine shaped kazoo was patented by George D. Smith May 27, 1902 &lt;ref&gt;US Patent 700986&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first metal kazoos were manufactured and patented in [[Eden, New York]], where they are still made in the original factory. In 2010 a museum dedicated to the history of the kazoo, [[The Kazoo Museum]], was opened in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Kazoo factory tunes in to Beaufort County |author=Meredith Jordan |newspaper=Bluffton Today |date=7 October 2010 |url=http://www.blufftontoday.com/news/2010-10-07/kazoo-factory-tunes-beaufort-county |accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional usage==
The kazoo is played professionally in [[jug band]]s and [[comedy]] music, and by amateurs everywhere. It is one of the few acoustic instruments to be developed in the United States and one of the easiest melodic instruments to play well, requiring only the ability to vocalize in tune. In [[North East England]] and [[South Wales]], kazoos play an important role in what are called [[juvenile jazz band]]s. During [[Carnival]] the kazoo is routinely used in the [[Carnival of CÃ¡diz]] and the [[Murga]] in Uruguay.

In the [[Original Dixieland Jass Band]] 1921 recording of &quot;Crazy Blues&quot;, what the casual listener might mistake for a trombone solo is actually a kazoo solo by drummer [[Tony Sbarbaro]]. The [[Mound City Blue Blowers]] had a number of hit kazoo records in the early 1920s. The Mound City Blue Blowers featured [[Dick Slevin]] on metal kazoo and [[Red McKenzie]] on comb-and-tissue-paper kazoo. The '''vocaphone''', a kind of kazoo with a trombone-like tone, was occasionally featured in [[Paul Whiteman]]'s Orchestra. Trombonist-vocalist [[Jack Fulton]] played it on Whiteman's recording of &quot;Vilia&quot; (1931) and [[Frankie Trumbauer]]'s &quot;Medley of [[Isham Jones]] Dance Hits&quot; (1932).  The vocal group [[The Mills Brothers]] originally started in vaudeville as a kazoo quartet, playing four-part harmony on kazoo with one brother accompanying them on [[guitar]]. 

The kazoo is not often found in [[European classical music]], a rare exception being [[David Bedford]]'s ''With 100 Kazoos'', a piece which emphasizes the simplicity of the instrumentârather than being played by trained musicians, kazoos are handed out to members of the audience, who accompany a professional instrumental ensemble. [[Leonard Bernstein]] included a segment for kazoo ensemble in the First Introit (Rondo) of his [[Mass (theatre)]]. The kazoos are played by the boy's choir. The kazoo was used in the 1990 [[Koch International]] and 2007 [[Naxos Records]] recordings of American classical composer [[Charles Ives]]' &quot;Yale-Princeton Football Game&quot;, where the kazoo chorus represents the football crowd's cheering.  The brief passages have the kazoo chorus sliding up and down the scale as the cheering rises and falls.

The kazoo is called for in [[Frank Loesser]]'s score for the 1961 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical comedy ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. It appears as part of the instrumental accompaniment played by the orchestra: several instruments provide the sound effect of electric razors being used in the executive washroom, during a dance reprise of the ballad &quot;I Believe in You&quot;.

A kazoo solo is featured in [[Jesse Fuller]]'s 1962 recording of his song &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;SF&quot;&gt;Peter Siegel, liner notes to ''Friends of Old Time Music'' ([[Smithsonian Folkways]], SFW40160) [http://media.smithsonianglobalsound.org/liner_notes/smithsonian_folkways/SFW40160.pdf Media.smithsonianglobalsound.org]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Eric Clapton]]'s 1992 recording of the song on MTV's Unplugged television show and album.

Short performances of kazoo music is included on many modern recordings, usually for comic effect. For example, in [[Frank Zappa]]'s first album, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', he used the kazoo for adding such comic feel in some songs (including one of his best known, &quot;[[Hungry Freaks, Daddy]]&quot;). In the song &quot;[[Crosstown Traffic (song)|Crosstown Traffic]]&quot;, from the album ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'', [[Jimi Hendrix]] used a kazoo made of comb and paper acompanying the guitar to accentuate a blown-out speaker sound for which he was looking. In the song &quot;[[Lovely Rita]]&quot;, from the album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' by [[the Beatles]], kazoos made of combs and toilet paper are featured. It is also believed that musician Dave Fidler played the Kazoo in the US band Shalamar, until he left in 1979.

One of the best known kazooists in recent times might be Barbara Stewart (1941-2011). She was a classically trained singer who has written a book on the kazoo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/089480605X]&lt;/ref&gt; formed the &quot;quartet&quot; Kazoophony, and performed at [[Carnegie Hall]]. She appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.

==Records==  
On Monday 14 March 2011, the audience at BBC Radio 3's Red Nose Show at the Royal Albert Hall along with a star-studded kazoo band set a new [[Guinness World Record]] title for the Largest Kazoo Ensemble. Wagner's [[Ride of the Valkyries]] and the [[Dambusters March]] were performed by 3,910 kazooists in  the Royal Albert Hall crowd,  surpassing the old record of 3,861 players set in Sydney, Australia in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/03_march/15/kazoo.shtml] Big Red Nose Show&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2010 The [[San Francisco Giants]] hosted a [[Jerry Garcia]] tribute night, in which an ensemble of up to 9,000 kazoo players attempted a rendition of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgiant01&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/Giants-Fans-Kazoos-Create-World-Record-Buzz-100394269.html |title=Giants Fans' Kazoos Create World Record Buzz |accessdate=2010-08-14 |publisher=NBC Universal, Inc. |work=NBC Bay Area |author=Joe Kukura |year=2010 |month=August}}&lt;/ref&gt;
