'''Valencia Club de FÃºtbol''' ({{lang-va|ValÃ¨ncia Club de Futbol}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valenciacf.com/va/ElClub/ClubHistoria.html Valencia CF history in Valencian (named ValÃ¨ncia CF in article)],&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Valencia C.F.''', '''Valencia'''  or '''Los Che''') is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Association football|football]] [[football team|club]] based in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]. They play in [[La Liga]] and are one of the most successful and biggest clubs in [[Football in Spain|Spanish Football]] and [[European football records|European Football]]. Valencia have won six La Liga titles, seven [[Copa del Rey]] trophies, two [[Fairs Cup]]s which was the predecessor to the [[UEFA Cup]], one UEFA Cup, one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s.

==History==
{{Main|History of Valencia CF}}

[[File:Valencia1927.JPG|thumb|210px|The Valencia squad in 1927.]]
The club was established in [[March 5]], [[1919]] and officially approved in [[March 18]], [[1919]], with Octavio Augusto Milego DÃ­az as its first president; incidentally the presidency was decided by a [[coin toss]]. The club played its first competitive match away from home on [[21 May]] [[1919]] against Valencia GimnÃ¡stico, and lost the match 1â0.

Valencia CF moved into the Mestalla stadium in 1923, having played its home matches at the AlgirÃ³s ground since [[7 December]] [[1919]]. The first match at Mestalla pitted the home side against CastellÃ³n Castalia and ended a 0â0 draw. In another match the day after, Valencia won against the same opposition 1â0. Valencia CF won the Regional Championship in 1923, and was eligible to play in the domestic [[Copa del Rey]] cup competition for the first time in its history.

===Emergence as a Giant in Spanish Football===

The [[Spanish Civil War]] halted the progress of the Valencia team until 1941, when it won the Copa del Rey, beating [[RCD Espanyol]] in the final. In the 1941â42 season, the club won its first Spanish [[La Liga]] championship title, although winning the [[Copa del Rey]] was more reputable than the championship at that time. The club maintained its consistency to capture the league title again in the 1943â44 season, as well as the 1946â47 league edition.

In the 1950s, the club failed to emulate the success of the 1940s, even though it grew as a club. A restructuring of Mestalla resulted in an increase in spectator capacity to 45,000, while the club had a number of Spanish and foreign stars. Players such as [[Spain national football team|Spanish international]] [[Antonio Puchades]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] forward [[Faas Wilkes]] graced the pitch at Mestalla. In the 1952â53 season, the club finished as runners-up in the La Liga, and in the following season, the club won the Copa del Rey, then known as the Copa del GeneralÃ­simo.

===European successes===

While managing indifferent league form in the early 1960s, the club had its first European success in the form of the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] (the forerunner to the [[UEFA Cup]]). In the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1961-62|1961â62 season]], Valencia beat Spanish club [[FC Barcelona]] in the final. The [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1962-63|1962â63 edition]] of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final, pitted Valencia CF against [[Croatia]]n club [[Dinamo Zagreb]], which the Valencians also won. Valencia CF was again present in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in the 1963â64 season, but was defeated 2â1 by [[Real Zaragoza]] from Spain.

Former two-time [[European Footballer of the Year]] award winner [[Alfredo Di StÃ©fano]] was hired as coach in 1970, and immediately inspired his new club to their fourth La Liga championship. This secured Valencia its first qualification for the [[European Cup]], contested by the various European domestic champions. Valencia reached the third round of the [[European Cup 1971-72|1971â72 competition]], before losing to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] champions [[Ãjpest FC|Ãjpest TE]]. The most notable players of the 1970s era include [[Austria]]n midfielder [[Kurt Jara]], forward [[Johnny Rep]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Argentina|Argentinian]] forward [[Mario Kempes]], who became the [[Pichichi Trophy|La Liga topscorer]] for two consecutive seasons in the 1976â77 and 1977â78 season. Valencia would go on to win the Copa del Rey again in the 1978â79 season, and also capture the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] the next season, after beating [[England|English]] club [[Arsenal FC]] in the final, with Kempes spearheading Valencia's success in Europe.

===Stagnation===

In 1982, the club appointed [[Miljan Miljanic]] as coach. After a disappointing season, Valencia was in 17th place and faced [[relegation]] with seven games left to play. Koldo Aguirre replaced Miljanic as coach, and Valencia barely avoided relegation that year, relying on favorable results from other teams to ensure their own survival. In the 1983â84 and 1984â85 seasons, the club was heavily in debt under the presidency of Vicente Tormo. The club finally hit rock bottom when it was [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] at the end of the 1985â86 season, and riven with internal problems such as unpaid player and staff wages, as well as poor morale. The club was relegated for the first time after 55 years in Spanish top-flight football.

Arturo TuzÃ³n was named the new club president, and he helped steer Valencia CF back to La Liga. Alfredo Di StÃ©fano returned as coach in 1986, and Valencia won [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] again following the 1986â87 season. Di StÃ©fano stayed on as coach until the 1987â88 season, when the team finished in 14th position in La Liga. [[Bulgaria]]n forward [[Luboslav Penev]] joined the club in 1989, as Valencia aimed to consolidate their place in La Liga. [[Guus Hiddink]] was appointed as head coach in the 1991â92 season, and the club finished fourth in the League and reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. In 1992, Valencia CF officially became a Sporting Limited Company, and retained Hiddink as their coach until 1993.

Brazilian coach [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]], fresh from winning the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] with the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]], became manager at Mestalla in 1994. Parreira immediately signed the Spanish goalkeeper [[Andoni Zubizarreta]] and the [[Russia]]n forward [[Oleg Salenko]], as well as [[Predrag Mijatovic]], but failed to produce results expected of him. He was replaced by new coach JosÃ© Manuel Rielo. The club's earlier successes continued to elude it, although it was not short of top coaching staff like [[Luis AragonÃ©s]] and [[Jorge Valdano]], as well as foreign star forwards like Brazilian [[RomÃ¡rio]], [[Claudio LÃ³pez (footballer)|Claudio LÃ³pez]] and [[Ariel Ortega]] from Argentina.

===The 2000s: Valencia returns to the top of Spanish and European Football===
Valencia started the 1999â00 season by winning another title, the [[Spanish Super Cup]], beating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. Valencia finished third in the league, four points behind the champions [[Deportivo de La CoruÃ±a|Deportivo La CoruÃ±a]] and level on points with second placed BarÃ§a. But the biggest success was in the [[UEFA Champions League]]; for the first time in its history, Valencia reached the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]] final. However, in the final played in [[Paris]] on 24 May 2000, [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] beat Valencia 3â0.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[2000 UEFA Champions League Final]] starting lineup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

It was also Claudio LÃ³pez's farewell, as he had agreed to sign for the Italian side [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], also leaving was FarinÃ³s for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] and Gerard for Barcelona. The notable signings of that summer were, the Norwegian [[John Carew]], [[RubÃ©n Baraja]], the Argentine [[Roberto Ayala]], [[Vicente Rodriguez]] and the Brazilian left back [[FÃ¡bio AurÃ©lio]]. Also bought that season was [[Pablo Aimar]] in January. Baraja, Aimar, Vicente and Ayala would soon become a staple of Valencia's dominance of early 2000s in La Liga.

Valencia started the championship on the right foot and were top after 10 games, after the Christmas break Valencia started to pay for the top demand that such an absorbing competition like the Champions League requires. After passing the two mini-league phases, CÃºper's team eliminated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in quarter finals and [[Leeds United A.F.C|Leeds United]] in the semi-finals, and got ready to face [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the big final, Valencia had now reached two European Cup finals in a row. This time the final was to be played in Milan and at the [[San Siro]], on 23 May. [[Gaizka Mendieta]] gave Valencia the lead by scoring from the penalty spot right at the start of the match, CaÃ±izares then stopped a penalty from [[Mehmet Scholl]], but [[Stefan Effenberg]] drew level after the break thanks to another penalty. After extra time, it was a penalty shoot-out to decide who would be European champions, Valencia, or Bayern Munich. [[Mauricio Pellegrino]] was the man who missed to give Bayern European glory and give Valencia heartbreak for the second season running in the biggest game in club football. For Valencia, it was difficult to recover from the blow in Milan, it culminated in Valencia finishing 5th in [[La Liga]] and out of the Champions League for the 2001â02 season, the final game of the season meant Valencia only needed a draw at the [[Nou Camp]] against Barcelona to seal Champions League qualification, unfortunately for Los Che they lost to Barcelona 3â2 at the Nou Camp, with a last minute goal from [[Rivaldo]] resulting in Barcelona qualifying for the Champions League and Valencia missing out, in a head-to-head tie.

The president, D. Pedro CortÃ©s, resigned due to personal reasons and left the club in July, with the satisfaction of having won the Kingâs Cup, one [[Spanish Super Cup]] and having been runners up in two Champions League finals in a row. D. Jaime OrtÃ­ replaced him as president and expressed his intention on maintaining the good form that had made the club so admired on the European circuit. There were also some changes in the team and staff, [[Rafael BenÃ­tez]], after helping Tenerife to promotion, replaced [[HÃ©ctor CÃºper]] after the latter became the new coach at Internazionale. Among the footballers, Mendieta, Deschamps, Milla and ZahoviÄ left, and Marchena, Mista, Curro Torres, Rufete, de los Santos, and Salva arrived.

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[2001 UEFA Champions League Final]] starting lineup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

From 1999 up until the end of the 2004 season, Valencia had one of the their most successful periods in the club's history. With a total of two [[La Liga]] titles, one [[UEFA Cup]], one [[Copa del Rey]] and one [[UEFA Super Cup]], in those six years, no less than five first class titles and two [[UEFA Champions League]] finals had been achieved.[[Image:Roberto Ayala y Javier Zanetti - 07FEB2007 - Francia - presidencia-govar.jpg|thumb|left|160px|During Valencia's domestic and European dominance of the early 2000's, Argentine [[Roberto Ayala]] had been a key component in their defense.]]

The 2001â02 season brought Valencia a La Liga title, 31 years after the last title crown. There were new incorporations to the team, manager [[Rafael BenÃ­tez]] and the new players of Marchena, Mista, Curro Torres, Rufete, de los Santos and Salva.

That first game against fellow title rivals [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], produced a significant and important victory. This was followed by a record of eleven games won consecutively, breaking the existing one set in the 1970â71 season, the season they had last won the La Liga title under [[Alfredo di StÃ©fano]].

After a defeat in [[La CoruÃ±a]] against Deportivo on 9 December 2001, the team had to win against [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] in the [[Estadi OlÃ­mpic LluÃ­s Companys]] to prevent falling further behind the league leaders. Valencia were 2â0 down at half time, but a comeback in the second half saw Valencia win 3â2.

In the second part of the season, BenÃ­tez's team suffered a small setback after losing 1â0 in the Santiago BernabÃ©u to Real Madrid, but they recovered from this setback and achieved four victories and two draws in the following six games. The games against [[UD Las Palmas|Las Palmas]], [[Athletic de Bilbao]], [[Deportivo AlavÃ©s]], [[Real Zaragoza]] and [[FC Barcelona|BarÃ§a]].

In one of those crucial games that they would come up against Espanyol, Valencia were trailing 1â0 half-time and a man down too with the dismissal of Carboni, but after two goals from [[RubÃ©n Baraja]], Valencia achieved a 2â1 victory. Furthermore, Real Madrid's defeat in [[Anoeta]] to [[Real Sociedad]] left Valencia with a three-point lead at the top of the table.

The final game of the season was at [[La Rosaleda]] to face [[MÃ¡laga CF|MÃ¡laga]], on 5 May 2002, a date that has gone down in Valenciaâs history. The team shut itself away in [[BenalmÃ¡dena]], close to the scene of the game, in order to gain focus. An early goal from Ayala and another close to half-time from [[FÃ¡bio AurÃ©lio]], assured them their fifth La Liga title, 31 years after their last title win.

The 2002â03 season was a disappointing one for Valencia, as they failed in their attempt to retain the La Liga title and ended up outside of the Champions League spots in fifth, behind [[Celta de Vigo]]. They were also knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] on away goals. The 2003â04 season saw Valencia trailing the long time leaders Real Madrid. In February, after 26 games played, Real Madrid were eight points clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resultsfromfootball.com/primeradivision/stage26-season2003-2004.html 2003â2004 season]&lt;/ref&gt; However, their form declined in the late season and they lost their last five games of the campaign, allowing Valencia to overtake them and win the title. The club added the UEFA Cup to this success. Valencia had now been La Liga champions twice in three seasons.

In the summer of 2004, coach Rafa BenÃ­tez decided to leave the club stating he had had problems with the club president, he would soon become manager of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He was replaced by former Valencia coach [[Claudio Ranieri]], who had recently been sacked by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. However, his second reign at the club was a disappointment as Valencia harboured realistic hopes of retaining their La Liga crown but, by February, found themselves in 7th place. Valencia had also been knocked out of the Champions League group phase, with Ranieri being sacked promptly in February. The 2004â2005 season ended with Valencia outside of the UEFA Cup spots.

[[Image:Mestalla2.jpg|thumb|2005: Fans at Estadio Mestalla.]]
In the summer of 2005, [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] coach [[Quique SÃ¡nchez Flores]] was appointed as the new manager of Valencia and ended the season in third place, which in turn gained Valencia a place in the Champions League after a season away from the competition. The 2006â07 season was a season with many difficulties, a season which started with realistic hopes of challenging for La Liga was disrupted with a huge list of injuries to key players and internal arguments between Flores and new Sporting Director [[Amedeo Carboni]]. Valencia ended the season in fourth place and were knocked out of the Champions League at the quarter-finals stage by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 3â2 on aggregate, after knocking out Italian champions Inter in the second round. In the summer of 2007, the internal fight between Flores and Carboni was settled with Carboni being replaced by Ãngel Ruiz as the new Sporting Director of Valencia.

On 29 October 2007, the Valencia board of directors fired Flores after a string of disappointing performances and caretaker manager [[Ãscar RubÃ©n FernÃ¡ndez]] took over on a temporary basis until a full-time manager was found, rumoured to be either [[Marcello Lippi]] or [[JosÃ© Mourinho]]. A day later, Dutch manager [[Ronald Koeman]] announced he would be leaving [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] to sign for Valencia. But there was still no improvement; in fact, Valencia even went on to drop to the 15th position in the league, just two points above the relegation zone. Although on 16 April 2008, Valencia lifted the Copa del Rey with a 3â1 victory over Getafe at the [[Vicente CalderÃ³n]]. This was the club's 7th Copa title. Five days later, one day after a devastating 5â1 league defeat in Bilbao, Valencia fired [[Ronald Koeman]] and replaced him with [[Voro (footballer)|Voro]], who would guide Valencia as Caretaker Manager for the rest of the season. He went on to win the first game since the sacking of Koeman, beating [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] 3â0 in his first game in charge. Voro would eventually drag Valencia from the relegation battle to a safe mid-table finish of 10th place, finally ending a disastrous league campaign for ''Los Che''.

Highly-rated [[Unai Emery]] was announced as the new manager of Valencia on 22 May 2008. The start of the young manager's career looked to be promising, with the club winning four out of its first five games, a surge that saw the team rise to the top position of the La Liga table. Despite looking impressive in Europe, ''Los Che'' then hit a poor run of form in the league that saw them dip as low as seventh in the standings. Amid the slump emerged reports of a massive internal debt at the club exceeding 400 million Euros, as well as that the players had been unpaid in weeks. The team's problems were compounded when they were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] on away goals. After a run where Valencia took only five points from ten games in La Liga, an announcement was made that the club had secured a loan that would cover the players' expenses until the end of the year. This announcement coincided with an upturn in form, and the club won six of its next eight games to surge back into the critical fourth place Champions' League spot. However, ''Los Che'' were then defeated by 4th place rivals [[AtlÃ©tico Madrid]] and [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] in two of the last three games of the campaign, and finished sixth in the table, which meant they failed to qualify for a second successive year for the Champions League.

===The 2010s: Debt issues and Stability===
No solution had yet been found to address the massive debt Valencia were faced with, and rumours persisted that top talents such as [[David Villa]], [[Juan Mata]], and [[David Silva]] could leave the club to help balance the books. In the first season of the new decade, Valencia returned to the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time since the 2007-08 season as they finished comfortably in 3rd in the 2009-10 [[La Liga 2009-10|La Liga]] season. However, in the summer of 2010 due to financial reasons, David Villa and David Silva were sold to Barcelona and [[Manchester City]], respectively, to reduce the club's massive debt. But, despite the loss of two of the club's most important players, the team was able to finish comfortably in 3rd again [[2010-11 La Liga|La Liga]] for the 2nd season running, although they were eliminated from the [[UEFA Champions League]] by German side [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in the Round of 16. In the summer of 2011, then current captain [[Juan Mata]] was sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] to further help Valencia's precarious financial situation. It was announced by president Manuel Llorente that the club's debt had been decreased and that the work on the new stadium will re-begin as soon as possible, somewhere in 2012.

==Current stadium==
{{Main|Mestalla}}
[[Image:Mestalla1.jpg|thumb|200px|Mestalla]]
Valencia played its first years at the AlgirÃ³s stadium but moved to the [[Mestalla]] in 1923. In the 1950s, Mestalla was restructured, which resulted in a capacity increase to 45,000 spectators. Today it holds 55,000 seats. Valencia was scheduled to move to a [[Nou Mestalla|new stadium]] in the north-west of the city in 2010.  Construction of the 75,000-seat [[Nou Mestalla]] was halted by financial constraints, however, and the future status of the project remains indefinite.

The current Mestalla is the fifth largest stadium in Spain. It is also renowned for its steep terracing and for being one of the most intimidating atmospheres in all of Europe to play.

On 20 May 1923, the Mestalla pitch was inaugurated with a friendly match that brought Valencia CF and [[Levante UD]] face to face. It was the beginning of a new era that meant farewell to the old place, AlgirÃ³s, which will always remain in the memories of the [[Valencian]]s as first home of the club. A long history has taken place on the Mestalla field since its very beginning, when the Valencia team was not yet in the [[La Liga|Primera DivisiÃ³n]]. Back then, this stadium could hold 17,000 spectators, and in that time the club started to show its potential in regional championships, which led the managers of that time to carry out the first alterations of Mestalla in 1927. The stadium's total capacity increased to 25,000 before it became severely damaged during the Civil War.

Mestalla was used as concentration camp and junk warehouse. It would only keep its structure, since the rest was a lonely plot of land with no terraces and a stand broken during the war. Once the Valencian [[Pitch (sports)|pitch]] was renovated, Mestalla saw how the team managed to bring home their first title, the 1941 Cup. An overwhelming team was playing on the grass of the redesigned Valencian stadium in that decade, team that conquered three League titles and two Cups with the legendary âelectric forwardsâ of Epi, Amadeo, Mundo, Asensi and [[Guillermo Gorostiza]]. Those years of sporting success also served as support to recover little by little the Mestalla ground.

During the decade of the fifties, the Valencia ground experienced the deepest change in its whole history. That project resulted in a stadium with a capacity of 45,500 spectators. It was a dream that was destroyed by the [[flood]] that flooded Valencia in October 1957 after the overflowing of the [[Turia River]]. Nevertheless, Mestalla not only returned to normality, but also some more improvements were added, like artificial light, which was inaugurated during the 1959 [[Fallas]] festivities. This was the beginning of a new change for the Mestalla.

[[Image:Mestallapanoramic4.jpg|thumb|250px|Mestalla panoramic]]

During the sixties, the stadium kept the same appearance, whilst the [[urban area|urban]] view around it was quickly being transformed. Moreover, the Valencian domain became from that moment on, the setting of big European feats. [[Nottingham Forest]] was the first foreign team that played an official match in Mestalla with the &quot;Che&quot; club. They played on 15 September 1961 and it was the first clash of a golden age full of continental successes, reinforced with the [[Fairs Cup]] won in 1962 and 1963. Mestalla had just entered the European competitions as a stadium where the most important events were taking place.

From 1969, the expression &quot;Anem a Mestalla&quot; (Letâs go to Mestalla), so common among the supporters, started to fall into oblivion. The reason was the change of name that meant a big tribute that the club paid to his most symbolic president that lasted for a quarter of a century. [[Luis Casanova Giner]] admitted that he was completely overwhelmed by such honour, and the president himself requested in 1994 that his name was again replaced by the name of Mestalla, as it happened. At the beginning of the seventies, the local bench of the back-then-called Luis Casanova stadium was occupied by [[Alfredo Di StÃ©fano]], whose results were the winning of one League competition, one second place in the League and two Cup finals lost by the minimum difference. Moreover, Valencia participated for the first time in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]] and made their debut in the [[UEFA Cup]]. It all was a series of events that made that every match in the stadium located in Suecia Avenue turned into a big party.

In 1972, the head office of the club, located in the back of the numbered terraces, was inaugurated. It consisted of an office of [[avant-garde]] style with a worth mentioning trophy hall, which held the foundation flag of the club. In the summer of 1973 there was another new thing, the goal seats, which meant the elimination of fourteen rows of standing [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] providing more comfort and an adjustment to the new times. Valencia's management started to consider the possibility of moving Mestalla from its present location to some land in the outskirts of the town, but finally the project was turned down and some years later.

At that time, [[Mario Kempes]], subsequently considered one of the greatest footballers in the world by Pele&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533833.stmand FIFA 100]&lt;/ref&gt; was playing for Valencia. With the Matador in its team, Valencia won the [[Copa del Rey]], the [[Cup Winners Cup]] and [[European Super Cup]] in consecutive years. The &quot;Che&quot; team became continental superchampion in the last European final played in Mestalla. [[File:Nou mestalla semana 49.JPG|thumb|200px|Construction is underway for the new 75,000-seater stadium [[Nou Mestalla]].]]It was in 1980 against Nottingham Forest, which oddly enough was the first foreign team that had played an official match in the Valencian stadium.

Mestalla, which in 1925 had held the first match of the [[Spain national football team]] in Valencia, was chosen as the setting for the debut of Spain in the [[1982 World Cup]], although the performance of the combined national team was not finally what was expected. Ten years later, the Olympic team would look for support in the Valencian stadium, this time with a very different result, since the selected young footballers finally got the gold medal in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Barcelona]].

Mestalla has been the setting for important international matches, has held several Cup finals, has been seat for Levante UD, home of the Spanish national team and exile for [[CD CastellÃ³n|CastellÃ³n]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the European Cup.

2008â2009 was to have been the last season at the Mestalla, with the club moving to their new 75,000-seater stadium [[Nou Mestalla]] in time for the 2009â2010 season. However, due to the club being in financial crisis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsoccer.com/news/Valencias_financial_crisis_prompts_fire_sale_news_279976.html World Soccer 5 April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; work on the new stadium has stopped.

==Kit and colours==
Originally the kit was composed of white shirts, black shorts and socks of the same color. Although through the years these two have gone from alternating between white and black.

==Hymn==
The club assigned D. Pablo Sanchez Torella who composed the music of Valencia's anthem, named the &quot;[[Pasodoble]]&quot;. The hymn was written by Ramon Gimeno Gil, in [[Valencian language]]. The anthem was premiered and had its official presentation at the 75th anniversary of Valencia Club de Futbol on September 21, 1993.

==The story of the bat==
[[Image:Escudo de Valencia 2.svg|thumb|120px|Coat of arms of the city of Valencia.]]

Valencia and the Balearic Islands were conquered by King [[James I of Aragon]] during the first half of the 13th century. After the conquest the king gave them the status of independent kingdoms of whom he was also the king (but they were independent of Aragonese laws and institutions). The arms of Valencia show those of James I, [[King of Aragon]].

The unique crowned letters L besides the shield were granted by King James. The reason for the letters was that the city had been loyal twice to the King, hence twice a letter L and a crown for the king.

There are several possible explanations for the bat; one is that bats are simply quite common in the area. The second theory is that on October 9, 1238, when James I was about to enter the city, re-conquering it from the Moors, one bat landed on the top of his flag, and he interpreted it as a good sign. As he conquered the city, the bat was added to the arms.
