The universityâs Wasatch Campus in [[Heber, Utah|Heber City, Utah]], also offers bachelor degrees in business management and secondary education, as well as associate degrees in accounting, behavioral science, business management, elementary education and general education.

Utah Valley University is a teaching institution that prepares students through a combination of academic and hands-on learning, a process dubbed &quot;engaged learning&quot; at UVU. The institution was awarded the Community Engagement Classification by the Carnegie Foundation in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Carnegie Classification|publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/news/sub.asp?key=51&amp;subkey=2821}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously called '''Utah Valley State College''' (UVSC), the school attained [[university]] status in July 2008, changing to Utah Valley University. [[Matthew S. Holland]], appointed as the first president of UVU, officially began his duties on June 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.uvureview.com/media/storage/paper982/news/2009/06/22/News/University.Key.Passed.To.Pres.Holland-3748808.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:UVSCcampus.jpg|300px|left|A view of Utah Valley University's campus.]] --&gt;UVU was founded in the fall of 1941, when the Utah State Vocational Office consolidated federal work program classes into one campus in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]]. At this time, the school was known as the Central Utah Vocational School.
Growth brought numerous changes to UVU over the following decades, and the school was renamed several times to reflect its changing role. In 1963, the name was changed from Central Utah Vocational School&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvu.edu/visitors/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; to Utah Trade Technical Institute. In 1967, the school became Utah Technical College at Provo, and was given the authority to confer associate degrees for the first time. In 1977, the institution began moving to its present location beside the [[Interstate 15|I-15]] in Orem. In 1987, it became Utah Valley Community College.

It wasn't until 1993 that the school was named Utah Valley State College and began awarding four-year degrees. The Utah legislature approved renaming it as a university in February 2007 (effective July 1, 2008), allowing it to begin offering master's degrees, although the school continues to place particular emphasis on its two- and four-year degree programs.

On July 1, 2008, the institution was awarded university status and changed its name to Utah Valley University to reflect the shift.

UVU is Utah's largest public university, and the largest employer in Orem&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mountainland.org/Economic_Development/Business/Employers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with over 1,400 full-time faculty and staff, and over 3,200 part-time faculty and staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.uvu.edu/iri/factbooks/factbook0910.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was a community college, the school had approximately 8,000 students enrolled, growing by approximately 3,000 students a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=UVU looking for funds to replace overloaded science building | url=http://heraldextra.com/news/local/central/orem/article_846a476e-58d5-5db9-bb23-8754e14098e2.html | publisher=The Daily Herald | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/education/college/article_5ffb95fb-b0d8-5cd2-b643-1b6e419e5600.html UVU enrollment up 8 percent, funding still a concern&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
=== Accreditation and admissions===
UVU was accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the [[Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools|Northwest Association of Schools]] in 1969, and had its accreditation renewed in 1984, 1995, and 2005. Vocational accreditation was granted in 1976, and renewed in 1990 and 1995 by the Utah State Office of Vocational Education. In December 2006, the UVU School of Business received accreditation from the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]].

UVU is an [[Open admissions|open enrollment]] university and despite the University's size and growth it looks as though administration will keep enrollment open for the time being.{{Or|reason=Please provide a source|date=November 2011}}

About 88% of UVU students come from Utah but an increasing number of students are coming from different countries and states. In 2009, UVU students represented all 50 states and 67 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

===Digital Learning Center===
{{Unreferenced|date=November 2011}}
In September 2006, the school began construction of a new Digital Learning Center to replace the {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Losee Resource Center (library). The &quot;DLC&quot; is {{convert|180000|sqft|m2}} and is located northeast of the Liberal Arts building. It opened on July 1, 2008. UVU President [[William A. Sederburg]] hired Cooper, Roberts, Simonsen and Associates and Layton Construction as the design/build team for the new Digital Learning Center, with acclaimed New York architect Jacob Alspector as lead architect. âWe chose the design weâre going with because it was an exceptional design that still kept a lot of the same features of our current campus. So it looks like itâs supposed to be there yet it stands out,â said Jim Michaelis, associate vice president of Facilities Planning. The $48 million project includes networked computers, computer labs, a computer reference area (Information Commons), media center, 31 study rooms, and wireless internet throughout the building.

The library is the âgreenestâ state-owned building in Utah, and won two 2008 awards from Intermountain Construction magazine for its energy efficiency.
