'''Sharman Networks''' is a company headquartered in [[Australia]] and incorporated in [[Vanuatu]]. It owns the rights to the [[KaZaA]] [[file sharing]] software. It was created for this purpose in 2001 when the original owners of KaZaA were sued in the [[Netherlands]].

In December 2003, Sharman shut down Kazaa Lite K++ by serving [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] notices to all the server owners that hosted the software.

In April 2004 Sharman threatened legal action against Markus Kern for his distribution of the giFT Fasttrack plugin claiming that reverse engineering Sharman's Fasttrack network was illegal.

The [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Sharman Networks is [[Nikki Hemming]]. [[Alan Morris]] is the executive vice president. [[Phil Morle]] is the director of technology.

In 2006, Sharman launched a defamation suit against p2pnet.net, a one-man digital media news site specialising in freedom of speech and file sharing issues [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5230776.stm]. Sharman later dropped out, leaving executive Nikki Hemming to keep the suit going. It has not yet been resolved.

The company is currently involved in legal brawls in Australia and the [[United States|U.S.]] over the alleged use of KaZaA to infringe [[copyright]]s. (As of 8 March 2009 its still unclear if these cases have been resolved.)

KaZaA has partnered with Major Record Labels, Music distributors,and Re-opened the KaZaA website, To listen and download any music for a monthly cost with certain Strings attached. as said in their about section of their new website.
