'''''Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity''''' [[2010 in literature|(2010)]] is a book-length critique of [[Media bias in the United States|media bias]] by author, journalist, and conservative political commentator, [[S. E. Cupp]].

==Summary==
Cupp argues that the liberal media is not only ''unreliable'', ''irresponsible'', and ''partisan'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity&quot;&gt;S. E. Cupp: &quot;Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity&quot;, Twelve Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but they are also guilty of inciting a &quot;revolution&quot; that will destabilize and dilute [[Christianity in the United States|Christian America]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity&quot;/&gt;. She also claims that ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[CNN]], and ''[[Newsweek]]'' among others &quot;''mock, subvert, pervert, corrupt, debase, and extinguish''&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity&quot;/&gt; the [[Judeo-Christian]] ethic and back believers into a dark, irrelevant, morally void corner of American society.

In her book Cupp wrote, according to Newsweek, that:

*[[Secularism|Secularist]] media have attempted to portray religious expression as a marginal &quot;[[subculture]].&quot; They overreacted to [[Mike Huckabee|presidential candidate Mike Huckabee]]âs 2007 [[Christmas]] commercial by concentrating on a &quot;strategically placed&quot; [[Christian cross|cross]] formed by bookshelves in the unfocused background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion:The Liberal Mediaâs Attack on Christianity polarizes conservatives, liberals, raises claims of irony&quot;&gt;[http://theundergroundsite.com/index.php/2010/05/losing-our-religionthe-liberal-mediaâs-attack-on-christianity-polarizes-conservatives-liberals-raises-claims-of-irony-11999 Losing Our Religion:The Liberal Mediaâs Attack on Christianity polarizes conservatives, liberals, raises claims of irony]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Major media outlets did not cover [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]âs failure to acknowledge the [[National Day of Prayer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion:The Liberal Mediaâs Attack on Christianity polarizes conservatives, liberals, raises claims of irony&quot;/&gt;

*''Newsweek''âs review of the bestselling [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] [[Christian novel|Christian fiction]] series, ''[[Left Behind]]'', said, &quot;Sociologists tell us that the United States is experiencing a religious revival, but if the bestseller lists are any guide, the revival looks more like a collective leaving of the senses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion:The Liberal Mediaâs Attack on Christianity polarizes conservatives, liberals, raises claims of irony&quot;/&gt;

*Film reviews of the Christian-themed ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|Chronicles of Narnia]]'' were lukewarm despite it being a box office hit.  Reviews for ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'', which attacks religion in general and the Christian faith in particular, were positive although the movie did not do well at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion:The Liberal Mediaâs Attack on Christianity polarizes conservatives, liberals, raises claims of irony&quot;/&gt;

*Cupp also noted that the liberal press downplays Obamaâs discomfort with religious America and barely wrote about his covering up of religious imagery in the backdrop when he gave a speech at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Losing Our Religion:The Liberal Mediaâs Attack on Christianity polarizes conservatives, liberals, raises claims of irony&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism==
=== Science and religion ===
[[The Washington Post]] asked the [[National Center for Science Education]]'s Joshua Rosenau &quot;to weigh in on Cupp's scholarship&quot; on the issue of [[evolution]]. He responded by saying that S.E. Cupp's handling of science and religion misrepresents the nature of evolution, obscures the science of [[biology]], and dismisses the deeply-held religious views of most Christians outside of the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] subculture. This is the sort of misrepresentation which Rosenau believes leads her to concoct an [[anti-Christian]] [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] on the part of reporters, and to say that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] is &quot;quite literally the [[antichrist]]&quot; for liberals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cupp skips the facts in arguing against evolution&quot;&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/political-bookworm/2010/04/cupp_skips_the_facts_in_arguin.html Cupp skips the facts in arguing against evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe Cupp presents evolutionâand science more generallyâas the enemy of religion. Reporters' &quot;propping up of science,&quot; she writes, is an &quot;attack on Christianity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cupp skips the facts in arguing against evolution&quot;/&gt; She concludes by complaining that &quot;the liberal media is not interested in acknowledging our nation as a deeply religious one,&quot; and repeats her claim that evolution has been a weapon used to attack Christians.
