'''Euphoria''' is a [[programming language]] originally created by Robert Craig of Rapid Deployment Software&lt;ref name=rehomepage/&gt; in [[Toronto]]. Initially developed (though not publicly released) on the [[Atari ST]],&lt;ref name=atari1/&gt; the first commercial release&lt;ref name=firstversion/&gt; was for the 16-bit [[ms-dos|Microsoft MS-DOS]] platform and was [[proprietary software|proprietary]]. In 2006 (with the release of version 3),&lt;ref name=opensource/&gt; Euphoria became [[open source software|open source]] and the openEuphoria Group&lt;ref name=oehomepage/&gt; continues to administer and develop the project. In December 2010, the openEuphoria Group released version 4&lt;ref name=oedownload/&gt; of openEuphoria along with a new identity and mascot for the project. OpenEuphoria is currently available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[osx|Mac OS X]] and three flavors of [[*BSD]].

Euphoria is a general-purpose [[High-level programming language|high-level]] [[Imperative programming|imperative/procedural]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] language. A [[translator (computers)|translator]] generates [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] and the [[GNU compiler collection|GCC]] and [[Open Watcom]] compilers are supported. Alternatively, Euphoria programs may be bound&lt;ref name=binding/&gt; with the interpreter to create stand-alone [[executable]]s. A number of [[GUI]] libraries are supported including Win32lib&lt;ref name=win32lib/&gt; and [[wrapper function|wrappers]] for [[wxWidgets]],&lt;ref name=wxeuphoria/&gt; [[GTK+]]&lt;ref name=GTK/&gt; and [[IUP (software)|IUP]].&lt;ref name=IUP/&gt; Euphoria has a simple built-in [[database]]&lt;ref name=database/&gt; and wrappers for a variety of other databases.&lt;ref name=oedatabases/&gt;

==Overview==
The Euphoria language is a general purpose [[procedural programming|procedural language]] that focuses on simplicity, legibility, rapid development and performance.
: '''Simplicity'''
:: - The language uses just four built-in data types ''(see below)''
:: - Automatic [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] is implemented.
: '''Legibility'''
:: - The syntax favors simple English keywords over the use of punctuation to delineate constructs.
: '''Rapid Development'''
:: - Euphoria is [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] to encourage prototyping and incremental development.
: '''Performance'''
:: - Euphoria incorporates an efficient reference-counting garbage collector that correctly handles cyclic references.

==History==
Developed as a personal project to invent a programming language from scratch, Euphoria was created by Robert Craig&lt;ref name=rehomepage/&gt; on an [[atari st|Atari Mega-ST]].&lt;ref name=atari1/&gt; Many design ideas for the language came from Craig's [[masters degree|Master's]] [[Thesis]] in [[Computer Science]] at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=renotes/&gt; Craig's thesis was heavily influenced by the work of [[John Backus]] on [[functional programming]] (FP) languages.&lt;ref name=renotes/&gt;

Craig ported his original Atari implementation to the 16-bit [[ms-dos|Microsoft MS-DOS]] platform and Euphoria was first released (version 1.0) in July, 1993&lt;ref name=firstversion/&gt; under a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] licence. The original Atari implementation is described by Craig as &quot;primitive&quot;&lt;ref name=atari2/&gt; and has not been publicly released. Euphoria continued to be developed and released by Craig via his company Rapid Deployment Software (RDS) and website rapideuphoria.com.&lt;ref name=rehomepage/&gt; In October, 2006 RDS released version 3&lt;ref name=opensource/&gt; of Euphoria and announced that henceforth Euphoria would be freely distributed under an [[open-source software|open source]] licence.

RDS continued to develop Euphoria, culminating with the release of version 3.1.1 in August, 2007.&lt;ref name=renotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=renews/&gt; Subsequently, RDS ceased unilateral development of Euphoria and the openEuhporia Group&lt;ref name=oehomepage/&gt; took over ongoing development. The openEuphoria Group released version 4 in December, 2010&lt;ref name=oenotes/&gt; along with a new logo and mascot for the openEuphoria project.

Version 3.1.1 remains an important milestone release being the last version of Euphoria which supports the [[MS-DOS|Microsoft MS-DOS]] platform.&lt;ref name=oeplatform/&gt; 

Euphoria is an [[acronym]] for &quot;End-User Programming with Hierarchical Objects for Robust Interpreted Applications&quot; although there is some suspicion that this is a [[backronym]].

The Euphoria language interpreter was originally written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. With the release of version 2.5&lt;ref name=renotes/&gt; in November, 2004 the Euphoria interpreter was split into two sections: the front-end parser and the back-end interpreter. The front-end (which is also used with the Euphoria-to-C translator and the Binder) is now written in Euphoria. The main back-end and run time library are written in C. 

==Features==

'''Euphoria''' was conceived and developed with the following design goals and features:

* Ease of learning and with consistent high-level constructs (moreso than e.g. the [[BASIC]] language)
* Implementation of flat-form 32-bit memory to avoid complicated memory management and size/addressing limits
* Debugging support and run-time error-handling
* Subscript and [[Type system|type checking]]
* Loose and strict variable typing
* Programming via objects as types (user-defined or otherwise)
* Interpreted, with automatic memory management and [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]
* Heterogeneous collection types (sequences)
* [[DOS]] graphics library (Euphoria language versions up to and including 3.1.1)
* Debugger
* Integrated database system
* Low-level memory handling
* Straightforward [[wrapper function|wrapping]] of (or access to) [[C (programming language)|C]] libraries

==Execution modes==
* [[Interpreter (computing)|Interpreter]]
* [[C (programming language)|C]] translator (E2C) for standalone executables or [[Library (computer science)#Dynamic linking|dynamic linking]]
* [[Bytecode]] compiler and interpreter (shrouder&lt;ref name=binding/&gt;)
* The Binder&lt;ref name=binding/&gt; binds the Euphoria source code to the interpreter to create an executable.
* A [[REPL]] version is on the openEuphoria [[technology roadmap|roadmap]].&lt;ref name=repl/&gt;

==Use==
Euphoria is designed to readily facilitate the handling of dynamic collections of data of varying types and is particularly useful for string and image processing. Euphoria has been used in [[artificial intelligence]] experiments, the study of [[mathematics]], for teaching programming, and to implement fonts involving thousands of characters. A large part of the Euphoria interpreter is written in Euphoria.

==Data types==
'''Euphoria''' has two basic data types:
;atom : A number, implemented as a 31-bit signed [[integer]] or a 64-bit [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE floating-point]]. Euphoria dynamically changes between integer and floating point representation according to the current value.
;sequence : A [[Array data type|vector]] (array) with zero or more elements. Each element may be an '''atom''' or another '''sequence'''. The number of elements in a sequence is not fixed (i.e. the size of the vector/array does not have to be declared). The program may add or remove elements as required during run-time. Memory allocation/deallocation is automatically handled by reference counting. Individual elements are referenced using an index value enclosed in square brackets. The first element in a sequence has an index of one [1]. Elements inside embedded sequences are referenced by additional bracked index values, thus X[3][2] refers to the second element contained in the sequence that is the third element of X. Each element of a sequence is an '''object''' type (see below).

'''Euphoria''' has two additional data types predefined:
;integer : An '''atom''', restricted to 31-bit signed [[integer]] values in the range -1073741824 to 1073741823 (-2^30 to 2^30-1). '''Integer''' data types are more efficient than the '''atom''' data types, but cannot contain the same range of values. Characters are stored as integers, e.g. coding [[ASCII]]-'A' is exactly the same as coding 65.
;object : A generic datatype which may contain any of the above (i.e. '''atom''', '''sequence''' or '''integer''') and which may be changed to another type during run-time.

There is no character [[string (computer science)|string]] data type. Strings are represented by a '''sequence''' of '''integer''' values. However, because literal strings are so commonly used in programming, Euphoria interprets double-quote enclosed characters as a sequence of integers. Thus
 &lt;code&gt;&quot;ABC&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
is seen as if the coder had written:
 &lt;code&gt;{'A', 'B', 'C'}&lt;/code&gt;
which is the same as:
 &lt;code&gt;{65,66,67}&lt;/code&gt;

==Hello World==
  &lt;code&gt;puts(1,&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

==Examples==
'''Note:''' Comments start with a double dash &quot;--&quot; and go through the end of line.

The following code looks for an old item in a group of items. If found, it removes it by concatenating all the elements prior to it with all the elements after it. Note that the first element in a sequence has the index one [1] and that $ refers to the length (i.e. total number of elements) of the sequence.

 &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;global function&lt;/font&gt; delete_item( &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;object&lt;/font&gt; old, &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;sequence&lt;/font&gt; group )
    &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/font&gt; pos
              &lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;-- Code begins --&lt;/font&gt;
    pos = &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;find&lt;/font&gt;( old, group )
    &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;if&lt;/font&gt; pos &gt; 0 &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;then&lt;/font&gt;
        group = group[1 .. pos-1] &amp; group[pos+1 .. $]
    &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;end if
    return&lt;/font&gt; group
 &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;end function&lt;/font&gt;

The following modification to the above example replaces an old item with a new item. As the variables ''old'' and ''new'' have been defined as objects, they could be '''atoms''' or '''sequences'''. Type checking is not required as the function will work with any sequence of data of any type and requires no external libraries.

 &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;global function&lt;/font&gt; replace_item( &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;object&lt;/font&gt; old, &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;object&lt;/font&gt; new, &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;sequence&lt;/font&gt; group )
    &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/font&gt; pos
              &lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;-- Code begins --&lt;/font&gt;
    pos = &lt;font color=&quot;#ff00ff&quot;&gt;find&lt;/font&gt;( old, group )
    &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;if&lt;/font&gt; pos &gt; 0 &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;then&lt;/font&gt;
        group[pos] = new
    &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;end if
    return&lt;/font&gt; group
 &lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;end function&lt;/font&gt;

Furthermore, no pointers are involved and subscripts are automatically checked. Thus the function cannot access memory out-of-bounds. There is no need to allocate or deallocate memory explicitly and no chance of a memory leak.

The line

 &lt;code&gt;group = group[1 .. pos-1] &amp; group[pos+1 .. $]&lt;/code&gt;

shows some of the '''sequence''' handling facilities. A '''sequence''' may contain a collection of any types, and this can be sliced (to take a subset of the data in a '''sequence''') and concatenated in expressions with no need for special functions.

==Parameter passing==
Arguments to routines are always passed by value; there is no pass-by-reference facility. However, parameters are allowed to be modified ''locally'' (i.e. within the callee) which is implemented very efficiently as sequences have automatic [[copy-on-write]] semantics. In other words, when you pass a sequence to a routine, initially only a reference to it is passed, but at the point the routine modifies this sequence parameter the sequence is copied and the routine updates only a copy of the original.
