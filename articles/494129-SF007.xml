'''LinuxQuestions.org''' (commonly abbreviated '''LQ''') is a community-driven, self-help [[Website|web site]] for [[Linux]] users. As of August 2011, it has over 462,200 registered members. Started in [[2000]] by Jeremy Garcia, LQ is one of the most popular [[free software community]] sites and is usually reputed for helpfulness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jordomedia.com/RSS/l_op=viewrss/lid=110713.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linuxquestions.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular section of the site are the [[Internet forum|forum]]s, where [[Linux]] users can share their knowledge and experience. Newcomers to the Linux world (often called [[newbie]]s) can ask questions and Linux experts can offer advice. Topics include [[Computer security|security]], installation, and [[Computer network|networking]]. Currently available forums fall into the following categories: LinuxQuestions.org, Linux, Enterprise Linux, Other *NIX Forums, Non-*NIX Forums. As of April 2009, the forums had more than 3.5 million posts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jordomedia.com/RSS/l_op=viewrss/lid=110713.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linuxquestions.org&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2004, LinuxQuestions.org set up a [[wiki]] aimed at building the largest online Linux [[knowledge base]]. The software used for this task is [[MediaWiki]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

LQ also has a section where one can download [[Compact Disc|CD]]/[[DVD]] [[ISO image]]s of Linux installation and [[Live CD]]s. Other than the download section and forums LQ also has the following sections:
* Linux [[Podcast]]
* LQ [[Radio]]
* [[Linux distribution]]s [[review]]s
* [[Book review]]s
* Linux [[Tutorial]]s
* Linux [[hardware compatibility list]]
* Articles (member written and submitted)
* Linux [[Internet bookmark|Bookmarks]]
* Member [[Blog]]s
&lt;ref&gt;http://iso.linuxquestions.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its growth, it is still essentially run by one person &amp;mdash; owner and founder Jeremy Garcia &amp;mdash; with help from a team of [[Forum moderator|moderators]].  LQ is active in the community, often having either a stall or presence at [[:Category:Linux conferences|Linux conferences]] or expositions. These are primarily in the [[United States]], but have also been in the [[United Kingdom]] and in [[Canada]].
