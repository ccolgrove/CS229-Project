==Personal life==
Evan Lysacek was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and raised in [[Naperville, Illinois]]. His mother, Tanya ([[nÃ©e]] Santoro), is a [[substitute teacher]] in Naperville, and his father, Don, is a [[General contractor|building contractor]].&lt;ref name=lseben/&gt; He has an older sister, Laura, and a younger sister, Christina, who played on a nationally ranked [[volleyball]] team.&lt;ref name=usfsa/&gt; His cousin Cole Chason is a former punter for the [[Clemson Tigers]].&lt;ref name=chason/&gt; Lysacek graduated from [[Neuqua Valley High School]] in 2003. During high school, Lysacek was a member of the [[Honors student|honor roll]], where he earned a number of academic achievement awards, including the Presidential Award for Academic Excellence in 1999.&lt;ref name=usfsa/&gt; 

Lysacek is of [[Italian people|Italian]]&lt;ref name=chat/&gt; and [[Czechs|Czech]] descent; his great-grandfather FrantiÅ¡ek LysÃ¡Äek, emigrated from [[Czechoslovakia]] to Chicago in 1925.&lt;ref name=czech/&gt; He is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christian]],&lt;ref name=chat/&gt; having stated that one of his most prized possessions is his [[Patriarchal cross#Other variations|Orthodox cross]].&lt;ref name=nbcolympics/&gt; He wears Graf [[Figure skate|figure skating boots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC Olympic Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;

Lysacek moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], in 2003 following his graduation from high school. He trains at the [[Toyota Sports Center]] in [[El Segundo, California]]. He also has a home in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=ct111028/&gt;

Lysacek studies acting, having taken [[method acting]] classes at the Professional Arts School in [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; He appeared in the [[independent film|independent]] [[short film]] ''Skate Great!'', playing a Russian Olympic gold medalist.&lt;ref name=gmiho/&gt; Lysacek uses [[power yoga]] as conditioning training.&lt;ref name=vhallett/&gt;

==Career==
Lysacek began skating at the age of eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldenskate April 2004&quot;/&gt; His grandmother had always wanted to be in the [[Ice Capades]], so she bought him skates for [[Christmas]]. He originally wanted to play [[hockey]], so his mother enrolled him and his sister Laura in figure-skating lessons to learn how to skate. Lysacek was soon competing as a figure skater.

===Early career===
In 1996, Lysacek won the U.S. national title at the [[Figure skating competition#Qualifying competitions in the United States|Juvenile level]] â the lowest qualifying level in the [[U.S. Figure Skating]] competition structure. In 1997, he moved up to Intermediate and won the pewter medal (fourth place) at the Junior Olympics, after winning both his regional and his sectional qualifying competitions. After failing to qualify for Nationals on the novice level in 1998,&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; Lysacek won the U.S. Novice title at the [[1999 United States Figure Skating Championships|1999 U.S. Championships]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nationals - novice level&quot;/&gt; at the age of thirteen.

===Junior career===
====1999â2000 season====
In the 1999â2000 season, Lysacek made his international junior debut and competed on the [[1999-2000 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] circuit. He placed seventh at his first event and then won his second event. He was the third alternate to the 1999â2000 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final.&lt;ref name=9900jgpf/&gt;

At the [[2000 United States Figure Skating Championships|2000 U.S. Championships]], Lysacek won the Junior title&lt;ref name=&quot;nationals - junior level&quot;/&gt; at the age of fourteen. He placed fifth in the short program and first in the free skate, placing first overall. He was the first male skater since [[Terry Kubicka]] to win back-to-back Novice and Junior Men's titles in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldenskate April 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPO Oct 04&quot;/&gt; The win on the junior level was unusual in that Lysacek moved from third to first overall while sitting backstage, because he won through a tiebreak in the 6.0 ordinal system.&lt;ref name=lshontz/&gt; Lysacek was tied with [[Parker Pennington]] in second place ordinals and had one more first place ordinal, giving him the win in the free skate in the Total Ordinals of Majority tiebreaker, which pushed him ahead in overall factored placements, allowing him to win the title overall.&lt;ref name=00usnat/&gt; Following the U.S. Championships, he was assigned to the 2000 [[Gardena Spring Trophy]] in [[UrtijÃ«i]] where he won the silver medal on the junior level.

====2000â2001 season====
Lysacek had a strong showing in the 2000â2001 season. He competed in his second season on the [[2000â2001 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] circuit and won two silver medals. He was the 7th qualifier for the 2000â2001 Junior Grand Prix Final&lt;ref name=0001jgpf/&gt; and placed 8th at the Final.

He made his senior national debut at the [[2001 United States Figure Skating Championships|2001 U.S. Championships]], placing 12th at the age of fifteen. Lysacek was named second alternate to the US team to the [[2001 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2001 World Junior Championships]] and was placed on the team after [[Ryan Bradley]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldenskate April 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt010302/&gt; withdrew due to injury. Lysacek performed two clean programs and came in second behind fellow American [[Johnny Weir]], giving the United States a gold and a silver on the World Junior podium for the first time since 1987.&lt;ref name=01jw/&gt;&lt;ref name=01jwb/&gt;

====2001-2002 season====
Over the next season, Lysacek dealt with several injuries, including broken ribs, which resulted in lost training time. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the [[United States Figure Skating Association]] cancelled the [[2001-2002 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] event to be held in Arizona&lt;ref name=arizona/&gt; and did not allow its junior skaters to compete on the Junior Grand Prix circuit for the rest of that season.&lt;ref name=allwd/&gt; At the [[2002 United States Figure Skating Championships|2002 U.S. Championships]], Lysacek repeated his 12th-place finish from the previous year and was not selected for the team to the [[2002 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2002 World Junior Championships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldenskate April 2004&quot;/&gt; He was sent to the 2002 [[Triglav Trophy]] in April, where he won the gold medal on the junior level.&lt;ref name=02triglav/&gt;

====2002-2003 season====
After that, Lysacek changed his diet and his training habits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldenskate April 2004&quot;/&gt; In the 2002â2003 season, he competed on the [[2002â2003 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] circuit and won two silver medals. He was the 4th qualifier for the 2002â2003 Junior Grand Prix Final,&lt;ref name=0203jgpf/&gt; where he placed 5th. For the [[2003 United States Figure Skating Championships|2003 U.S. Championships]], his goal had been to place in the top ten. He achieved this with a 7th-place finish.

Lysacek was named third alternate for the [[2003 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2003 Four Continents Championships]] and was placed on the team after other skaters withdrew. He placed 10th at this event in his senior international debut. He was also named to the [[2003 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2003 Junior Worlds]] team; following the withdrawal of [[Parker Pennington]], the higher-ranked man on the two-man team, Lysacek was the only United States men's skater at the competition. He landed his first clean [[axel jump|triple axel jump]] of his career in the qualifying round of this competition and his second clean one in the free skate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldenskate April 2004&quot;/&gt;

====2003-2004 season====
[[Image:Evan lysacek.jpg|thumb|right|Lysacek at the [[2004 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2004 Four Continents]]]]
After graduating from high school in 2003, Lysacek made a coaching change and began to work with [[Ken Congemi]] and [[Frank Carroll]] in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[California]]. With Congemi and Carroll, Lysacek won both of his [[2003â2004 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] events.&lt;ref name=walshb/&gt; He was the second qualifier to the 2003â2004 Junior Grand Prix Final&lt;ref name=0304jgpf/&gt; and won the event. He placed 5th at the [[2004 United States Figure Skating Championships|2004 U.S. Championships]]. At the [[2004 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2004 Four Continents]] he won the bronze medal, his first senior-level international medal. He then went on to compete at the [[2004 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2004 World Junior Championships]], where he won a third silver medal.

===Senior career===
====2004â2005 season====

In the 2004â2005 season, having aged out of the junior level at age 19, Evan Lysacek made his senior international debut. Skating through a hip injury,&lt;ref name=apart/&gt; Lysacek placed fifth at the [[2004 Skate America]], the first Grand Prix event of his career. He repeated that placement a few weeks later at the [[2004 Cup of Russia]]. At the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|2005 U.S. Championships]], Lysacek won the bronze medal after receiving the only [[6.0 scoring system|6.0]] of his career for his short program.&lt;ref name=ldewa/&gt; He went on to win his first senior international title at the [[2005 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2005 Four Continents]]. He competed next at the [[2005 World Figure Skating Championships|2005 World Championships]] in [[Moscow]]. There, he won a surprising bronze medal at his first senior World Championships, a competition for which his goal had been only to qualify for the free skate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune Jan 06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ldwbronze/&gt;

====2005â2006 season====

In the 2005â2006 season, Lysacek again competed on the Grand Prix. He placed second at the [[2005 Skate America]], but it was clear that his ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' free skate was not working. Lysacek and coach [[Frank Carroll]] made the decision to find a new long program.&lt;ref name=oldie/&gt; Lysacek's new ''Carmen'' program was a success at the [[2005 NHK Trophy]], where Lysacek placed second. Lysacek was the only American man to qualify for the [[2005â2006 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2005â2006 Grand Prix Final]],&lt;ref name=05gpfq/&gt; but he withdrew before the event because of [[bursitis]] and [[tendinitis]] in his right hip.&lt;ref name=05gpfwd/&gt;

At the [[2006 United States Figure Skating Championships|2006 U.S. Championships]], the [[de-facto]] Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but pulled up to win the free skate, finishing second overall. He was named to the [[2006 Winter Olympic]] team along with [[Johnny Weir]] and [[Matthew Savoie]].&lt;ref name=06olyteam/&gt; At the Olympics, following a 10th-place finish in the short program, Lysacek became sick with the stomach flu. Unable to practice, he stayed in bed at the Olympic village, receiving fluids from [[Intravenous therapy|IV]]s. After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate.&lt;ref name=jcarn/&gt; He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on ''[[Olympic Ice]]'' the next day with [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]] and [[Mary Carillo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; 

Lysacek ended his season by winning the bronze medal at the [[2006 World Figure Skating Championships|2006 World Championships]] in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. He was once again troubled by illness, having been administered three different antibiotics to fight a bacterial infection, which at one point, caused him to cough up blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;USFS1&quot;/&gt; He rose from seventh place in the short to finish third on the strength of his free-skating program. After the World Championships, Lysacek toured with [[Champions on Ice]] as a full member of the cast.

====2006â2007 season====

In the 2006â2007 season, Lysacek placed second at the [[2006 Skate America]]. Two weeks later, Lysacek won the gold medal at the [[2006 Cup of China]] by a 20-point margin.&lt;ref name=06coc/&gt; He was the fourth qualifier for the [[2006â2007 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2006â2007 Grand Prix Final]]&lt;ref name=06gpfq/&gt; in his second consecutive year in qualifying for the event. However, he withdrew from the competition before he was to skate his short program due to an injury to his hip.&lt;ref name=06gpfwd/&gt;

Lysacek resumed training a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; At the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]], he performed his first clean short program of the season, then went on to land his first clean quadruple jump in competition, a quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop jump, in the long program, to win his first national title.&lt;ref name=07usn/&gt; A week later, Lysacek competed in the [[2007 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2007 Four Continents]]. He was fourth after the short program, but made yet another comeback in the free skate, landing a clean quadruple combination, to earn a new personal best and to win his second Four Continents title.

At the [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Championships]], Lysacek made his first attempt at landing a quadruple jump in the short program. He attempted a quad-triple, but stepped out of the quad and put his hand down, and followed it with a double.&lt;ref name=07wclatsp/&gt;&lt;ref name=07wcctsp/&gt; He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a [[three turn]] after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended.&lt;ref name=07wlatlp/&gt; He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.

Lysacek toured over the summer of 2007 with [[Champions on Ice]] for the second consecutive year.

====2007â2008 season====

Lysacek began the 2007â2008 season at the [[2007 Skate America]]. He underrotated and fell on an attempted quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop&lt;ref name=jiggy/&gt; in the short program, receiving only one point for that element.&lt;ref name=07sasp/&gt; He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate,&lt;ref name=07sares/&gt; landing a clean quadruple jump,&lt;ref name=07safsprot/&gt; but was unable to pull up to first overall, due to [[Daisuke Takahashi]]'s twelve point lead after the short program.&lt;ref name=spil07sa/&gt; He went on to the [[2007 Cup of China]], where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points.&lt;ref name=07cocsp/&gt; He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.&lt;ref name=07coclp/&gt;

At the [[2007â2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2007â2008 Grand Prix Final]], Lysacek was credited with a quadruple jump in both his programs&lt;ref name=07gpfsp/&gt;&lt;ref name=07gpflp/&gt; and won the bronze medal overall, after placing third in both segments of the competition.&lt;ref name=07gpfres/&gt; He earned a new overall personal best of 229.78 points. 

At the [[2008 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]], Lysacek was second after the short program and won the free skate.

His next event was the [[2008 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2008 Four Continents]], where he placed second in the short program and third in the free skate, and finished third overall. Lysacek was also named to the team for the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|2008 World Championships]]. A week before the event, he was forced to withdraw due to an injury sustained while attempting a [[triple axel]]; the blade broke off of his boot and he injured the left side of his body, from his forearm to his shoulder, and required a cast.&lt;ref name=08wch/&gt; Lysacek toured over the summer of 2008 with the [[Stars on Ice]] tour.

Lysacek did not skate competitively in [[2010â2011 figure skating season|2010â2011]] but did not announce a retirement. In June 2011, he received two Grand Prix assignments for the [[2011â2012 figure skating season|2011â2012 season]] â [[2011 Skate America]] and [[2011 TrophÃ©e Eric Bompard]]. He resumed training with Frank Carroll at Lake Arrowhead, California, and his publicist said he would make a decision whether to compete later in the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ct062711&quot;/&gt; In September, he announced that his goal was to participate in the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=si110924/&gt; In October, [[U.S. Figure Skating]] announced that he would not compete at the [[2011 Skate America]] due to a financial disagreement, and Lysacek confirmed that he would not take part in the Grand Prix series, explaining on his twitter that &quot;a suitable agreement could not be reached between US Figure Skating and myself by the event entry deadline&quot;.&lt;ref name=usfs111014/&gt;&lt;ref name=ct111014/&gt;&lt;ref name=nolys/&gt;&lt;ref name=ct111028/&gt; In November, Lysacek confirmed he would not enter the [[2012 United States Figure Skating Championships|2012 U.S. Championships]].&lt;ref name=ctnov2211/&gt;

==Coaching changes==

[[Image:Evan Lysacek and Frank Carroll 2007-2008 GPF.jpg|thumb|right|Lysacek with coach [[Frank Carroll]] at the [[2007â2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final]]. He won the bronze medal at this event. Lysacek has been coached by Carroll since June 2003.]]

Evan Lysacek was originally coached by Candice Brown in Naperville.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU archive&quot;/&gt; After that, he worked with Deborah Stoery in [[Naperville, Illinois]] and [[Addison, Illinois]] for three years. For the next two years, he had an arrangement where he would train under both Addison-based [[Maria JeÅ¼ak-Athey]] and Moscow-based [[Viktor Kudriavtsev]]. Kudriavtsev would come to Chicago for part of the year to coach, and Lysacek spent his summers at Kudriavtsev's summer training camps in [[Moscow|Moscow, Russia]] and [[Flims|Flims, Switzerland]]. When that arrangement proved untenable, Kudriavtsev recommended Lysacek to Carroll, who agreed to coach Lysacek on the condition that Lysacek would work more with Congemi than with himself, due to Carroll's commitments to [[Timothy Goebel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldenskate April 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune Jan 06&quot;/&gt; Lysacek moved to [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[California]] to work with [[Frank Carroll]] and [[Ken Congemi]] in June 2003. Lysacek worked with both Congemi and Carroll through the 2006/2007 season, after which he began working solely with Carroll. He has also trained with ballerina Galina Barinova.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday-artistry&quot;/&gt;

Lysacek has worked with many choreographers over the years, including Oleg Epstein&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU archive&quot;/&gt; and [[Kurt Browning]]. Both his programs for the 2007â2008 season were choreographed by [[Lori Nichol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; He worked with [[Tatiana Tarasova]] on his programs for the 2008â2009 season.&lt;ref name=mbrown0806/&gt; He returned to Nichol for the 2009â2010 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday-artistry&quot;/&gt;

==Endorsements and public life==

Lysacek supports a number of [[charitable organization|charities]]. He participated in Target â A Time for Heroes, a celebrity charity event benefiting the [[Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation]].&lt;ref name=timeforheroes/&gt; He also supports the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] (Jimmy Fund).&lt;ref name=usfsa/&gt; He began supporting Figure Skating in Harlem in 2006 and is a board member of the charity.&lt;ref name=harlem/&gt; Lysacek attended their 2009 benefit gala in New York City.

Lysacek is a spokesperson for [[Total Gym]]. Following his win at the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships]], Lysacek began being sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[Ralph Lauren]].&lt;ref name=&quot;espn-curse&quot;/&gt; In 2011, he switched agents from International Management Group to Creative Artists Agency.&lt;ref name=ct111028/&gt;

===Costumes===
In the past, Lysacek has worn costumes designed by [[Christian Dior S.A.|Christian Dior]],&lt;ref name=dior/&gt; [[Gianfranco Ferre]],&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-hope&quot;/&gt; [[Alexander McQueen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-hope&quot;/&gt; and [[Vera Wang]], American fashion designer and former figure skater. Wang created the mock tuxedo Lysacek wore when he won the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Championships]].&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt; Lysacek and Wang also collaborated to design his costumes for the 2010 Winter Olympics, as well as those worn for the rest of the 2009â2010 season.&lt;ref name=mhendricks/&gt;&lt;ref name=instyle/&gt;

=== ''Dancing with the Stars'' ===
