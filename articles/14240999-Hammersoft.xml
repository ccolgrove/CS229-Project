'''Chris Randall''' is an American musician, and the former frontman of [[Sister Machine Gun]]. In 1998, he created a side-project called Micronaut, focusing on more instrumental music that was not necessarily appropriate for Sister Machine Gun.
After disbanding Sister Machine Gun in 2007, he began his solo career and released the EP ''Cheap Sensation'' and the full-length album ''The Devil His Due''.  Chris also collaborates with Wade Alin from [[Christ Analogue]] on the IDM project Scanalyzer.

In 1998, he founded [[Positron records]].
He also runs Audio Damage, a creator of music software plug-ins.
