==Connect Wellingborough==

'''''Connect Wellingborough''''' is the brand name of five bus routes in the town of [[Wellingborough]] in [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]]. The buses are operated by Stagecoach and [[Centrebus]] but are owned by [[Northamptonshire County Council]]. When the brand was established in 2006, there were eight routes which had new route numbers (which can be identified with 'W'), buses with new green colours, new bus stop signage, and later daily finishing times. Before ''Connect Wellingborough'' all buses were part of Stagecoach, all buses had the Stagecoach livery, and some routes finished at around 1500. From May 2011, routes W5 to The Priory, W6 to Redhill Grange &amp; W7 to Senwick were withdrawn and several others revised due to Northamptonshire County Council funding cuts. Centrebus also started operating route W3 (from Stagecoach) &amp; routes W4/W8 (from [[First Northampton]]).
