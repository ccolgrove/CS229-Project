==Prologue of a Legend~Hercules Factory Arc==
[[Image:Mantaro Kinniku.jpg|thumbnail|Mantaro Muscle]]
;Mantaro Kinniku (ã­ã³èä¸å¤ªé ''Kinniku MantarÅ'') / Mantaro Kinnikuman/Mantaro Muscle (Kid Muscle) &lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:KinnikuFlag.svg|20px]] --&gt;
: [[SeiyÅ«]]: [[Masaya Onosaka]]/[[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]] (US). Homeland: [[Planet Kinniku]], Age: 14 (Choujin Olympics: 15, Ultimate Tag: 16), Height: 176cm/5'9&quot;, Weight: 83kg/189lbs., Chojin Power: 930,000. The main character of the story. He is the 59th prince of Planet Muscle (Planet Kinniku) and son the first Kinnikuman, Suguru Muscle and Belinda/Bibinba. Raised during times of peace, he is a spoiled, cowardly, lazy teenager, much like his father was at the beginning of the first series except with more emphasis on cowardice and less on clumsiness. He usually start matches off in a cowardly state, only managing to get a few good moves in due to luck. However, when his friends are in trouble or his opponent is being dishonorable, he manages to reach the state of [[Kinnikuman#Terminology|Kajiba no Kuso Djikara]] (Burning Inner Strength). When this happens, the Niku-Mark appears on his forehead and his strength, stamina, and technique increase many fold. Because Suguru had his records annulled years ago, Mantaro never knew how great a hero his father really was until he met Alexandria Meat. Mantaro was named after Ultraman Taro (Ultraman + Taro/Kinniku + Mantaro). Mantaro's favorite wrestling move is his father's signature move, the Kinniku Buster (sometimes called the ''Butt Buster'' in the English dub, though it actually translates to Muscle Buster) which he won much of his wrestling matches with until he gains his own signature move, ''Muscle Millennium''. Mantaro is rather lecherous and lusts after many girls, but his main love interest is [[Rinko Nikaido]] (Roxanne). His favorite food is [[galbi]] bowl (Beef and Rice), which he often sings about.

:In the Japanese version of the anime, Mantaro has a habit of adding {{nihongo|Muscle|ããã¹ã«|''Massuru''}} at the end of certain words and sentences in place of the standard {{nihongo|masu|ã¾ã}}. For example, {{nihongo|Itadaki-masu|ããã ãã¾ã}}, a common [[Japanese language|Japanese]] phrase said before eating, becomes {{nihongo|Itadaki-MUSCLE|ããã ãããã¹ã«|''Itadaki Massuru''}}.

;Terry the Kid (ããªã¼ã»ã¶ã»ã­ãã ''Te-ri Za Kiddo'') / Terry &quot;The Grand&quot; Kenyon  {{flagicon|USA}}
: [[Seiyuu]]: [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]], [[Ai Nonaka]] (young)/[[Frank Frankson]] (US). Height: 190cm/6'2&quot;, Weight: 86kg/191.1lbs, Choujin Power: 1,050,000. Terry is the son of the Texas wrestler Legend, [[Terryman]] and Natsuko ShÅno, a Japanese reporter. Kid always believed that Suguru Muscle stole the fame from his father, and held a grudge against the Muscles because of it, saying that he will come in first place to Mantaro Muscle and prove that his family is better. He even hated his father because of all this, and always said that he is nothing like him. After he learns about the power of friendship, he changes his ways and becomes best friends with Mantaro, but he still works independently now and then. Kid has a soft spot for many things, and is always willing to support his team. He even gave up the Chojin Olympics to save a little boy from drowning. Even though his family's moves aren't much of a powerhouse as others, he is still able to do critical damage on his opponent by using technical wrestling and submission holds.

:Like Terryman, he will sometimes refer to others as {{nihongo|'''You'''|ã¦ã¼|''YÅ«''}} and himself in the [[grammatical person|first person]] as {{nihongo|'''Me'''|ãã¼|''MÄ«''}}. As his father was frequently referred to as {{nihongo|'''Terry'''|ããªã¼|''TerÄ«''}} in the original series, Terry the Kid is usually referred to as {{nihongo|'''Kid'''|ã­ãã|''Kiddo''}} in order to [[Differentiation (linguistics)|differentiate]] the two of them.

;Seiuchin (ã»ã¤ã¦ãã³ ''Seiuchin'') / Wally Tusket {{flagicon|Ireland}}
: '''[[SeiyÅ«]]:''' [[Takumi Yamazaki]] ([[GinzÅ Matsuo]] in first movie)/[[Maddie Blaustein|Madeline Blaustein]] (US). Height: 193cm/6'3&quot;, Weight: 145kg/322.2lbs, Choujin Power: 910,000. A big [[Ireland|Irish]] [[walrus]] ('''seiuchi''' is [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for [[walrus]]). A [[walrus]] Chojin, Wally is the friendlier and easygoing member of the New Generation. He greatly admires Mantaro Muscle, and in many ways is a lot like him, the two of them always being hungry and seen eating food all the time.  Wally cares greatly for his family, who often come to watch his matches. He is the Number 2 student of the Hercules Factory First Years and has a lot of heart and spirit, but his kind and gentle personalty can lead to weaknesses in the ring. He is originally assigned to defend Hokkaido, an area in Japan best fitted for Wally's enivronment. In the current story arc, Wally has grown sick of Mantaro's numerous thoughtless remarks about him and leaves the Seigi Chojin side to form the '''Hell Expansions''' with Neptuneman. Neptuneman awakens Wally's ferocious [[Instinct|animal instinct]], transforming him into a blood thirsty beast. Ever since, Wally has appeared as an enemy of Mantaro and the others.

:In the Japanese version, Seiuchin refers to himself in the [[grammatical person|first person]] as '''{{nihongo|Ora|ãªã©}}''' instead of the more common '''{{nihongo|Ore|ãªã¬}}'''. He refers to Mantaro as '''{{nihongo|[[Aniki]]|ã¢ãã­}}''', a term of respect for (in this case) someone considered a brother.

;Gazelleman (ã¬ã¼ã«ãã³ ''Gazeruman'') / Dik-Dik Van-Dik {{flagicon|Tanzania}}
: '''[[SeiyÅ«]]:''' [[Yasunori Masutani]]/[[Eric Stuart]] (US). Height: 205cm/6'7&quot;, Weight: 136kg/302.2lbs, Chojin Power: 1,000,000. A [[Tanzania]]n [[gazelle]]-type wrestler. Dik-Dik started out as being ranked #1 in the Hercules Factory Graduates, being quite skilled in battle and very handsome. He was originally assigned to protect [[Tokyo]], Japan with Mantaro Muscle. Though being the highest graduate, Dik-Dik is known for losing pretty much all of his battles miserably against any opponent, and eventually becomes comedy relief who chooses not to always support Mantaro, who he usually sees as a lazy. His role is more prominent in the anime than the original manga, where he had more appearances along with other supporting characters who also appear more so in the anime. Though Dik-Dik has made his role somewhat of a loser after a while, he does have his spotlights throughout the series, being there for his teammates and giving support in their fights. His known trademark technique is Antler Fist, an attack where he places a glove with antlers on them onto his right fist and leaps into the air, sending a powerful fist into his opponent plus his ultimate move the savannah heat. His English name is a reference to the [[dik-dik]] and to the actor [[Dick Van Dyke]].

He is named after [[George Adamski]]. Ranked Number Four in the Hercules Factory. He was originally assigned to the [[Tohoku region]].

He is the son of British super-wrestler [[Robin Mask]] and Alisa Mackintosh. He hated his father's strict upbringing, so he ran away when he was 8 and joined the d.M.p (although their relationship has gotten better since the ChÅjin Olympics). He refers to his father as '''{{nihongo|Daddy|ããã£}}'''. During [[Mantaro Kinniku]]'s first two matches on [[earth]], he showed that he cared deeply about honour and that he had a soft spot inside him which was rarely shown. He is sometimes known as 'every girl's knight in shining armour' this was particularly because of his mask which was a bluish-grey knight-like helmet. Kevin's English accent is one of the traits that girls find attractive about him. On his back is a '''Spider Nest [[Tattoo]]''' which was added during his AkugyÅ ChÅjin days. The image of each ChÅjin he defeats is added to the tattoo. This continues even after he leaves the d.M.p. Kevin also possesses his own version of the Kinniku Clan's [[Kinnikuman#Terminology|Kajiba no Kuso Djikara]] called '''[[Maelstrom]] Power'''. The name Kevin Mask is a play on a major wrestling star [[Kevin Nash]].

: '''[[seiyÅ«]]:''' [[Tomohiro Nishimura]]/[[Eric Stuart]] (US). A walking, talking [[cell phone]] from [[Hong Kong]]. He is Mantarou's debut match opponent and his weakness is water and other liquids. When he was up against Mantaro, rain devastated him and his phone lines cut off from the tournament which resulted a lead to Mantaro's victory. His name comes from [[teru teru bozu]], a doll made from a tied up piece of cloth that ensures skies stay clear and rain doesn't fall.

;MAXman (ããã¯ã¹ãã³ ''Makkusu Man'') / Pumpinator  {{flagicon|USA}}
: '''[[seiyÅ«]]:''' [[Tetsu Inada]]/[[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] (US). The grandson of [[Sneagator]] (Shocadile), an old-generation [[Akuma Choujin]] that was defeated by Mantaro's father. He can transform into a giant [[athletic shoe]].

;Rex King (ã¬ãã¯ã¹ã»ã­ã³ã° ''Rekkusu Kingu'') / Tyrannoclaw  {{flagicon|USA}}
: '''[[seiyÅ«]]:''' [[Shinichiro Ohta]]/[[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]] (US). One of Sunshine's star pupils, Rex King is from the [[United States]]. His right arm is actually a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' head and neck, known as the '''{{nihongo|[[Jurassic]] Hand|ã¸ã¥ã©ã·ãã¯ãã³ã}}'''. In truth, he is actually a dinosaur and his &quot;Jurassic Hand&quot; is his real head and what appears to be his &quot;head&quot; is a fake and it only stores his brain. After fighting Terry for a while, he was put into a strangle hold that started fossilizing his Dinosaur hand. He pummeled Terry the Kid with his brutal attacks, but Mantaro helped out Terry by telling chillingly bad jokes (coldness being a dinosaur's weakness) and ended up having his head crushed to bits by Terry's finishing move. He bears a resemblance to [[Beast Wars]]' [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]].

;Check Mate (ãã§ãã¯ã¡ã¤ã ''Chekkumeito'')  {{flagicon|Monaco}}
: '''[[seiyÅ«]]:''' [[Kouichi Toochika]]/[[Wayne Grayson]] (US). Height: 221cm/7'2.5&quot;, Weight: 190-800kg/422.2-1777.78lbs, Choujin Power: 1,210,000. An Akugyo Chojin from [[Monaco]] trained by Sunshine. At first he is a sadist that is incapable of feeling pain, this is however his greatest weakness as his body itself is being damaged, he simply cannot feel it. But after being bested by Mantaro, he turns over a new leaf and became a New Generation Seigi Chojin. In the Ultimate Choujin Tag Arc he turned down Seiuchin's offer to form a tag team. Because of this, he became the first victim of Seiuchin and Neptuneman's '''Optical Fiber Cross Bomber''', resulting in the skin on his face being peeled off. His attacks are modeled after chess pieces for King, Knight, and Rook. He can fuse them and his normal form together in a technique known as ''Grand Slam''. When [[Reborn Ashuraman]] and the Demon Seed separate [[Alexandria Meat|Meat]]'s body in order to revive [[General Terror]], Check Mate joins forces with [[Jade (Kinnikuman)|Jade]] to help [[Kevin Mask]] train for his match against Voltman.

;Jade (ã¸ã§ã¤ã ''Jeido'') / Jeager (anime only)  {{flagicon|DEU}}
: '''[[Seiyuu]]:''' [[Kenji Nojima]], [[Fumiko Orikasa]] (young)/[[Wayne Grayson]] (US). Height: 187cm/6'1&quot;, Weight: 93kg/206.67lbs, Choujin Power: 950,000. [[Brocken Jr.]]'s [[Germany|German]] pupil, first introduced as a member of Generation EX. His nickname is &quot;Berlin's Green Arrow&quot;, as he wears a green uniform and bicyclist's helmet. An orphan, he was raised by an elderly couple, who were subsequently slain by a trio of anti-superhuman thugs. This incident was what inspired Jade to seek Brocken's guidance in becoming a champion for those unable to defend themselves. (In the English dub of the anime, he is later revealed to be Brocken's son, though this is not the case in the English manga.) Jade's ultimate attack is Brocken's &quot;The Red Rain of Pain&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Red Rain of Berlin&quot;, a chop-like attack capable of cutting right through a superhuman's body). According to Brocken, it works on the principle of &quot;cutting the flesh to cut the meat, cutting the meat to cut the bone, cutting the bone to cut the core&quot;. However, Jade's version differs from Brocken's in that Jade actually causes a blade to protrude from his hand before slashing, and his hand/arm is usually engulfed in flames before he delivers the attack. Jade's second favourite move is the &quot;Beefcake Hammer&quot;, where he shifts behind the opponent, raises one of his opponent's legs and crosses the opponent's arms around it before executing a leaping suplex. In a grueling concrete deathmatch, Jade is defeated by Scarface in [[Maui]], [[Hawaii]], and fails to enter the finals. Though Scarface twists off Jade's right arm, it is later reattached. He later participates in the Chojin Crown. Unfortunately, he suffers another defeat, this time to yet another dMp member in disguise; Ricardo.

==Part 2: Ultimate Choujin Tag Arc==
;Muscle Brothers Nouveau (ããã¹ã«ãã©ã¶ã¼ãºã»ãã¼ã´ã©ã¼)
: Team of '''Mantarou''' and [[Kinnikuman Great]] III ('''Chaos''').

:;Chaos (ã«ãªã¹)
:: A young man who grew up in the '''{{nihongo|Gakincho House|ãããã¡ããã¦ã¹}}''' [[orphanage]]. He is a huge Choujin [[Otaku]] and has an extensive collection of Choujin items, including [[Kinkeshi]] (M.U.S.C.L.E.) figurines. In order to earn money for his orphanage, he would take part in a [[bogus]] Choujin Wrestling show as '''{{nihongo|Butanikuman|ãã¿èãã³,|Porkman}}'''. After seeing his potential, Mantarou invites him to team up as the '''Muscle Brothers Nouveau''' and participate in the Ultimate Choujin Tag Tournament. Because he was a human he was not allowed to participate in the tournament, so he obtained the Kinnikuman Great mask in order to hide his identity and pose as a Choujin. Chaos is a very kind, although somewhat childish, character. Though he claims to be a human and not a Choujin, as a child a horn grew on the side of his head. Currently the horn is gone and in its place is a keyhole shaped hole, a characteristic shared with the '''{{nihongo|Jikan Choujin|æéè¶äºº,|Time Supermen}}'''. He works as a [[bogus]] Choujin Wrestler named '''{{nihongo|Butanikuman|ãã¿èãã³,|Porkman}}''', putting the money he earns into the '''{{nihongo|Gakincho House|ãããã¡ããã¦ã¹}}''' [[orphanage]] he grew up in. Although Chaos seems to have feelings for [[Rinko Nikaidou|Rinko]], he has a huge crush on singer [[Seiko Matsuda]] and has a collection of her merchandise. He appears to greatly admire [[Idol Choujin]] [[Geronimo (Kinnikuman)|Geronimo]] as a fellow &quot;human fighting alongside Choujins&quot;. When he was younger his parents and fellow villagers were murdered, the trauma of which causes him to occasionally go into spasms (at which point his fighting strength is weakened). On said occasions he is given a sedative (given in the same manner as [[asthma]] medication). He refers to himself in the [[grammatical person|first person]] as '''{{nihongo|Wachiki|ã¯ãã­}}''' (occasionally using the more common '''{{nihongo|Boku|ãã¯}}'''). When he overhears Meat encouraging Mantarou to give up on the tag team, he goes into shock and tries to run away. But in order to obtain the key (courage) to open his sealed memory, he returns to the tournament. The Great Mask still has the tear in the forehead from the [[Dream Tag Tournament]], so Chaos' hair sticks out.

:;Thunder (ãµã³ãã¼)
:: Time Choujin No. 2 and the bigger of the two. Like Lightning he is sly but focuses more on brute strength. Laugh: '''Nuwanuwanuwa'''. He usually wears an overbody with the face of a [[lion]] and the clothes of a [[Greek Mythology]] soldier. His left shoulder guard, which resembles a lion's paw, can be used as a giant claw. His left hand can transform into the Legendary Destruction Bell, but it was destroyed by Geronimo's Apache Death Scream. Trademark Techniques: Calamity Cross.

;The Machineguns (ã¶ã»ãã·ã³ã¬ã³ãº)
: Team of '''Kinnikuman''' and '''Terryman'''. They do not believe that Mantarou and Kid are their future sons and look down on them. Lately though, Terry has been softened. [[Geronimo]] and [[Brocken Jr.]] are serving as their seconds. Tag Techniques: Muscle Docking.

:;[[Warsman|Belmond]] (ãã«ã¢ã³ã) {{flagicon|USSR}}
:: Hells Bears No. 2 (colored black). Revealed to be Warsman during his battle against Team Cosmos. First believed so because of Mongolman's reaction towards him was similar to his reaction to Croe, where he feels pain in the scars he got from fis last fight with Warsman. After he punches Meteorman in a fist to fist attack, Meteorman gets a stabbing wound on his knuckles in the pattern of Warsman's Bear Claws. He also used the Storm Elbow technique and performs a Screw Driver when coming out of the bear costume.
