==History==
San Diego State University was originally two separate schools. San Diego Normal School had school colors of white and gold. San Diego Junior College had school colors of blue and gold. They decided to merge schools in 1921 to form San Diego State College. The first school colors of SDSC were blue, white and gold. During the 1921 school year they had their first football game.  The 1943-44 seasons were not played, due to the circumstances involving WWII.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} 

Years later the school decided to adopt purple and gold as the new school colors. However, local confusion between the Aztecs and St. Augustine High School forced the school to change their colors yet again. The school voted on new colors and landed on scarlet and black. It is now a very well known tradition that the Aztecs wear all black on home games.

===Night games===
Night games have become a San Diego State University football tradition. The first SDSU night game was played on September 25, 1930 at Lane Field. Over 5,000 fans attended the game to watch the Aztecs beat the San Diego Marines 39-0. Since that day, over 75% of all Aztec games, home and away, have been played at night.

After seven games in the 2009 season, Hoke has led the Aztecs to a 3-4 record and a sixth place standing in the Mountain West Conference. In 2010, Hoke led the Aztecs to the school's first nine-win season since 1971 and a victory over Navy in the 2010 Poinsettia Bowl. Hoke left in January 11, 2011 for Michigan.
