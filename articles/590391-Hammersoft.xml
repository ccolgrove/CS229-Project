The school mascot, which was suggested by former Dean of Student Affairs Emeritus George F. Ralston, is a Colonel and the official colors are blue and yellow.  The campus symbol is a letter &quot;W&quot; known as the &quot;flying W&quot; by students and alumni.

==History and Expansion==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Wilkes University was first established in 1933 by [[Bucknell University]] under the name &quot;Bucknell Junior College&quot; (BUJC) in [[Wilkes-Barre, PA|Wilkes-Barre]].  BUJC attracted many students who were the first members of their families to benefit from higher education. The Junior College also received support from leading members of the [[Wilkes-Barre]] community.

In 1947, Wilkes College was instituted as an independent, nondenominational four-year college, with programs in the arts, sciences, and a number of professional fields as well as numerous extracurricular activities. Wilkes was given university status in 1990.

More recently college programs were significantly expanded. Wilkes College opened the School of Pharmacy in 1996, and in 1999, through a donation from Mrs. Geraldine Nesbitt Orr, the Nesbitt School of Pharmacy at Wilkes University was established.

The Jay S. Sidhu School of Business &amp; Leadership was created in 2004.  Students in the university's business program are required to take courses across several schools with the intent to provide an emotional education in addition to the typical business experience.

In 2005, the Henry Student Center was expanded and the University purchased an {{convert|80000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building in downtown Wilkes-Barre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilkes.edu/ Wilkes Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This building serves as the Wilkes University communications center, housing the registrar, bursar, [[indoor track]] and field, and [[ropes course]].

[http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/236.asp Passan Hall]&lt;ref name=factbook /&gt; at Wilkes University houses the infirmary, where a nurse can be consulted by any student who is ill.
