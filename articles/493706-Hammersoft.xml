==History and tradition==
===History===
[[Image:Bellarmine 3.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[St. Robert Bellarmine|St. Robert Bellarmine, S.J.]], [[Patron Saint]] of Fairfield University]]

Fairfield University was founded in 1942 by the [[Society of Jesus]] when the Jesuits acquired the two contiguous estates of the [[Brewster Jennings]] and Walter Lashar families. In the same year the [[James H. Dolan, S.J.|Rev. James H. Dolan, S.J.]], the Provincial Superior of the New England Jesuit Province appointed the [[John J. McEleney, S.J.|Rev. John J. McEleney, S.J.]] the first President of the &quot;Fairfield University of [[St. Robert Bellarmine|Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J.]]&quot; and Vicar of the [[Fairfield College Preparatory School]]. In 1944, the Rev. James H. Dolan, S.J. became the second President. During his tenure, Fairfield University was chartered by the State of Connecticut to grant degrees in 1945; the first class of 303 male students was admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences in 1947; the College of Arts and Sciences was accredited by the State of Connecticut and the first summer session of undergraduate courses was held in 1949.

In 1971, Fairfield University won a significant legal victory at the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''Tilton vs. Richardson'' establishing an important legal precedent concerning the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] and government financial assistance to religious-based colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_153/ |title=Tilton vs. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971) |publisher=Oyez |date=June 28, 1971 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This landmark court case questioned the legality of Fairfield and three other Connecticut religious-based institutions securing federal construction grants under the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963. An appeal by the plaintiffs was denied by the Supreme Court on June 28, 1971, ensuring Fairfield a significant amount of federal money which contributed to the construction of the [[DiMenna-Nyselius Library|Nyselius Library]] (1968) and Bannow Science Center (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.fairfield.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/fuhp&amp;CISOPTR=227&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=8 |title=Rev. William C. McInnes, S.J., 5th President of Fairfield University (1964â1973) |publisher=Digital.fairfield.edu |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority opinion, the Court upheld, 5â4, the federal construction grants as long as the facilities were not to be used for sectarian instruction or places of worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez.org&quot;/&gt;  The Court held that the church-related institutions in question had not used their federally funded facilities for religious activities, and that the facilities were &quot;indistinguishable from a typical state university facility.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez.org&quot;/&gt;

Fairfield has been a frequent stop of candidates for President of the United States throughout several Presidential campaigns.  During the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]],  President of the United States [[Ronald Reagan]] visited Fairfield on October 26, 1984.  During the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 Presidential election]],   [[George H. Bush]] visited the university and delivered a speech in [[Alumni Hall (Fairfield University)|Alumni Hall]] attacking the tax-and-budget policies of then Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] days before being elected the 41st [[President of the United States|President]]. Alumnus [[J. Michael Farren|J. Michael Farren '77]] served as deputy director to President-elect [[George H. Bush]]'s transition team and later served as deputy campaign manager for the Bush-Quayle Re-election Committee during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]]. During the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 United States Presidential Election]],   Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]] scheduled and controversially cancelled at the last moment a large student rally at Fairfield following a visit to [[Bob Jones University]], a school which has been characterized as anti-Catholic. Alumnus [[Thomas J. Josefiak]] served as general counsel to both the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|55th Presidential Inaugural Committee]] and later served as general counsel to [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|the Bush presidential campaign]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]].

A detailed account of the history of Fairfield University was written by the late Rev. Joseph MacDonnell, S.J. in his book entitled '''If these Stones Could Speak.'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/fu/FU1ur.htm If These Stones Could Speak]&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, a brief history of '''The Jesuits in Fairfield''' can be found on The Fairfield Jesuit Community website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jesuit/history_1.html |title=The Jesuits in Fairfield |publisher=Faculty.fairfield.edu |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1779, the &quot;Battle of Round Hill&quot; took place on the present day Bellarmine Hill on the campus of the university where the Americans under the command of Colonel Samuel Whiting (whose third-generation grandson Andrew Whiting graduated in 2005) repelled the British invaders under the command of Major-General [[William Tryon]], but not before the British laid ruin to the Town of Fairfield.

===Recent history===

===Roman Catholic and Jesuit tradition===

As one of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, Fairfield belongs to an elite group that continues the dedication [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] (1491â1556)  to developing the whole person. The university's   environment invites students of all traditions to a maturing of faith, self knowledge, respect for the dignity of themselves and others, a devotion to justice, a commitment to serving the poor, and a passion for truth, reflection, and lifelong learning.

===Seal of the University===
[[Image:Fairfield Seal.png|frame|left]]
Fairfield's seal combines elements of its several traditions. The gold pinecones come from the coat of arms of the family of [[St. Robert Bellarmine|Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J.]], for whom the university was originally named. Superimposed on the cones is the badge of the [[Society of Jesus]] â the letters IHS surmounted by the cross and surrounded by the instruments of Christ's passion â to indicate that the University is in the care of members of the same religious family.

There are three compartments in the upper portion of the shield, because &quot;the school is dedicated and exists in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit.&quot; The central compartment portrays a hart crossing a ford, a part of the coat of arms of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford|Diocese of Hartford]], whose boundaries encompassed the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Town of Fairfield]], when the University was founded. Finally, the two outer compartments show clusters of grapes, charges taken from the town seal and symbolic of the fertility of the verdant fields of the Town and County of Fairfield.
When the University was founded in 1942, the official name of the University was &quot;Fairfield University of St. Robert Bellarmine&quot;. Three of the original seals with this name still exist on campus â in the main lobby of Alumni Hall, on the exterior of the Barone Campus Center, and on the glass front of Regis Hall facing the Quad.

===Campus safety===
The university received the 2008 [[Jeanne Clery]] Campus Safety Award, presented each year by Security On Campus Inc. (SOC). The national award, established in 1994 by Howard and Connie Clery in memory of their daughter who was murdered on a college campus in 1986, honors schools and individuals âthat have done extraordinary things to make college and university students safer.â Fairfield was selected for the award based on &quot;...its innovative programs, comprehensive emergency response plan, and overall commitment to...peer education and prevention programming, and a unique study abroad travel safety program.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/press/pr_index.html?id=2201 |title=Fairfield University to receive the national 2008 Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Award |publisher=Fairfield University |date=November 4, 2008 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DiMenna-Nyselius Library===
[[Image:Fairfield Library.JPG|thumb|300px|left|DiMenna-Nyselius Library]]
Built in 1968, the [[DiMenna-Nyselius Library]] originally was named the Nyselius Library in honor of benefactors Gustav and Dagmar Nyselius. They were Swedish immigrants who had settled in Stamford and wanted to make a donation to Fairfield University to repay in part the kindness of their adoptive country. In 2001, the Library underwent a major renovation and expansion and was renamed the DiMenna-Nyselius Library in recognition of a   donation from alumnus Joseph A. DiMenna, Jr. '80.

The Library contains an extensive   collection of [[printing|print]] and [[Computer file|electronic resources]] which include over 300,000 bound volumes, 1800 [[Academic journal|journals]] and newspapers, over 11,000 [[audiovisual]] items and the equivalent of 92,000 volumes in [[microform]]. Its electronic resources provide online access to a wide variety of [[World Wide Web]] subscription databases that bring full text journals and statistical information to the desktop anywhere on campus. Throughout the Library, [[wireless network|wireless access]] is available in designated areas. The Library also contains two open access computer labs featuring [[Macintosh]] and [[Dell]] computers (one with 24-hour access for students), two dozen [[multimedia]] [[workstations]], an [[electronic classroom]], a 90-seat [[multimedia]] [[auditorium]], and study rooms.

In March 2010, a strong [[Nor'easter]] storm peeled back a roughly 120â x 30â40â section of the roof along the parking lot side of the library building, destroying 2,583 booksâsome of which were out of print. The worst-damaged sections were the ones on Shakespeare, film, modern languages, science and social science. The minimum estimated value of the books was $88,519.41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fairfieldmirror.com/2010/03/30/library-loses-books-at-high-cost/ |title=Library Loses Books At High Cost |author=Schelzi, Meghan |date=March 30, 2010 |work=The Fairfield Mirror |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Sustainability===
In recent years, the university has implemented an institution-wide Green Movement, taking major steps to reduce its impact on the [[natural environment]] and improve [[sustainability]].   The university now builds facilities with an eye to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[recycling]], and receives high marks from [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED), a rating system of the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] that promotes responsible building practices and [[sustainable design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfield.edu/green/green_fairfield_doing.html What is Fairfield doing?]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have earned the university recognition as one of the nation's &quot;Cool Schools&quot; from the [[Sierra Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.org/sierra/200909/coolschools/allrankings.aspx |title=Sierra Club Cool Schools: The Third Annual List |publisher=Sierraclub.org |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;C-&quot; grade on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's 2009 College Sustainability Report Card.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 College Sustainability Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2009/schools/fairfield-university |title=Fairfield University â Green Report Card 2009 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=June 30, 2007 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2010, the Princeton Review and U.S. Green Building Council included Fairfield   in the &quot;Guide to 286 Green Colleges&quot;

==Residence life==
===Residence halls===
[[Image:Fairfield Dolan Hall.JPG|thumb|left|300px|John C. Dolan Hall]]
Fairfield University guarantees first year students four years of campus housing and provides several housing options depending on their class. Most underclassman live on campus and live the typical [[residence hall]] life in the '''Quad''' or '''The Orient''' sections of campus. '''The Quad''' is located in the northwest corner of campus and consists of Campion Hall, Joques Hall, Gonzaga Hall, Loyola Hall, and Regis Hall. Students typically choose to live in The Quad in order to be close to the classroom buildings and to enjoy the annual battle of dorms water fights; and frisbee and wiffleball games during the warm weather. '''The Orient''' is located in the southeast corner of campus and consists of Kostka Hall and Claver Hall which is suite style living, and also the apartments, the newest on campus housing. This section earned its nickname because the original names of the residence halls located in that area were &quot;Southeast&quot; (now Kostka) and &quot;Far East&quot; (now Claver). Though the names were changed in the 1980s, the nickname survived as a non sequitur.  '''Dolan Hall''' is located in the northeast corner of campus is the primary residence hall for students who request to live in singles housing. This building also holds some freshman doubles.

===Residential Colleges===
Loyola Hall is home to the '''Ignatian Residential College''', which offers a unique [[residential college]] experience for Fairfield sophomores. Funded by a $2 million grant from the [[Lilly Endowment]], the program provides over 200 students with the opportunity to study and live together while pondering questions of identity, faith and purpose. In addition to living together and taking two classes together students meet once per month in groups of ten with a mentor, hear from weekly speakers, attend one overnight retreat per semester, and take cultural trips.

St. Ignatius House, the former Jesuit community house, will be home to the '''Just-Us Residential College'''. The program will allow up to 140 sophomores,   committed to community service and social justice, to go beyond the small community service groups at Campus Ministry and live with a group of individuals concerned with life outside of Fairfield County. The program is not inherently religious, but should attract students of all faiths, races and socioeconomic backgrounds who want to do something to help the Fairfield community and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfieldmirror.com/editorial_just-us-1.1314693 Editorial: Just-Us]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upperclassmen alternatives===
Upperclassmen   choose between living at the  Townhouse Complex ,  the Apartment Village, or [[Fairfield Beach, Connecticut|Fairfield Beach]]. The 10 unit  Townhouse Complex is a series of 104 two-story student townhouses for 469 juniors and seniors. There are between five and seven students living in each townhouse which has two or three bedrooms upstairs, a living and dining area, a kitchen and two bathrooms. In 2007, townhouse basements have been closed off to students, after an incident in which the administration and Fairfield fire department deemed the basements a fire hazard. During the warmer weather students enjoy their back porches and lawns with an occasional barbecue and wiffleball game. The  Apartment Village   was opened in September 2000. These apartment-style residences house 192 juniors and seniors. Each apartment contains four single bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room.   Fairfield Beach is  a unique Fairfield living experience for 200 eligible students to rent beach houses along the Long Island Sound. It historically has been the center of off-campus social life hosting such Fairfield traditions as the Clam Jam and Mock Weddings. However, as it  has evolved from a part-time summer beach community into a more permanent residential community, Fairfield Beach has become a source of strain on town-gown relations leading to greater controls over student social life including a ban on large gatherings at Lantern Point since 2001 due to a court injunction.{{cite}}

==Student life==
===Community service===
The goal of Jesuit education is ''homines pro aliis'', âmen and women for othersâ. As a result, Fairfield students are involved in many [[community service]] opportunities.  Fairfield was among just 119 colleges in the nation named to the Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/descriptions/community_engagement.php?key=1213 The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching: Community Engagement Classification Elective], accessed December 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the University was named to the 2009 and 2010 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll by the [[Learn and Serve America]] Program of the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnandserve.gov/about/programs/higher_ed_honorroll.asp President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll], accessed December 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally, the award-winning '''Annual Hunger Clean Up''' is a one-day service-a-thon where the entire university community joins together to work at 40-plus local agency sites throughout Fairfield County  and to raise money for local and national [[hunger]] and [[homelessness]] causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfield.edu/student/cmsj_hunger.html Annual Hunger Clean Up]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fairfield chapter of '''Colleges Against Cancer''' hosts an annual [[American Cancer Society]] [[Relay for Life]], an overnight event designed to spread awareness of cancer prevention, treatments and cures, celebrate [[cancer survivors]] and raise money for [[cancer research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.fairfieldmirror.com/media/storage/paper148/news/2008/04/24/CampusLife/All-Aboard.For.Relay.For.Life-3342805.shtml All aboard for Relay for Life!]&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''[[Family literacy|Adrienne Kirby Family Literacy Project]]''', recognized as a model program by the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]], involves about 175 Fairfield student-volunteers a year in providing individual tutoring to preschool children  at the Action for Bridgeport Community Development's [[Head Start Program|Early Learning/Head Start Program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

Internationally, '''Ignatian Solidarity Corps''' volunteers annually participate in two-week international service trips during their spring and winter breaks traveling to [[Ecuador]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19365140&amp;BRD=1653&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=12717&amp;rfi=6 Fairfield students provide aid in Ecuador]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]], Jamaica, [[Belize]] and [[Haiti]].  In 2004, Mikaela Conley '06 and Aamina Awan '07 founded '''The Afghan Children's Project''' to raise awareness and funds for children who have suffered the effects of war, violence, and poverty in the heart of [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afghanchildrensproject.org/background.html |title=The Afghan Children's Project: Background |publisher=Afghanchildrensproject.org |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both were interviewed on [[CNN Daybreak]] in August 2005 for their work in funding the building of a [[water well]] for Aloudine, a small village outside [[Kabul]], desperate for clean drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/documents/publications/fn_fall05.pdf |title=A Well That Runs Deep |format=PDF |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2008, nine Fairfield students, inspired by 2006 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient [[Muhammad Yunus]] and the [[Grameen Bank]], started '''Sustainable Equity for Women''', a [[micro-lending]] project designed to raise and invest money in small businesses run by women in [[developing countries]] in conjunction with
[[Kiva (organization)|Kiva Microfunds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/press/pr_index.html?id=2049 |title=Fairfield University seniors leave legacy of micro-lending project, Sustainable Equity for Women (SEW) |publisher=Fairfield University |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity===
In total, the   student body hails from 32 states, Washington, D.C., [[Puerto Rico]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and 45 foreign countries. 13% of undergraduate students are African American, [[Hispanic]], Asian American, Native American ([[AHANA]]), or [[multiracial]]. Valuing a mix of experiences in the classroom and on campus, increasing [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] at Fairfield is a major goal of the University's Strategic Vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/documents/publications/fn_winter06.pdf |title=Fairfield's Strategic Vision: Windows to the Future |format=PDF |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, during the University's [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday Celebration and Convocation]], the [[Jeffrey P. von Arx|Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.]], called on the university   to join him in efforts to increase [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] at the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/press/pr_index.html?id=1237 |title=Fairfield President pledges campus-wide effort to increase diversity |publisher=Fairfield University |date=January 27, 2005 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, the '''Office of Institutional Diversity Initiatives''' and the '''Office of Student Diversity Programs'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/student/sd_about.html |title=Office of Student Diversity Programs |publisher=Fairfield University |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; were created to pursue a number of initiatives to increase [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|racial]] and [[socioeconomic]] [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]]. These [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] initiatives are helped annually by the Fairfield Awards Dinner held in New York City in which funds are raised for '''The Alumni Multicultural Scholarship Fund'''. The 2008 Fairfield Awards Dinner raised a record-breaking $1.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/press/pr_index.html?id=2035 |title=Record-breaking $1.1 million raised by Fairfield University for drive to increase diversity |publisher=Fairfield University |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fairfield University Student Association===
The Fairfield University Student Association (FUSA) is the official student association for full-time undergraduate students and is the largest student organization on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/fusa/ |title=Fairfield University Student Association (FUSA) |publisher=Fairfield University |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The association exists to represent student issues and concerns to the faculty and administration and to sponsor a multitude of student programs and activities. All full-time undergraduate students are members. The association is organized into three branches â  legislative', executive, and  judicial. The  legislative branch  consists of the '''Student Senate''', comprising 40 elected representatives (10 from each undergraduate class year). The  executive branch  is headed by the popularly elected  President  of FUSA, who serves as the official spokesperson for undergraduate students in addition to administering the student association on a daily basis. In 2002, Karen Donoghue '03 became the first women elected President of FUSA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE3DD133BF932A05750C0A9649C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fF%2fFairfield%20University Kenneth Best, &quot;Fairfield University's B.W.O.C.,&quot; [[New York Times]], March 31, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; The FUSA President is assisted by a popularly elected Vice President, elected class officers, and a number of other appointed officers, including the Executive Director of Programming and the Executive Director of Clubs &amp; Organizations. The  judicial branch,  known as the Student Court,  serves as a hearing body in certain student conduct cases, as well as performing the judicial functions required for the student association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/documents/student/sl_sthandbook.pdf |title=Fairfield University Student Handbook |format=PDF |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student activism===
A central tenet of a [[Jesuit]] education is the promotion of the [[values]] of [[peace]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/cas/pj_index.html |title=Program in Peace and Justice Studies |publisher=Fairfield University |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairfield University students have embraced and reflected these values in their own [[student activism]]. In 1988, 1989 and 1990, the '''Coalition for a Better World''' constructed &quot;Cardboard City&quot; and held a 36 hour vigil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.fairfield.edu/u?/fuhp,240 |title=Cardboard City on the patio of Barone Campus Center |publisher=Digital.fairfield.edu |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and again in 2008, the '''Students for Social Justice''' similarly constructed &quot;Homeless Village&quot; and hosted the [[Oxfam|&quot;Oxfam Hunger Banquet&quot;]] to raise awareness of the plight of the [[homeless]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.fairfieldmirror.com/media/storage/paper148/news/2008/01/31/News/Food-For.Thought.Students.For.Social.Justice.Host.Hunger.Banquet-3176960.shtml Food for thought: Students for Social Justice host Hunger Banquet]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, students staged an 11-hour sit-in at the home of the university president and later a [[hunger strike]] to protest a contracting company used by the university that the students said was anti-union and paid janitors poorly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D9143DF930A25752C1A96F958260 |title=Six Students End Hunger Strike After Fairfield Drops Contractor |work=New York Times |date=November 13, 1999 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year, the Students for Social Justice travel to [[Columbus, Georgia]] for the annual [[School of the Americas Watch]] protest at a combat training school for Latin American soldiers now known as the [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation]]. The date of the protest marks the anniversary of the murder of six [[Jesuit]] priests, their maid, and her daughter in [[El Salvador]] at the hands of soldiers trained at the School of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/student/cmsj_social_justice.html |title=Fairfield University: Social Justice: School of the Americas Protest |publisher=Fairfield University |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2008, '''Fairfield for Peace NOW''' created &quot;Hope Trail&quot;, a pathway of flags around campus symbolizing the cost in life and casualties from the [[Iraq War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/press/pr_index.html?id=2019 |title=Fairfield University students erect symbols of Iraq war casualties |publisher=Fairfield University |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;A Cry For Peace&quot;, a play written and performed with Theatre Fairfield demonstrating the toll of the [[Iraq War]] on the families of soldiers back in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.fairfieldmirror.com/media/storage/paper148/news/2008/05/01/Commentary/Editorial.Fairfield.Shows.Activism-3357368.shtml Fairfield shows activism]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student clubs &amp; organizations===
