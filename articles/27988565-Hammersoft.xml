Each [[Paralympic Games]] have a [[mascot]], usually an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures representing the cultural heritage. Nowadays, most of the merchandise aimed at young people focuses on the mascots, rather than the Paralympic flag or organization logos.

The unnamed mascots of [[1980 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Arnhem]], The Netherlands are possibly the first Paralympic mascots. But since Komduri in the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], the Paralympic mascots has been associated with its Olympic counterparts. Nowadays, most of the merchandise aimed at young people focuses on the mascots, rather than the Paralympic flag or organization logos.
