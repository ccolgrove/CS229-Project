'''Dwight Michael Evans''' (born November 3, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Dewey&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redsoxdiehard.com/players/dewey.html Dwight Evans] RedSoxDiehard.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] former professional [[baseball]] [[right fielder]] and right-handed batter who played with the [[Boston Red Sox]] (1972â90) and [[Baltimore Orioles]] (1991) in [[Major League Baseball]].

Evans won eight [[Gold Glove Award]]s (1976,1978-79 &amp; 1981-85). In the 1970s and 1980s, Evans played in the outfield with [[Jim Rice]] as well as all-stars [[Fred Lynn]] and [[Tony Armas]].

==Life and career==
Evans was born in [[Santa Monica, California]]. He attended Chatsworth High School in California and played alongside Rick Rieger.  Evans started his career by winning [[International League]] [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] honors, but in his early major league career, he was primarily a defensive standout with a modest bat. In the second half of his career, he became a powerful batter.

Evans made his Major League Baseball debut for the Boston Red Sox on September 16, 1972 in a game against the [[Cleveland Indians]]. The Red Sox won 10-0 behind the pitching of [[Luis Tiant]] who threw a 3-hit complete game. Evans pinch ran for [[Reggie Smith]] in the 6th but was stranded at 2B, he played in right field where he recorded 1 PO. Evans went 0-1 at the plate in his debut. Evans played in 18 games in 1972 for the Red Sox, and had 57 plate appearances (.263 BA, 15 H, 2 R, 6 RBI, 1 HR).

Despite the strike-shortened 1981 season, Evans had his best all-around year. He paced the league in total bases (215), [[on-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.937), [[base on balls|walks]] (85), times on base (208), and tied [[Eddie Murray]], Tony Armas and [[Bobby Grich]] for the home run title with 22. He also ranked second in [[Run (baseball statistics)|runs scored]] (84) and [[on-base percentage]] (.415), and third in [[slugging percentage]] (.522). He added a .296 [[batting average]] with 71 [[runs batted in]]. In 1987, at age 35, Evans recorded career highs in batting average (.305), HRs (34) and RBI (123). He spent his final season with the Orioles, batting .270 with six homers and drove in 38 runs in 101 games.

Evans was named an Outfielder on The Sporting News AL All-Star team in 1982, 1984 and 1987 and was also tabbed as an Outfielder on the AL Silver Slugger Team by The Sporting News in 1981 and 1987. Evans would win the Gold Glove award in 1976, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985.

In his 20-year career, Evans batted .272, with 385 home runs, 1384 [[Run batted in|RBI]], 1470 runs, 2446 [[Hit (baseball statistics)|hits]], 483 doubles, 73 [[Triple (baseball)|triples]], and 78 stolen bases in 2606 games. Only [[Carl Yastrzemski]] (3308) played more games for the Red Sox than Evans (2505).

From 1980 through 1989, Evans hit more home runs (256) than any other player in the American League. He also led the A.L. in extra base hits over the same period of time. He is the only player to hit 20 or more home runs during every season of the 80's (1980â1989).

Evans hit a home run four times on Opening Day. On April 7, 1986, he set a major league record by hitting the first pitch of the season for a home run, eclipsing the mark held by the [[Chicago Cubs]]' [[Bump Wills]], who hit the second pitch for a home run on April 4, 1982.

Originally Evans was assigned the uniform number 40 but quietly he wanted to wear number 24, the number of his idol [[Willie Mays]]. In 1973 Sox gave him number 24, the number he wore for the rest of his career in Boston and one year with Baltimore. Other Red Sox players to wear the same jersey number since Evans retired include [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]], [[Mike Stanley]], [[Manny RamÃ­rez]], and [[Takashi Saito]].

In 2000, Dwight Evans was selected to the [[Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame]].

In 2002, Evans served as hitting coach for the Red Sox and wore uniform number 25.

In 2003, Evans was named a Player Development Consultant for the Red Sox.
