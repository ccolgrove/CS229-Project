'''Adrian Mutu''' ({{IPA-ro|adriËan Ëmutu|-|Ro-Adrian Mutu.ogg}}; born 8 January 1979) is a Romanian [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Cesena|Cesena]].

==Club career==
===ArgeÅ PiteÅti===
Mutu began his professional career with his home club [[FC ArgeÅ PiteÅti|ArgeÅ PiteÅti]]. He made his debut on 15 March 1997 against [[OÅ£elul GalaÅ£i]] and went on to score 11 goals in 41 games before sealing a transfer to [[FC Dinamo BucureÅti|Dinamo BucureÅti]].

===Dinamo BucureÅti===
His strong performances for [[FC Dinamo BucureÅti|Dinamo Bucharest]] meant that Mutu did not spend long playing in the Romanian capital. He scored 22 goals in 33 games in total and played an important role in Dinamo's league and Romanian Cup success. However by the time that Dinamo lifted these trophies, Mutu had already left to play for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]].

===Internazionale===
Having joined [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] midway through the season, Mutu made an immediate impact on his debut for the Italian side, in the [[Coppa Italia]] scoring within nine minutes of his appearance against derby rivals [[A.C. Milan]] to help Inter to a 3â2 victory. However, Mutu failed to replicate his form in [[Serie A]], playing only ten games for the Nerazzurri without scoring, partially due to 3+2 non-EU quota.

===Verona===
In 2000, Mutu was sold to [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Verona]] in [[co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?L=it&amp;N=138|title= MUTU-VERONA: FIRMA PER COMPROPRIETA'|date=2000-07-09|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=FC Internazionale Milano|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Veneto]] side has also signed [[Mauro Camoranesi]] (later team-mate at Juventus) and young rising star [[Alberto Gilardino]] (later team-mate at Fiorentina) that season but almost relegated after winning the relegation tie-breaker playoffs. In June 2001, Verona bought Mutu outright,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hellasverona.it/news.php?id=122|title=APERTE LE BUSTE: MUTU GIALLOBLU'|date=2001-06-30|accessdate=2010-04-08|work=Hellas Verona FC|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in although the quota system was abolished during the season.

===Parma===
In the 2002â03 season, Mutu was loaned to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] with the option to purchase him outright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hellasverona.it/news.php?id=791|title=CALCIOMERCATO: COMUNICATO UFFICIALE|date=2002-08-31|accessdate=2010-04-08|work=Hellas Verona FC|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilardino, who arrived in June. followed. At Parma, he met coach [[Cesare Prandelli]] (also at ''La Viola'') and partnered [[Adriano Leite Ribeiro]] to form a deadly striking duo. He also met [[SÃ©bastien Frey]], [[Marco Marchionni]] and [[Alberto Gilardino]] who all later played for Fiorentina.

===Chelsea===
In August 2003, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] paid Parma â¬22.5m (around Â£15.8m) for Mutu's transfer as part of new owner [[Roman Abramovich]]'s spending spree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3145465.stm|title=Mutu completes Chelsea switch|date=2003-08-12|accessdate=2009-11-05|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=89980.html|title=Mutu makes it seven|date=2003-08-12|accessdate=2009-11-05|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tas-cas.org/d2wfiles/document/3459/5048/0/Award%201644%20FINAL.pdf|title=CAS 2008/A/1644 Adrian Mutu v/ Chelsea Football Club Limited: ARBITRAL AWARD delivered by the COURT OF ARBITRATION FOR SPORT|date=2009-07-31|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=Court of Arbitration for Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started with four goals in three matches, including two in a 4â2 victory over London rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], but Mutu scored fewer goals as the season progressed.

In the [[2004â05 in English football|2004â05 season]], Mutu had a difficult relationship with the club's new manager [[JosÃ© Mourinho]], with each accusing the other of lying about whether the player was injured for a [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification â UEFA Group 1|qualifying]] match against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3718894.stm | work=BBC News | title=Mutu hits out at Mourinho | date=6 October 2004 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, he failed a drugs test for [[cocaine]] and was sacked on 29 October 2004. He also received a seven-month ban and a Â£20,000 fine from [[the FA]]. The ban ended on 18 May 2005. Many people think he is a disgrace and sourly not a model for young soccer players. He could have been one of the best football players of all time; but he wasted his chance.

===Breach of contract saga===
Chelsea started to seek compensation from Mutu in early 2005.&lt;ref name=award/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4544557.stm|title=
Mutu contests compensation ruling|date=2005-05-13|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Football Association]] Premier League Appeals Committee decided that the player had committed a breach of his contract without just cause&lt;ref name=award/&gt; which made Chelsea eligible to claim the compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status_transfer_sept2001_en_27.pdf|title=Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players (2001 edition)|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=FIFA}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutu started his first appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) but the case was dismissed.&lt;ref name=award/&gt; On 11 May 2006, Chelsea applied to [[FIFA]] for an award of compensation against Mutu. In particular, the club requested that the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) should award an amount of compensation in favour of the club following the established breach of the Employment Contract committed by the Player without just cause.&lt;ref name=award/&gt; However, on 26 October, the DRC decided that it did not have jurisdiction to make a decision in the dispute between the Club and the Player and that the claim by the Club was therefore not admissible.&lt;ref name=award/&gt; On 22 December, Chelsea lodged a new appeal before the CAS seeking the annulment of the DRCâs decision. On 21 May 2007, a CAS panel upheld the Clubâs appeal, set aside the DRCâs decision, and referred the matter back to the DRC, ''âwhich does have jurisdiction to determine and impose the appropriate sporting sanction and/or order for compensation, if any, arising out of the disputeâ between the Club and the Player,&quot;''&lt;ref name=award/&gt;

On 6 August 2007, on the basis of the Second CAS Award, Chelsea filed with the DRC a ''&quot;Re-amended application for an award of compensation&quot;'', seeking damages, to be determined on the basis of various factors, ''&quot;including the wasted costs of acquiring the Player (Â£ 13,814,000), the cost of replacing the Player (Â£22,661,641), the unearned portion of signing bonus (Â£ 44,000) and other benefits received by the Player from the Club (Â£ 3,128,566.03) as well as from his new club, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (unknown), the substantial legal costs that the Club has been forced to incur (Â£ 391,049.03) and the unquantifiable but undeniable cost in playing terms and in terms of the Clubâs commercial brand values&quot;,'' but ''&quot;at least equivalent to the replacement cost of Â£ 22,661,641&quot;.''&lt;ref name=award/&gt; On 14 September, Mutu submitted to the DRC a brief stating the ''&quot;Position of Player Mutu regarding Chelsea's petition for an award of compensation&quot;,'' requesting its rejection, and asking FIFA to open an investigation against the Club for having used and/or dealt with unlicensed agents.&lt;ref name=award/&gt; But Mutu failed to suspend the arbitration and his claim for unlicensed agent was found no such violation emerged.

On 7 May 2008, [[FIFA]] Dispute Resolution Chamber ordered Mutu to pay â¬17,173,990 in compensation to his former club, Chelsea FC, for breach of contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;casverdict&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tas-cas.org/d2wfiles/document/3433/5048/0/Press&amp;#32;release&amp;#32;2009.07.31.pdf|title=The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismisses Adrian Mutu's appeal|publisher=Court of Arbitration for Sport|date=2009-07-31|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/administration/news/newsid=850413.html|title=DRC reaches decision on Mutu|publisher=FIFA.com|date=2008-08-15|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included â¬16,500,000 for unamortised portion of the transfer fee paid to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], â¬307,340 for unamortised portion of the sign-on fee (received by Mutu), and â¬366,650 for unamortised portion of the fee to the Agent, but already not to take into account for the determination of the damages the amounts already paid by the Club to the Player (being the consideration for the services rendered) or the remaining value of the Employment Contract (valued for â¬10,858,500). Mutu have to pay within 30 days after informed the decision in August 2008.&lt;ref name=award/&gt; Mutu lodged an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport for the second time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7440416.stm|title=Mutu lodges appeal over damages|date=2008-09-05|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 2009, the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed an appeal filed by Mutu regarding his fine,&lt;ref name=&quot;casverdict&quot;/&gt; Mutu is ordered to pay to Chelsea the amount, plus interest of 5% [[Per annum|p.a.]] starting on 12 September 2008 until the effective date of payment, and the matter will be submitted to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for its. In addition, Mutu had to pay the costs of the arbitration of both parties, and have to pay [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 50,000 to Chelsea contribution towards the legal and other costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings.&lt;ref name=award/&gt; The fine was the highest ever levied by FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8178248.stm|title=Mutu loses appeal over huge fine|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2009-07-31|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juventus===
Mutu signed a five-year contract with the [[Italy|Italian]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on 12 January 2005, despite still being banned from football until 18 May. As Juventus had no available room to buy another non-EU player from abroad, the move also involved fellow Serie A club [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], who signed the player and contemporaneously sold him to Juventus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2005/gennaio/19/Spinelli_favore_cambio_giovani__ga_10_0501194414.shtml |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-07-25 |title=Spinelli: &quot;Un favore In cambio 2 giovani&quot; |date=2005-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2005/gennaio/29/Via_libera_Mutu_dall_Inghilterra_ga_10_0501291322.shtml|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-07-25 |title=Via libera a Mutu dall' Inghilterra|date=2005-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance on 29 May 2005, coming on as a substitute in the 57th minute of the last match of the season which was a 4â2 win over [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]]. During the 2005â06 season, he scored seven goals in his 20 league match and 12 substitute appearances for Juventus. In the [[UEFA Champions League]] he made three starts and five substitute appearances and scored against [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]].

===Fiorentina===
[[File:Adrian Mutu Roberto Vicario.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Mutu with Fiorentina during their [[2007â08 Serie A|2007â08]] season.]]
On 8 July 2006, [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] announced that they had signed Mutu for â¬8 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/comunicatipricesensitive/10_lug_2006_eng_fio.pdf|title=Agreement with ACF Fiorentina S.p.A. |date=2006-07-10|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=Juventus FC}}&lt;/ref&gt; from relegated Juventus which both clubs involved in the [[2006 Italian football scandal]]. This reunited Mutu with his former manager at Parma, [[Cesare Prandelli]]. Mutu formed a productive partnership with [[Luca Toni]] and between them the pair scored 32 goals in the [[Serie A 2006-07|2006â07 season]]. He was named the best player of the season by âIl Calcioâ, due to his 16 goals and eight assists in 33 games.

In July 2008, [[A.S. Roma]] made a reported â¬18 to 20 million offer to sign him outright,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=831665.html|title=Roma confirm Mutu offer|date=2008-07-23|accessdate=2009-11-06|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asroma.it/UserFiles/851.pdf|title=OFFERTA FORMULATA PER LâACQUISIZIONE DEL DIRITTO ALLE PRESTAZIONI SPORTIVE DEL CALCIATORE ADRIAN MUTU|date=2008-07-23|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Mutu hinted that he may remain in Florence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=825552.html|title=Mutu concentrates on Fiorentina future|date=2008-07-15|accessdate=2009-11-06|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually signed a new contact reported last to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=738042.html|title=Mutu resolved to make music with Viola|date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2009-11-06|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 2008, at his 200th match in [[Serie A]], Mutu was chosen to captain Fiorentina in the game against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. On 2 February 2009, he scored his 100th and 101st Serie A goals against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]]. On 15 February 2009, Mutu scored his first [[hat-trick]] with Fiorentina. After going 3â0 down against [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], Mutu converted a penalty, a free kick, and scored again in the final second of extra time, bringing the final score to 3â3. Despite a difficult elbow injury, Mutu managed to finish the 2008â2009 season with 14 goals, along with Gilardino they were one of the top ten single season striker partnerships in Viola history with 33 goals between them.

On 29 January 2010, it was reported that Mutu failed a [[doping]] test after a [[Coppa Italia]] match against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] match nine days earlier, in which he scored twice in to help Fiorentina win 3â2. The [[Italian National Olympic Committee|INOC]] was requested to hand Mutu a one-year ban by the Italian anti-doping prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=764306|title=Italian authorities demand one-year ban for Mutu|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually received a nine-month ban on 19 April, which was later reduced to six months and ended on 29 October. After the ban finished, Mutu was suspended by the club due to breach of contract ([[AWOL]]) on 7 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://it.violachannel.tv/dettaglio-ultimora/items/comunicato-stampa.9779.html|title=COMUNICATO STAMPA|date=7 January 2011|accessdate=7 January 2011|work=ACF Fiorentina|publisher=Viola Channel|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After such events, Mutu publicly apologised to the club and parted company with his agent Victor Becali;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/fiorentina-president-della-valle-opens-door-mutu-return-1413921 |title=Fiorentina president Della Valle opens door to Mutu return|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=3 February 2011|publisher=Tribalfootball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.romaniantimes.at/?id=12778 |title=Mutu splits from Romanian manager|date=25 January 2011|accessdate=3 February 2011|publisher=Romanian Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 3 February 2011 Fiorentina announced the player was reinstated into the first team with immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://it.violachannel.tv/dettaglio-ultimora/items/comunicato-stampa.10044.html|title=COMUNICATO STAMPA|date=3 February 2011|accessdate=3 February 2011|work=ACF Fiorentina|publisher=Viola Channel|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cesena===
On 23 June 2011, it was officially announced that [[AC Cesena|Cesena]] had signed Mutu on a two-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4998%3Aadrian-mutu-e-un-giocatore-del-cesena&amp;catid=4%3Acomunicato-stampa&amp;Itemid=121&amp;lang=it|language=Italian|title=Adrian Mutu Ã¨ un giocatore del Cesena|trans_title=Adrian Mutu Is a Cesena Player|work=A.C.

He represented Romania at [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], his first major tournament where they beat [[England national football team|England]] 3â2, and drawing 1â1 against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Romania were eliminated in the quarter-finals by [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Mutu has played for Romania 72 times, scoring 34 goals, 23 of which have come in qualifying games. [[Romania]] has only lost once when Mutu has scored for them, which was in a 2004 European qualifying game against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. He was the [[Captain (association football)|vice-captain]] of Romania. His performances (games, goals) with the [[Romania national football team|Romanian national team]] earned him the Romanian Footballer of the Year award.

===Euro 2008===
Mutu scored Romania's only goal of [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] in the 55th minute of their [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group C#Italy vs Romania|second match]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], however in the same match he had a second-half penalty saved by Italian goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]], which could have sent Italy out of the competition and would have guaranteed Romania a spot in the quarter finals. The game finished 1â1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match=300695/index.html Italy vs Romania match report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, Romania's national team coach [[RÄzvan Lucescu]] has reservations about calling him up, because Mutu was exposed consuming alcohol after a match with [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|World Cup 2010 Qualifications]]. Because of poor results and fan pressure, [[RÄzvan Lucescu]] was forced to call him up again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinesport.ro/stiri/fotbal/fotbal-intern/nationala/55079/mutu-exclus-pe-viata-de-la-nationala.htm Mutu excluded from the national football team](Romanian)[onlinesport.ro]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutu scored a brace in his first game back, a 3â1 win  over [[Luxembourg_national_football_team|Luxembourg]] on 29 March 2011, Romania's first win of the qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/euro/2012/qualifying/romania-luxembourg-368890.html Romania v Luxembourg][eurosport]&lt;/ref&gt;
He also scored once in the next game, a 3â0 win over [[Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_national_football_team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 3 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/match/2011/jun/03/358675 Romania v Bosnia and Herzogovina][guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; After the retirement of [[Cristian Chivu]] he has become the undisputed captain of the [[Romania national football team|Romanian national team]].
