'''TrueImage''' is a [[PostScript]]-compatible interpreter (clone) originally developed by Cal Bauer and Bauer Enterprises and sold to [[Microsoft]] in 1989.  Microsoft subsequently cross-licensed TrueImage to [[Apple Computer]] in exchange for a [[TrueType]] license. After many delays, Microsoft finally delivered version 1.0 of TrueImage to Apple; Apple announced they would be licensing PostScript Level 2 from [[Adobe Systems]] a few months later. 

Apple tried to build one product on TrueImage, but no TrueImage products were ever released by the company.[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2038] However, TrueImage was used in a variety of [[laser printer]]s, such as Okidata [http://my.okidata.com/mandocit.nsf/WebBPXContents/975E43CA500C9569852561C7004A5145?OpenDocument] and LaserMaster [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-9589579.html] into the mid-1990s, with limited success.{{fact|date=August 2010}}
