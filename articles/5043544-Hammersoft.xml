As of the [[112th Congress]] following the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 elections]], the Democratic Party currently holds a minority of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but holds a majority of seats in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. It currently holds a minority of state [[Governor (United States)|governorships]], as well as a minority of [[List of U.S. state legislatures|state legislatures]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Democratic Party (United States)}}
The Democratic Party evolved from [[Anti-Administration Party (United States)|Anti-Federalist]] factions that opposed the [[Hamiltonian economic program|fiscal policies]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]] in the early 1790s. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] organized these factions into the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. The party favored [[states' rights]] and strict adherence to the [[Constitution]]; it opposed a national bank and wealthy, moneyed interests. The Democratic-Republican Party ascended to power in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]].

[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrew Jackson]] is typically considered the first Democratic [[President of the United States]].]]

[[File:Democratslogo.svg|thumb|left|The &quot;Kicking Donkey&quot; party logo is still a well-known symbol for the Democratic Party, despite no longer being the official logo of the party.]]
After the [[War of 1812]], the party's chief rival, the [[Federalist Party]] disbanded. Democratic-Republicans split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. Along with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], the Democratic Party was the chief party in the United States until the Civil War. The Whigs were a commercial party, and usually less popular, if better financed. The Whigs divided over the [[Slavery|slavery issue]] after the [[MexicanâAmerican War]] and faded away. In the 1850s, under the stress of the [[Fugitive slave laws|Fugitive Slave Law]] and the [[KansasâNebraska Act]], [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery]] Democrats left the party. Joining with former members of existing or dwindling parties, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith Schlisinger, ''Of the People: The 200 Year History of the Democratic Party'' (1992) ch 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Buchanan]] along Northern and Southern lines, while the Republican Party gained ascendancy in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]]. As the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Northern Democrats were divided into [[War Democrats]] and [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace Democrats]]. The [[Confederate States of America]], seeing parties as evils, did not have any.  Most War Democrats rallied to Republican President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the Republicans' [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] in 1864, which put [[Andrew Johnson]] on the ticket as a Democrat from the South.  Johnson replaced Lincoln in 1865 but stayed independent of both parties . The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. After [[Redeemers]] ended Reconstruction in the 1870s, and the extremely violent disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in the 1890s, the South, voting Democratic, became known as the &quot;[[Solid South]].&quot; Though Republicans won all but two presidential elections, the Democrats remained competitive. The party was dominated by pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s led by [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and [[Grover Cleveland]], who represented mercantile, banking, and railroad interests; opposed [[imperialism]] and overseas expansion; fought for the [[gold standard]]; opposed [[bimetallism]]; and crusaded against corruption, high taxes, and tariffs. Cleveland was elected to non-consecutive presidential terms in 1884 and 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrarian Democrats demanding [[Free Silver]] overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908). Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to Republican [[William McKinley]]. The Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected [[Woodrow Wilson]] as president in 1912 and 1916. Wilson effectively led Congress to put to rest the issues of tariffs, money, and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years with new progressive laws. The [[Great Depression]] in 1929 that occurred under Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government; the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1931 until 1995 and won most presidential elections until 1968. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], elected to the presidency in 1932, came forth with government programs called the [[New Deal]]. New Deal liberalism meant the promotion of social welfare, labor unions, civil rights, and regulation of business. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth, support for business, and low taxes, started calling themselves &quot;conservatives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues facing parties and the United States after [[World War II]] included the [[Cold War]] and the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. Republicans attracted conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their resistance to New Deal and [[Great Society]] liberalism and the Republicans' use of the [[Southern strategy]]. African Americans, who traditionally supported the Republican Party, began supporting Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin Roosevelt administration, the New Deal, and the Civil Rights movement. The Democratic Party's main base of support shifted to the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], marking a dramatic reversal of history. [[Bill Clinton]] was elected to the presidency in 1992, governing as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]]. The Democratic Party lost control of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution|election of 1994]] to the Republican Party. Re-elected in 1996, Clinton was the first Democratic President since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected to two terms. Following twelve years of Republican rule, the Democratic Party regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. Some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century in their last national platform have included the methods of how to combat [[terrorism]], [[homeland security]], expanding access to [[health care]], [[labor rights]], environmentalism, and the preservation of liberal government programs.&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States elections, 2010| 2010 elections]], the Democratic Party lost control of the House, but kept a small majority in the Senate (reduced from the 111th Congress). It also lost its majority in state legislatures and state governorships.

The Democratic Party traces its origins to the inspiration of Democratic-Republican Party, founded by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other influential opponents of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in 1792. That party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans. Organizationally, the modern Democratic Party truly arose in the 1830s, with the election of [[Andrew Jackson]]. Since the division of the Republican Party in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|election of 1912]], it has gradually positioned itself to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the Republican Party on economic and [[social issues]]. Until the period following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Democratic Party was primarily a coalition of two parties divided by region. Southern Democrats were typically given high conservative ratings by the [[American Conservative Union]] while northern Democrats were typically given very low ratings. Southern Democrats were a core bloc of the bipartisan [[conservative coalition]] which lasted through the Reagan-era. The economically activist philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's economic agenda since 1932, and served to tie the two regional factions of the party together until the late 1960s. In fact, Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] usually controlled the national government until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman and Peter Wallenstein, eds. ''The Encyclopedia Of American Political History'' (CQ Press, 2001) , passim, esp. pp 124-26&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2010}}, [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] polling found that 31% of Americans identified as Democrats, 29% as Republicans, and 38% as independents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/145463/Democratic-Party-Drops-2010-Tying-Year-Low.aspx Democratic Party ID Drops in 2010, Tying 22-Year Low]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Pew Research Center survey of registered voters released August 2010 stated that 47% identified as Democrats or leaned towards the party, in comparison to 43% of Republicans.&lt;ref name=growing/&gt;

==Current structure and composition==
The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than [[public policy]]. In presidential elections, it supervises the [[Democratic National Convention]]. The national convention is, subject to the charter of the party, the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times. The DNC is currently chaired by  [[Florida]] congresswomen [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wasserman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/04/debbie-wasserman-schultz-democratic-national-committee-chair-/1 | title=Obama taps Wasserman Schultz to lead DNC | accessdate=April 05, 2011 | author=Camia, Catalina | date=Apr 5, 2011 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races; its current chairman (selected by the party caucus) is Rep. [[Steve Israel]] of New York. Similarly, the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] (DSCC), currently headed by Senator [[Patty Murray]] of Washington, raises large sums for Senate races. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), currently chaired by Mike Gronstal of Iowa, is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on state legislative races. The DNC sponsors the [[College Democrats of America]] (CDA), a student-outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists. [[Democrats Abroad]] is the organization for Americans living outside the United States; they work to advance the goals of the party and encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats. The [[Young Democrats of America]] (YDA) is a youth-led organization that attempts to draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates, but operates outside of the DNC. In addition, the recently created branch of the Young Democrats, the Young Democrats High School Caucus, attempts to raise awareness and [[activism]] amongst teenagers to not only vote and volunteer, but participate in the future as well. The [[Democratic Governors Association]] (DGA), chaired by Governor [[Martin O'Malley]] of Maryland, is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents. Likewise, the mayors of the largest cities and urban centers convene as the [[National Conference of Democratic Mayors]].

Each state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex-officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair. County, town, city, and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law. Rarely do they have much funding, but in 2005, DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the &quot;50 State Strategy&quot;) of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and paying for full-time professional staffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gilgoff | first = Dan | title = Dean's List | date = 2006-07-16 | url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/24dems.htm | publisher = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{See|Political ideologies in the United States|Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)}}

Since the 1890s, the Democratic Party has favored [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions (the term &quot;liberal&quot; in this sense describes [[social liberalism]], not [[classical liberalism]]). In recent [[exit poll]]s, the Democratic Party has had broad appeal across all socio-ethno-economic demographics.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2000). Exit Poll.&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, the party has favored farmers, laborers, labor unions, and religious and ethnic minorities; it has opposed unregulated business and finance, and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign policy, internationalism (including interventionism) was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid-1960s. In the 1930s, the party began advocating welfare spending programs targeted at the poor. The party had a fiscally conservative, pro-business wing, typified by [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Al Smith]], and a [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] conservative wing that shrank after President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] supported the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which peaked in the 1936â1952 era), and the [[African American]] wing, which has steadily grown since the 1960s. Since the 1970s, [[environmentalism]] has been a major new component.

In recent decades, the party has adopted a [[Centrism|centrist]] economic and [[Social progressivism|socially progressive]] agenda, with the voter base having shifted considerably. Today, Democrats advocate more social freedoms, [[affirmative action]], [[balanced budget]], and a [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] system tempered by [[public sector|government intervention]] ([[mixed economy]]). The economic policy adopted by the modern Democratic Party, including the former [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], has been referred to as the &quot;[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-07-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party believes that government should play a role in alleviating poverty and [[social injustice]] and use a system of [[progressive tax]]ation.

The Democratic Party, once dominant in the [[Southeastern United States]], is now strongest in the Northeast ([[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]), [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]], and the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] (including [[Hawaii]]). The Democrats are also very strong in [[List of United States cities by population|major cities]].

===Liberals===

[[Social liberalism|Social liberals]] (modern liberals) and progressives constitute roughly half of the Democratic voter base. Liberals thereby form the largest united typological demographic within the Democratic base. According to the 2008 exit poll results, liberals constituted 22% of the electorate, and 89% of American liberals favored the candidate of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exit Polls ''CNN.com''.&quot;&gt;{{cite news

A majority also favor [[diplomacy]] over [[war|military action]], [[stem cell|stem cell research]], the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]], secular government, stricter [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]], and environmental protection laws as well as the preservation of [[pro-choice|abortion rights]]. Immigration and [[cultural diversity]] is deemed positive; liberals favor [[cultural pluralism]], a system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to adopting their new culture. They tend to be divided on [[free trade]] agreements and organizations such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Most liberals oppose increased military spending and the display of the [[Ten Commandments]] in public buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Research Center.&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Progressives===
{{Main|Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Democrats of America}}
Many progressive Democrats are descendants of the [[New Left]] of Democratic presidential candidate Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota; others were involved in the presidential candidacies of [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and U.S. Representative [[Dennis Kucinich]] of [[Ohio]]. The [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] (CPC) is a caucus of progressive Democrats, and is the single largest Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives. Its members have included [[Dennis Kucinich]] of Ohio, [[John Conyers]] of Michigan, [[Jim McDermott]] of Washington, [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia, [[Barbara Lee]] of California, the late Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] of Minnesota, and [[Sherrod Brown]] of Ohio, now a Senator. [[America Votes]] and the [[Leadership Conference on Civil Rights]] are liberal umbrella organizations that push for progressive causes.

===Libertarians and civil libertarians===
{{See also|Libertarian Democrat}}

Some [[libertarians]] also support the Democratic Party because Democratic positions on such issues as [[civil rights]] and [[separation of church and state]] are more closely aligned to their own than the positions of the Republican Party. They oppose gun control, the &quot;[[Prohibition (drugs)|War on Drugs]],&quot; [[protectionism]], [[corporate welfare]], [[government debt]], and an [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy. The [[Libertarian Democrat#Democratic Freedom Caucus|Democratic Freedom Caucus]] is an organized group of this faction. Some [[civil libertarians]] also support the party because of their support of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]] for [[unlawful combatants]], opposition to [[Torture and the United States|torture]] of suspected terrorists, [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]], [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless wiretapping]], [[indefinite detention]] without trial or charge, the [[Patriot Act]], the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] and what they see as the erosion of the protections of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

===Conservatives===
{{See also|Southern Democrats|Conservative Democrats}}

The [[Pew Research Center]] has stated that [[conservative Democrat]]s represent 15% of [[voter registration|registered voters]] and 14% of the general electorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Research Center.&quot;/&gt; In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], a caucus of [[fiscal conservatives|fiscal]] and [[social conservatives]] and [[centrism|moderates]] forms part of the Democratic Party's current faction of [[conservative Democrat]]s. They have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past, giving its forty plus members some ability to change legislation and broker compromises with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s leadership. Historically, southern Democrats were generally much more ideologically [[conservative]]. In 1972, the last year that a sizable number of conservatives dominated the southern wing of the Democratic Party, the American Conservative Union gave higher ratings to most southern Democratic Senators and Congressmen than it did to Republicans.

===Centrists===
Though [[centrism|centrist]] Democrats differ on a variety of issues, they typically foster a mix of political views and ideas. Compared to other Democratic factions, they tend to be supportive of the use of military force, including the war in Iraq, and are more willing to reduce government welfare, as indicated by their support for [[welfare reform]] and [[tax cut]]s. One of the most influential factions is the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), a nonprofit organization that advocates [[centrism|centrist]] positions for the party. The DLC hails President [[Bill Clinton]] as proof of the viability of &quot;[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]&quot; politicians and a DLC success story. Former Representative [[Harold Ford, Jr.]] of [[Tennessee]] is its current chairman. Centrist Democrats form the [[New Democrat Coalition]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]].

==Voter base==
[[File:Republican v Democrat Gallup 6-10.svg|thumb|right|250px|Self-identified Democrats versus self-identified Republicans (JanuaryâJune 2010 data).]]

===Professionals===
Professionals, those who have a [[Higher education|college education]] and whose work revolves around the conceptualization of ideas, have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12-percentage point margin. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party, it has become increasingly split between the two parties, leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judis &amp; Teixeira&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Academics, intellectuals, and the highly [[Educational attainment|educated]] overall constitute an important part of the Democratic voter base. [[Academia]] in particular tends to be [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressive]]. In a 2005 survey, nearly 72% of full-time faculty members identified as liberal, while 15% identified as conservative. The [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] were the most liberal disciplines while business was the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]].

===Youth===
Studies have shown that younger voters tend to vote mostly for Democratic candidates in recent years. Despite supporting [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], the young have voted in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992, and are more likely to identify as liberals than the general population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagourney&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/washington/27poll.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1182947253-8kvQkT+aYTOYz/BCpTsRCg&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Nagourney, A.

The [[Young Democrats of America]] are an affiliated organization of members of the party younger than 36 that advocates for youth issues and works for youth voter turnout.

===Labor===
[[File:Fig 109 - does someone in house belong to union.JPG|thumb|375px|left]]
Since the 1930s, a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition has been [[Labor unions in the United States|organized labor]]. Labor unions supply a great deal of the money, [[Grassroots|grass roots]] [[Political organisation|political organization]], and voting base of support for the party. Democrats are far more likely to be represented by unions, although union membership has declined, in general, during the last few decades. This trend is depicted in the following graph from the book, ''Democrats and Republicans&amp;nbsp;â Rhetoric and Reality.''&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans&amp;nbsp;â Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 126.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies (NES).

The historic decline in union membership over the past half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the [[AFL-CIO]] and [[Change to Win Federation|Change to Win]] [[National trade union center|labor federations]], as well as the [[National Education Association]], a large, unaffiliated [[teacher|teachers']] union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting [[industrial policy]] (including [[protectionism]]) that sustains unionized [[manufacturing]] jobs, raising the [[minimum wage]] and promoting broad social programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[universal health care]].

===Working class===
{{See|Social class in the United States}}
[[File:Gilbert class.svg|thumb|300px|American social classes]]

While the American [[working class]] has lost much of its political strength with the decline of [[trade union|labor unions]],&lt;ref name=&quot;What's Class Got To Do With It, American Society in the Twenty-First Century&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as those with lower [[Social class in the United States|socioeconomic status]] are less likely to vote, the working and lower classes are underrepresented in the electorate. The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of [[Clerk (position)#United States|clerical]] and [[blue-collar worker]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;The American Class Structure&quot;/&gt; Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate [[standard of living]], high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended [[social safety net]], make the majority of working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Research Center.&quot;/&gt; The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which shows that the majority of those with low [[Income in the United States|incomes]] and little education vote for the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2000). Exit Poll.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2004). Exit Poll.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2006). Exit Poll.&quot;/&gt;

===Women===
Although the &quot;gender gap&quot; has varied over many years, women of all ages are more likely than men to identify as Democrats. Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic.&lt;ref name=gallup2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/120839/Women-Likely-Democrats-Regardless-Age.aspx |title=Women More Likely to Be Democrats, Regardless of Age |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Federation of Democratic Women]] is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. National women's organizations that often support Democratic candidates are [[Emily's List]] and the [[National Organization for Women]].

===Relation to marital status and parenthood===
Americans that identify as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican.&lt;ref name=gallup2010/&gt;

[[General Social Survey|GSS]] surveys of more than 11,000 Democrats and Republicans conducted between 1996 and 2006 came to the result that the differences in [[fertility rate]]s are not statistically significant between these parties, with the average Democrat having 1.94 children and the average Republican having 1.91 children.
&lt;ref name=Fried2008&gt;[http://books.google.com.my/books?id=wGtJ66o3EyIC&amp;pg=PA1 Page 16] in: {{Cite book  | last1 = Fried | first1 = Joseph. | title = Democrats and Republicans--rhetoric and reality : comparing the voters in statistics and anecdote | date = 2008 | publisher = Algora Pub. | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-87586-603-1 | pages =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a significant difference in fertility rates between the two related groups [[liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], with liberals reproducing at much lower rate than conservatives.&lt;ref name=Fried2008/&gt;

===LGBT Americans===
[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] Americans typically vote Democratic in national elections within the 70-77% range, according to national media exit polling. In heavily gay precincts in large cities across the nation, the average was higher, ranging from 85-94%. This trend has continued since 1996 when Bill Clinton won 71% of the LGBT vote compared to Bob Dole's 16% and 13% for others. In 2000 Al Gore won 70% to George W. Bush's 25% with 5% for others, in 2004 John Kerry won 77% to George W. Bush's 23% and in 2008 Barack Obama won 70% to John McCain's 27% with 3% to others. Patrick Egan, a professor of politics at New York University specializing in LGBT voting patterns, calls this a &quot;remarkable continuity.&quot; Saying &quot;about three-fourths vote Democratic and one-fourth Republican from year to year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/press/GaySupportForObamaSimilarToDemsInPastElections.html |title=press |publisher=Law.ucla.edu |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable LGBT Democrats include current Representatives [[Barney Frank]] of Massachusetts, [[Tammy Baldwin]] of Wisconsin, [[Jared Polis]] of Colorado and [[David Cicilline]] of Rhode Island. The late activist and San Francisco Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] was a Democrat. The [[National Stonewall Democrats]] is an LGBT advocacy group associated with the Democratic Party. The [[LGBT Equality Caucus]] is a congressional caucus of 76 Democrats and 1 Republican that work and advocate for LGBT rights within the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

===African Americans===
From the end of the Civil War, [[African American]]s primarily favored the Republican Party due to its overwhelming political and more tangible efforts in achieving abolition, particularly through President Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blacks and the Democratic Party&quot; /&gt;  The south had long been a Democratic stronghold, favoring a state's right to legal slavery. In addition, the ranks of the fledgling [[Ku Klux Klan]] were composed almost entirely of white Democrats angry over poor treatment by northerners and bent on reversing the policies of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ku Klux Klan - History|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/history.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as years passed and memories waned, [[African American]]s began drifting to the Democratic Party, as [[Franklin D.

===Hispanic and Latino Americans===
The [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] population, particularly the large [[Mexican American]] population in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and the large [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]] populations in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party. They commonly favor liberal views on immigration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]] received 72% of the Hispanic vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|title=With Hispanic support for Obama waning, could Latino vote be up for grabs in 2012?|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-hispanic-support-for-obama-waning-could-latino-vote-be-up-for-grabs-in-2012/2011/09/18/gIQAG9KUdK_story.html|accessdate=30 October 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, however, the Republican Party has gained increasing support from the Hispanic community, especially among Hispanic Protestants and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]]. Along with Bush's much more liberal views on immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40% of the Hispanic vote (he did so in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]). Yet, the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], dropping from 44 to 30 percent, with the Democrats gaining in the Hispanic vote from 55% in 2004 to 69% in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2004). Exit Poll.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2006). Exit Poll.&quot;/&gt;

Democrats increased their share of the Hispanic vote in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], with [[Barack Obama]] receiving 67%. [[Cuban American]]s still heavily vote Republican, though there has been a noticeable change since the 2008 elections. During the 2008 elections Barack Obama received 47% of the Cuban American vote in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/us/21miami.html | work=The New York Times | first=Damien | last=Cave | title=U.S. Overtures Find Support Among Cuban-Americans | date=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bendixen's [[exit polls]], 84% of Miami-Dade Cuban American voters 65 or older backed McCain, while 55% of those 29 or younger backed Obama.&lt;ref&gt;http://candidatecubawatch.blogspot.com/2008/11/analysis-of-cuban-american-vote.html&lt;/ref&gt; Showing that the younger Cuban-American generation have shifted to becoming more liberal.  Unaffiliated Hispanic advocacy groups that often support progressive candidates and causes include the [[National Council of La Raza]] and the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]]. In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the Democratic caucus of Hispanic Americans is the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]].

Throughout the decade of the 2000s, 60% or more of Hispanic [[Roman Catholics]] registered voters have identified as either Democratic or leaning towards the Party.&lt;ref name=growing/&gt;

===Native Americans===
The Democratic Party also has strong support among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population, particularly in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[North Carolina]]. Though now a small percentage of the population (virtually non-existent in some regions), most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10676.html Dems woo Native American vote]. [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]. Published 5/29/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish Americans===
{{See also|National Jewish Democratic Council}}
[[American Jews|Jewish American]] communities tend to be a stronghold for the Democratic Party, with more than 70% of Jewish voters having cast their ballots for the Democrats in the 2004 and 2006 elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2004). Exit Poll.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN. (2006). Exit Poll.&quot;/&gt; Support tends to vary among specific sectarian groups. For example, only 13% of [[Orthodox Jews]] supported Barack Obama in 2008 while around 60% of [[Conservative Jews]] and [[Reform Jews]] did so.&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt; A 2010 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 60% of self-described Jews identified as Democratic or leaning towards the party, compared to 33% with those feelings towards Republicans.&lt;ref name=growing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/2010/08/19/growing-number-of-americans-say-obama-is-a-muslim/ |title=Growing Number of Americans Say Obama is a Muslim: Section 3: Religion and the 2010 Elections |publisher=Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews as an important Democratic constituency are especially politically active and influential in large cities such as [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]] and play critical roles in large cities within Presidential [[Swing States]] such as [[Philadelphia]], [[Miami]], and [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]]. Many prominent national Democrats in recent decades have been Jewish, including [[Chuck Schumer]], [[Abraham Ribicoff]], [[Henry Waxman]], [[Martin Frost]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Barney Frank]], [[Barbara Boxer]], [[Paul Wellstone]], [[Rahm Emanuel]], [[Russ Feingold]], [[Herb Kohl]], and [[Howard Metzenbaum]].&lt;ref name=ajc&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=2818289&amp;content_id=%7b1031E98B-96D6-4CA2-A3FD-2A1E4411F777%7d&amp;notoc=1 Survey].

==Recent issue stances==

Columnist [[Ezra Klein]] argues that the current Democractic Party and President Obama have adopted the same positions held by moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Ezra|title=Obama revealed: A moderate Republican|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-revealed-a-moderate-republican/2011/04/25/AFPrGfkE_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=27 April 2011|authorlink=Ezra Klein|date=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following views are generally held by most Democrats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Some Democrats take other positions on these issues.

===Economic issues===
====Minimum wage====
Democrats favor a higher [[minimum wage]], and more regular increases. The [[Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007]] was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed.

====Fiscal policy====
Democrats generally support a more [[progressive tax]] structure to provide more services and reduce [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name=how-high&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/od/monetaryandfiscalpolicy/a/high_taxes.htm |title=How High Should Taxes Be? |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=2010-06-12 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently they have proposed allowing those [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003|tax cuts the Bush administration]] gave to the wealthiest Americans to expire as written in the original legislation while wishing to keep in place those given to the middle class.&lt;ref name=how-high/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2007/12/dems_in_debate_urge_taxes_on_w.html |title=Dems in debate urge taxes on wealthiest - OPENERS - Ohio Politics Blog by The Plain Dealer |publisher=Blog.cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats generally support more [[government spending]] on social services while spending less on the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saturday, November 17, 2007 12:01 A.M.

Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary and non-monetary terms, are a more [[Productive and unproductive labour|productive labor]] force and cultured population, and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing [[Positive liberty|positive freedom]], i.e. freedom derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the [[PAYGO]] (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNC Chairman [[Howard Dean]] has cited [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's presidency]] as a model for [[Fiscal discipline|fiscal responsibility]].

====Health care reform====
Democrats call for &quot;affordable and quality health care,&quot; and many advocate an expansion of government intervention in this area. Many Democrats favor [[national health insurance]] or [[universal health care]] in a variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern [[health insurance]]. Some Democrats, such as Representatives [[John Conyers]] and [[John Dingell]], have called for a [[single-payer health care|single-payer program]] of [[Medicare for All]]. The [[Progressive Democrats of America]], a group operating inside the Democratic Party, has made single-payer universal health care one of their primary policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdamerica.org/policy/priorities.php |title=Progressive Democrats of America - Priorities (Health Care for All) |publisher=Pdamerica.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Democratic governors have supported purchasing Canadian drugs, citing lower costs and budget restrictions as a primary incentive. Recognizing that unpaid insurance bills increase costs to the service provider, who passes the cost on to health-care consumers, many Democrats advocate expansion of health insurance coverage.

Policies which most Democrats favor include:

*ending the ability of insurers to drop coverage when people get sick
*ending lifetime caps on benefits and payments insurers provide
*creating a nation-wide insurance exchange across state lines
*dropping the current anti-trust provision for insurance companies
*requiring large businesses to provide employer-based insurance
*mandating coverage for all Americans
*ending insurance companies ability to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions
*expansion of Medicaid
*providing subsidies for low to moderate income families and small businesses
*allowing children to stay on their parents coverage longer
*the expansion of Medicare to those aged 55
*importing Canadian drugs and creating a national public insurance option paid for by premiums and co-pays.

Many of these proposals were included in the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].

====Renewable energy and oil====
Democrats have opposed tax cuts and incentives to oil companies, favoring a policy of developing domestic [[renewable energy]], such as [[Montana]]'s state-supported wind farm and &quot;clean coal&quot; programs as well as setting in place a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade policy]] in hopes of reducing carbon emissions and creating incentives for clean-energy innovations.

====Environment====
Democrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of [[environmentalism]].  In more recent years, this stance has had as its emphasis alternative energy generation as the basis for an improved economy, greater [[national security]], and general environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.democrats.org/a/national/clean_environment/
|title=Agenda&amp;nbsp;â Environment
|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic Party also favors expansion of conservation lands and encourages open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and economy; it &quot;believe[s] that communities, environmental interests, and government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies. Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment. They now know this is a false choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most important environmental concern of the Democratic Party is [[global warming]]. Democrats, most notably former Vice President [[Al Gore]], have pressed for stern regulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es. On October 15, 2007, he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts to build greater knowledge about man-made [[climate change]], and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract these changes asserting that &quot;the climate crisis is not a political issue, it is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====College education====
Most Democrats have the long-term aim of having low-cost, publicly funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of Europe and Canada), which should be available to every eligible American student, or alternatively, with increasing state funding for student financial aid such as the [[Pell Grant]] or [[college tuition]] [[tax deduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Trade agreements====
The Democratic Party has a mixed record on [[international trade]] agreements that reflects a diversity of viewpoints in the party. The liberal and [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] wing of the party, including the intelligentsia and college-educated professionals overall, tend to favor [[globalization]], while the organized labor wing of the party opposes it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rorty&quot;&gt;Rorty, R. (1997). ''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought In Twentieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-00312-8&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the Clinton administration and a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a number of agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Since then, the party's shift away from free trade became evident in the [[Dominican Republic&amp;nbsp;â Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) vote, with 15 House Democrats voting for the agreement and 187 voting against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In his 1997 ''Achieving Our Country'', [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Richard Rorty]], [[professor]] at [[Stanford University]] states that economic globalization &quot;invites two responses from the Left. The first is to insist that the inequalities between nations need to be mitigated... The second is to insist that the primary responsibility of each democratic nation-state is to its own least advantaged citizens... the first response suggests that the old democracies should open their borders, whereas the second suggests that they should close them. The first response comes naturally to academic leftists, who have always been internationally minded. The second comes naturally to members of trade unions, and to marginally employed people who can most easily be recruited into right-wing populist movements.&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;88)&lt;ref name=&quot;Rorty&quot;/&gt;

====Alternative Minimum Tax====
While the Democratic Party is in support of a progressive tax structure, it has vowed to adjust the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] (AMT). The tax was originally designed to tax the rich but now may affect many households, especially those with [[Income in the United States|incomes]] ranging from $75,000 to $100,000. The party proposed to re-adjust the tax in such a manner as to restore its initial intention. According to a 2007 Reuters News Report, &quot;House Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Charles B. Rangel]] has said he will push for permanent AMT relief for those taxpayers who were never meant to pay it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Social issues===
====Discrimination====
The Democratic Party supports [[equal opportunity]] for all Americans regardless of sex, age, race, ethnicity, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], religion, creed, or national origin. The Party supports [[affirmative action]] programs to further this goal. Democrats also strongly support the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability.

====Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights====
The Democratic Party has been divided on the subject of [[same-sex marriage]], though support for it has been increasing and most of the [[List of supporters of same-sex marriage in the United States|support for same-sex marriage]] in the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]] has come from Democrats. Some members favor [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples, others favor full and equal legalized marriage, and others are opposed to same-sex marriage on religious or ideological grounds. Support for same-sex marriage has increased in the past decade according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1089a6HotButtonIssues.pdf|title=Changing Views on Social Issues|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2008 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support [[civil union]]s or [[domestic partnership]] laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm Civil Rights related polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 Democratic National Platform stated that marriage should be defined at the state level and it repudiated the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;platform&quot;/&gt; [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]], Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, did not support same-sex marriage.

President [[Barack Obama]] has stated that he considers marriage to be &quot;something sanctified between a man and a woman&quot;.

A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT related laws such as extending [[hate crime]] statutes, [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce]], and repealing [[Don't ask, don't tell]].  A 2006 [[Pew Research Center]] poll of Democrats found that 55% supported gays adopting children with 40% opposed while 70% support [[Sexual orientation and military service|gays in the military]] with only 23% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people-press.org/report/273/less-opposition-to-gay-marriage-adoption-and-military-service Less Opposition to Gay Marriage, Adoption and Military Service].

====Reproductive rights====
Most members of the Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to [[birth control]], and support public funding of contraception for poor women. The Democratic Party, in its national platforms from 1992 to 2004, has called for [[abortion]] to be &quot;safe, legal and rare&quot;&amp;nbsp;â namely, keeping it legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in abortion decisions, and reducing the number of abortions by promoting both knowledge of reproduction and contraception, and incentives for adoption. The wording changed in the 2008 platform. When Congress voted on the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, Congressional Democrats were split, with a minority (including current [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]]) supporting the ban, and the majority of Democrats opposing the legislation.

The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which declared abortion covered by the constitutionally protected individual right to privacy under the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts. As a matter of the [[Privacy|right to privacy]] and of [[gender equality]], many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct. Some Democrats also believe that poor women should have a right to publicly funded abortions.

Current [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] self-identifies as '[[pro-life]]', while President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] self-identify as '[[pro-choice]]'. Groups such as [[Democrats for Life of America]] represent the pro-life [[political faction|faction]] of the party, while groups such as [[EMILY's List]] represent the pro-choice [[political faction|faction]]. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were pro-life while a 69% majority was pro-choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm Abortion related polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport].&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-life Democrats themselves state that they represent over 40% of Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/day200412020833.asp A Pro-Choice Party No More]. By [[Kristin Day]]. ''[[National Review]]''. Published December 02, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Embryonic stem cell research====
The Democratic Party has voiced strong support for [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem cell research]] with federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=488 Those Favoring Stem Cell Research Increases to a 73 to 11 Percent Majority].

The Democratic Party has both recently and historically supported Israel.&lt;ref name=israel/&gt;&lt;ref name=leftpush/&gt; [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] has said, âWhen it comes to Israel, Republicans and Democrats speak with one voice.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=35689|publisher=[[FrontPage Magazine]]|date=July 24, 2009|title=Alan Dershowitz vs. Melanie Phillips|first=Jamie|last=Glazov|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 [[Gallup poll]] found that 64% say that they have a favorable image of Israel while only 16% say that they have a favorable image of the [[Palestinian Authority]].&lt;ref name=israel&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/104734/Americans-Most-Least-Favored-Nations.aspx Americansâ Most and Least Favored Nations]. By Lydia Saad. Gallup. Published March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the party, the majority view is held by the Democratic leadership although some members such as [[John Conyers Jr.]], [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]], [[Nick Rahall]], [[Dave Obey]], [[Pete Stark]], [[Dennis Kucinich]], [[Jim McDermott]], and [[Cynthia McKinney]] as well as former [[POTUS|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] are less or not supportive of Israel.&lt;ref name=leftpush&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0707/4986.html Left could push pro-Israel voters to GOP].

Published 7-18-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The party leadership refers to the other side as a &quot;[[wikt:fringe|fringe]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=leftpush/&gt;

The 2008 Democratic Party Platform acknowledges a &quot;[[special relationship]] with Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a clear, strong, fundamental commitment to the security of Israel, our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy.&quot; It also included: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is in the best interests of all parties, including the United States, that we take an active role to
help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a democratic, viable
Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of
Israel. To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly
committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel
against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should
continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israelâs right to exist, and
abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require
patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation
of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international
compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to
settle there, rather than in Israel. All understand that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of
final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. Jerusalem
is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for
final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/a/party/platform.html |title=Renewing America's Promise: Democratic Party Platform, 2008 |publisher=Democrats.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A January 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] study found that, when asked &quot;which side do you sympathize with more&quot;, 42% of Democrats and 33% of liberals (a plurality in both groups) sympathize most with the Israelis. Around half of all political moderates and/or independents sided with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1097/america-europe-ideological-gaps-over-israel Ideological Gaps Over Israel on Both Sides of Atlantic]. [[Pew Research Center]]. Published January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq War====
In 2002, Congressional Democrats were divided on the [[Iraq Resolution|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]]; 147 voted against it (21 in the Senate and 126 in the House) and 110 voted for it (29 in the Senate, 81 in the House). Since then, many prominent Democrats, such as former Senator [[John Edwards]], have expressed regret about this decision, and have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] have criticized the conduct of the war but not repudiated their initial vote for it (though Clinton later went on to repudiate her stance during the 2008 primaries). Referring to Iraq, in April 2007 [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] declared the war to be &quot;lost&quot; while other Democrats (especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle) accused the President of lying to the public about WMDs in [[Iraq]]. Amongst lawmakers, Democrats are the most vocal opponents of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom VI|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and campaigned on a platform of withdrawal ahead of the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]].

A March 2003 [[CBS News]] poll taken a few days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] found that 34% of Democrats nationwide would support it without [[United Nations]] backing, 51% would support it only with its backing, and 14% would not support it at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq16.htm Archive page #16 of polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' stated in early April 2003 that 70% of Democrats supported the decision to invade while 27% opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq15.htm Archive page #15 of polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Research Center]] stated in August 2007 that opposition increased from 37% during the initial invasion to 74%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/579/iraq-vietnam Pew Research Center: Along the Iraq-Vietnam Parallel]. [[Pew Research Center]]. Published Aug 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In April  2008, a [[CBS News]] poll found that about 90% of Democrats disapprove of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s conduct and want to end the war within the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm Recent polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport].&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrats in the House of Representatives near-unanimously supported a [[non-binding resolution]] disapproving of President Bush's decision to send [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|additional troops into Iraq in 2007]]. Congressional Democrats overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation that included a provision that set &quot;a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq&quot; by March 31, 2008, but also would leave combat forces in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter-terrorism operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Flaherty

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]] was passed by Congress and signed by the president after the timetable was dropped. [[Criticism of the Iraq War]] subsided after the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] led to a dramatic decrease in Iraqi violence. The Democratic-controlled 110th Congress continued to fund efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] advocated a withdrawal of combat troops within Iraq by late 2010 with a residual force of peacekeeping troops left in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;force&quot;/&gt; He stated that both the speed of withdrawal and the amount of troops left over would be &quot;entirely conditions-based.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;force&quot;&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN2639269420080727 Obama says conditions to dictate final Iraq force]. [[Reuters]]. Published July 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2009, President Obama announced, âAs a candidate for president, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains weâve made and protect our troops... Those consultations are now complete, and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months.&quot;&lt;ref name=top/&gt; Around 50,000 non-combat related forces will remain.&lt;ref name=top/&gt; Obama's plan drew wide bipartisan support, including that of defeated Republican Presidential candidate Senator [[John McCain]].&lt;ref name=top&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/19410.html Top Republicans embrace Iraq plan]. ''[[The Politico]]''. Published February 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unilateralism====
Democrats usually oppose the doctrine of [[unilateralism]], which dictates that the United States should use military force without any assistance from other nations whenever it believes there is a threat to its security or welfare. They believe the United States should act in the international arena in concert with strong alliances and broad international support. This was a major foreign policy issue of [[John Kerry]]'s 2004 presidential campaign; his platform attributed rifts with international allies to unilateralism. Barack Obama's 2008 campaign also discussed promoting the image of the United States abroad.

In a general sense, the modern Democratic Party is more closely aligned with the [[international relations theory|international relations theories]] of [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]], [[neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], and [[functionalism in international relations|functionalism]] than [[Political realism|realism]] and [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], though realism has some influence on the party. [[Wilsonian|Wilsonian idealism]], in which unilateral [[Humanitarian intervention|foreign intervention]] is justified to end [[genocide]] or other humanitarian crises, has also played a major role both historically and currently- with its supporters known as '[[liberal hawk]]s'.

====Political status of Puerto Rico====
The Democratic Party has expressed its support for the U.S. Citizens of [[Puerto Rico]] to exercise their right to self-determination.  Puerto Rico has been under U.S. sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been [[U.S. citizens]] since 1917, but the islandâs ultimate status still has not been determined and its 3.9 million residents still do not have voting representation in their national government.  Also states that U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico should receive treatment under federal programs that is comparable to that of citizens in the States.  The following are the appropriate section from the 2000, 2004 and 2008 party platforms:&lt;ref&gt;{{PDF|[http://www.democrats.org/page/-/pdf/dem-platform.pdf The 2008 Democratic National Platform]|223&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;platform&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letpuertoricodecide.com/details.php?cid=4 |title=An Introduction to Puerto Rico's Status Debate |publisher=Let Puerto Rico Decide |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Legal issues===
====Torture====
Many Democrats are opposed to the use of [[torture]] against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]], and hold that categorizing such prisoners as [[unlawful combatant]]s does not release the U.S. from its obligations under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results. Democrats largely spoke out against [[waterboarding]].

====USA PATRIOT Act====
All but two Democrats in the U.S. Senate voted for the original [[USA PATRIOT Act]] legislation in 2001. The lone nay vote was from [[Russ Feingold]] of [[Wisconsin]]; [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]] did not vote. In the House the Democrats voted for the Act by 145 yea and 62 nay. Democrats split on the renewal in 2006. In the Senate, Democrats voted 34 for the 2006 renewal, and 9 against. In the House, Democrats voted 66 voted for the renewal, and 124 against.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://educate-yourself.org/cn/patriotact20012006senatevote.shtml votes in 2001 and 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right to privacy====
The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a [[privacy law|right to privacy]]. For example, Democrats have generally opposed the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|NSA warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens]].

Some Democratic officeholders have championed [[consumer protection]] laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations. Most Democrats oppose [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]] and believe that government should not regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults as a matter of personal privacy.

====Gun control====
With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] measures, most notably the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]] of 1993, and Crime Control Act of 1994. However, some Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]].

====Death penalty====
The Democratic Party supports the [[death penalty]] far less than the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  Though most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]], both [[Russ Feingold]] and [[Dennis Kucinich]] have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in [[New Jersey#Capital punishment|New Jersey]] and in [[Government of New Mexico|New Mexico]]. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which currently prohibit it, including Massachusetts and [[New York#Capital punishment|New York]]. During the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], Signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.

In 1992, 1993, and 1995, Democratic Texas Congressman [[Henry B. Gonzalez|Henry GonzÃ¡lez]] unsuccessfully introduced the [[wikisource:Death Penalty Abolition Amendment|Death Penalty Abolition Amendment]] which prohibited the use of [[capital punishment in the United States]]. Democratic Missouri Congressman [[Bill Clay|William Lacy Clay, Sr.]] cosponsored the amendment in 1993.

During his [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|Illinois Senate career]], now-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] successfully introduced legislation intended to reduce the likelihood of [[miscarriage of justice|wrongful conviction]]s in capital cases, requiring videotaping of confessions. When [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|campaigning for the presidency]], Obama stated that he supports the limited use of the death penalty, including for people who have been convicted of raping a minor under the age of 12, having opposed the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'' that the death penalty was unconstitutional in child rape cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newser.com/story/30953/obama-backs-death-penalty-for-child-rapists.html?utm_source=ssp&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=story &quot;Obama Backs Death Penalty for Child Rapists&quot;]. [[Newser]], June 26, 2008. Retrieved 10 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Obama has stated that he thinks the &quot;death penalty does little to deter crime&quot;, and that it is used too frequently and too inconsistently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Candidates on the Death Penalty|url=http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Death_Penalty|accessdate=2009-07-26|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080704020036/http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Death_Penalty |archivedate = July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially calling itself the &quot;Republican Party,&quot; Jeffersonians were labeled &quot;Democratic&quot; by the opposition [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]], with the hope of stigmatizing them as purveyors of democracy or mob rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, Republicans have often referred to the Democratic Party using the phrase &quot;[[Democrat Party (phrase)|Democrat Party]]&quot; as a political [[epithet]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/200608160005/|title=GOP Strategists Christen 'Democrat [sic' Party' - and the Media Comply|date=August 16, 2006|work=MediaMatters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common mascot symbol for the party is the [[donkey]], although the party never officially adopted this symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democrats.org/a/2005/06/history_of_the.php History of the Democratic Donkey]. Retrieved on 2006-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson's opponents had labeled him a jackass during the intense mudslinging in [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]]. A political cartoon titled &quot;A Modern Balaam and his Ass&quot; depicting Jackson riding and directing a donkey (representing the Democratic Party) was published in 1837. A political cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] in an 1870 edition of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly]]'' revived the donkey as a symbol for the Democratic Party. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the elephant to represent the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in Midwestern states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Ohio was the rooster, as opposed to the Republican eagle. This symbol still appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbour County, West Virginia General Election Ballot|date=2008-11-04|url=http://www.wvsos.com/elections/ballots/barbourgen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ballot]]s. In [[New York (state)|New York]], the Democratic ballot symbol is a five-pointed star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballots for Upcoming Elections|publisher=[[Schenectady County, New York]]|url=http://www.schenectadycounty.com/FullStory.aspx?m=320&amp;amid=930}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority of the 20th century, Missouri Democrats used the [[Statue of Liberty]] as their ballot emblem. This meant that when [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidates received [[ballot access]] in Missouri in 1976, they could not use the Statue of Liberty, their national symbol, as the ballot emblem. Missouri Libertarians instead used the [[Liberty Bell]] until 1995, when the mule became Missouri's state animal. From 1995 to 2004, there was some confusion among voters, as the Democratic ticket was marked with the Statue of Liberty (used by Libertarians in other states) and the Libertarians' mule was easily mistaken for a Democratic donkey.

Although both major political parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American red, white, and blue colors in their marketing and representations, since election night [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] the color blue has become the identified color of the Democratic Party, while the color red has become the identified color of the Republican Party. That night, for the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: [[Red states and blue states|blue states]] for [[Al Gore]] (Democratic nominee) and red states for [[George W. Bush]] (Republican nominee). Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party. This has caused confusion among non-American observers because blue is the traditional color of the [[right-wing politics|right]] and red the color of the [[left-wing politics|left]] outside of the United States. For example, in Canada red represents the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], while blue represents the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]]. In the United Kingdom, red denotes the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and blue symbolizes the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Blue has also been used both by party supporters for promotional efforts&amp;nbsp;â [[ActBlue]], BuyBlue, BlueFund, as examples&amp;nbsp;â and by the party itself in 2006 both for its &quot;Red to Blue Program&quot;, created to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the [[United States general elections, 2006|midterm elections]] that year, and on its official website.

In September, 2010, the Democratic Party unveiled its new logo, which featured a blue D inside a blue circle. It was the party's first official logo, as the donkey logo had been used as a semi-official party logo.

[[Jefferson-Jackson Day]] is the annual fundraising event (dinner) held by Democratic Party organizations across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The song &quot;[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]&quot; is the unofficial song of the Democratic Party. It was used prominently when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was nominated for president at the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today. For example, [[Paul Shaffer]] played the theme on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]] after the Democrats won Congress in 2006. More recently, the emotionally similar song &quot;[[Beautiful Day]]&quot; by the band [[U2]] has become a favorite theme song for Democratic candidates. [[John Kerry]] used the song during his 2004 presidential campaign, and several Democratic Congressional candidates used it as a celebratory tune in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
