'''Berklee College of Music''', located in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], is the largest independent college of [[contemporary music]] in the world. Known primarily as a school for [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]] and popular music, it also offers college-level courses in a wide range of contemporary and historic styles, including [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[salsa music|salsa]], and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berklee.edu/courses/ Berklee website: need more specific link]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
Berklee College of Music is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC). NEASC is the regional accreditation agency for schools and colleges located in the New England region of the United States.

==History==
===Schillinger House, 1945â1954===
In 1945, pianist-composer-arranger and MIT graduate [[Lawrence Berk]] founded Schillinger House, the precursor to the Berklee School of Music.&lt;ref name=Haz12&gt;Hazell, Ed, ''Berklee: The First Fifty Years'' (Berklee Press, 1995), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Located at 284 Newbury St. in Bostonâs Back Bay, the school specialized in the [[Schillinger System]] of harmony and composition&lt;ref&gt;Schillinger, Joseph (1946). ''Schillinger System of Musical Composition.'' C. Fischer, Inc. (New York)&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Joseph Schillinger]]. Berk had studied with Schillinger. Instrumental lessons and a few classes in traditional theory, harmony, and arranging were also offered.&lt;ref name=Haz12/&gt; At the time of its founding, almost all music schools focused primarily on classical music, but Schillinger House offered training in jazz and commercial music for radio, theater, television, and dancing. At first, most students were working professional musicians. Many students were former World War II service members who attended under the G.I. Bill. Initial enrollment was fewer than 50 students,&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1949 there were more than 500 students.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, when the schoolâs curriculum had expanded to include music education classes and more traditional music theory, Berk changed the name to Berklee School of Music, after his son [[Lee Eliot Berk]], to reflect the broader scope of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berklee School of Music, 1954â1970===
Lawrence Berk placed great emphasis on learning from practitioners, as opposed to academics, and generally hired working musicians as faculty members. Several of the schoolâs best-known musician-educators arrived after the schoolâs name changed. In 1956, trumpeter [[Herb Pomeroy]] joined the faculty, remaining until his retirement in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer [[Alan Dawson]] and saxophonist [[Charlie Mariano]] became faculty members in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Reed player [[John LaPorta]] began teaching in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of Berkâs ideas, this practice continues into the present. Although far more emphasis is placed on academic credentials among new faculty hires than in the past, experienced performers such as [[Gary Burton]], [[Pat Metheny]], [[Joe Lovano]], and [[Danilo Perez]] have served as faculty over the years.

Another trend in the schoolâs history also began the mid-â50s. During this period, the school began to attract international students in greater numbers. For example, Japanese pianist [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] arrived in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple Grammy-winning producer [[Arif Mardin]] came from Turkey to study at the school in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The number of international students has grown steadily to 24.2 percent of total enrolment in 2010.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;[http://www.berklee.edu/about/facts.html &quot;Berklee College of Music Fact Sheet&quot; for the 2009â2010 academic year, Berklee website.] Accessed December 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Berklee initiated the first of many innovative applications of technology to music education with Jazz in the Classroom, a series of LP recordings of student work, accompanied by scores. These albums contain early examples of composing, arranging, and performing by students who went on to prominent jazz careers such as [[Gary Burton]], [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]], [[John Scofield]], [[Ernie Watts]], [[Alan Broadbent]], [[Sadao Watanabe]], and many others. The series, which continued until 1980, is a precursor to subsequent Berklee-affiliated labels. These later releases provided learning experiences not only for student composers and performers, but also for students in newly created majors in music engineering and production and music business and management.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berklee awarded its first bachelor of music degrees in 1966.&lt;ref name=Hazell74&gt;Hazell, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the first graduating class to receive degrees included Alf Clausen, Stephen Gould and Michael Rhendish. Gould taught film scoring at Berklee and is currently the Program Director for the Educational Leadership PhD program at Lesley University.  During the 1960s, the Berklee curriculum began to reflect new developments in popular music, such the rise of rock and roll, soul and funk, and jazz-rock fusion.&lt;ref name=Hazell74/&gt; In 1962, Berklee offered the first college-level instrumental major for guitar. The guitar department initially had nine students. Today it is the largest single instrumental major at the college. Trombonist [[Phil Wilson (trombonist)|Phil Wilson]] joined the faculty in 1965.&lt;ref name=Hazell77&gt;Hazell, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; His student ensemble, the Dues Band, helped introduce current popular music into the ensemble curriculum, and later as the Rainbow Band, performed world music and jazz fusions.&lt;ref name=Hazell77/&gt; In 1969, new courses in rock and popular music were added to the curriculum, the first ever offered at the college level.&lt;ref name=Hazell74/&gt; The first college course on jingle writing was also offered in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berklee College of Music, 1970âpresent===
The school became Berklee College of Music in 1970&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; and bestowed its first honorary doctorate on [[Duke Ellington]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Vibraphonist [[Gary Burton]] joined the faculty in 1971, helping to solidify the place of jazz-rock fusion in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; As Dean of Curriculum from 1985 to 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyburton.com/display_page.php?id=2 biography on Gary Burton.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Burton led the development of several new majors, including music synthesis and songwriting, and facilitated the schoolâs transition to technology-based education.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum innovations during the 1970s included the first college-level instrumental major in electric bass guitar in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and the first jazz-rock ensemble class in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Berklee founder Lawrence Berk stepped down as president.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The board of trustees appointed his son, [[Lee Eliot Berk]], to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the leadership of [[Lee Eliot Berk]], the school underwent further growth and diversification of its curriculum. The college offered the worldâs first undergraduate degree program in film scoring starting 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1981, the string department curriculum expanded to include many idioms besides classical music.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the worldâs first college-level major in music synthesis was offered,&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the worldâs first college songwriting major in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental majors also expanded to include the first college hand-percussion major in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berklee expanded its community outreach efforts in 1991 with the launch of City Music, a program designed to make music instruction available to underserved youth in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; On a more global scale, Berklee partnered with selected music schools around the world to form the Berklee International Network in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Another new major, Music Therapy, was offered beginning in 1996. In 2002, the school began offering classes online through Berkleemusic.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://namm.harmony-central.com/WNAMM03/article/Berkleemusic/Berkleemusic-com.html &quot;Eric John Up Close part 3&quot; embedded YouTube video on Harmony Central]&lt;/ref&gt; Other curriculum developments included the incorporation of a hip-hop course in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Muther, Christopher, âBerklee Professor Takes DJ Class Out for a Spinâ, ''Boston Globe,'' February 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Lee Eliot Berk]] stepped down as president of the school his father had founded and [[Roger H. Brown]] was installed as the collegeâs third president.&lt;ref&gt;Anderman, Joan: âBerklee Names Entrepreneur Roger Brown New President,â ''Boston Globe'' February 7, 2004, p. C1, C4&lt;/ref&gt; Under Brownâs leadership the college's enrollment has grown and diversified, admission is now highly selective, while further expansion of the schoolâs academic offerings have continued. In 2006, mandolin and banjo were accepted as principal instruments for the first time. The college also initiated an Africana Studies program, the Berklee Global Jazz Institute, and an American Roots Music Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berklee.edu/focused/ Focused Areas of Study, Berklee website], accessed December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawless|first=John|title=Matt Glaser to direct American Roots Music Program at Berklee|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/5933/matt-glaser-to-direct-american-roots-music-program-at-berklee/|work=Bluegrass Today|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fine|first=Eric|title=Berklee Goes Global with New Institute|journal=DownBeat|year=2010|month=February|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Students at Berklee are exposed to a range of instruments, musical styles, and career options, so they can explore possibilities and find their own paths. Toward that end, Berklee offers student musicians courses of study toward a fully accredited four-year baccalaureate degree or professional diploma. Students may combine many of Berklee's 12 majors, depending on the nature of the program. The dual major program requires a five-year course of study and is available to both degree and diploma candidates.

Starting Spring 2012, Berklee offers Global Studies Program students currently enrolled in Berklee College of Music in Boston. The program takes Berklee students to Berklee College of Music in Valencia, Spain to study courses that range in 2 areas: International Music Business and Mediterranean Music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkleevalencia.org/academic-programs/global-studies/ Global Studies Program] accessed October 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission==
Berklee's admission process is holistic.  It focuses primarily on the audition and the interview and the applicant's previous academic record. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berklee.edu/admissions/general/admissions_faqs.html Berklee Admissions FAQs] accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the application to the college, applicants are required to complete a live audition and interview. An integral part of selecting the entering class is the audition and interview experience, designed to show applicants' strengths while helping the school to assess applicants' talent and potential to succeed in Berklee's dynamic environment. Although there is a general format for the audition and interview, each experience is unique. Berklee considers all applicants for both admission and scholarship through the audition and interview process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berklee.edu/admissions/general/audition_interview.html Audition and Interview] accessed on October 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance rate for the entering class of 2011 was 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berklee.edu/about/facts.html Berklee Facts and Stats] accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:Berklee College of Music Ensemble Building.jpg|thumb|right|Berklee classroom building at 130 Massachusetts Avenue]]

Berklee remained at its original location at 284 Newbury Street from its founding in 1945 to 1966, when it moved into the larger 1140 Boylston St. building, the former Hotel Bostonian.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1972 an era of more rapid expansion began with the purchase of the Fenway Theater and the adjoining Sherry Biltmore Hotel at 150 Massachusetts Avenue. The theater was renovated and opened as the 1,227-seat [[Berklee Performance Center]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The former Biltmore Hotel provided additional classroom and practice room spaces and residence halls. It also houses the library, which was renamed the Stan Getz Library and Media Center in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berklee.edu/facilities/library.html Stan Getz Media Center and Library], accessed December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The 150 Massachusetts Avenue building is also the site of the Berklee Learning Center, which when it opened in 1993, was the worldâs largest networked computer learning facility for music education.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

The Genko Uchida Center at 921 Boylston Street opened in 1997 and houses the offices for enrollment, admissions, scholarships and student employment, the registrar, financial aid, bursar, rehearsal and classroom space, and the 200-seat David Friend Recital Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schooldesigns.com/Project-Details.aspx?Project_ID=229 Genko Uchida Building, schooldesigns.com], accessed 5/10/10&lt;/ref&gt; At 939 Boylston Street, CafÃ© 939, the nationâs only student-run, all-ages night club, hosts a full program of student performers, local and national acts, and community programs.
