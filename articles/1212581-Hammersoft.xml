==Biography==
===Early life===
'''Edin OsmiÄ''' was born and raised in [[BrÄko (city)|BrÄko]] (at the time [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]) where he finished his elementary schooling. In 1992 when the [[Bosnian war]] started, he left [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and went to [[Zagreb]], the capital of [[Croatia]], where he began attending secondary [[mechanical engineering]] school.&lt;ref name=&quot;sevdah_o_rodama&quot;&gt;Documentary film &quot;Edo Maajka - Sevdah o rodama&quot;; screenwriter and director: Silvio MiroÅ¡niÄenko, Croatia, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he returned to Bosnia to study criminal law in [[Tuzla]], but never graduated.&lt;ref name=&quot;sevdah_o_rodama&quot; /&gt;

He took an interest in hip-hop when he was still in high school and began battling at the age of 15. He also recorded a few of his demos on his own, creating his own backing by [[beatboxing]]. He went to [[Tuzla]] and became a member of the hardcore rap group Diskord, later named [[Odbrana]] (Defence). The group became one of the best in the city of Tuzla and all of Bosnia. Their demo single &quot;Odbrana '99&quot; (Defence '99) was the hit of the year on the &quot;Radio Hit&quot; station in [[BrÄko (city)|BrÄko]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sevdah_o_rodama&quot;/&gt;

After a year of studying, he left school due to financial problems and returned to Zagreb to meet a friend (from the group [[Elemental (music group)|Elemental]]) and recorded his first single &quot;Minimalni rizik&quot; (Minimum Risk) and, a month later, &quot;Mahir i Alma&quot;. The songs were top hits on the Zagreb &quot;Radio 101&quot; station's show &quot;Blackout&quot; and the response was enthusiastic. The demo, &quot;Mahir i Alma&quot;, became Kameleon's hit of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edomaajka.com/biografija/ |title=Biography |author=Edo Maajka |date=17 September 2011 |work= |publisher=edomaajka.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmjam.com/crew/edo-maajka |title=Edo Maajka |author=Fmjam |date=17 September 2011 |work= |publisher=Fmjam.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Business ventures===
In September 2006, Edo Maajka opened up a cafe bar called &quot;No sikiriki&quot;, named after his second album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superbosna.com/vijesti/muzika_i_film/edo_maajka_u_zagrebu_otvara_kafi%E6_%22no_sikiriki%22/ |title=Edo Maajka u Zagrebu otvara kafiÄ &quot;No sikiriki&quot;  |author=Portal superbosna |date=4 September 2006 |work= |publisher=Superbosna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with beverages, the cafe also serves Edo's favorite food, [[cevapi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/edo-maajka-otvorio-kafic-no-sikiriki/154880/ |title=Edo Maajka otvorio kafiÄ No sikiriki |author=Portal Jutarnji.hr |date=17 September 2006 |work= |publisher=Jutarnji list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the cafe bar, he also plans to publish a weekly  magazine which will only focus on positive things that are happening in everyday life and the music scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/edo-maajka-na-tresnjevci-otvara-kafic-no-sikiriki/153073/ |title=Edo Maajka na TreÅ¡njevci otvara kafiÄ No sikiriki |author=Portal Jutarnji.hr |date=2 September 2006 |work= |publisher=Jutarnji list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues===
Edo Maajka released his first single and music video for his third album, named &quot;[[To mora da je ljubav]]&quot;, before his album came out, in which his producer. [[Koolade]], used a the song &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; from 1969 by The Meters. Some media outlets{{Who|date=October 2011}} have criticized him for plagiarizing the music in the song. Edo answered back by saying &quot;Sampling is not stealing. In hip hop you sample music, you take someones beat and rap on that beat. My album was postponed 1 week just because of that reason, while we waited for the authorization to use that song. The fact is that sometimes this waiting for authorization can be as long as one year, we redid the beat a little, gave credit to the author and not on us. You can see that the credit goes to the author on the inside cover of the album. Hip hop is made up of sampling, that is normal. On this particular track, Koolade is not named as the beat maker, but the author is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhunity.org/vijesti/obavijesti/nepoznavatelji-hip-hopa-optuzili-edu-maajku-za-kradu.html |title=Nepoznavatelji Hip-Hopa optuzili Edu Maajku za kradu |author=Mean25  |date=12 March 2006 |work= |publisher=Hip hop Unity }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remi]], who is featured on the song, also gave a comment on the issue, saying that &quot;That is not stealing, we are dealing with sampling of a already made song. You take one part of a song and combine it with your text. People who are not in hip hop don't usually know that this is a practice in this type of music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mean25&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhunity.org/vijesti/obavijesti/nepoznavatelji-hip-hopa-optuzili-edu-maajku-za-kradu.html |title=Nepoznavatelji Hip-Hopa optuzili Edu Maajku za kradu |author=Mean25   |date=12 march 2006 |work= |publisher=Hip hop Unity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports Hall Incident===
Edo maajka held a concert in the Sports Hall ([[Dom sportova]]) in 2005. The sponsor for the concert was T-mobile Croatia. Edo held a press conference before the concert where he criticized his sponsors for the firing of workers after they changed their &quot;brand&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mean25&quot;/&gt; He also explained his decision  to work with a telecommunications monopoly by saying that he wanted his ticket for his concert to be 45 kuna or less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mean25&quot;/&gt; He added &quot;you can only do that with a compromise, no one is criticizing [[Hladno Pivo]] that they sold out because their sponsor for the tour was Ozujka beer, whose owners are also foreigners&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mean25&quot;/&gt;

===Concert in Serbia controversy===
Bassivity (music label that released Edo Maajka's album in Serbia) promoted a concert fro Edo Maajka, unknown to Edo Maajka. When Edo was asked about this in an interview for Svet magazine, he replied &quot;I don't know where this idea that I will promote my album in Belgrade came from? &quot;Bassivity&quot; did that promotion on their own. I don't plan to go to Serbia, at least in the coming months. I don't want to go to a country that promotes the burning of mosques, and yet thousands of young people are howling on the streets. If I come to Serbia for a album promotion, which I promised to do, I am sure that it will not be for a while.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;index.hr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/edo-maajka-necu-promovirati-album-u-zemlji-u-kojoj-pale-dzamije/203666.aspx |title=I don't want to promote my album in where they burn mosques|author=Mean25  |date=23 May 2005 |work= |publisher=Index }}&lt;/ref&gt; Svet also tried to bring some of Edo mistakes from the past to the light, in which they stated that he was supposed to have concert with Mile Kitic, but they never reveled the source for that.&lt;ref name=&quot;index.hr&quot;/&gt; In the same interview, Svet made some untrue and false accusations against Edo Maajka and his family, saying that his brother ans sister &quot;live from black marketing in Northern Bosnia&quot; and that his close family live of pirate sales from his own albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;index.hr&quot;/&gt;

===UNICEF's Education Action in Bosnia===
Edo Maajka was one of three artists that was featured in UNICEF's education program in Bosnia against AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/edo-maajka-kabanicom-protiv-aidsa/174291.aspx |title=Edo Maajkla against AIDS |author=Index |date=5 December 2003 |work= |publisher=Index }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feuds==
Throughout his career Edo Maajka had several feuds, although most of them have been with artists that are not hip hop musicians.

===Severina===
In 2004, a sex tape was released on the in internet that featured pop star Severina and Croatian business man Milan LuÄiÄ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=3&amp;art_id=qw1086184266820B232&amp;set_id=1 |title= Croatian pop icon red-faced over sex romp |publisher=www.iol.co.za |accessdate=2010-09-18|date= 2004-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edo Maajka addressed this sex tape on the 2004 song &quot;KliÅ¡e&quot; (Cliche), in which he said &quot;We all can rap, everyone can F*** Severina&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edomaajka.com/diskografija/ |title=Edo Maajka discography |author=Edo Maajka |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=edomaajka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tekstovi-pesama.com/edo-maajka/klise/16303/1/ |title=EDO MAAJKA - KLISE - tekst |author=Edo Maajka |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=tekstovi-pesama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severina answered back in her 2004 summer single &quot;Hrvatica&quot; with the lyrics: &quot;rappers raise a revolt, your kids are listening to the wrong mother (Maajka)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tekstovi.net/2,212,5118.html |title=Severina Hrvatica |author=Severina |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=tekstovi.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the feud Croatian hip hop artist and producer [[Bizzo]] was almost pulled into the feud, as he was supposed to be in the video spot of the song &quot;Hrvatica&quot;,where Severina calls out Edo Maajka, but after he  talked to Severina, Bizzo found out that it contained those lyrics, mentioned earlier, and he backed out because he felt that it was a bad move on the part of Severina, but mostly because he thought the lyrics were geared towards the nationality of Edo Maajka, him being a Bosnian Muslim.&lt;ref name=&quot;A.H. and N.B&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/bizzo-odbio-sudjelovati-u-severininom-pljuvanju-ede-maajke-po-nacionalnoj-osnovi/226518.aspx |title=Severina pljuje Edu Maajku po nacionalnoj osnovi, odbio je snimiti spot. |author=A.H. and N.B. |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=index.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of media outlets have criticized Severina for only going after Edo Maajka, determining that she went after him because he was more popular that her in Croatia, yet he is not an Croatian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marina BiluÅ¡&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13990/severina-napada-edu-maajku-jer-se-boji-njegove-popularnosti |title=Severina napada Edu Maajku jer se boji njegove popularnosti |author=Marina BiluÅ¡ |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=nacional.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also media have criticized her attack on Edo Maajka because others have made fun of her and named her in a number of songs about her sex tape, yet she failed to say anything to them, thus sustaining that the response to Edo Maajka was based on popularity and national orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;A.H. and N.B&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marina BiluÅ¡&quot;/&gt; Ironically, on the same album the Edo Maajka takes a shot at Severina, he lends support to her when she left her record company, but then the same record company released a best off album of hers after she left and Edo Maajka on hios single &quot;Prziiii&quot; states that &quot;Come to Croatia Records we'll make you a male Severina, we'll release your album after you leave us&quot;, implying that the artist does not get any money from the sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edomaajka.com/diskografija/|title=Prziiiii lyrics |author=Edo Maajka|date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=edomaajka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SiniÅ¡a Vuco===
This feud started when Edo Maajka was appearing more and more on TV, especially Croatian TV, while other artists, not necessarily hip hop artists, like SiniÅ¡a Vuco were not, as he claims &quot;allowed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primax&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inet.hr/~oberic/vuco.html |title=Vuco song description |author=Primax |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=inet.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vuco said while describing one of his songs that the song in question is refereeing to Edo Maajka, calling him a Turk and criticizing him being on TV more than Vuco himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primax&quot;/&gt; Edo Maajka simply answered back with a small reference to Vuco in his 2006 song &quot;UÅ¡i zatvori&quot; (Close your ears), where he said &quot;For what reason did Vuco call me a Turk&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tekstovi-pesama.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tekstovi-pesama.com/edo-maajka/usi-zatvori/16329/1/ |title=EDO MAAJKA - USI ZATVORI - tekst |author=Edo Maajka |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=tekstovi-pesama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alka Vuica===
After the release of Edo Maajka's the second studio album, he was promoting the album, which featured a number of TV spots and TV exposure such as interviews, concerts, etc... Alka Vuica in an interview for Jutarnji list said that only intellectuals listen to her and that Edo Maajka &quot;stinks of sweat and over the TV&quot;. In the same interview she supported Severina in the her feud with Edo Maajka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/alka-vuica-mene-slusaju-intelektualci-a-edo-maajka-smrdi-po-znoju-i-preko-ekrana/228865.aspx |title=Alka ustvrdila da njezinu glazbu sluÅ¡aju intelektualci, da je Edo Maajka &quot;smrdi po znoju preko televizije&quot; |author=N.B. |date=22 September 2011 |work= |publisher=index.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edo Maajka also anwered back to her calling him out in the song &quot;UÅ¡i zatvori&quot; (close your ears), with &quot;Why did Alka say that I stink over the TV&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tekstovi-pesama.com&quot;/&gt;
