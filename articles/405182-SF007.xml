'''''Simutrans''''' is a [[cross-platform]] [[simulation game]] in which the player strives to run a successful transport system by transporting goods, passengers, and mail between places. Along with ''[[OpenTTD]]'', ''Simutrans'' is an [[open source]] remake of ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''.&lt;ref name=ff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2008/11/21/freeware-friday-simutrans/|title=Freeware Friday: Simutrans|work=Big Download|publisher=GameDaily|author=James Murff|date=Nov 21st 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simutrans was originally written by [[HansjÃ¶rg Malthaner]] but it is now maintained and developed by a small team which releases bug fixes, changes or new features for the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funkelwerk.de/site/index.php/projects/simutrans/years-1997-2001 A short History of Simutrans Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simutrans is available free for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BeOS]], [[Mac OS X|Intel Mac OS X]], [[iPhone]] and recently [[AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4.x]] under the [[Artistic License]] which was adopted in 2007. Prior to that, Simutrans was a closed source game and developed internally.&lt;ref&gt;[[SourceForge:projects/simutrans/|Simutrans's Artistic License, SourceForge]]&lt;/ref&gt; Simutrans also releases nightly builds for the program and its main PAKs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simutrans-germany.com/~nightly/simutrans/index.php Simutrans Nightly]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the stable release of Simutrans is version 110.0.1. There is an &quot;[[Simutrans experimental|experimental]]&quot; release, which aims to extend the basic game.

==Overview and features==

The main goal of ''Simutrans'' is to provide an efficient transport system for passengers, goods, and mail to be transported to their desired destination fast and with minimal transfers, at the same time making the company grow and avoid bankruptcy.

''Simutrans'' has a number of factory chains that are interconnected with other chains. For example, a coal mine produces coal for a coal power plant and an oil rig produces oil for an oil power plant. Supplying a factory with electric power will increase the production and allows for fine tuning the economy. Passengers and mail are transported between different cities and tourist attractions, and may use several methods of transport to find a route to their destination.

The Simutrans executable can run many different so-called PAK-sets. These PAKs determine the objects in the game, their appearance, and can modify payments and even the main menu. Gaming experience is therefore very dependent on the PAK-set.

Simutrans currently features 12 [[Artifical Intelligence|AI]] players, and since version 110.0 has an online capability similar to ''OpenTTD''. The [[terrain]] in Simutrans is freely-modifiable, and different layer like tunnel and bridges can be stacked, allowing for subways systems or highways. It has a day and night cycle, different [[climate]]s and [[season]]s. In Simutrans, nearly all modes of transportation exist. At least [[bus]]ses/[[truck]]s, [[train]]s, and [[ship]]s are always provided. If defined in the PAK-set [[aircraft]]s, [[monorail]]s, or [[Maglev (transport)|maglevs]] can be used too.

Simutrans is [[multilingual]] and is compiled for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BeOS]]/[[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]],  [[Mac OS X]] and [[AmigaOS|AmigaOS 4.x]] which make use of several graphics libraries such as [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] only), [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] (all versions) or [[Allegro library|Allegro]] (BeOS only). It is portable to any architecture using GCC and one of the aforementioned libraries.

==Customizing==
[[File:Fuzzy bigundergroundhub.jpg|thumb|250px|Underground mode (pak128)]]
The ''Simutrans'' executable must load a PAK-set which contains the game's objects. Over the years several PAK-sets have been created, an overview is given on the official page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simutrans.com/paksets.htm PakSets]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simutrans'' can be easily expanded and modified. Simple modification can be done via editing the personal config file. Since the objects in the game just consist of a simple image and a short description file, it is very easy to create a house or add a train. Thus many contributed objects for all graphic sizes exist. The user can also add height maps and citylists which add [[city]] names into the game. Via the config file even deep modifications of the game mechanics are possible, like setting no stockpiling at factories.

==Critical reception==
[[GameDaily]]'s Big Download considered ''Simutrans'' to be one of the best freeware games, highlighting the logical system of routing passengers and freight to their destinations, decent AI opponents, and the support for custom aesthetics or rules sets. However, the sometimes unreliable vehicle pathfinding was criticised, particularly with respect to alternate routes and switches for train lines. The sound effects were deemed to be unengaging, and new players may be baffled by the range of transportation possibilities.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt;

Another review from Amiga Future came to very similar conclusions (apart from the lack of sound support on [[Amiga OS]]). Especially the depth of simulation and its stability was highlighted.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;&gt;[http://www.amigafuture.de/album_page.php?pic_id=14785 Amiga Future 82] (11/2009) 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;
