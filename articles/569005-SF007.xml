'''Gmail''' is a free, [[advertising]]-supported email service provided by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teeter|first=Ryan|title=Google Apps For Dummies|isbn=1118052404|pages=364|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=5TUv9jCaJdwC&amp;pg=SA3-PA27&amp;dq=Gmail+free+advertising+supported&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FyKWTsHIJan00gHpl8mmBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gmail%20free%20advertising%20supported&amp;f=false|coauthors=Karl Barksdale|page=3-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users may access Gmail as [[HTTPS|secure]] [[webmail]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmail-HTTPS&quot;/&gt; as well via [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]] or [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] protocols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmail Now Has IMAP Support&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/webdev/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=202601159 | title = Gmail Now Has IMAP Support | publisher = Information Week | date=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=13273&amp;topic=1556 | title = How do I enable POP? | publisher = Google |date=2007-09-03 | accessdate = 2008-06-01 | quote = You can retrieve your Gmail messages with a client or device that supports POP, like Microsoft Outlook or Netscape Mail.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gmail was launched as an invitation-only [[beta release]] on April 1, 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Gets the Message, Launches Gmail |date=April 1, 2004 |publisher=[[Google]] |url = http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/gmail.html |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became available to the general public on February 7, 2007, though still in beta status at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;goog001&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-apps-is-out-of-beta-yes-really.html |title=Google Apps is out of beta (yes, really) |accessdate=2010-06-19 |publisher=Google |work=Official Google Blog |author=Matthew Glotzbach, Director, Product Management, Google Enterprise |year=2009 |month=July}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was upgraded from beta status on July 7, 2009, along with the rest of the [[Google Apps]] suite.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBlogJuly2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-apps-is-out-of-beta-yes-really.html|title = Gmail leaves beta, launches &quot;Back to Beta&quot; Labs feature|accessdate = 2009-07-07|last = Coleman|first = Keith|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = July}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP07Jul09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gjI6d7txpkx2q7_7Z6uwM4-x-MbgD999MNJ01|title = Gmail drops 'beta' label to woo business customer|accessdate = 2009-07-07|last = Vanacore|first = Andrew|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = July}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an initial storage capacity offer of 1 [[Gigabyte|GB]] per user, Gmail significantly increased the webmail standard for free storage from the 2 to 4 [[Megabyte|MB]]&lt;!--- Note this should &quot;MB&quot; and not &quot;GB&quot; - competitors were only offering small storage until Gmail came along --&gt; its competitors such as [[Hotmail]] offered at that time.&lt;ref&gt;

Gmail has a [[search engine|search]]-oriented interface and a &quot;conversation view&quot; similar to an [[Internet forum]]. Gmail is noted by [[web developer]]s for its pioneering use of [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Storage===
[[Image:Gmail Login Page September 2011.png|thumb|right|Gmail's log-in page (September 2011)]]

On April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail, Google announced the increase from 1 GB. Georges Harik, the product management director for Gmail, stated that Google would &quot;keep giving people more space forever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetnews.com/xSP/article.php/3494491 Endless Gmail Storage]. Retrieved 30 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gmail Labs===
The Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental features of Gmail, such as bookmarking of important email messages, custom [[keyboard shortcut]]s and games. Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about each of them. This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and also to assess their popularity and whether they merit developing into regular Gmail features. All Labs features are experimental and are subject to termination at any time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labs&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=29418|title = About Labs|accessdate = 5 August 2011|last = [[Google]]|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spam filter===
Gmail's [[spam filter]]ing features a community-driven system: when any user marks an email as [[E-mail spam|spam]], this provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Users may tune the system to allow mail marked as spam to be handled in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Gmail Mobile===
Gmail Mobile is a version of Google's Gmail email service. It is a free service, developed to provide access to Gmail from mobile devices such as cell phones, or [[smartphone]]s. Gmail Mobile offers many of the features as Gmail delivered effectively to smaller, mobile screens. Users have the ability to compose, read, archive, reply, forward, mark unread, add a star, add custom labels or trash email messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-mobile-gmail-experience-for-iphone.html |title=A new mobile Gmail experience for iPhone and Android |work=Official Gmail Blog |date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 22, 2009 Google brought Push Mail support to its Gmail service using [[Google Sync]] for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10358618-94.html|title=Official Gmail push comes to iPhone, Windows Mobile|date=2009-09-22|publisher=cnet|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Gmailmobileviewgoogle.gif|thumb|Screenshot of Gmail Mobile]]

In order to use the service a user will need a Gmail account and a mobile device that meets the following requirements:
* It must have [[Internet]] access and a [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] enabled [[web browser]]
* It must be [[XHTML]] compliant
* It must have [[http cookie|cookies]] enabled and the mobile network must also allow cookies to be set
* It must allow [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] ([[Secure Sockets Layer]]) traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=38689&amp;topic=1580 Gmail Help Center]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gmail Mobile was released on December 16, 2005, and is available in more than 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/12/and-bonjour-to-better-mobile-web-gmail.html |title=ä½ å¥½, à¤¨à¤®à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥ and bonjour to better mobile web Gmail |work=Google Mobile Blog |date=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gmail on iPad===
On April 3, 2010, Google announced a new two-pane layout designed specifically for the [[iPad]]. It is delivered automatically to Gmail website users who are signed in using the device's Safari browser; they may choose to revert to the traditional layout or use the native IMAP client.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicolaou03Apr10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/gmail-on-ipad.html|title = Gmail on the iPad|accessdate = 14 April 2010|last = Nicolaou|first = Alex|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Gmail [[gadget]] for [[iGoogle]] uses interface elements from Gmail mobile, which includes the two pane layout.&lt;ref name=&quot;GmailGadget2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =

===Google Buzz===
{{Main|Google Buzz}}
On February 9, 2010, Google commenced their new service, Google Buzz, which integrates with Gmail allowing users to share links and media, as well as [[status update]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/02/google-facebook-social-networking.html|title=Google aims to take on Facebook with new social feature called &quot;Buzz&quot;|last=Guynn|first=Jessica |date=2010-02-09|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buzz was launched with an automatic opt-in, causing an uproar in the Gmail community which led Google to quickly undo its initial moves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Android Guys&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.androidguys.com/2011/02/02/road-google-buzz|title=The End Of The Road For Google Buzz?| date-2011-2-2|publisher=Android Guys|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google Voice in Gmail chat===
{{Main|Google Voice}}
In August 2010, Google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within Gmail's [[Google Chat]] interface. This service initially lacked an official name, with Google referring to it as &quot;Google Voice in Gmail chat&quot; and also &quot;Call Phones in Gmail&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Calore, Michael, [http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/08/gmail-gets-dialed-up-a-notch-with-new-calling-feature/ &quot;Gmail Gets Dialed Up a Notch With New Calling Feature&quot;], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]'', August 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC25Aug10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/08/25/google-voice-calls-gmail.html |title = Google launches free voice calls from Gmail|accessdate = 26 August 2010|last = Nowak|first = Peter|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = August | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Daily News&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/tech_guide/2010/08/27/2010-08-27_google_announces_via_twitter_1000000_gmail_calls_in_24_hours.html |title=Google announces via Twitter: 1,000,000 Gmail calls in 24 Hours |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now called [[Google Voice|Google Video and Voice Chat]]. The service allows people to make free calls from their Gmail account to U.S. and Canada, at least through the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley |first=Tony |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/204220/gmail_voice_promises_affordable_calling.html |title=Gmail Voice Promises Affordable Calling |publisher=Pcworld.com |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gmail account users can also call other countries on a fee basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN26Aug10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/26/google.gmail.phone.calls/index.html?iref=NS1|title=Google: 1 Million Gmail Calls On First Day|publisher=CNN|date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service logged over 1 million calls in 24 hours on 26 August 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN26Aug10&quot; /&gt;

=== Offline Google Mail ===
On August 31, 2011, it was announced on the Official Gmail Blog that Offline Google Mail was launched as a Chrome web app at the [[Chrome Web Store|Google Chrome Web Store]]. This HTML5-powered app is based on the Gmail web app on tablets. On April 11, 2011 Google engineer [[Sundar Pichai]] revealed that Google employees had been testing the app together with offline versions of [[Google Docs]] and [[Google Calendar]] for months and that the apps would be launched in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MG Siegler|title=Coming This Summer: Fully Offline Gmail, Google Calendar, And Google Docs|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/11/offline-gmail/|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
{{Main|Gmail interface}}

The Gmail interface differs from other Webmail systems with its focus on search and its &quot;conversation view&quot; of email, grouping several replies onto a single page. Gmail's user-experience designer, Kevin Fox, intended users to  feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Gmail}}

The idea for Gmail was pitched by [[Rajen Sheth]] during an interview with Google,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz |first=Cade |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/chromebook-raises-second-child/ |title=Chromebook: 'Father of Google Apps' Raises Second Child &amp;#124; Wired Enterprise |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to be developed by [[Paul Buchheit]] several years before it was announced to the public. Initially the email client was available for use only by Google employees internally.  Google announced Gmail to the public on April 1, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3334241
|title=Google Launches Gmail, Free Email Service - Search Engine Watch

|last=Sullivan
|first=Danny}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMAP support was added on October 24, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmail Now Has IMAP Support&quot;/&gt;

==Domain name history==
Before its acquisition by Google, the gmail.com [[domain name]] was used by a free email service offered by Garfield.com, online home of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Garfield]]''. After moving to a different domain, that service has since been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intelliot.com/blog/archives/2004/03/31/slashdot-comments-on-google-gmail/#comment-294783 | title=Slashdot Comments on Google Gmail | author=Elliot Lee | date=2004-03-31 | accessdate=2008-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2005|6|22|df=US}}, Gmail's [[CNAME record|canonical]] [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] changed from ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://gmail.google.com/gmail/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''   to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://mail.google.com/mail/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mathiasbynens.be/blogmarks/2005/06/gmail-goes-301 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070811084436/http://mathiasbynens.be/blogmarks/2005/06/gmail-goes-301 | archivedate=2007-08-11 | title=Google goes 301 | author=Mathias Bynens | date=2005-06-25 | accessdate=2007-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2010|11}}, those who typed in the former URI were redirected to the latter.

==Requirement for mobile phone number==
When attempting to create a Gmail account from some countries, Google requires a [[mobile phone]] [[telephone number|number]] that supports [[text messaging]]. In other countries this is not required for sign-up, according to Google due to service limitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMSacct&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=114129|title = I don't have a mobile phone, can I sign up?|accessdate = 2009-07-08|last = [[Google]]|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google explains this:

{{quote|If you'd like to sign up for a Gmail address, you need to have a mobile phone that has text-messaging capabilities.
If you don't have a phone, you may want to ask a friend if you can use his or her number to receive a code.

One of the reasons we're offering this new way to sign up for Gmail is to help protect our users and combat abuse. Spam and abuse protection are two things we take very seriously, and our users have been very happy with the small amount of spam they've received in Gmail. We take many measures to ensure that spammers have a difficult time sending their spam messages, getting these messages delivered, or even obtaining a Gmail address (spammers will often use many different addresses to send spam). Sending invitation codes to mobile phones is one way to address this, as the number of addresses created per phone number can be limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMSacct&quot; /&gt; }}

In some cases, Google may allow a certain number of accounts to be created per [[IP address]] without requiring a phone number. In certain countries, one can also request a voice call with a verification code as an alternative to the text message. Voice calls are only available during certain hours and will not be listed as an option outside those hours.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Gmail hoaxes==

===Gmail Paper hoax===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2007, Google made fun of Gmail by introducing &quot;Gmail Paper&quot;, where a user could click a button and Gmail would purportedly mail an ad-supported paper copy email archive for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/ | title=Welcome to Gmail (introducing Google Paper) | author=[[Google]] | date=2007-04-01 | accessdate=2008-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gmail Custom Time hoax===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2008 Google introduced a fake service, &quot;Gmail Custom Time&quot;, which would allegedly allow a user to send up to ten emails per year with forged timestamps. The hoax stated that by bending spacetime on the Google servers, the emails actually get routed through the [[Spacetime|fourth dimension]] of time itself before reaching their intended recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html |title=Gmail: Google's approach to email |publisher=Mail.google.com |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Caroline |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-9907571-36.html?tag=nefd.top |title=Google does April Fools': 'Custom time' and a Mars trip &amp;#124; The Social |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gmail Autopilot hoax===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2009 Google introduced a service called Gmail Autopilot by CADIE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/autopilot/index.html |title=Gmail Autopilot by CADIE |publisher=Mail.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Google, the service purported to automatically read and respond to emails for the user. It appeared to work by analyzing messages for the emotions expressed in the message and either providing advice to the user or automatically responding to the message.

===Gmail Motion hoax===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2011 Google introduced a service called Gmail Motion which allowed users to navigate emails, send and even dictate messages through the user's physical actions using webcams. For example, to send an email, the user would perform the action of licking a stamp, and posting it. After the user signed up, they would be directed to an &quot;April Fools'&quot; message.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMailBlog01Apr11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url =http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/introducing-gmail-motion.html|title = Introducing Gmail Motion|accessdate = 1 April 2011|last = McDonald|first = Paul|authorlink = |year = 2011|month =April| work = Gmail Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GMailMotion&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url =http://mail.google.com/mail/help/motion.html|title = Gmail Motion - A new way to communicate|accessdate = 1 April 2011|last = McDonald|first = Paul|authorlink = |year = 2011|month =April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code changes==
Gmail's JavaScript was rewritten in the middle of 2007 and was released to users starting on October 29, 2007. The new version had a redesigned contacts section, quick contacts box and chat popups, which were added to names in the message list as well as the contact list. The contacts application is integrated into other Google services, such as Google Docs. Users granted access to the new version were given a link at the top-right corner which read &quot;Newer Version&quot;. As of December 2007, most new registrations in English (US) along with most pre-existing accounts are given the new interface by default when supported. There remains the option to downgrade via a link labelled &quot;Older Version&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

These coding changes mean that only users of [[Internet Explorer 7]], [[Mozilla Firefox 2|Firefox 2]], [[Google Chrome]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 3.0]] (or more recent versions) are officially supported by Gmail and can fully use the new code. [[Opera (web browser)|Opera 9.5]] and more recent versions are not officially tested but are expected to &quot;work with all of Gmail's features&quot;. Internet Explorer 5.5+,  [[Netscape]] 7.1+, Mozilla 1.4+, Firefox 0.8, Safari 1.3 and some other browsers will give limited functionality.

During the week of January 18, 2008, Google released an update that changed the way Gmail loads JavaScript. This caused the failure of some third-party extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Criticism==

===Privacy===
Google automatically scans emails to add context-sensitive advertisements to them. Privacy advocates raised concerns that the plan involved scanning their personal, assumed private, emails, and that this was a security problem. Allowing email content to be read, even by a computer, raises the risk that the [[expectation of privacy]] in email will be reduced. Furthermore, email that non-subscribers choose to send to Gmail accounts is scanned by Gmail as well, even though those senders never agreed to Gmail's terms of service or [[privacy policy]]. Google can change its privacy policy unilaterally and Google is technically able to cross-reference cookies across its information-rich product line to make dossiers on individuals. However, most email systems make use of server-side content scanning in order to check for [[E-mail spam|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2004 privacy advocates also regard the lack of disclosed data retention and correlation policies as problematic. Google has the ability to combine information contained in a person's email messages with information from Internet searches. Google has not confirmed how long such information is kept or how it can be used. One of the concerns is that it could be of interest to law enforcement agencies. More than 30 privacy and civil liberties organizations have urged Google to suspend Gmail service until these issues are resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-06-01
| date=2004-04-19
| publisher = Privacy Rights Clearinghouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gmail's privacy policy used to contain the clause: &quot;residual copies of deleted messages and accounts may take up to 60 days to be deleted from our active servers and may remain in our offline backup systems&quot;. However, this statement does not appear in Gmail's current privacy policy. Less specifically, Google have stated that they will &quot;make reasonable efforts to remove deleted information from our systems as quickly as is practical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Google points out that Gmail adheres to most industry-wide practices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Google defends its position by citing their use of email-scanning to the user's benefit. Google states that Gmail refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages such as those that mention tragedy, catastrophe, or death.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

Gmail accounts of [[human rights activist]]s in China were hacked in sophisticated attacks â thought to use [[phishing]] and exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drummond |first=David |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html |title=Google on Blogspot.com: A new approach to China |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/search/label/security |title=Google on phishing |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/operation-aurora/ |title=on Google hack attack |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; â in late 2009. Any (web mail or other) mail system which stores and retains user's email contents is an attractive target for such attacks, but Gmail is popular with security-conscious users because of its early [[HTTPS]] secure ([[Email encryption|encrypted]]) connection support, and its more-recent HTTPS-only default setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmail-HTTPS&quot;&gt;[http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=74765 Gmail HTTPS-only default setting].

The launch of [[Google Buzz]] as an [[opt-out]] [[social network]] immediately drew criticism for violating user privacy because it automatically allowed Gmail users' contacts to view their other contacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox12Feb10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/02/12/google-buzz-privacy-flaws/?test=latestnews|title = Google Buzz Has Serious Privacy Flaws|accessdate = 2010-02-13|last = SkyNews|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = February | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skynews12Feb10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Technology/Google-Buzz-Utility-Has-Serious-Privacy-Flaws-According-To-Users/Article/201002215547473?lpos=Technology_First_Technology_Article_Teaser_Region__1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15547473_Google_Buzz_Utility_Has_Serious_Privacy_Flaws_According_To_Users|title = Google's Buzz 'Has Serious Privacy Flaws'|accessdate = 2010-02-13|last = Mansfield|first = Roddy|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = February}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical limitations===

Gmail does not allow users to send or receive executable files or archives containing executable files if it recognizes the [[file extension]] as one used for executable files or archives.&lt;ref name=&quot;exe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6590|title = Some file types are blocked|accessdate = 2009-03-01|last = [[Google]] |authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| quote = Gmail does not allow users to receive executable files
| publisher = Google
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By design, Gmail does not deliver all of a user's emails. When downloading mail through POP or IMAP access, Gmail fails to deliver messages that users have sent to themselves if the client has a copy of it already.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url         = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=13291

| quote       = [...] Gmail doesn't download copies of messages sent from within your client, or messages already available in your client.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It also does not deliver to a user's inbox (via any access interface) those messages that users have sent to [[electronic mailing list|mailing list]]s and which they might expect to receive back via the mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6588&amp;topic=1564 |title=Messages sent to mailing lists don't show in my inbox - Help Center |publisher=Mail.google.com |date=2011-03-20 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before September 29, 2010, Gmail sorted email only by conversations ([[threaded discussion|thread]]s), which can be a problem for large conversations. For example, if a user sends a query to a large group of people, all of the responses are stored in a single conversation that is impossible to break apart. There is no way to search for responses from one user without getting the entire conversation. While deletion of individual emails is possible, most operations, such as archiving and labeling, can be performed only on whole conversations. Conversations cannot be split up or combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Threading&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=7189|title = Improper message threading|accessdate = 2009-04-19|last = [[Google]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of complaints from some users, Google made conversation view optional starting September 29, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2010/sep/30/google-hears-users-allows-inbox-resorting-ar-427234/

===Outages===

Gmail has been unavailable on several occasions. On February 24, 2009, the Gmail service was offline for 2 hours and 30 minutes, preventing millions of users from accessing their accounts. People who rely entirely on Gmail for business purposes complained about these outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://venturebeat.com/2009/02/24/where-were-you-during-the-great-gmail-outage-of-february-2009/ |title=Where were you during the great Gmail outage of February 2009? |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://venturebeat.com/2008/08/11/gmail-fails-that-google-gears-integration-cant-come-soon-enough/ |title=The Gfail Whale: Gmailâs Google Gears integration canât come soon enough |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another outage occurred on September 1, 2009.   Later that day, a Google vice president, Ben Treynor, explained that the problem, which ultimately resulted in about 100 minutes of outage, was caused by overloaded routers, triggered by a routine configuration change which added more router load than expected.  Treynor wrote, &quot;Gmail remains more than 99.9% available to all users, and we're committed to keeping events like today's notable for their rarity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/09/google-explains-why-you-didnt-have-gmail/ |title=Google Explains Why You Didnât Have Gmail &amp;#124; Epicenter |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Treynor |first=Ben |url=http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/more-on-todays-gmail-issue.html |title=Official Gmail Blog: More on today's Gmail issue |publisher=Google |work=Official Gmail Blog |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Google continued to experience outages across its network, leaving users without access to their email, calendars, and virtual files.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWorld24Sep09&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/172614/google_outages_damage_cloud_credibility.html|title=Google Outages Damage Cloud Credibility|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-four hour lockdowns===
If an algorithm detects what Google calls &quot;abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised&quot;, the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and 24 hours, depending on the type of activity detected. Listed reasons for a lock-down include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockdown&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=43692|title = My account has been locked|accessdate = 23 March 2010|last = [[Google]]|authorlink = |year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;Receiving, deleting, or downloading large amounts of mail via POP or IMAP in a short period of time. If you're getting the error message, 'Lockdown in Sector 4,' you should be able to access Gmail again after waiting 24 hours.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockdown&quot; /&gt;

*&quot;Leaving multiple instances of Gmail open.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockdown&quot; /&gt;
*&quot;Browser-related issues. Please note that if you find your browser continually reloading while attempting to access your Inbox, it's probably a browser issue, and it may be necessary to clear your browser's cache and cookies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockdown&quot; /&gt;

===On behalf of===
Prior to July 2009, any email sent through the Gmail interface included the Gmail.com address as the &quot;sender&quot;, even if it was sent with a custom email address as &quot;from&quot;. For example, an email sent with an external &quot;from&quot; address using Gmail could be displayed to a receiving [[email client]] user as ''From user@gmail.com on behalf of user@OtherDomainEmailAddress.com'' (the display used by versions of Microsoft Outlook). By exposing the Gmail address, Google claimed that this would &quot;help prevent mail from being marked as spam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=22370 |title=Adding a custom 'From' address&amp;nbsp;â Gmail Help |publisher=Mail.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Gmail users complained that this implementation was both a privacy concern and a professionalism problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Manjoo |first=Farhad |url=http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/maintaining-a-true-universal-inbox-on-gmail-remains-elusive/ |title=Maintaining A True Universal Inbox on Gmail Remains Elusive&amp;nbsp;â Gadgetwise Blog&amp;nbsp;â NYTimes.com |publisher=Gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2009, Gmail announced an update to resolve this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=649d9103208e5aab&amp;hl=en |title=Update: New way to &quot;send mail as&quot; without &quot;on behalf of&quot; - Gmail Help |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated ''custom 'From:''' feature allows users to send messages from Gmail using a custom [[SMTP server]], instead of Gmail's.&lt;ref name=&quot;CustomFrom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=22370|title = Adding a custom 'From' address|accessdate = 2009-07-30|last = Google|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = July}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the issue is still present for users whose custom email address is a second Gmail account, rather than an account on a separate domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=2cb03772f39c2d61&amp;hl=en|title = Multiple Gmail accounts showing &quot;on behalf of&quot;|publisher=Google Help|accessdate = 2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark disputes==
===Germany===
[[Image:Google Mail Beta logo.png|thumb|The former Google Mail logo]]
[[Image:New_Google_Mail_logo.png|thumb|The present Google Mail logo]]
On July 4, 2005 Google announced that ''Gmail Deutschland'' would be rebranded as ''Google Mail''. The domain &lt;tt&gt;gmail.com&lt;tt&gt; is unavailable in [[Germany]] due to [[#Trademark disputes|trademark disputes]], in which cases users must use the domain &lt;tt&gt;googlemail.com&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gmail Germany Trademark dispute |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/architecture/google-loses-gmail-trademark-case-in-germany-077 |author=Juan Carlos Perez |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that point forward, visitors originating from an [[IP address]] determined to be in [[Germany]] would be forwarded to &lt;tt&gt;googlemail.com&lt;/tt&gt; where they could obtain an [[email address]] containing the new domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Mail vs. Gmail&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Mail vs. Gmail |url=http://www.freeemailtutorials.com/googleMailGmailTutorials/differencesBetweenGmailVsGoogleMail.php |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any German user who wants a &lt;tt&gt;gmail.com&lt;/tt&gt; address must sign up for an account through a [[proxy server|proxy]]. German users who were already registered were allowed to keep their old addresses.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The domains are interchangeable so users obliged to use the &lt;tt&gt;googlemail.com&lt;tt&gt; domain are unable to select addresses already chosen by &lt;tt&gt;gmail.com&lt;tt&gt; users.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Mail vs. Gmail&quot;/&gt; Inbound emails sent to either &lt;tt&gt;googlemail.com&lt;tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;gmail.com&lt;tt&gt; addresses will reach the user. When registering for an online service, Google Mail users must use the &lt;tt&gt;googlemail.com&lt;tt&gt; form of their email address to ensure that any administrative emails they send to the service, such as confirmation messages, are recognized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Mail vs. Gmail&quot;/&gt;

The German naming issue is due to a trademark dispute between Google and Daniel Giersch, who owns a German company called &quot;G-mail&quot; which provides the service of printing out email from senders and sending the print-out via postal mail to the intended recipients. On January 30, 2007, the EU's [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market]] ruled in favor of Giersch.&lt;ref&gt;

Google spoofed &quot;offering&quot; the same service in the Gmail Paper April Fool's Day joke in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html|title = Introducing Gmail Paper|accessdate = 2008-11-23|last = [[Google]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
In February 2007 Google filed legal action against the owners of &lt;tt&gt;gmail.pl&lt;/tt&gt;, a poet group known in full as ''Grupa MÅodych ArtystÃ³w i LiteratÃ³w'' abbreviated GMAiL (literally, &quot;Group of Young Artists and Writers&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;

A [[Russia]]n paid mail redirect service called &lt;tt&gt;gmail.ru&lt;/tt&gt; owns the &quot;Gmail&quot; trademark in the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===United Kingdom===
On October 19, 2005, Google voluntarily converted the [[United Kingdom]] version of Gmail  to ''Google Mail'' because of a dispute with the UK company Independent International Investment Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en-GB/googlemail.html Google Mail in the UK], retrieved 14 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4354954.stm | title=Google drops Gmail address in UK | publisher=BBC News | date=2005-10-19 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users who registered before the switch to Google Mail were able to keep their Gmail address, although the Gmail logo was replaced with a ''Google Mail'' logo. Users who signed up after the name change receive a &lt;tt&gt;googlemail.com&lt;/tt&gt; address, although a reverse of either in the sent email will still deliver it to the same place.

In September 2009 Google began to change the branding of UK accounts back to Gmail following the resolution of the trademark dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw21Sep09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.ft.com/techblog/2009/09/the-curious-case-of-the-uks-missing-gmail|title = The curious case of the UKâs missing Gmail|accessdate = 14 May 2010|last = Bradshaw|first = Tim|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2010, Google announced that they would start to phase out the &lt;tt&gt;googlemail.com&lt;/tt&gt; domain in the UK. Existing users will get the option to switch to &lt;tt&gt;gmail.com&lt;/tt&gt;, while new users will be given a &lt;tt&gt;gmail.com&lt;/tt&gt; address by default.&lt;ref name=&quot;GmailUK&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-mail-is-becoming-gmail-in-uk.html|title = Google Mail is becoming Gmail in the UK|accessdate = 4 May 2010|last = Bullock|first = Greg|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also required [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone users to perform a factory reset (requiring a back-up to prevent data loss) to restore phone functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson |first=Andy |url=http://www.bitterwallet.com/googlemail-changes-to-gmail-but-snarls-up-android-phones/29294 |title=Googlemail changes to Gmail but snarls up Android phones |publisher=Bitterwallet.com |date=2010-05-08 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
{{See also|Comparison of webmail providers}}

After Gmail's initial development and launch, many existing web mail services quickly increased their storage capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Glauser, Stephen | title = Should you switch to Gmail? | url = http://blog.tooreal.net/articles/gmail/ | publisher = Too Real | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Hotmail]] increased space for some users from 2 MB to 25 MB, with 250 MB after 30 days, and 2 GB for Hotmail Plus accounts. [[Yahoo! Mail]] went from 4 MB to 100 MB and 2 GB for Yahoo! Mail Plus accounts. Yahoo! Mail storage then increased to 250 MB and in late April 2005 to 1 GB. Yahoo! Mail announced that it would be providing &quot;unlimited&quot; storage to all its users in March 2007 and began providing it in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-6171111.html |title=Yahoo Mail to offer unlimited storage &amp;#124; CNET News.com |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gawab.com was the first email provider who offered free 2 GB space for email account.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

These were all seen as moves to stop existing users from switching to Gmail and to capitalize on the newly rekindled public interest in web mail services. The desire to catch up was especially noted in the case of MSN's Hotmail, which upgraded its email storage from 250 MB to the new Windows Live Hotmail which includes 5 GB of storage that grows with you (expands if necessary). In November 2006, MSN Hotmail upgraded all free accounts to 1 GB of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mailcall.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!CC9301187A51FE33!13754.entry |title=1 GB Hotmail mailboxes |publisher=Mailcall.spaces.live.com |date=2006-11-27 |accessdate=2011-08-12}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, AOL started providing all [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] screen names with their own email accounts with 2 GB of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.networkworld.com/net.worker/news/2005/060705-aol.html|title=AOL launches free Web mail service|date=2005-06-07|last=Saalfield|first=Peter|publisher=NetworkWorld|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google may terminate a Gmail account after nine months of inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/mail/help/program_policies.html |title=Gmail - Program Policies |publisher=Google.com |date=2008-09-12 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other webmail services have different, often shorter, times for marking an account as inactive. Yahoo! Mail deactivates dormant accounts after four months.&lt;ref name=&quot;YahooMail&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/original/account/account-04.html;_ylt=AoUq1QRsesxKcYlUimG3plq51CN4|title = Do you close accounts due to inactivity?|accessdate = 2009-04-26|last = [[Yahoo!]]|authorlink = |year = 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNHotmail&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://help.live.com/Help.aspx?market=en-US&amp;project=MailClassic&amp;querytype=topic&amp;query=WL_Mail_CONC_AboutMail.htm|title = About your e-mail service|accessdate = 2009-04-26|last = [[Microsoft]]|authorlink = |year = undated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as increasing storage limits following the launch of Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail also enhanced their email interfaces. During 2005 Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail matched Gmail's attachment size of 10 MB. Following the footsteps of Gmail, Yahoo! launched the Yahoo! Mail Beta service and Microsoft launched Windows Live Hotmail, both incorporating [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] interfaces. Google increased the maximum attachment size to 20 MB in May 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/05/gmail-doubles-maximum-attachment-size.html |title=Gmail Doubles Maximum Attachment Size to 20 MB |publisher=Googlesystem.blogspot.com |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 25 MB in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/06/gmail-increases-maximum-attachment-size.html | title=Gmail Increases Maximum Attachment Size to 25 MB | publisher=Google | accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
