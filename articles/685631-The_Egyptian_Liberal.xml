Moreover, the issue that he is best known for, are his images depicting the [[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict]] and, more recently, the [[Arab Spring]] events. Latuff himself has described his work as controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/5505-carlos-latuff-cartoonist-opinion-maker Interview with Latuff &quot;Carlos Latuff: Cartoonist and opinion-maker&quot;], Menassat, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

==Published works==
Latuff's works have been posted mostly by himself on [[Indymedia]] websites and private blogs. However, some of them have been picked up and featured in magazines such as the Brazilian edition of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://latuff2.deviantart.com/art/Bush-s-Last-Days-109635078 Mad magazine, January 2009, Brazilian edition] &lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitpic.com/3hbxub]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[The Toronto Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/living/article/433754 The Toronto Star: More than just a chic checkered scarf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few of his works were published on Arab websites and publications such as the ''[[Islamic Front for the Iraqi Resistance]]'' (JAMI) magazine, the Saudi magazine ''Character'', the Lebanese newspaper ''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/06/interview-for-jami-magazine.html Interview for JAMI magazine]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/05/my-cartoons-in-saudi-arabia-magazine.html My cartoons in Saudi Arabia magazine]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/04/article-about-my-art-in-lebanese.html Article about my art in the Lebanese newspaper &quot;Al Akhbar&quot;]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/04/cartoon-reproduced-in-iraqi-magazine.html Cartoon reproduced in Iraqi magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
A vast number of Latuff's cartoons are related to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which according to his claims : &quot;became important to Latuff after he visited the area in the late 1990s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot;&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/14746/ The Jewish Daily Forward: Simple, Offensive and Out There]&lt;/ref&gt; These cartoons are heavily critical of [[Israel]]&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot; /&gt; and have drawn criticism and allegations of uninhibited utilization of &quot;[[judeophobic]] [[stereotype]]s in the service of the [[anti-globalisation]] movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/18/israelandthepalestinians-pressandpublishing|title=Cartoon symbols of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|last=Black|first=Ian|date=19 December 2008|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''We are all Palestinians'' ({{lang-ar|ÙÙÙØ§ ÙÙØ³Ø·ÙÙÙÙÙ}}) cartoon series, various famous oppressed groups, including [[Jew]]s in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], Black [[South Africa]]ns during [[Apartheid]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and [[Tibet]]ans in [[China]], are all shown stating &quot;I am Palestinian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinkers.org/latuff Carlos Latuff: &quot;We Are All Palestinian&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latuff has also made a series of cartoons that portray Israeli [[Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2110463/ | title = Ariel Sharon portrait by ~latuff | publisher = [[DeviantArt]] | date = 2003-06-08 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2103617/ | title = Ariel Sharon by ~latuff | publisher = [[DeviantArt]] | date = 2003-06-07 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://latuff.deviantart.com/art/The-Godfather-1809410 | title = The Godfather by ~latuff | publisher = [[DeviantArt]] | date = 2003-05-02 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]], Brazilian president [[Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] PM [[Tony Blair]] among other politicians as monsters and as [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/graphics/latuff/main.php?g2_itemId=1051][http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2110858/]

&lt;/ref&gt;

Latuff is also critical of US military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has made promotional cartoons for anti-US militancy&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Victory.gif]], [[:File:Iraq war, year FOUR!.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as cartoons alleging US actions have been motivated by the chance of making profit from oil.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:KillinintheRain.png]], [[:File:Warforoil.gif]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the cartoons, there are also some that portray US soldiers as severely wounded, dead, or paraplegic or as harming Iraqi civilians.

In his comic series ''Tales of Iraq War'' ({{lang-ar|Ø­ÙØ§ÙØ§Øª ÙÙ Ø­Ø±Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø§Ù}}) he portrays &quot;[[Juba (sniper)|Juba, the Baghdad sniper]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2007/02/juba-baghdad-sniper-4.html An example episode of Juba the Baghdad sniper at Latuff's blog]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2007/02/juba-baghdad-sniper-2.html A second example episode of Juba the Baghdad sniper at Latuff's blog], [http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2007/02/juba-baghdad-sniper-arabic_07.html (Arabic)]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Iraqi insurgency]] character claimed to have shot down several-dozen US soldiers, as a &quot;superhero&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latuff2.deviantart.com/art/Latuff-in-NOX-Magazine-125566238 Interview with Carlos Latuff]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made a caricature of US President George W. Bush laughing over US casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/graphics/Latuff3/Anti-America/Laughs.gif.html 'Laughs' by Carlos Latuff (infoshop.org)], [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Laughs.gif Commons Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of 2010, he's been consistently engaged in producing cartoons about the [[Arab Spring]] in which he openly sided with the revolutionaries. After the victory of revolutions in [[Tunisia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]] his cartoons about these countries have focused on the menace of [[counter-revolution]] or [[imperialism|Western interference]]. Some of his cartoons have been displayed in mass demonstrations in Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/29/us-brazil-cartoonist-mideast-idUSTRE77S3IW20110829 Rio cartoonist inspires Arab rebellions from afar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twicsy.com/i/QsLSL Latuff's cartoon displayed in Tahrir Square]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabawy.org/2011/07/16/no-military-tribunals-2/ Stop military tribunals]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
His works were criticized by a writer for the Institute for Global Jewish Affairs, part of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] (an Israeli [[NGO]]), for allegedly containing antisemitism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anti-Israelism, Jewish Studies&quot;&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=3&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=624&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=4636&amp;TTL=Antisemitic_Cartoons_on_Progressive_Blogs Anti-Semitic Cartoons on Progressive Blogs Adam Levick]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based [[Holocaust survivors]] organization [[Aktion Kinder des Holocaust]] sued the [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]] of Switzerland on the charge of [[anti-Semitism]] for publishing Latuff's cartoon titled ''We are all Palestinians'' series in their website, which depicted a Jewish boy in [[Warsaw Ghetto]] saying: &quot;I am Palestinian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alex SchÃ¤rer: [http://www.akdh.ch/ps/woz040402.htm Linke und Antisemitismus: Der Indymedia-Streit - Aufpassen, was im KÃ¼bel landet], ''Die Wochenzeitung'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Junge Welt]]: [http://www.akdh.ch/indymedia4.htm Ãrger im Internet: Wegen antisemitischer BeitrÃ¤ge hat Indymedia Schweiz den Betrieb gestoppt], February 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aktion Kinder des Holocaust: [http://www.akdh.ch/latuff2.htm Is this cartoon by Latuff, published at indymedia-switzerland, anti-Semitic? An analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal proceedings were suspended by Swiss court.&lt;ref name = Redress&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redress.btinternet.co.uk/ahamadeh2.htm | title = Jewish peace activists and Israeli violence | month = August | year = 2002 | first = Anis | last = Hamadeh | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Latuff placed second and won $4,000, for his cartoon comparing the [[Israel]]i [[West Bank barrier]] with the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, in the controversial [[Iran]]ian '[[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irancartoon.com/120/holocaust/ Winners of the Iranian Holocaust Cartoon Competition], IRANCARTOON International&lt;/ref&gt;
The contest was created in response to Muhammad cartoons published by a Danish newspaper (see ''[[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]''), under the notion that those who supported the right to free speech in matters concerning Islam would be placed in a precarious position were they to condemn the [[antisemitic]] cartoons aimed to mock and ridicule the Jewish [[Holocaust]].
Latuff's entry was described as &quot;Holocaust inversion,&quot; a &quot;motif&quot; of antisemitism, by [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Gerstenfeld]]: [http://www.spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=1792 &quot;Ahmadinejad, Iran, and Holocaust manipulation: methods, aims, and reactions&quot;], ''[[Scholars for Peace in the Middle East|Scholars For Peace in the Middle East]]'', February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2003 Annual Report, the [[Stephen Roth Institute]] compared Latuff's cartoons of [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] to &quot;the [[antisemitic]] caricatures of [[Philipp Rupprecht]] in [[Julius Streicher]]'s [[Der StÃ¼rmer]].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;SRI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/general-analysis.htm|title=General Analysis: Overview|year=2003|work=Annual Report|publisher=[[Stephen Roth Institute]]|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SRI also complained over a cartoon showing [[Che Guevara]] in a Palestinian [[keffiyeh]].&lt;ref name = &quot;SRI2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Response===
In an interview with the Jewish-American weekly newspaper ''[[The Forward]]'' in December 2008, Latuff responded to charges of antisemitism and the comparison to Streicher:&lt;blockquote&gt;
My cartoons have no focus on the Jews or on Judaism. My focus is Israel as a political entity, as a government, their armed forces being a satellite of U.S. interests in the Middle East, and especially Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. It happens to be Israeli Jews that are the oppressors of Palestinians.â¦My detractors say that the use of the [[Magen David]] in my Israel-related cartoons is irrefutable proof of antisemitism; however, itâs not my fault if Israel chose sacred [[religious symbol|religious motif]]s as [[national symbols]], such as the [[Knesset Menorah]] or the [[Star of David]] in killing-machines like [[F-16]] jets.&lt;ref&gt;
