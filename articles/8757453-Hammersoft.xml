'''Claro''' (''formerly Telecom'') is a mobile and fixed phone, broadband and television service provider in the [[Central American]] country of [[El Salvador]].

Controlled by the mother company [[Telecom]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} in [[El Salvador]] (owned by [[America Movil]] of [[Mexico]]), '''Telecom''' started its [[wireless]] service as '''Personal''' around 1999, but later changed to [[ALÃ]] with its new motto  ''&quot;Facil y Rapido&quot;'' (Spanish for ''&quot;Fast and Easy&quot;'') but even though '''Personal''' didn't disappear. But on September [[2006]], [[America Movil]] and its vision to unify the brand in [[Latin America]] changed '''Personal''' and '''ALÃ''' to the whole new Claro.
