'''[[Sailing|Sailing/Yachting]]''' is an [[Olympic sport]] starting from the Games of the 1st [[Olympiad]] ([[Sailing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] in Athens {{GRE}}). With the exception of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and possibly the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916]] sailing was always a part of the Olympic program.
The Sailing program of 1936 consisted of a total of four sailing classes (disciplines). For each class seven races were scheduled from 4â12 August in the [[Kiel Fjord|Firth of Kiel]].

For the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Summer Olympics]] a choice had to be made between the Berliner [[MÃ¼ggel Lake]] district or the Kiel area. Finally the Organizing committee made the decision in favour of the big boats and picked Kiel.

As a result of the distance between Berlin to Kiel, a special committee for Yachting sprung to life to assist the Organizing Committee for the XIth Olympiad. Since Kiel was mainly a military port this Committee had to cooperate not only with the local authorities but also with the Commander of the German Fleet in Kiel to ensure the success of the races. 

One race area was created to the East of Schielksee and two in the harbor area more into the fjord.
[[File:1936 Outer Course Kiel.png|thumb|left]]
The start was made in the center of a set of 8 numbered marks that were places in a circle. During the starting procedure the sequence of the marks was communicated to the sailors. By picking the mark that was most upwind the start could always be made upwind. This system is, at least in certain German lakes, still in use.

== Remarks ==
=== Sailing ===
[[File:Olympic fire (on vessel left) from the yachting home in kiel.jpg|thumb]]
* This Summer Olympics established Sailing as a full mature Olympic sport after a long struggle to get a unified International standard set of rules.
* Each Olympic Gold medalist was also given a plant during the prize giving ceremony.
* Spain withdrew from sailing before the opening ceremony, as part of its boycott of the 1936 Summer Olympics.
* The Swiss 6 Metre was eliminated for all races since the helmsmen turned out not to be an amateur.
* Many protests in the Metre classes were filed. Speculations were made about whether this was due to the scoring system. One of the reasons was probably the close racing.
* The Olympic flame was burning on a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] [[galleon]] in the harbor of Kiel.
* In total a number of 257 participants were entered. 169 of them competed, the others were reserves or team managers and so on.

===Media===
[[File:Floating transmission station.jpg|thumb]]
* A floating transmission station was used for reporting the race events to shore.
* New media was also used in the protest room. On the footage made from a [[Zeppelin]], for the film [[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]] of [[Leni Riefenstahl]], an incident was observed by the jury between Sweden and Finland in race No. VI of the 8 Metre. As result both teams were disqualified.

=== Sailors ===
During the Sailing regatta's at the 1936 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:
* {{flagIOCteam|NED|1936 Summer}}, [[Daan Kagchelland]] in the O-Jolle is among the first sailors that did physical exercises on structural basis. Therefore he was able to compensate his light body weight during heavy air races.
* {{flagIOCteam|GER|1936 Summer}}, [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]] in the 8 Metre, Played an important role for Germany in World War II.
* {{flagIOCteam|GBR|1936 Summer}}, [[Peter Scott]] in the O-Jolle became later one of the presidents of the [[IYRU]]. He also was the one who advised to put the trapeze on the [[Flying Dutchman (dinghy)|Flying Dutchman]].
