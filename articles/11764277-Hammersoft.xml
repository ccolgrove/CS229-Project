==Biography==
Tonny Sorensen was born on March 9, 1964 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].  He earned a Bachelors of Engineering in Electronic Engineering from the [[University of Copenhagen]], and a degree in Business and Trade from a Copenhagen trade school.  Sorensen was a member of Denmarkâs Taekwondo team at the [[Taekwondo at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Official Report, Games of the XXIVth Olympiad Seoul 1988, Volume 2, Competition Summary and Results |year= 1989 |month=September |  url=http://www.aafla.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1988/1988v2.pdf | accessdate=2010-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won a Gold Medal in the Heavyweight division of the [[1991 World Taekwondo Championships|1991 World Taekwondo Championships in Athens, Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtf.org/wtf_eng/site/hall/01_international_championships/01-World-Taekwondo-Championships-Women/Women_10th.html|title=International Championships, 10th World Taekwondo Championships |publisher=[[World Taekwondo Federation]] |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sorensen subsequently owned the Glad Saxe [[dojo]] in Denmark, an elite school that produced several Taekwondo world champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/worldtaekwondo.shtml|title=World Taekwondo Championship Medalists |publisher=Hickok Sports |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xmedialab.com/mentor/tonny-sorensen|title=Tonny Sorensen: CEO and Owner, Von Dutch Originals; Co-founder, Planet Illogica (Los Angeles) |publisher=X Media Lab |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorensen moved to the [[United States]] in 1991, settling in [[Los Angeles]], where he studied acting, screenwriting and filmmaking.  In 1998 he co-produced the 1998 movie ''American Intellectuals'', starring [[Portia de Rossi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0136705/fullcredits|title=Full cast and Crew for American Intellectuals |publisher=[[Imdb]] |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorensenâs renegade style of management earned him a reputation as a rebel in the world of fashion. His âone-second ruleâ, in which he instantly decides on whether or not to pursue a new project, design or program, led to the global phenomenon that was the [[Trucker hat|Trucker Cap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Moore | first = Booth | authorlink = | coauthors =

== Kustom Kulture and Von Dutch Originals ==
[[File:Trucker arugatse.jpg|thumb|200px|right| The [[Trucker hat|Trucker Cap]], popularized by [[Von Dutch|Von Dutch Originals]] under the leadership of Tonny Sorensen]]In the mid-1990s, Sorensen purchased a [[hot rod]] [[Cadillac]] and became involved in [[Southern California]] car culture.  Sorensenâs [[Venice, California|Venice]] mechanic introduced him to the art and design of [[Kenny Howard|Kenny &quot;Von Dutch&quot; Howard]] the father of the [[Kustom Kulture]] movement that has heavily influenced the fashion and style of [[hot rods|hot rodding]], [[surf culture]], [[skateboarding]] and [[rock 'n' roll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2006-05-18/culture/von-rich/|title=Von Rich.

Sorensen invested in Von Dutch Originals in 2000 and became its CEO, opening the Von Dutch Melrose Avenue retail location that same year.  Sorensen expanded Von Dutch from a niche t-shirt and hat line to a full-scale fashion collection adding hoodies, jeans and accessories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilary behind brand&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hilary.com/fashion/von-dutch.html|title=Von Dutch:Behind the Brand|publisher=Hilary Fashion |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sorensen rapidly grew the business, opening stores in Las Vegas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Chicago and Miami, with wholesale distribution to Japan, Canada and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/style/articles/0113vondutch.html|title=Hats off to Von Dutch|publisher=azcentral.com |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Von Dutch Originals used high-level product placements and celebrity involvement to propel the brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilary behind brand&quot;/&gt;  In the height of the brandâs popularity, [[Britney Spears]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Ashton Kutcher]] were regularly photographed wearing the Von Dutch [[trucker hat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aiga.org&quot;/&gt;  Sales reached $33 million in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newfaces.com/magazine/von-dutch-pt2.php|title=Von Dutch:Behind the Brand |publisher=New Faces Free Magazine |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitmeout.com/fashion/von_dutch.php|title=Von Dutch Jeans |publisher=KitMeOut:Original Online Fashion Brand Directory |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as high as $100 million in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;aiga.org&quot;/&gt;  Von Dutch Originals was sold to Groupe Royer S.A. in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek.com&quot;/&gt;
In 1996 he had his first daughter named nadja sorensen

== Planet illogica ==
Influenced by the free and open trade mentality of [[Freetown Christiania]], an artist enclave near [[Copenhagen]], and his success as a brand entrepreneur at Von Dutch, Sorensen was inspired to build an online artistic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118015719?refcatid=3690&amp;printerfriendly=true|title=Creatives network on Net |publisher=Variety Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 he partnered with [[Ken Goldstein]], founder of marketing agency Six Shooter LA, and formerly Marketing Director of Von Dutch, to form [[Planet illogica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.brr.com.au/event/66613/tonny-sorenson--ken-goldstein-co-founders-of-planet-illogica-part1|title=COMMSEC entrepreneur series |publisher=Boardroom Radio Australia |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online collaborative tool for artists.  The site launched in July 2009 with the help of the [[American Film Institute|American Film Instituteâs Digital Content Lab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.afi.com/education/dcl/roster/|title=Planet Illogica Artist in Residence Program |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://blog.afi.com/main/index.php/2009/10/28/afi-fest-2009-presented-by-audi-presents-third-afi-digifest-showcase-november-4-and-5/|title=AFI FEST 2009 Presented by AUDI presents third AFI Digifest November 4 and 5 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site and organization are designed to serve as a tool to help artists create, promote and sell their work, and build collaborative relationships with other artists and commercial [[brands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/05/21/littlebigplanet-the-patch-new-artists-and-levels/|title=LittleBigPlanet &quot;The Patch&quot; â New Artists and Levels|publisher=Playstation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Planet illogicaâs business model relies on product sales and licensing of [[user-generated content]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.brr.com.au/event/66613/tonny-sorenson--ken-goldstein-co-founders-of-planet-illogica-part1|title=Commsec Entrepreneur Series. Tonny Sorenson &amp; Ken Goldstein: Co Founders of Planet Illogica |publisher=Boardroom Radio Australia |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Borrowing on Sorensenâs earlier experience with Von Dutch, Planet illogica focuses on the commercial intersection between emblematic art and brand associations with that art, deliberately fostering relationships between art, brand imagery and commercial advertising.&lt;ref name=&quot;trendhunter.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/ron-english-interview|title=Ron English, Pop Artist (INTERVIEW) |publisher=Trendhunter Magazine |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planet illogica also serves as a vehicle for Sorensen to scout and develop talent.  Select artists are supported by the organizationâs artist in residence program, which provides marketing, management, legal and financial support for the artist, and which facilitates joint artistic ventures with Planet illogicaâs alliance partners.  Planet illogicaâs affiliate network includes [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony PlayStation]], [[Best Buy]] and [[Guitar Center]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118015719.html?categoryid=3690&amp;cs=1|title=Creatives network on Net:Online collaboratives a new source for film distribution |publisher=[[Variety Magazine]] |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.planetillogica.com/capabilities/air-artists|title=Planet illogica Artist in Residence Program |publisher=Planetillogica.com |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Planet illogicaâs marketing support of its artists in residence include their 2010 [[South by Southwest]] art exhibit of American contemporary artist [[Ron English (artist)|Ron Englishâs]] ''Historic'' ''[[KISS (band)|KISS]]'' art and other music-related prints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/18864-rock-roll-according-to-ron-english|title=Rock &amp; Roll According to Ron English |publisher=[[Juxtapoz Magazine]] |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its online sale and promotion of custom limited edition apparel from Englishâs ''Popaganda'' collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;trendhunter.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popaganda.com/store_tshirts.shtml|title=Popaganda, The Art and Crimes of Ron English |publisher=Popaganda.com |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetillogica.com/ronenglish|title=Ron English store |publisher=Planet illogica |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Planet illogica continues Sorensenâs promotion of fashion lines, with its launch of artist Civil Smithâs ''American Heritage'' apparel collection, the ''California Christiania Republic'' line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xmedialab.com/mentor/tonny-sorensen|title=CEO and Owner, Von Dutch Originals; Co-founder, Planet Illogica (Los Angeles) |publisher=X Media Lab |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetillogica.com/civilsmith/posts/2009/11/who-civil-smith|title=Who is Civil Smith? |publisher=Planetillogica.com |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sorensenâs own ''Tonny Sorensen Collection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetillogica.com/shop/products/67x1|title=Planet illogica shop, Tonny Sorensen |publisher=Planetillogica.com |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== California Christiania Republic ==
In 2010, Tonny Sorensen officially launched his new clothing brand, California Christiania Republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefashionreporter.com/blog/2010/11/24/dave-teams-up-with-ccr-on-mtvs-the-buried-life/|title=Dave teams up with CCR on MTV's &quot;The Buried Life&quot;...|publisher=thefashionreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CCR, with a one-piece casual suit called the one*Z. The clothing item, which is adorned with the &quot;Freedom Star&quot; of CCR, was clearly featured in several popular music videos, including Willow Smith's debut music video, &quot;Whip My Hair&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myfashioncents.com/2010/features/looks-for-less/willow-smith-ccr-onez-jumpsuit-whip-my-hair-video/?cdu=disabled|title=Willow Smith Wears $99 CCR OneZ Jumpsuit in &quot;Whip My Hair&quot; Video|publisher=myfashioncents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wpgc.radio.com/2010/10/21/wanna-dress-like-willow-smith/|title=Wanna Dress Like Willow Smith |publisher=wpgc.radio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the clothing line is a reference and homage to [[Freetown Christiania]] and part of Sorensen's effort to save the town,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=da&amp;u=http://msndk.starlounge.com/tags/Tonny_S%25C3%25B8rensen&amp;ei=2k2ITeydKIm4sAP7zo2SDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ7gEwCTgU&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DTonny%2BSorensen%2BCCR%26start%3D20%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divnso|title=Pajama-party at Zen|publisher=msndk.starlounge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from being taken over by the current Danish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g189541-i218-k4255656-l31369752-Danish_government_to_take_control_of_Christiania-Copenhagen_Zealand.html|title=Copenhagen Forum: Danish government to take control of Christiania|publisher=www.tripadvisor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outofthestormnews.com/2010/12/01/ezra-fox-explores-christiana-the-free-denmarks-sort-of-lawless-place/|title=Ezra Fox Explores Christiania the Free â Denmarkâs (Sort Of) Lawless Place|publisher=outofthestormnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=133866246|title=Danish Supreme Court Deals Blow To Hippie Enclave|publisher=npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Social Ventures ==
Sorensen has also engaged [[Planet illogica]] and his Tonny Sorensen Foundation to support other social ventures, including ''Manifest Equality'', an art and music event used as vehicle to raise awareness of [[LGBT]] civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/slideshow/vote-for-love-manifest-equality-art-show-29371560/|title=Vote for Love:Manifest Equality Art Show |publisher=[[LA Weekly]] |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Starts With U ''Global Sustainability Symposiumâs'' work regarding social inclusion of minority groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swu.com.br/en/global-sustainability-symposium/ |title=SWU and Nestle present the Global Sustainability Symposium |publisher=Starts With U |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Climate Refugees'', a documentary about climate change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.care-international.org/Featured-Articles/the-human-face-of-climate-change.html |title=The human face of climate change |publisher=Care International |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Save Our Oceans Tour'', which is a series of music, film and art installations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.savemyoceans.com/oceans_concerts.php |title=Oceans is on tour |publisher=Savemyoceans.com |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fine Art &amp; Auto Collections ==
Sorensen's auto collection features the most valuable motorcycle in the world, Steve McQueen's Von Dutch 1929 Scott 596cc Super Squirrel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://motorcyclemuseum.org/classics/bike.asp?id=134 |title=1929 Scott Super Squirrel, restored by Von Dutch Originals |publisher=AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a rare Ray Allen world champion 1970 Chevelle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sportscarmarket.com/car-reviews/american/2404-1970-chevrolet-chevelle-ss-454-ls6-convertible |title=1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 LS6 Convertible |publisher=Keith Martinâs Sports Car Market |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1969 Mercury Cyclone Boss 429 NASCAR (winner of the 1969 NASCAR circuit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legendarycollectorcars.com/2010/07/1969-mercury-cyclone-spoiler-and-spoiler-ii-history/ | title=1969 Mercury Cyclone Spoiler and Spoiler II History |publisher=Legendary Collector Cars |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
