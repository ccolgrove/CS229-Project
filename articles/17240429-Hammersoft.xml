The '''Libertarian Party of Louisiana''' '''(LPL)''' is the [[Louisiana]] affiliate of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. The state chair is [[T. Lee Horne, III]].  It is the third largest party in Louisiana and one of five officially recognized parties in the state.  The LPL has two legislative accomplishments to its credit, one a friendlier ballot access law passed in 2004, and the other, a defeat of a bill which would have redefined any party under 40,000 registered voters as a &quot;minor&quot; party and not deserving of federal primary elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://louisianalibertarian.net/News_%26_Events/Entries/2009/5/27_HB_776_Defeated_In_Committee.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The party is currently organizing individual parishes with their own party committees and is recruiting candidates for the upcoming 2011 statewide elections.

==Membership==

Party membership as of July 12, 2010 was 3,442 registered voters statewide and over an additional 3,000 affiliated members.  Party membership increased dramatically over the previous year, due chiefly to the interest in the 2008 presidential election and the candidacy of former Congressman [[Bob Barr]] of Georgia and &quot;The King of Vegas&quot; [[Wayne Allyn Root]] of Nevada as Barr's VP running mate.

To become a member of the Libertarian Party in Louisiana, one simply need register as &quot;Libertarian&quot; on their voter registration form, or ask their Parish Registrar of Voters to change their party affiliation to &quot;Libertarian.&quot;

Those registered Libertarians who also pay annual dues, are automatically registered for the State Convention, can seek party office, and can vote at the convention on party business.  The party currently offers the following memberships: 1 year = $120, 2 years = $220, and 5 years = $500.  Members may also substitute qualified volunteer time in lieu of monetary payment for yearly dues at the rate of $10 per hour.

The State Central Committee recently adopted the impressive goal of increasing its registration to 40,000 by December 31, 2011.  If the party is successful in doing so, the State of Louisiana will hold a Presidential Preference primary for the Libertarian Party on Saturday, February 11, 2012 according to State law. (LA RS 18:1280.21.A)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=81288&lt;/ref&gt;  Achieving this goal would also head off future attempts at relegating the LPL to &quot;minor party&quot; status as was attempted in the recent Spring 2009 legislative session.

==Party organization==

The Party is organizing on the parish level as required by state law similar to that used by the larger Democrat and Republican parties.  This consists of a Parish Executive Committee ''(PEC)'' made up of one member from each incorporated district, and unincorporated ward in a parish.  (at-large committee members are not included at this time)  From among themselves, the Committee selects a Parish Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Membership Officer, Elections Officer, and Campus Officer.  These officers are chosen every four years by caucus of party members in the parish. (state run elections will be used if the party has more than 5% of the registered voters in the state)

The PEC's are the primary organizational unit of the LPL and are responsible for membership, fund raising, electioneering and public outreach within their parish.  They are also responsible for implementing and overseeing the Government Liaison program of the LPL.

The state is also divided into Metropolitan Regions containing certain parishes, and each is loosely centered on the larger cities in the state.  At present there are nine Metro Regions: Shreveport, Monroe, Central Louisiana, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, North Shore, New Orleans, and Bayou.  Each Region is represented by one individual on the State Central Committee who is chosen by caucus prior to a State Convention.

The LPL is governed by a State Central Committee which serves as the Party's Board of Directors.  This committee is chosen every four years at an annual State Convention.  Its members include: Party Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer, the Metro Region Representatives, and five At-Large Representatives.  (larger parties in Louisiana must elect State Central Committees based on State House districts)  The five At-Large Representatives serve as chairs of each of the five Supporting Party Committees - Finance, Registration, Elections, Economic Development, &amp; Media Relations.  The five At-Large Representatives and the Vice-Chairman serve as the Strategic Planning Committee.

==Government Liaison Program==
This program is designed to increase participation in the party, as well as help advance Libertarian public policy goals in the state.  The program also serves as a 'candidate in training' experience, and is part of what the Party hopes will be an ongoing information awareness and civic participation program.  Government Liaisons are analogous to a 'mirror government' or a &quot;shadow cabinet&quot; in the British tradition.

Individuals are encouraged to select a public office that interests them in their parish.  The initial goal is to gather as much information about the office as they can including term of the office, pay rates, duties and responsibilities, past and current office holders, as well as past and current policy issues associated with the office.  Once the basic information is assembled, that individual should meet with that elected or appointed official on a regular basis to discuss current policy from a Libertarian perspective.  In this fashion, it is hoped that by being more familiar with Libertarian principles, public officials will be more open to them, as well as perhaps learning something about the issue and how it affects their constituents.  It is envisioned that actual legislation or policy actions will be borne out of this project and advanced through current channels and office holders.

The added benefit of being a Liaison is that one will naturally be well informed about the issues, the office, and the official, in order to be better prepared for public service and running for office themselves.  (either the office they are studying, or another which is similar)  At the very least, Government Liaisons will be an invaluable resource for any future LPL candidate seeking that office.

==Ballot access==
The LPL is one of five officially recognized parties in Louisiana and as such its members are designated by &quot;LBT&quot; on voter registration cards rather than &quot;other&quot;, and its candidates have &quot;Libertarian&quot; printed next to their names on the ballot.  Being a recognized party, only filing fees dictated by statute are required to be placed on the ballot; petition signatures are not needed.

Louisiana has one of the most liberal ballot access laws in the nation, due in no small part to efforts by the LPL in 2004.  The LPL approached independent members of the state legislature and urged them to support legislation that would formally recognize additional parties and distinguish their candidates on the ballot from other parties and from independents.  The measure passed and currently a party can choose two methods of recognition:  method A) register 1,000 voters, pay a $1,000 fee, and register with the La. Secretary of State; or B) achieve at least 5% of the total votes in any statewide election.  To retain ballot access, a party must maintain at least 1,000 registrants and field a statewide candidate at least once every four years if choosing option A, or repeat the 5% or better vote total if qualifying by method B.  The LPL chose method A and has maintained that status and has fielded statewide candidates every year since.

===''Libertarian Party et al. v. Dardenne 2008''===
Due to problems arising from Hurricane Gustav closing state offices during the 2008 qualifying period and other issues, the LPL did not meet the filing deadline to place Libertarian Party Presidential candidate Bob Barr on the ballot for November.  State law at the time, allowed for a 72 &quot;grace period&quot; where the national party could secure a ballot line for their candidate, where the state party had failed to do so.  The LNC filed their paperwork within 72 hours of the state party missing the deadline, but the Secretary of State, [[Jay Dardenne]] refused to add Barr's name to the ballot.  Litigation commenced with the first round in U.S. District court going to the LP, however, the Judge agreed to a two day stay of his order to reprint the ballots pending appeal by the State.  Dardenne won the next two rounds at both the fifth circuit and the US Supreme court and so Barr did not appear on the 2008 Louisiana ballot.  Notably, neither the Fifth Circuit Appeals court, nor the Supreme Court addressed the issue of a Secretary of State or a Governor altering the deadlines for qualifying set by the legislature as a violation of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution in rendering their decision.  Instead, both courts focused on the issue that the LPL failed on its own accord to meet the filing deadline, (which was never disputed) and they both used the circular logic that the State's act of printing the incorrect ballots precipitated a hardship for the State to have to reprint them and that overseas, military, and absentee voters would be needlessly &quot;confused&quot; by receiving a second ballot.  Both courts also failed to acknowledge findings from the District court that the State had received the LP filing before the &quot;proof&quot; copy of the ballot was returned from the printer for final approval, and that the state could have printed the ballots correctly without this confusion or hardship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.capital.edu/News/Archive/2008/20081028Brown.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party primaries==
In 2006, Louisiana adopted &quot;closed&quot; partisan primaries for U.S. Congressional and Senate races for all recognized parties.  This means that if two or more Libertarians qualify for the first party primary for either a U.S. House District or U.S. Senate Seat, then there will be a separate primary just for these Libertarian candidates.  To date, only the Republicans and Democrats have held partisan primaries under this system.  If three or more Libertarians qualify for a House or Senate seat, and no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first primary, the top two candidates advance to a second party primary ahead of the general election in November.

The system is &quot;closed&quot; in that a registered voter of any of the five recognized parties in the state may only vote in their own party's primary.  A party may choose to further restrict its primary by prohibiting independent (non-affiliated) voters or those not affiliated with a recognized party from participating in their process.  To date, only the Republican Party has excluded independents and non-recognized party voters from their primaries.  Voters may choose (only one) primary to vote in if there is one being held.  All voters are eligible to vote for any candidate, regardless of party affiliation in the general election.

Elections for State and Local races are still conducted by the &quot;jungle primary&quot; method where all filed and qualified candidates appear on the ballot without regard to party affiliation, and anyone can vote for any candidate, also without regard to party affiliation.

Update - Congressional races will once again be held by the jungle primary method as the State legislature has repealed the law mandating party primaries for those elections.  The change will take effect after the 2010 November general election.

==Current candidates==
'''US Senate'''
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Randall Todd Hayes entered the campaign for the US Senate seat held by David Vittter without any prior announcement, unintentionally creating the first third party primary in Louisiana's history. Hayes was an activist in the Louisiana Libertarian Party before his run for Senate and before that was instrumental in getting [[Ron Paul]] on the ballot in Louisiana in his run for President.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anti-politician.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Hayes defeated Madeville native Anthony &quot;Tony G&quot; Gentile in that primary on August 28, 2010 by a 62% to 38% margin.  2,483 votes were cast in that primary statewide.  (approximately a 72% party turnout)  Hayes now faces Democrat Charlie Melancon and Republican incumbent David Vitter in the General Election on November 2nd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The LPL is seeking serious candidates for Statewide and regional offices that are up for election in 2011, particularly for each of the BESE board districts to be elected in October 2011.  (see below)

&quot;Serious&quot; candidates, are those individuals who genuinely wish to serve the public as elected officials, and are willing to do as much as is in their power and within their abilities to effectively campaign and participate in the electoral process, with the intent and mindset of actually getting elected.  There is little if any evidence of any candidate in modern times being elected to office who thought it &quot;impossible&quot; to win the race, and who took no or little effort to do so.

The LPL strongly discourages &quot;paper&quot; candidates who simply file for ballot access merely to give themselves and their friends a &quot;choice&quot; of voting for someone other than the other party candidates.  Instead, the LPL would respectfully request that such persons donate the hundreds or even thousands of dollars they would have spent on their own filing fees to another real campaign, or to the party itself to advance Libertarian policy. If a &quot;paper&quot; candidate files in any race, the LPL will take every measure possible to recruit a &quot;serious&quot; candidate into the race.  Such &quot;paper&quot; candidates will most likely not receive any endorsement from the State Party.

Additionally, many local races will be decided between now and November 2010, as well as some municipal elections being held in November, and the LP encourages anyone contemplating entering public service on this level to notify them as soon as possible to begin the process of campaigning.

==State platform==
The state party platform is geared towards state issues, or national issues where state government has some influence or jurisdiction.  Issues that are national or international in scope and can or should only be addressed by Congress, the President, or the Supreme Court are not allowed in the state platform.

The platform consists of two parts, General Principle Planks and specific Policy Issue Planks.

===General Principles===
The General Principles fit under the three headings of the Louisiana State Motto &quot;Union, Justice, Confidence&quot; and should act as guides in formulating policies on specific issues.

====Union====

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Federalism&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Louisiana is a sovereign State jealous of its territories and powers and zealously 
guards them.  We have a reciprocal responsibility to our fellow States to bind the 
national government with the chains of the Federal Constitution.  We pledge in 
this union, assistance to protect all from Invasion from without and to maintain 
republican government in our own territory.&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;International relations&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We jealously guard our national and state sovereignty against any attempt to 
institute a supranational government, organization, or instrument designed 
towards such ends.  International relations should be conducted on a case by 
case basis only with relevant nations.  We will not subordinate public money to 
foreign interests, nor interfere with the governing of, or initiate the use of force 
against,  sovereign peoples.  We encourage limited, legal immigration, for our 
general benefit.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Militias&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Louisiana is responsible for maintaining the general militia for the protection of 
itself, the Union, and to execute the laws.  Each able individual has the 
responsibility to be knowledgeable and safe in the proper use of force so that he 
may provide for the defense of himself, his family, and the People.  To these 
ends, the individual right of each to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Laissez faire markets&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;All markets should be free of regulation and interference by government, using 
an honest weight and measure as a medium of exchange.  All markets shall be 
kept free of any fraud and coercion.  The free flow of goods, services and 
information among the several States should not be hindered.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Taxes&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Taxation should be limited in its scope and light in its impact.  Congress should 
be held to the constitutional restrictions on taxation in both form and purpose.  
Direct, apportioned taxes are preferred for both state and national revenue.  
Louisiana must ensure that the tax laws are not misapplied or improperly 
enforced to the detriment of the citizen.  All taxation should be approved by a 
three-fourths majority of the legislature and three-fourths of the people.  No tax 
passed for any purpose shall last longer than five years.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;National party platform&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We adopt, affirm, and agree with the planks of the Libertarian Party Platform 
insofar as they are consistent with and supportive of the concepts of limited 
republican government as espoused in the Declaration of Independence, the 
Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution for the United States of America.&lt;/dd&gt;

====Justice====
&lt;dt&gt;Citizenship&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We hold that all Men born in Louisiana, or in any one of the several United 
States, now domiciled in Louisiana, regardless of race or gender, are Citizens of 
Louisiana, and enjoy all of the benefits, rights, powers, authorities, 
prerogatives, and privileges of a sovereign.  At no time is any Citizen of Louisiana 
in any way subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, while within the 
territory of Louisiana.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Individual rights&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We affirm the principles espoused in the Declaration of Independence - that all 
Men are created equal, with inalienable rights; that the sole purpose of 
government is to protect these rights; that it is the responsibility of the People 
to alter or abolish their form of government whenever it becomes destructive of 
this purpose, instituting new government more conducive to their liberty.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Contracts&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We uphold the right to freely contract with others outside of interference or 
coercion.  Government has the obligation to enforce performance of private 
contracts, when requested by a counter-party, without regard to public policy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Corporations&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Corporations are chartered by government for the benefit of the People 
generally and no one specially.  Corporations do not enjoy, nor should they be 
bestowed, the same individual and inalienable rights of Men.  No Man should ever 
be deemed to be, or be treated as, a corporation.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Public resources&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Those resources, natural or otherwise, held in the public trust, are held so for 
the benefit of all the People generally and none specially.  The holding of public 
resources in trust by government does not confer any power to government to 
restrict or otherwise regulate the use or enjoyment of those resources by any 
one of the people except so as to preserve its future use for all.  Any Man or 
Corporation deriving profit from use of public resources shall owe a royalty to 
the Treasury, to be used for the benefit of the People generally.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Juries&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;All jurors have the power to decide both the Law and the Facts in every case.  It 
is the responsibility of all jurors to serve as a check against overreaching 
government and find for acquittal if in their opinion the law or its enforcement is 
unjust.  Juries must be given all evidence relevant to their decision, and they 
should be present for all proceedings affecting the defendant.&lt;/dd&gt;

====Confidence====
&lt;dt&gt;Elections&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;All elections should be secure and free from tampering or fraud.  All votes should 
have a permanent paper record, and a publicly accessible electronic record, and 
should be counted in each precinct in full public view.  The process, machines, or 
software used to count votes, be they manual, mechanical, or electronic, shall 
be open to the public.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Accountability&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;All public officials, elected or otherwise are fully and personally, legally and 
financially accountable to the people.  Non elected positions should be bonded, 
and All Officials should be subject to a Grand Jury of the People, assembled for 
the purpose, should they be deemed to have violated their oath of office, the 
law, or enjoy personal benefit while acting under color of law.  All proceedings of 
government, in any form or fashion whatsoever, should be open to the public, 
either at the time of their occurrence or by publishing of their activities.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Preparedness&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Government officials have the duty to maintain civil defense procedures and 
emergency supplies or supply networks, held in trust for the People.  All due 
diligence should be exercised in anticipating contingencies and relief needs.  In 
No case should the government ever hinder or prevent the People or any one of 
Them from securing their own personal Safety and Security or that of their 
family or neighbors.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Constitutions&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Our Federal and State Constitutions are the supreme law of the land.  They 
should be maintained as general, yet absolute temporary delegations from the 
people, of powers to various institutions of government.  They should not be 
amended for light or transient causes, nor should their basic provisions be 
constructed so as to require amendment to assent to laws which would otherwise 
be in the purview of the Legislature or the People themselves.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Budgets&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Government has the duty and obligation to spend within the means of the 
Treasury.  Debt should not be incurred unless in dire emergency as invasion or 
rebellion or natural disaster as shall not admit of any other remedy.  A full cash 
and accrual basis accounting of all Public resources and Monies shall be issued to 
the People no less than once per calendar year.  Louisiana shall not accept or 
cause to be accepted, any Thing except Gold or Silver coin as a tender in the 
payment of debt as required by the United States Constitution.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Initiatives&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We recognize the imperfection of vesting all power in government.  We support 
the People in reserving their right of Legislative, Executive, and Judicial 
Initiative, and of Legislative Referenda.  We also hold that our state constitution 
should reflect this right of the People, and outline a structure and guidelines for 
the People to properly exercise their power.&lt;/dd&gt;

===Policy issues===
The following are current policy issues which the party is advancing through electoral and legislative means.

====L.E.A.P. Testing &amp; school seizures====
The LPL State Convention in 2009 adopted a resolution of their concerns and suggestions for improvements with respect to the State's use of L.E.A.P. testing as a means for grade promotion in government schools. (private and parochial schools are not required to use the test)  The test is statutorily required as a means to gauge performance of the &quot;school&quot;, rather than the students.  This has not stopped the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) from using low test scores to seize locally run schools, taking possession over the buildings, the institutions themselves, and control of the local property tax funds dedicated to run those schools.  The state however does not use L.E.A.P. testing in any school they have seized so there is no comparison in the quality of the education students are receiving before and after the seizure.  Other than general state constitutional authority to seize locally controlled schools and locally owned property, there are also serious legal implications and problems with commandeering tax revenues authorized by the voters for use by local school boards when there was no indication that the state could ever effectively &quot;take&quot; the revenue for their own use when the taxes were put before the voters for approval.

The LPL is working with the Louisiana chapter of the NAACP in the fight to end L.E.A.P. testing as a grade promotion tool, and to restore control of government schools back to the control of local school boards, and the voters that elected them and pay the taxes to fund them.

The resolution is as follows:

The State Central Committee Hereby instructs the Strategic Planning Committee and the Elections Committee to: 
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;identify and seek out Libertarians to run for each of the BESE positions in the 2011 statewide elections, and to&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;draft a formal policy for these candidates and the party to campaign with containing the following&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standardized (LEAP) tests should either be abolished entirely, or they should be removed from being used as a factor in the determination of grade promotion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The state of Louisiana must cease and desist the seizure of schools from local ownership and control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in law should be sought that:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;i&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;prohibits the use of any standardized test as a factor in grade promotion, and that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides criminal penalties for the unlawful taking of locally owned property and institutions without just compensation and voter approval, and that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires the return of any such seized property and institution, and that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requires repayment of all tax money taken and/or used by the state on any school, while it was under the control of the state, back to the local school jurisdiction from which the voters had approved it to be held and used in trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

====2011 legislative package====
At its July 12 meeting, the State Central Committee announced issues it wishes to push in the upcoming 2011 state House and Senate races.  These measures include so far:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banning the use of cameras in enforcement of state laws.  This would be a more general ban that would affect the current use of traffic cameras in enforcing red light and speed infractions.  A specific ban on such cameras, as well as a bill authorizing their use were introduced in the Spring 2009 legislative session, but both bills were defeated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A State constitutional amendment setting the pay for all public officials to the median income of their district or equivalent pay in the private sector for comparable jobs on a pro-rata basis.  This would undo the recent pay-raise the LA Legislature passed for itself and remove the ability to set pay from the legislature's hands.  (the &quot;burden&quot; of setting their own pay was noted during the recent pay raise fiasco)  State employees would be paid the median paid in the private sector for the same amount of work.  Elected officials would be paid the median income from their district (or the state, if a State-wide office). Variations such as multiples of the median may be necessary for such offices as Governor.  Additionally, if an employee or official does not work full time, they are paid their respective rate only for the time actually worked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A State constitutional amendment that would require all legislation to apply equally to everyone the law affects without exception for public officials or employees of the state.  This would prohibit the state legislature from exempting themselves or any part of the government from any laws passed upon the people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

==Party success==
The Libertarian Party of Louisiana has had some success in elections. In the 2006 election for Louisiana's 6th Congressional District, Libertarian candidate [[Richard Fontanesi]] received almost 18% of the total vote or 19,644 votes. This was a very strong showing for a candidate who raised very little money. In 2000 and 2002, in the race for the Louisiana's 7th Congressional District seat, both candidates received 17% and 13% of the vote, respectively. IN 2006 S.B.A. Zaitoon received 11% of the vote in a special election for Insurance Commissioner, garnering over 60,000 votes, this is the most for any Louisiana Libertarian candidate in a Statewide race.  Also, in 2009, the party was instrumental in defeating Louisiana HB 776, which would have caused Reform, Green and Libertarian Congressional candidates to appear only on the general election ballot no matter how many there were of each, and without the benefit of a party primary.  This issue has been rendered moot since the repeal of party primaries to take effect after the November 2010 general election.
