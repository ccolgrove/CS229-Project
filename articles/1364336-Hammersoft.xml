A '''Cambodian American''' is an American who is born, raised, or from [[Cambodia]] usually of [[Khmer people|Khmer]] descent but also including [[Chinese Cambodians]], Vietnamese Cambodians, [[Cham people (Asia)|Cham people]] and other ethnicities of Cambodia.  The term may also refer to Americans who have ancestors that are born, raised or from Cambodia.

==History==
Prior to 1975, most of the few Cambodians in the [[United States]] were children of upper income families or having government funded scholarships sent abroad to attend school. After the fall of [[Phnom Penh]] to the [[communism|communist]] [[Khmer Rouge]] in 1975, a few Cambodians managed to escape, but not until the Khmer Rouge was overthrown in 1979 did large waves of Cambodians began immigrating to the United States as [[refugee]]s. In order to encourage rapid [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into American culture and to spread the economic impact, the U.S. government settled the 150,000 refugees in various towns and cities throughout the country.  However, once established enough to be able to communicate and travel, many Cambodians began migrating within the U.S. to certain localities where the climate was more like home, where they knew friends and relatives had been sent, or where there were rumored to be familiar jobs or higher government benefits.  Consequently, large communities of Cambodians took root in cities such as [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] in [[California]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]], as well as [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]] and [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] in [[Massachusetts]], and in the [[Pacific Northwest]], [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

As of 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey there were 275,379 American citizens of Cambodian heritage (both naturalized U.S. citizens and citizens born in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southeast Asian Americans at a Glance|url=http://www.searac.org/sites/default/files/SEAAs_At_A_Glance_Jan_2011.pdf|publisher=Southeast Asia Resource Action Center|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of concentration==
Major communities that include high numbers of Cambodian Americans exist across the [[United States]], including [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] (36,233), [[Boston]] (17,301), [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] (4,441), [[San Diego]] (4,314), [[New York City]] (4,060), [[Philadelphia]] (7,790), [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] (10,552), [[Minneapolis]] (4,149), [[Seattle]] (12,391), [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] (4,173), [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] (9,330), [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] (9,313), [[DallasâFort Worth metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth]] (5,596), [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] (2,959), and [[Chicago]] (2,764). In the 2006 American Community Survey, figures for Cambodian-Americans were released back in September 2007 by the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the 2006 report, the top ten states for Cambodian-Americans were #1: [[California]] (86,700), #2: [[Massachusetts]] (22,106), #3: [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] (13,055), #4: [[Texas]] (11,646), #5: [[Minnesota]] (7,790), #6: [[Pennsylvania]] (6,787), #7: [[Virginia]] (6,153), #8: [[New York]] (5,720), #9: [[Rhode Island]] (5,030), and #10: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (4,592). Half of the Cambodian American population in the United States is in California, with Long Beach having the highest density of Cambodian Americans in the U.S. There is also a large population in [[Massachusetts]], concentrated in around [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]]. Lowell is considered to have the second highest population of Cambodians, Lynn is the third city with the highest population. Cambodian Americans are quickly growing in numbers in the entire [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], but more so in the states of [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York]]. [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]] have also seen growth in the Cambodian American population.

There are two [[museum]]s in the U.S. devoted to the story of Cambodians in America, the Cambodian Cultural Museum and Killing Fields Memorial in [[Seattle]] and the Cambodian American Heritage Museum and Killing Fields Memorial in [[Chicago]], both founded in 2004.

==Cambodian American studies and culture==

Aside from personal memoirs of coming to America, such as those by [[Loung Ung]], a few books have been dedicated to studying the Khmer American population in the U.S., such as ''Khmer American: Identity and Moral Education in a Diasporic Community'' by Nancy J. Smith-Hefner. This book is an anthropological study of Khmer refugee families, largely from the perspective of the parental generation, residing in metropolitan Boston and eastern Massachusetts. This book was one of the early books among the few, circulating, that talks about this [[Diaspora|diasporic]] community. It portrays some understanding of both traditional Khmer culture and contemporary American society, but it is not a historical study of Khmer Americans. A more recent book is, ''Buddha Is Hiding'' written by [[Aiwha Ong]], an ethnographic study that tells the story of Khmer Americans and their experiences of American citizenship. The study was largely investigating Khmer refugee in Oakland and San Francisco Bay Area.  It portrayed what most Cambodian refugees experience with American institutions such as health, welfare, law, police force, church, and school. The book reveals through extensive ethnographic dialogs showing how Khmer refugees interpret and negotiate with American culture, often at the expense of their own cultural [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] cultural upbringing. This book revealed the contradictions in how Khmer American encounters with American citizenship as they negotiate with service providers, bureaucrats, and employers on how to be autonomous while the system and American cultural citizenship limits them within terms that labeled them as refugees in the context of ethnicity, race, and class.

''Survivors: Cambodian Refugees in the United States'' written by [[Sucheng Chan]], is a multidisciplinary study of Khmer American, drawing on interviews with community leaders, government officials, and other staff members in community agencies as well as common Khmer American to capture the perspectives of Cambodian Americans from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds.

A survivor of the [[Cambodian genocide]], Dara Duong, has founded ''[[The Killing Fields]] Museum'' in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.killingfieldsmuseum.com/ The Killing Fields Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;
