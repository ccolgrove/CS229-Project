'''Harrah's Louisiana Downs''' is a [[horse racing]] track and [[racino]] located in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]]. 

Louisiana Downs opened in 1974. It was built by [[shopping center]] developer [[Edward J. DeBartolo Sr.]], a longtime supporter of horse racing; it was third race track he developed, along with [[Thistledown (racecourse)|Thistledown]] and [[Remington Park]]. [[Harrah's Entertainment]] purchased the track in 2002. 

The track is home to the [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] [[Super Derby]], a race run each September since 1980 at the classic [[United States]] stakes distance of 1Â¼ miles (2,000 m). The race often attracts winners and top finishers from the season's [[American Classic Races]] races.

The [[Thoroughbred]] meet takes place from early May through October. A [[quarter horse]] meet is held from January through March.

The casino features 1,300 slot machines.
