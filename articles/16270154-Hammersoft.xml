'''Per-Olov Kindgren''' (born June 10, 1956 in [[BogotÃ¡]], [[Colombia]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[classical guitar]]ist, [[composer]] and [[music teacher]] known for his [[classical guitar]] playing ranging from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] to [[The Beatles]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kindgren was born in [[BogotÃ¡]], [[Colombia]] to a [[Sweden|Swedish]] father and a [[Denmark|Danish]] mother. Per-Olov's father Owe, an engineer, worked for the Colombian branch of [[Ericsson|LM Ericsson]] installing telephone stations. The family returned to [[Stockholm]] when Per-Olov was three years old. He lived there from 1960 till 1970. At the age of six Per-Olov was fascinated by a bright red electric guitar in a shop window. The Beatles became his heroes, and he especially admired [[Paul McCartney]]. His parents acquired a [[classical guitar]] for his seventh birthday present. In 1970 he saw a documentary about [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] broadcast on Danish national television, and from that day on, he knew what he wanted to become. When Per-Olov was 14 years old, his family moved to the border town [[HelsingÃ¸r]] in [[Denmark]]. In doing so he could more easily attend a Swedish high school in [[Helsingborg]], where he met his first classical guitar teacher [[Torvald Nilsson]].

===Professional life===
In 1976 he began to study at [[The Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in [[Copenhagen]], where he moved during his studies and where he lives and works today. He studied there for 7 years with professor [[Per-Olof Johnson]] until his graduation in 1983. Even while continuing his studies, he became a music teacher, teaching at both music schools in [[VallensbÃ¦k]] and [[Gentofte]] for 24 years. Presently Kindgren only works as a music teacher at the music school in Gentofte. His work as a music teacher provides him with a steady living along with the concerts he performs. In 1979 he joined with three other guitarists, [[Steffen Broe Christensen]], [[Dag Egil Berge]] and [[Torsten Borbye Nielsen]], forming the Nordic Guitar Quartet. which performed more than 400 concerts throughout the years. Per-Olov composes pieces for [[solo (music)|solo]] guitar, as well as for [[duet (music)|duets]], [[trio (music)|trios]], [[quartet]]s up till [[septet]]s and [[octet (music)|octets]] for guitar. In 1998 he composed pieces for [[choir]], [[orchestra]] and a [[Rock band#Rock and pop bands|rock band]] for the 25th anniversary of the VallensbÃ¦k music school and in 2000 he composed a Christmas [[Oratorio]] for [[organ (music)|organ]], [[guitar]], [[flute]]s, choir and [[narrator]]. In 2009, the great French [[guitarist]] and composer [[Jean Marie RAYMOND]] wrote for him a beautiful music piece, a little jewel called [http://www.productionsdoz.com/c378004449p17576611.1.html &quot;As always&quot;].

==Musical style==
Kindgren's style is mainly classical, with influences from [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[easy listening]]. In addition to his classical repertoire Per-Olov also plays works of The Beatles. Kindgren likes to describe his own compositions as songs without words.

A friend of his, JÃ¸rgen, had bought a guitar from the Swiss luthier whom he had met in [[Bern]] during his studies and loved its superb quality. Per-Olov asked his friend to order a guitar for him and nine months later he was able to visit Philippe Jean-Mairet in Switzerland to test his new guitar.
