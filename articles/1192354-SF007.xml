'''IBM WebExplorer''' was an early [[web browser]] designed at [[IBM]] facilities in the [[Research Triangle Park]] for [[OS/2]].

==History==
[[Image:IBMExploreWikipedia20040224.png|thumb|200 px|Spanish IBM WebExplorer displaying [[Wikipedia]] in 2004]]
Presented in 1994 with [[OS/2 Warp]] (v3), it was hailed as the best browser by ''[[Internet Magazine]]'' in their November issue{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} and leveraged its position as the only native browser in OS/2 at that time. It was based on the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser and was a ''coming attraction'' in ''The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML''. Almost immediately after the introduction of OS/2 Warp version 3, IBM dismantled the development team and that relegated the WebExplorer to the annals of history. IBM WebExplorer, at that time, was the browser application to beat. OS/2 Warp 4 (1996) included it, but also included a link to download an OS/2 version of [[Netscape Navigator]] 2.02, which was late for shipping on CD.  IBM had already planned the substitution of WebExplorer.

==Features==
*Support for [[HTML]] 3.0 (with tables)&lt;ref name=&quot;readme1.1h&quot;&gt;[[Read me]] file of the Web Explorer 1.1h.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Newsreader (Usenet)|Usenet reader]]
*Some of its parts could be reused in other programs&lt;ref name=&quot;EDM&quot;&gt;[http://www.edm2.com/0405/scope.html Under the Scope] section. [[EDM/2]] June 1996,
Volume 4 Issue 5&lt;/ref&gt; and scripted with [[Rexx]]. Some external companies used this capability to offer an enhanced browser with IBM's rendering engine&lt;ref name=&quot;WebNav&quot;&gt;[http://www.bmtmicro.com/BMTCatalog/multipleos/webnav.html WebNav 2.0] added user interface enhancements on WebExplorer rendering.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A page could define what the animated [[throbber]] should look like. It was implemented through a non-standard &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;frame&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[HTML tag]]. OS/2 users created several animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hobbes.nmsu.edu|url=http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-browse?sh=1&amp;dir=//pub/multimedia/video/webexani|publisher=hobbes.nmsu.edu|accessdate=2009-04-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070705094652/http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-browse?sh=1&amp;dir=/pub/multimedia/video/webexani |archivedate=Jul 05, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later introduction of [[Framing (World Wide Web)|web frames]] leads WebExplorer to confusion on modern pages

--&gt;

==Criticism==
The browser doesn't support [[Framing (World Wide Web)|Frames]] and the installation of [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] like Java was complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Dave|title=A Quick Look at Web Explorer|url=http://www.scoug.com/os24u/2001/webexplorer.html|publisher=The Southern California OS/2 User Group|accessdate=16 August 2010|date=21 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
