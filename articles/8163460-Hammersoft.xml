[[es:MÃºsica de Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]
The music of the ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics (series)|Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' series, composed of ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', a spin-off of the main ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', a spin-off game from ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', its sequel, ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions]]'', a remake of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', was primarily composed by [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]]. The only input from [[Nobuo Uematsu]], the main composer of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, was in the soundtrack to ''Tactics Advance''.  He was assisted by [[Masaharu Iwata]] in composing the music for ''Final Fantasy Tactics''. The ''Final Fantasy Tactics Original Soundtrack'', a compilation of almost all of the music in the game, was released by [[DigiCube]] in 1997, and re-released by [[Square Enix]] in 2006. As of 2008, no separate soundtrack has been released for ''Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions''. The soundtrack was well received by critics, who found it to be astounding and one of the best video game music soundtracks in existence at the time of its release. 

The music of ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' was again composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with assistance from  Nobuo Uematsu, Kaori Ohkoshi, and Ayako Saso. The ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack'', a compilation of almost all of the music in the game, was released by DigiCube in 2003.  A [[New age music|new age]] [[arrangement]] album entitled ''White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by [[SME Visual Works]] in 2003. ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack'' was well received by critics, who praised the album's composition.  Critics did not react as well to the ''White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' album, finding it to be a mediocre album with poor arrangements.

The music for ''Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift'' was also composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, this time with the assistance of composers from his company [[Basiscape]]. The music was released as ''Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift Original Soundtrack'' by Square Enix in 2007. It was enjoyed by reviewers, who found it to be pleasant and rewarding.

===''White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance''===

''White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' is an arranged album of music from ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance''. The album contains the musical tracks from the game, composed mainly by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with assistance from Nobuo Uematsu, Kaori Ohkoshi, and Ayako Saso, and arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi. It spans 11 tracks and covers a duration of 46:10. It was released on February 26, 2003, by SME Visual Works. The release bears the catalog number ''SVWC-7172''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFWHITE&quot;/&gt;

''White'' was not received well by critics, with Patrick Gann finding it to be a mediocre album and saying that he felt &quot;very disappointed&quot; with it. He found the &quot;new-age&quot; style to be poorly chosen and the arrangements to be sub-par.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFWHITE&quot;/&gt; Zeugma of Square Enix Music Online was more approving of the album, saying that it conveyed the &quot;quiet mood&quot; it promised, but finding it to sometimes be &quot;dangerously close to muzak&quot; with too many synthesized instruments and too little variation.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-6&quot;/&gt;
