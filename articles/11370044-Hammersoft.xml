'''Division One South''' is one of the two second-tier divisions of the '''[[Northern Premier League]]'''. It is at Step 4 (or level 8) of the [[National League System]], placing it seven divisions below the [[Premier League]]. For sponsorship reasons, it is also referred to as the '''Evo-Stik League Division One South'''.

The split of the [[Northern Premier League First Division]] resulted in the creation of the Division One South and the [[Northern Premier League Division One North|Division One North]]. The division began play at the start of the 2007â08 season, initially with 18 teams but increased to 22 teams from the 2009â10 season.

At the end of the season, the champion of the league is promoted to the Northern Premier Division.  The teams placed 2nd to 5th engaged in a playoff to determine which team is also promoted. The teams placed 21st and 22nd are relegated to level 9. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7201054.stm BBC Guide to the Non-League Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==League system==
The league operates a double Round Robin system, where each team plays each other team twice, once at home and once away. After 42 games, the team that are placed top of the league will automatically promote to the Northern Premier League Premier Division and the two teams at the bottom of the league relegate to one of the feeder leagues (Usually either the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties]], [[Northern Counties East Football League|Northern Counties East]], [[United Counties League]] or [[Midland Football Alliance|Midland Alliance]]). Teams placed 2nd to fifth will play off for the final promotion spot.

However, prior to the 2008â09 season, when the league originally split from its traditional one division into a North and South, the league operated with 18 teams, leading to splitting the league into two separate groups of 9 teams each. Each team would play each team in their own group three times (once at home, once away then an extra game where each team received an extra four home games) and play the teams in the other group home and away once each.

This changed back to the traditional format in 2008â09 when more teams entered the league.
