It is located on [[Devon Island]] at the eastern shore of the waterway also named Dundas Harbour. [[Baffin Bay]]'s [[Croker Bay]] is immediately to the west.

The following year, 52 [[Inuit]] were relocated from [[Cape Dorset]] to Dundas Harbour but they returned to the mainland 13 years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Alia|first=Valerie |title=Names and Nunavut: culture and identity in Arctic Canada |publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2007 |series=Berghahn Series|pages=52|isbn=1845451651|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r0CUU3ZKMpkC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Dundas+harbour%22+nunavut&amp;ei=uCu8So2eGpzElATz-tD0Dg&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dundas%20harbour%22%20nunavut&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
