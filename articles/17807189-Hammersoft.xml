'''ABC Riverina''' is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station based in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]] and broadcasting to the [[Riverina]] and [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]] regions in [[New South Wales]].  This includes the towns and cities of [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]] and [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]].

The station began as '''2CO''' in 1931 originally based in [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] and covering south-west New South Wales and north-east [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  The station in Wagga Wagga operated only as an opt-out service until 1987. New studios and transmitters were opened and the region was split into two. '''ABC Riverina''' was created, serving New South Wales, with the Albury based station moving to [[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]] and becoming [[ABC Goulburn Murray]].

The transmitter originally installed at 2CO was a [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] 6.5/7 kW model manufactured in Sydney from imported components.  The final output stage had a pair of water-cooled 4220-B [[triode]]s.  These needed a 12,000 volt supply.  This was driven by a pair of type 4015-A triode valves cooled by air.  The power supply for this was only 5,000 volts.  The power supply was [[three phase]] using three 4222-A [[vacuum diode]]s also water-cooled.  The water cooling was at a rate of 37 litres per minute and had a 450 litre tank and heat exchanger outside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Radio the Technical Story 1923-83|author=Winston T.
