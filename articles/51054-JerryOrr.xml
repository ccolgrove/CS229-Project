The '''American black bear''' (''Ursus americanus'') is a medium-sized [[bear]] native to [[North America]]. It is the continent's smallest and most common bear species. Black bears are [[omnivore]]s, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food.  Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The American black bear is listed by the [[IUCN]] as [[Least Concern]], due to the species' widespread distribution and a large global population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. American black bears often mark trees using their claws to show dominance in an area. Dominance is determined by the highest claw mark found on the tree. This behavior is common to many species of bears found in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN2008|assessors=Garshelis, D.L., Crider, D. &amp; van Manen, F.|year=2008|id=41687|title=Ursus americanus|downloaded=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Although they all live in North America, American black bears are not closely related to [[brown bear]]s and [[polar bear]]s; genetic studies reveal that they split from a common ancestor 5.05 [[Mya (unit)|mya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;krause&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krause | first = J. | authorlink =  | coauthors = Unger, T.; NoÃ§on, A.; Malaspinas, A.; Kolokotronis, S.; Stiller, M.; Soibelzon, L.; Spriggs, H.; Dear, P.

A small primitive bear called ''Ursus abstrusus'' is the oldest known North American [[fossil]] member of the genus ''Ursus'', dated to 4.95 mya.&lt;ref&gt;M.O.

The American black bear lived during the same period as short-faced bears (''[[Arctodus simus]]'' and ''A. pristinus'') and the Florida spectacled bear (''Tremarctos floridanus''). These Tremarctine bears evolved from bears that had emigrated from Asia to North America 7&amp;ndash;8 ma.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu, Z. 2003. Dispersals of Neogene Carnivorans between Asia and North America. Pages 18-31 in Bulletin American Museum of Natural History.&lt;/ref&gt; The short-faced bears are thought to have been heavily carnivorous and the FL spectacled bear more herbivorous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1666/09-113.1 | last1 = Schubert | first1 = B.

The black bear's generalist behavior allowed it to exploit a wider variety of foods and has been given as a reason why of these 3 genera, it alone survived climate and vegetative changes through and last [[ice age]] while the other more specialized North American predators went extinct. However, both ''Arctodus'' and ''Tremarctos'' had survived several other [[ice age]]s. After these prehistoric Ursids went extinct during the last glacial period 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, black bears were probably the only bear present in much of North America until the arrival of Brown bears to the rest of the continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

===Hybrids===
American black bears are reproductively compatible with several other bear species, and have occasionally produced [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring. According to Jack Hanna's ''Monkeys on the Interstate'', a bear captured in [[Sanford, Florida]], was thought to have been the offspring of an escaped female Asian black bear and an American black bear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/hybrid-bears.htm Hybrid Bears]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, a black bear and a [[Eurasian brown bear]] were bred together in the [[London Zoological Gardens]], but the three [[cub (disambiguation)|cubs]] did not reach maturity. In ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' [[Charles Darwin]] noted: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the nine-year Report it is stated that the bears had been seen in the Zoological Gardens to couple freely, but previously to 1848 most had rarely conceived. In the Reports published since this date three species have produced young (hybrids in one case),...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles |author-link=Charles Darwin | year=1868 | title=The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication.

A huge black bear was shot in Autumn 1986 in [[Michigan]], which was thought by some to be a black bear/[[grizzly bear]] hybrid, due to its unusually large size and its proportionately larger braincase and skull. DNA testing was unable to determine whether it was a black bear or grizzly.&lt;ref name=&quot;hybrid&quot;&gt;''Hybrid Black Bear'' from ''Black Bear Hunting'' by Richard P.

The skulls of American black bears are broad, with narrow muzzles and large jaw hinges. Females tend to have more slender and pointed faces than males. Their claws are typically black or grayish brown. The claws are short and rounded, being thick at the base and tapering to a point. Claws from both hind and front legs are almost identical in length, though the foreclaws tend to be more sharply curved. The hind legs are longer than those of Asiatic black bears. The tail is usually 4.8&amp;nbsp;inches (12&amp;nbsp;cm) long. The ears are small and rounded, and are set well back on the head. The soles of the feet are black or brownish, and are naked, leathery and deeply wrinkled. Black bears are highly dexterous, being capable of opening screw-top jars and manipulating door latches. They also have great physical strength, having been known to turn over flat-shaped rocks weighing {{convert|310|to|325|lb|kg}} by flipping them over with a single foreleg.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown2&quot;&gt;''Bear Anatomy and Physiology'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons &amp; Burford, Publishers, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; They move in a  rhythmic,  surefooted way and can run at speeds of 25&amp;ndash;30 mph (40&amp;ndash;50&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;brown3&quot;/&gt; Black bears have good eyesight, and have been proven experimentally to be able to learn visual discrimination tasks based on color faster than chimpanzees and as fast as dogs. They are also capable of rapidly learning to distinguish different shapes, such as small triangles, circles and squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_3/Bacon_Burghardt_B_Vol_3.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Learning and Color Discrimination in the American Black Bear'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual coat colors can range from white, blond, cinnamon, or light brown to dark chocolate brown or to jet black, with many intermediate variations existing. Bluish tinged black bears occur along a portion of coastal Alaska and British Columbia. White to cream colored black bears occur in coastal islands and the adjacent mainland of south-western British Columbia. Albino specimens have also been recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrero&quot;&gt;''Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance'' by Stephen Herrero, published by Winchester Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Black coats tend to predominate in moist areas such as New England, New York, Tennessee, Michigan and western Washington. 70% of all black bears are black, though only 50% of black bears in the Rocky Mountains are black.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown2&quot;/&gt;

==Behavior==
In his ''Great Bear Almanac'', Gary Brown lists 20 different sounds in eight different contexts. Sounds expressing aggression include growls, woofs, snorts, bellows and roars. Sounds expressing contentment include mumbles, squeaks and pants. American black bears tend to be territorial and non-gregarious in nature. They mark their territories by rubbing their bodies against trees and clawing at the bark. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed. Black bears climb regularly to feed, escape enemies or to hibernate. Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown3&quot;&gt;''Behaviour and Activities'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons &amp; Burford, Publishers, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Adult black bears are mostly nocturnal, but juveniles are often active in daytime.

===Reproduction and development===

Sows usually produce their first litter at the age of 3&amp;ndash;5&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown3&quot;/&gt; Sows living in urban areas tend to get pregnant at younger ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;life&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080930135301.htm |title='&amp;#39;Urban Black Bears &quot;Live Fast, Die Young&quot;'&amp;#39;, ScienceDaily (Oct. 1, 2008) |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breeding period usually occurs in the JuneâJuly period, though it can extend to August in the species' northern range. The breeding period lasts for 2&amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;weeks. Sows tend to be short tempered with their mates after copulating. The gestation period lasts 235&amp;nbsp;days, and litters are usually born in late January to early February. Litters usually consist of two cubs, though litters of 6 have been recorded. At birth, cubs weigh {{convert|10|-|16|oz}}, and measure 8&amp;nbsp;inches in length. They are born with fine, gray, downlike hair, and their hind quarters are underdeveloped. They typically open their eyes after 28&amp;ndash;40&amp;nbsp;days, and begin walking after 5&amp;nbsp;weeks. Cubs are dependent on their mother's milk for 30&amp;nbsp;weeks, and will reach independence at 16&amp;ndash;18&amp;nbsp;months. At the age of six weeks, they attain 2&amp;nbsp;lb, by 8&amp;nbsp;weeks they reach 5&amp;nbsp;lb and by the age of 6&amp;nbsp;months they weigh 40&amp;ndash;60&amp;nbsp;lb. They reach sexual maturity at the age of three years, and attain their full growth at 5&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown3&quot;/&gt;

The average lifespan in the wild is 18&amp;nbsp;years. The record age of a wild specimen was 31&amp;nbsp;years, while that in captivity was 44&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown2&quot;/&gt;

===Hibernation===
[[File:Bear hibernating.jpg|right|thumb|Mother black bear and cubs, hibernating]]
Black bears were once not considered true or &quot;deep&quot; hibernators, but because of discoveries about the metabolic changes that allow black bears to remain dormant for months without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating, most biologists have redefined mammalian hibernation as &quot;specialized, seasonal reduction in metabolism concurrent with scarce food and cold weather&quot;. Black bears are now considered highly efficient hibernators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/black-bear-facts/hibernation.html |title=Hibernation |publisher=Bear.org |date=2004-07-19 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/denning.htm |title=Yellowstone National Park - Denning and Hibernation Behavior (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Black bears enter their dens in October and November. Prior to that time, they can put on up to 30&amp;nbsp;pounds of body fat to get them through the seven months during which they fast. Hibernation in black bears typically lasts 3â5&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name=&quot;charlotte&quot;/&gt; During this time, their heart rate drops from 40â50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute. They spend their time in hollowed-out dens in tree cavities, under logs or rocks, in banks, caves, or culverts, and in shallow depressions. Females, however, have been shown to be pickier in their choice of dens, in comparison to males.&lt;ref name=&quot;goals1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entomology.cornell.edu/public/IthacaCampus/ExtOutreach/Outreach/Resources/pageBodySections/05/pageBodySections/00/text_files/file7/Golas_TeacherResourceGuide.pdf|title=American Black Bear Teaching Guide|last=Goals|first=Ben|publisher=Cornell|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special hormone, [[leptin]] is released into their systems, to suppress appetite. Because they do not urinate or defecate during dormancy, the nitrogen waste from the bear's body is biochemically recycled back into their proteins. This also serves the purpose of preventing muscle loss, as the process uses the waste products to build muscle during the long periods of inactivity. In comparison to true hibernators, their body temperature does not drop significantly (staying around 35&amp;nbsp;degrees Celsius) and they remain somewhat alert and active. If the winter is mild enough, they may wake up and forage for food. Females also give birth in February and nurture their cubs until the snow melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culter.colorado.edu:1030/~kittel/WEcol_Projects06/BearsHiberntn_BBennett.ppt|title=Hibernation of the Black and Brown Bear|last=Bennett|first=Bobby|date=Spring 2006|accessdate=22 November 2009|location=Mountain Research Station}}&lt;/ref&gt; During winter, black bears consume 25&amp;ndash;40% of their body weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;jim&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/dewa/naturescience/upload/cmsstgBEAR.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cmsstgBEAR.html |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The footpads peel off while they sleep, making room for new tissue. After emerging from their winter dens in spring, they wander their territories for two weeks so that their metabolism accustoms itself to the activity. They will seek carrion from winter-killed animals and new shoots of many plant species, especially wetland plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;jim&quot;/&gt; In mountainous areas, they seek southerly slopes at lower elevations for forage and move to northerly and easterly slopes at higher elevations as summer progresses. Black bears use dense cover for hiding and thermal protection, as well as for bedding.

===Dietary habits===
[[File:Black Bear Lake Louise.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Black bear feeding on a bush]]
[[File:Black Bear .........2.jpg|thumb|Black bear taking a dead [[Salmon]] near [[Hyder, Alaska]]]]
Up to 85% of the black bear's diet consists of vegetation,&lt;ref name=&quot;brown3&quot;/&gt; though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrero&quot;/&gt; Young shoots from trees and shrubs during the spring period are important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. Berries, fruits, grasses, nuts and buds are often eaten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1999/2/fact-americanblack.cfm American Black Bear Fact Sheet - National Zoo| FONZ]. Nationalzoo.si.edu. Retrieved on 2011-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, they may also raid the nut caches of [[squirrel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;jim&quot;/&gt; Black bears are fond of [[honey]], and will gnaw through trees if hives are too deeply set into the trunks for them to reach them with their paws. Once the hive is breached, black bears will scrape the honeycombs together with their paws and eat them, regardless of stings from the bees.&lt;ref name=&quot;wood&quot;/&gt;

The majority of the black bear's animal diet consists of insects such as bees, yellow-jackets, ants and their larvae.&lt;ref name=&quot;jim&quot;/&gt; Black bears will fish for salmon during the night, as their black fur is easily spotted by salmon in the daytime. However, the white furred black bears of the islands of western Canada have a 30% greater success rate in catching salmon than their black furred counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;invis&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bourton |first=Jody |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8344000/8344367.stm |title=Spirit bears become 'invisible' by Jody Bourton, Earth News reporter |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also prey on [[mule deer|mule]] and [[white-tailed deer]] fawns in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R. 1983.

The skin of large prey is stripped back and turned inside out with the skeleton usually left largely intact. Unlike wolves and coyotes, black bears rarely scatter the remains of their kills. Vegetation around the carcass is usually matted down by black bears and their droppings are frequently found nearby. Black bears may attempt to cover remains of larger carcasses, though they do not do so with the same frequency as [[cougar]]s and [[grizzly bear]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Predation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/ranchref/predator/bears/t-bears.htm |title=Bear Predation&amp;nbsp;â Description |publisher=Texnat.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-11-24}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may climb up to [[bald eagle]] nests to eat the eggs or chicks.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown3&quot;/&gt;  Black bears have been reported stealing deer and other animals from human hunters.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
Black bears tend to escape competition from brown bears by being more active in the daytime, and living in more densely forested areas. Violent interactions resulting in the deaths of black bears have been recorded in Yellowstone National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greateryellowstonescience.org/files/pdf/ys5-gunther.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Evidence of grizzly bear predation on a black bear in Hayden Valley'&amp;#39; by Kerry A. Gunther and Mark J. Biel |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/upload/predation.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Probable Grizzly Bear Predation On An American Black Bear In Yellowstone National Park'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black bears may compete with [[cougar]]s over carcasses. Like brown bears, they will sometimes steal kills from cougars. One study found that both bear species visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Parks]], usurping 10% of carcasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=COSEWIC. Canadian Wildlife Service |title=Assessment and Update Status Report on the Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos) |publisher=[[Environment Canada]] |year=2002 |url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CW69-14-166-2002E.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights between the two species are rare, though they can be violent. Cremony, in his ''Life among the Apaches'', describes an incident in which a cougar killed a black bear.&lt;ref&gt;Cremony, Life Among the Apaches, 1951, 225-26, a reprint of the 1868 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Black bear interactions with [[gray wolf|wolves]] are much rarer than with brown bears, due to differences in habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Despite the black bear being more powerful on a one to one basis, packs of wolves have been recorded to kill black bears on numerous occasions without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOLVES&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author= L. David Mech &amp; Luigi Boitani | url = | title=Wolves: Behaviour, Ecology and Conservation | year=2001 | page= 448 | isbn= 0-226-51696-2 | publisher= University of Chicago Press | location= Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf packs are known to kill black bears during their hibernation cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;scorzafava&quot;/&gt;

There is at least one record of a black bear killing a [[wolverine]] in a dispute over food in Yellowstone National Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoearth.info/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=22714&amp;keybold=predator%20AND%20%20coyote |title='&amp;#39;In Yellowstone, It's a Carnivore Competition'&amp;#39;, Washington Post, May 19, 2003 |publisher=Ecoearth.info |date=2003-05-19 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current range and population==
[[File:Grand Tetons black bear.jpg|thumb|right|Black bear at [[Grand Teton National Park]]]]
Historically, black bears occupied the majority of North America's forested regions. Today, they are primarily limited to sparsely settled, forested areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildlife1.wildlifeinformation.org/000ADOBES/Bears/Bears_IUCN_ActionPlan/bearsAP_chapter8.pdf |title=bearcov |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black bears currently inhabit much of their original Canadian range, though they do not occur in the southern farmlands of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. They have been extinct in Prince Edward Island since 1937. The total Canadian black bear population is between 396,000 and 476,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wwf.ca/newsroom/?1058| title=Canadian Population| publisher=World Wildlife Fund| accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on surveys taken in the mid 1990s in seven Canadian provinces, though this estimate excludes black bear populations in New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan. All provinces indicated stable populations of black bears over the last decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

The current range of black bears in the United States is constant throughout most of the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] (down to Virginia and West Virginia), the northern [[Midwestern United States|midwest]], the [[Mountain States|Rocky mountain region]], the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] and [[Alaska]]. However it becomes increasingly fragmented or absent in other regions. Despite this, black bears in those areas seems to have expanded their range during the last decade. Surveys taken from 35 states in the early 1990s indicate that black bears are either stable or increasing, excepting Idaho and New Mexico. The overall population of black bears in the United States has been estimated to range between 339,000 and 465,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;us&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wwf.ca/newsroom/?1058| title=United States Population| publisher=World Wildlife Fund| accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this excludes populations from Alaska, Idaho, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, whose population sizes are unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

As of 1993, known Mexican black bear populations existed in four areas, though knowledge on the distributions of populations outside those areas have not been updated since 1959. Mexico is the only country where the black bear is classed as endangered.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

==Relationships with humans==
===In folklore, mythology and culture===
[[Image:Harry Colebourne and Winnie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Harry Colebourn]] and [[Winnipeg bear|Winnie]], the bear from which [[Winnie the Pooh]] derives his name]]
Black bears feature prominently in the stories of some of America's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]]s. One tale tells of how the black bear was a creation of the [[Great Spirit]], while the grizzly was created by the Evil Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Folklore and Legends of the North American Indian'' compiled by Joshua B Lippincott, published by Abela Publishing Ltd, 2009, ISBN 0-9560584-6-9&lt;/ref&gt; In the mythology of the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Tsimshian]] people of the Northwest Coast, mankind first learned to respect bears when a girl married the son of black bear Chieftain.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Native American mythology'' by Dawn Elaine Bastian and Judy K. Mitchell, published by ABC-CLIO, 2004, ISBN 1-85109-533-0&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kwakiutl]] mythology, black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy. Black Bear Woman's children, in turn, killed Grizzly Bear Woman's own cubs.&lt;ref&gt;''Kwakiutl String Figures'' [[Julia Averkieva|Julia P. Averkieva]] and [[Mark Sherman|Mark A.

===Attacks on humans===
{{see also|Bear attack|Bear danger}}
Unlike [[grizzly bears]], which became a subject of fearsome legend among the European settlers of North America, black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous, even though they lived in areas where the pioneers had settled. Black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans, and usually limit themselves to making mock charges, emitting blowing noises and swatting the ground with their forepaws. However, according to Stephen Herrero in his ''Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance'', 23 people were killed by black bears from 1900 to 1980. The number of black bear attacks on humans is higher than those of the [[brown bear]], though this is largely because the black species outnumbers the brown rather than them being more aggressive. [[File:Bearmailbox.JPG|thumb|left|The incidence of bear attacks in parks and campgrounds declined after the introduction of bear-resistant garbage cans and other reforms]]Compared to brown bear attacks, violent encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury. However, the majority of black bear attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality, and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting. Unlike grizzlies, female black bears do not display the same level of protectiveness to their cubs, and seldom attack humans in their vicinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrero&quot;/&gt; The worst recorded fatality incident occurred in May 1978, in which a black bear killed three teenagers who were fishing in Algonquin Park in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;kruuk&quot;/&gt; The majority of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had become [[habituation|habituated]] to human contact and food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrero&quot;/&gt; 1,028 incidences of black bears acting aggressively toward people, 107 of which resulted in injury, were recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], and occurred mainly in tourist hotspots where people regularly fed the bears handouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;kruuk&quot;&gt;''Hunter and hunted: relationships between carnivores and people'' by Hans Kruuk, published by Cambridge University Press, 2002, ISBN 0-521-89109-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livestock and crop predation===
Livestock depredations by black bears occur mostly in spring. A limitation of food sources in early spring and wild berry and nut crop failures during summer months are probably major contributing factors. Black bears can do extensive damage in some areas of the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the [[Vascular cambium|cambium]]. Though black bears will attack adult cattle and horses, they seem to prefer sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. They normally kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of prey with blows from the paws. Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is frequently found on the neck, back, and shoulders of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats are common. Bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; whether or not this is intentional is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Predation&quot; /&gt;

===Hunting and exploitation===
====Hunting====

Historically, black bears were hunted by both Native Americans and European settlers. Some Native American tribes, in admiration for the black bear's intelligence, would decorate the heads of bears they killed with trinkets, and place them on blankets. Tobacco smoke would be wafted into the disembodied head's nostrils by the hunter that dealt the killing blow, and would compliment the animal for its courage.&lt;ref name=&quot;wood&quot;/&gt; The [[Kutchin]] typically hunted black bears during their hibernation cycle. Unlike the hunting of hibernating grizzlies, which was wrought with danger, black bears took longer to awaken, and was thus safer and easier.&lt;ref name=&quot;kutch&quot;/&gt; During the European colonisation of eastern North America, thousands of black bears were hunted for their meat, fat and fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;world&quot;/&gt; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] wrote extensively on black bear hunting in his ''Hunting the Grisly and other sketches'', in which he stated &quot;''in [a black bear] chase there is much excitement, and occasionally a slight spice of danger, just enough to render it attractive; so it has always been eagerly followed''&quot;. He wrote that black bears were difficult to hunt by stalking, due to their habitat preferences, though were easy to trap. Roosevelt described how in the Southern States, planters regularly hunted black bears on horseback with hounds. [[Wade Hampton III|General Wade Hampton]] was known to have been present at 500 successful black bear hunts, two thirds of which he killed personally. He killed thirty or forty black bears with only a knife, which he would use to stab the bears between the shoulder blades while they were distracted by his hounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEDDY&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fullbooks.com/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches1.html| title = ''Hunting the Grisly and Other Sketches'' | work = [[Theodore Roosevelt]]| publisher =  | accessdate = 2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless well trained, horses were often useless in black bear hunts, as they often bolted when the bears stood their ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;wood&quot;/&gt; In 1799, 192,000 black bear skins were exported from Quebec. In 1822, 3,000 skins were exported from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].&lt;ref&gt;''Volume 1 of The British CyclopÃ¦dia of Natural History: Combining a Scientific Classification of Animals, Plants, and Minerals, Charles Frederick Partington'' by Charles Frederick Partington,published by Orr &amp; Smith, 1835&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, untanned, fleshed and salted black bear hides were sold for an average of $165.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown4&quot;&gt;''Use of Bears and Bear Parts'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons &amp; Burford, Publishers, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, black bears are considered as both a big game and furbearer species in all provinces save for New Brunswick and Northwest Territories, where they are only classed as a big game species. There are currently 80,822 licensed black bear hunters in all of Canada. Canadian black bear hunts take place in autumn and winter, and both male and female bears can be legally taken, though some provinces prohibit the hunting of females with cubs, or yearling specimens.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

Currently, 28 of the USA's states have black bear hunting seasons. Nineteen states require a bear hunting license, with some also requiring a big game license. In eight states, only a big game license is required to hunt black bears. Overall over 481,500 black bear hunting licences are sold per year. The hunting methods and seasons vary greatly according to state, with some bear hunting seasons including fall only, spring and fall, or year-round. New Jersey, in November 2010, approved of a six-day bear-hunting season in early December 2010 to slow the growth of the black bear population. Bear-hunting had been banned in New Jersey for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Sciarrino/The Star-Ledger |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/nj_environmental_comissioner_g.html |title=Black bear hunt gets final approval from Department of Environmental Protection head |publisher=NJ.com |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] PublicMind poll found that 53% of New Jersey voters approved of the new season if scientists concluded black bears were leaving their usual habitats and destroying private property.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/1011bears/ |title=Bear Necessity? Public Approves of Bear Hunt |publisher=Publicmind.fdu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, older voters, and those living in rural areas were more likely to approve of a bear-hunting season in New Jersey than women, younger voters, and those living in more developed parts of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; In the western states, where there are large black populations, there are spring and year-round seasons. Approximately 18,845 black bears were harvested annually in the USA between 1988â1992. Within this period, annual harvests ranged from six bears in South Carolina to 2,232 in Maine.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

According to Dwight Schuh in his ''Bowhunter's Encyclopedia'', black bears are the third most popular quarry of bowhunters, behind deer and elk.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowhunter's Encyclopedia'' by Dwight R. Schuh, published by Stackpole Books, 1992, ISBN 0-8117-2412-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Black bear meat had historically been held in high esteem among North America's indigenous people and colonists.&lt;ref name=&quot;wood&quot;/&gt; Black bears were the only bear species the Kutchin hunted for their meat, though this constituted only a small part of their diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;kutch&quot;&gt;''Hunters of the northern forest: designs for survival among the Alaskan Kutchin'' by Richard K. Nelson, published by University of Chicago Press, 1986, ISBN 0-226-57181-5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the second volume of ''Frank Forester's field sports of the United States, and British provinces, of North America'':

{{bquote|The flesh of the [black] bear is savoury, but rather luscious, and tastes not unlike pork. It was once so common an article of food in New-York as to have given the name of ''Bear Market'' to one of the principal markets of the city.|x|x|''Frank Forester's field sports of the United States, and British provinces, of North America'' p. 186}}

Theodore Roosevelt himself likened the flesh of young black bears to that of pork, and not as coarse or flavourless as the meat of grizzlies.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting Trips of a Ranchman: Hunting Trips on the Prairie and in the Mountains'' by Theodore Roosevelt, published by Adamant Media Corporation, ISBN 1-4212-6647-4&lt;/ref&gt; The most favoured cuts of the black bear's meat are concentrated in the legs and loins. Meat from the neck, front legs and shoulders is usually ground into [[mincemeat]] or used for [[stew]]s and [[casserole]]s. Keeping the fat tends to give the meat a strong flavour. As black bears can have [[trichinellosis]], cooking temperatures need to be high in order to kill the parasites.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunt&quot;&gt;''Black Bear Hunting'' by Richard P. Smith, published by Stackpole Books, 2007 ISBN 0-8117-0269-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Black bear fat was once valued as a cosmetic article which promoted hair growth and gloss. The fat most favoured for this purpose was the hard white fat found in the body's interior. As only a small portion of this fat could be harvested for this purpose, the oil was often mixed with large quantities of hog lard.&lt;ref name=&quot;wood&quot;/&gt; However [[animal rights]] activism over the last decade has slowed the harvest of these animals; therefore the lard from black bear has not been used in recent years for the purpose of cosmetics.
