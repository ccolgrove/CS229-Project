'''Michael O'Hare''' (born May 6, 1952) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], best known for playing [[Jeffrey Sinclair]] in the [[science fiction]] [[television]] series ''[[Babylon 5]]''.

==Biography==
Michael O'Hare was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He attended [[Harvard University]] (where he majored in English literature) and studied at the prestigious [[Juilliard School]] of Drama, as well as with [[Sanford Meisner]].

==Career==
Michael O'Hare appeared in a number of theatrical productions in the [[New York City|New York]] area, including the role of Col. Jessup in the original stage version of ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'' (the role played by [[Jack Nicholson]] in the film version).

He was the first [[White people|white]] actor nominated by the [[African-American|black]] theater community of New York for the [[AUDELCO|AUDELCO Award]] for the Best Actor for his performance in the play &quot;Shades of Brown&quot; which examined the effects of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641365/bio IMDB bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he was cast in the lead role of Commander [[Jeffrey Sinclair]] in the science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]''. O'Hare remained with the series for one full season; both he and series producer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] said the decision for the character to depart was mutual and amicable.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote       = As a result of these discussions, it has been agreed that we will have a separation, in the role of the commander. Let me emphasize this very clearly, so there is no chance of miscommunication: this is a mutual, amicable, and friendly separation. This isn't a [[Denise Crosby#Star Trek|Tasha Yar]] situation. Moreover, we will be handling this in such a way that, down the road, Sinclair could potentially return to the story. The character of Sinclair will achieve an important destiny, and the mystery of the Battle of the Line will be explained, both in the first episode of the new season. His story will still track. And the series will still track precisely as planned. I take pains to mention this because both Michael and I want it clear that we both believe in the show, and want this in no way to interfere with the series. He has asked me to convey for him his encouragement, his best wishes, and to emphasize that this is, again, an amicable and friendly separation.
