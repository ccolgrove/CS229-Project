<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="3884978" ns="0" title="PGPDisk"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''PGP Virtual Disk''' is an [[on-the-fly encryption]] (OTFE) system that allows one to create a virtual [[encrypted disk]] within a file.

Older versions for Windows NT were freeware (for example, bundled with [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] v6.0.2i; and with some of the CKT builds of PGP). These are still available for download, but no longer maintained. Today, PGP Virtual Disk is available as part of the [[PGP Desktop]] product family, running on [[Windows 2000]]/[[WindowsXP|XP]]/[[Windows Vista|Vista]], and [[Mac OS X]].
