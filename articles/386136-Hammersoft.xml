The '''Little Caesars Pizza Bowl''' (known as the '''Motor City Bowl''' until 2009) is a post-season [[college football]] [[bowl game]] certified by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] that has been played annually since 1997. The first five games (1997&amp;ndash;2001) were played at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. Starting in 2002, the game was moved to 65,000-seat [[Ford Field]] in downtown [[Detroit, Michigan]].  Ford Field is home to the NFL's Detroit Lions, and played host to Super Bowl XL. 

The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl features a bowl-eligible team from the [[Mid-American Conference]] (usually the winner of the [[MAC Championship Game]], although that team is not required to accept the bid; prior to the formation of the bowl the MAC champion earned an automatic bid to the [[Maaco Bowl Las Vegas|Las Vegas Bowl]]) playing a bowl-eligible team from the [[Big Ten Conference]]. If the Big Ten does not have an eligible team, the game will feature a team from the [[Sun Belt Conference|Sun Belt]] that meets the NCAA requirement of at least six wins. In the event that the Sun Belt does not have an available team, an at-large team can be chosen. 

The game was jointly sponsored by the &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers in Detroit from 1998 to 2007 ([[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]]). Starting with the 2008 game, Chrysler was replaced by the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights as a presenting sponsor.  In 2009, [[Little Caesars]] became the title sponsor of the game after General Motors and Chrysler reorganized under bankruptcy protection.  Ford remained as a sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/20688451/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The then-named-Motor City Bowl marked the first bowl game held in the Detroit area since the [[Cherry Bowl]] in 1984&amp;ndash;85.  It is the only Division I college bowl game played in the Midwest United States.

The [[2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]], played December 26, 2009, matched the [[2009 Ohio Bobcats football team|Ohio Bobcats]] of the Mid-American Conference against the [[2009 Marshall Thundering Herd football team|Marshall Thundering Herd]] of Conference USA.  

A bowl record crowd of 60,624 fans witnessed the [[2007 Motor City Bowl|2007 bowl game]] between the [[2007 Purdue Boilermakers football team|Purdue Boilermakers]] and the [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan Chippewas]].

On April 12, 2010, it was announced that the Big Ten Conference has extended its affiliation with the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl (Big Ten No.8) through the 2013 season. Also the Sun Belt Conference and the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl have agreed to a secondary tie-in that will allow a Sun Belt Conference team to play in the Detroit based game should the Big Ten Conference not have an available bowl-eligible team to play. 

The [[2010 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]] game, the Big Ten did not have enough teams to fill the slot and the MAC champion [[Miami Redhawks football|Miami-Ohio]] chose to play in the [[GoDaddy.com Bowl]]; the bowl chose the MAC's third place team, [[Toledo Rockets football|Toledo]], and the Sun Belt's conference champion [[FIU Golden Panthers football|Florida International]]; Florida International won giving the university its first ever bowl win.

[[ESPN]] has televised the game since its inception.

The 2011 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl will be Tuesday, December 27, 2011 at 4:30 p.m. (ESPN).

On December 2, 2011, it was announced that the Western Michigan Broncos of the MAC and the Purdue Boilermakers of the Big Ten will play in the 2011 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl.

Western Michigan Broncos (7-5, 5-3 MAC) will make its first appearance in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl.

Purdue Boilermakers (6-6, 4-4 Big Ten) will be making their 2nd trip to the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl.
The last time Purdue played in a bowl game, it defeated Central Michigan 51-48 in the 2007 Motor City Bowl at Ford Field before a record crowd of 60,624.
