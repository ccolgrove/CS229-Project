'''Goatse Security''' ('''GoatSec''') is a loose-knit, nine-person&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost&quot; /&gt; [[grey hat]] [[hacker group]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Leyden&quot;/&gt; that specializes in uncovering security flaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;onlinewsj1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;npr1&quot;/&gt; It is a division of the anti-blogging [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolling]] organization known as the [[Gay Nigger Association of America]] (GNAA).&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytech2&quot;/&gt; The group derives its name from the [[Goatse.cx]] [[shock site]],&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic1&quot;/&gt; and it chose &quot;Gaping Holes Exposed&quot; as its [[slogan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thetechherald1&quot;/&gt; In June 2010, Goatse Security obtained the [[Email addresses]] of approximately 114,000 Apple iPad users. This led to an [[FBI]] investigation and the filing of criminal charges against two of the group's members.

==Founding==
The GNAA had several security researchers within its membership. According to Goatse Security spokesperson Leon Kaiser, the GNAA could not fully utilize their talents since the group believed that there would not be anyone who would take security data published by the GNAA seriously. In order to create a medium through which GNAA members can publish their security findings, the GNAA created Goatse Security in December 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytech2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;onlinewsj1&quot;/&gt;

==Browser vulnerabilities==
In order to protect its web browser from [[inter-protocol exploitation]], [[Mozilla]] blocked several [[Port number|ports]] that [[HTML forms]] would not normally have access to. In January 2010, the GNAA discovered that Mozilla's blocks did not cover [[6667|port 6667]], which left Mozilla browsers vulnerable to cross-protocol scripts. The GNAA crafted a [[JavaScript]]-based [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] in order to [[Internet Relay Chat flood|flood]] [[IRC]] channels. Although [[EFnet]] and [[OFTC]] were able to block the attacks, [[Freenode]] struggled to counteract the attacks. Goatse Security exposed the vulnerability, and one of its members, Andrew Auernheimer, aka &quot;[[weev]],&quot; posted information about the exploit on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;softpedia1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theregister1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theregister2&quot;/&gt;

In March 2010, Goatse Security discovered an [[integer overflow]] vulnerability within the [[Safari (web browser)|Apple Safari]] and posted an exploit on Encyclopedia Dramatica.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld2&quot;/&gt; They found out that a person could access a blocked port by adding 65,536 to the port number.&lt;ref name=&quot;thetechherald2-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nvd1&quot;/&gt; This vulnerability was also found in [[Arora (browser)|Arora]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nvd2&quot;/&gt; [[iCab]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nvd3&quot;/&gt; [[OmniWeb]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nvd4&quot;/&gt; and Stainless.&lt;ref name=&quot;nvd5&quot;/&gt; Although Apple fixed the glitch for desktop versions of Safari in March, the company left the glitch unfixed in mobile versions of the browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnmoney1&quot;/&gt; Goatse Security claimed that a hacker could exploit the mobile Safari flaw in order to gain access and cause harm to the Apple [[iPad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnmoney1&quot;/&gt;

==AT&amp;T/iPad e-mail address leak==
In June 2010, Goatse Security uncovered a vulnerability within the [[AT&amp;T]] website.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;valleywag2&quot;/&gt; AT&amp;T was the only provider of [[3G]] service for Apple's iPad in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;onlinewsj2&quot;/&gt; When signing up for AT&amp;T's 3G service from an iPad, AT&amp;T retrieves the [[ICC-ID]] from the iPad's [[SIM card]] and associates it with the Email address provided during sign-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gizmodo1&quot;/&gt; In order to ease the log-in process from the iPad, the AT&amp;T website receives the SIM card's ICC-ID and pre-populates the Email address field with the address provided during sign-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gizmodo1&quot;/&gt; Goatse Security realized that by sending a [[HTTP request]] with a valid ICC-ID embedded inside it to the AT&amp;T website, the website would reveal the Email address associated with that ICC-ID.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gizmodo1&quot;/&gt;

On June 5, 2010, Daniel Spitler, aka &quot;JacksonBrown&quot;, began discussing this vulnerability and possible ways to exploit it, including [[phishing]], on an IRC channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;complaint1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomberg1&quot;/&gt; Goatse Security constructed a [[PHP]]-based [[Brute force attack|brute force]] script that would send HTTP requests with random ICC-IDs to the AT&amp;T website until a legitimate ICC-ID is entered, which would return the Email address corresponding to the ICC-ID.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gizmodo1&quot;/&gt; This script was dubbed the &quot;iPad 3G Account Slurper.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomberg1&quot;/&gt;

Goatse Security then attempted to find an appropriate news source to confine the leaked information with. weev attempted to contact [[News Corporation]] and [[Thomson Reuters]] executives, including [[Arthur Siskind]], about AT&amp;T's security problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld1&quot;/&gt; On June 6, 2010, weev sent Emails with some of the ICC-IDs recovered in order to verify his claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;complaint1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld1&quot;/&gt; Chat logs from this period also reveal that attention and publicity may have been incentives for the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica1&quot;/&gt;

The tactics used by members of Goatse Security caused a significant debate regarding the proper disclosure of IT security flaws.&lt;ref name=wsj14&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer Experts Face Backlash |first=Ben |last=Worthen |author2=Spencer E. Ante |newspaper=WSJ.com |date=June 14, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703885104575303032919382858.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech }}&lt;/ref&gt; weev has maintained that Goatse Security used common industry standard practices and has said that, &quot;We tried to be the good guys&quot;.&lt;ref name=wsj14/&gt;&lt;ref name=tr&gt;{{cite news|last=Leydon|first=John|title=AT&amp;T iPad 'hacker' breaks gag order to rant at cops|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/07/ipad_hack_follow_up/|accessdate=16 February 2011|newspaper=The Register|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Granick]] of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has also defended the tactics used by Goatse Security.&lt;ref name=wsj14/&gt;

On June 14, 2010 [[Michael Arrington]] of [[TechCrunch]] awarded the group a Crunchie award for public service. This was the first time a Crunchie was awarded outside the annual Crunchies award ceremony.&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{cite news|last=Arrington|first=Michael|title=Weâre Awarding Goatse Security A Crunchie Award For Public Service|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/14/were-awarding-goatse-security-a-crunchie-award-for-public-service/|accessdate=31 March 2010|newspaper=Tech Crunch|date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yn&gt;{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=Ben|title=AT&amp;T apologizes for iPad breach, blames hackers|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ytech_gadg/20100614/tc_ytech_gadg/ytech_gadg_tc2564|accessdate=31 March 2010|newspaper=Yahoo! News|date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] then opened an investigation into the incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Tate |authorlink= |title=Apple's Worst Security Breach: 114,000 iPad Owners Exposed |url=http://gawker.com/5559346/apples-worst-security-breach-114000-ipad-owners-exposed |newspaper=[[Gawker.com]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a criminal complaint in January 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;complaint&quot;&gt;United States District Court - District Court of New Jersey, Docket: MAG 11-4022 (CCC). Filed with the court January 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and a raid on [[weev|Andrew Auernheimer's]] house.

He also asked for donations via [[PayPal]], to defray legal costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leyden&quot;&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/07/ipad_hack_follow_up/ AT&amp;T iPad 'hacker' breaks gag order to rant at cops] [[The Register]], John Leyden.
