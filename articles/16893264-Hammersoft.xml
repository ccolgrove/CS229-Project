{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Svayam Bhagavan''' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|svayam bhagavÄn}}''), &quot;'''The Lord'''&quot; or '''Lord Himself''', is a [[Sanskrit]]  theological term. The term refers to the concept of absolute representation of the monotheistic God as ''[[Bhagavan]]'' within [[Hinduism]].

It is most often used in [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] Krishna-centered theology as referring to [[Krishna]]. The title ''Svayam Bhagavan'' is used exclusively to designate Krishna,&lt;ref name=Gupta2007 /&gt; while there are conflicting semantics or other usages in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]. Traditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] and followers of [[Vallabha]] consider him to be the source of all [[avatar]]s,&lt;ref name = jsn/&gt; and the source of [[Vishnu]] and [[Narayana]] himself. As such, he is therefore regarded as ''Svayam Bhagavan''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Delmonico2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The term is seldom used to refer to other forms of Krishna and/or [[Vishnu]] within the context of certain religious texts such as the [[Bhagavata Purana]], and also within other sects of Vaishnavism.

}}&quot;Early Vaishnava worship focuses on three deities who become fused together, namely Vasudeva-Krishna, Krishna-Gopala, and Narayana, who in turn all become identified with Vishnu. Put simply, Vasudeva-Krishna and Krishna-Gopala were worshiped by groups generally referred to as Bhagavatas, while Narayana was worshipped by the Pancaratra sect.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source of [[Vishnu]] himself. This belief is drawn primarily &quot;from the famous statement of the Bhagavatam&quot;&lt;ref name=Gupta2007 /&gt;(1.3.28).&lt;ref name = Rosen&gt;''Essential [[Hinduism]]'' S. Rosen, 2006, Greenwood Publishing Group [http://books.google.com/books?id=VlhX1h135DMC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Krishna+is+the+original+Personality+of+Godhead&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=2Yojs3j3lTcocPQ7RaIqBnpLrq0 p.124] ISBN 0275990060&lt;/ref&gt;

A different viewpoint differing from this theological concept is the concept of [[Krishna]] as an ''[[avatar]]'' of [[Narayana]] or [[Vishnu]]. It should be however noted that although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avataras, this is only one of the names of the God of [[Vaishnavism]], who is also known as [[Narayana]], [[Vasudeva]] and Krishna and behind each of those names there is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name = Krishna4&gt;

==Meaning==

The theological interpretation of ''{{IAST|svayam bhagavÄn}}'' differs with each tradition and the literal translation of the term has been understood in several distinct ways. Translated from the [[Sanskrit language]], the term literary means &quot;[[Bhagavan]] Himself&quot; or &quot;directly [[Bhagavan]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007 /&gt; [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] tradition often translates it within its perspective as ''primeval Lord'' or ''original Personality of Godhead'', but also considers the terms such as ''Supreme Personality of Godhead'' and ''Supreme God'' as an equivalent to the term ''Svayam Bhagavan'', and may also choose to apply these terms to  Vishnu, [[Narayana]] and many of their associated [[Avatar]]s.&lt;ref name=Knapp2005&gt;{{cite book

==Perspectives==
===Supporting Views===
There is an element of countenance in many Krishna centered traditions to the subordination of Krishna to Vishnu. The reasons for that are given that it was the easiest way to accommodate Krishna's human story within the composite [[Vaishnava]] theological perspective. These &quot;core texts assert and defend the ultimacy of Krsna's identity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valpey|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; However inclusion of Krishna in the list of avataras does not necessarily subordinated him to Vishnu as one of the latter's expansions.&lt;ref name = Krishna182&gt;

p. 182-183&lt;/ref&gt; Early authors, such as 12th century [[Jayadeva]] considered [[dasavatara]] to be principal incarnations of Kirshna, rather than Vishnu.

The prime supporters of the Krishna-centered theology, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] and followers of the [[Vallabha Sampradaya]] [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], use the [[Gopala Tapani Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=Trip&gt;{{cite book |author=B.

In the sixth book of the [[Hindu epic]] [[MahÄbhÄrata]], the ''Bhishma Parva'' (where the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' is part of), Krishna offers numerous quotations that reaffirm the belief that he himself is the ''Svayam Bhagavan''. Verse [http://www.asitis.com/7/7.html 7.7] of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], is often used to support the opinion that Krishna himself is the ''Svayam Bhagavan'', and that no impersonal form of [[Brahman]] supersedes his existence, as it is an common view that [[Bhagavad Gita]] was propounding Krishna-theism before first major proponents of [[Advaita Vedanta|monism]].&lt;ref name = &quot;IST&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Other two pervading understandings of the position of ''Svayam Bhagavan'' asserted in the Gita are connected to other, not Krishna-centered, traditions. One tradition follows predominately the views of [[Sankaracharya]] commentary on [[Brahma Sutras]] and is referred as ''[[mayavada|maya-vad]]''&lt;ref name = &quot;IST&quot;/&gt; which justifies ''Svayam Bhagavan'' supremacy by a concept of illusion or [[maya (illusion)|maya]].

The second alternative understanding of the evident supremacy of  ''Svayam Bhagavan'' in the Gita, is a popular view on Krishna being the highest and fullest [[Avatar]] of the Lord, [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]].&lt;ref name = Pal1958&gt;{{cite book

Supremacy or a concept of ''originality'' is often referred to the words pf Krishna himself, as for example, [[Abhinavagupta]] of yet another tradition of Hinduism, introduces a quotation from the [[Bhagavad-gita]] that 'I', referring to [[Krishna]], is the highest self who transcends the perishable and imperishable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flood150&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|2006|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Vaishnava views===

The Sri Vaishnavas identify [[Vishnu]] with the [[Brahman]], while [[Krishna]]-centered traditions will associate [[Para Brahman]] with Krishna as Svayam Bhagavan. According to [[Ramanujacharya]], Brahman is [[personal god|personal]]. Indeed, he is the ''supreme'' person, creator and Lord, who leads souls to salvation. Far from having no (positive) attributes, as some [[Advaita Vedanta]] followers maintain, Brahman is the ''sum'' of all ânoble attributesâ â i.e. omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and all-merciful, all qualities attributed to Vishnu by all Vaishavas. According to South Indian traditions he is also ''advitya'' ([[Sanskrit]] meaning without rival). To Vaishnavas, [[Shiva]], [[Brahma]], and the other gods of the [[Hindu]] pantheon are viewed as Brahman's agents or [[servant of God|servants]], created and commissioned by him. Some Vaishnavas consider them to be or see that they have the same status that of [[angels]] have in the western religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;

âThe entire complex of intelligent and non-intelligent beings - is viewed as real and constitutes the form, i. e., the body of the highest Brahmanâ.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanuja (1962) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; A soul-body relationship, according to Ramanujacharya, is âentirely subordinateâ to its soul, having no independent reality or value.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanuja (1962) p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; However Ramanujacharya himself did not stress a subordination of the 'puravatara' Krishna to Vishnu.

However, [[Vaishnava]] traditions do not adhere to the concept of ''Svayam Bhagavan'' with the same views as those who support the concept.&lt;ref name=Tapasyananda1990&gt;{{cite book

To support their view they quote the 149th chapter of  ''AnushÄsanaparva'' in the epic [[Mahabharata]], [[Bhisma]] which states, with [[Krishna]] present, that mankind will be free from all sorrows by chanting the ''[[Vishnu sahasranama]]''', which are the thousand names of the all-pervading [[supreme being]] [[Vishnu]], who is the master of all the worlds, supreme over the ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'' and who is one with [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;see, Ganguli English translation of Mahabharata, Chapter 148, at http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b113.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit text and translation, see: Tapasyananda, Vishnu Sahasrnama, Ramakrishna Mission pp. 3-4.{{Verify credibility|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to indicate that Krishna is identical with Vishnu. Indeed, [[Krishna]] himself said, &quot;Arjuna, one may be desirous of praising by reciting the thousand names. But, on my part, I feel praised by one [[shloka]]. There is no doubt about it.â &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srivaishnavan.com/tomcat/visnu.html Srivaishnavism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Vaishnava schools have different interpretation of the concept as for example followers of the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] believe that Lord [[Narayana]] manifested himself as [[Lord Swaminarayan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.swaminarayanwales.org.uk/Murtis/murtis.asp | title=Lord Narayan manifested himself as Lord Swaminarayan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is only supported within their particular tradition.

===Comparison===

Some early schools of thought, such as Pancaratra in particular, refer to Vasudeva-Krishna (Krishna, the son of Vasudeva) as the source of all incarnations and as no different from the ultimate and absolute reality, and as non-distinct from Vasudeva and any other manifestations of the supreme self.&lt;ref name = Flood2006&gt;{{cite book

Two best known Vedic descriptions of the creation are [[purusha sukta]] and [[nasadiya sukta]].  One hymn addresses to Vishvakarma, The one who makes all. To beliefs of [[Vaishnavas]],&lt;ref&gt;Klaus K. Klostermaier, ''A Survey of Hinduism''.  Page 113, 1994, ISBN 0791421090&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Visvakarma Sukta'' of [[Rig Veda]] (10.82) refers to {{IAST|Garbhodakasayi Viá¹£á¹u}} indirectly as the Supreme God: The waters verily first retained the embryo in which all the gods were aggregated, single deposited on the navel of the unborn (ajah), in which all beings abide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10082.htm Rg.10.082.06] Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896] translates it &quot;The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together.

According to the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] interpretation, it is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gÄ«tÄ (7.7), which says, ''{{IAST|mattaá¸¥ parataraá¹ nÄnyat}}'': &quot;There is no truth superior to Me.&quot;  Where Krishna is 'bhagavan' himself, whose partial manifestations are the other gods. This idea is reflected in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]. The [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]] tells us Krishna is the ultimate source from which [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] and [[Prakriti]] originate. He is ''Svayam Bhagavan'' while other incarnation are his partial manifestations. The comments of [[Sridhara Svami]] (an early Sankara sect commentator), bring out uniqueness of Krishna.

When Chaitanya traveled through South India in 1509-10, he stayed at the house of Venkata Bhatta, the father of [[Gopala Bhatta]], priest of [[Srirangam]].

===Cosmological perspective===
The view of South Indian Vaishnava groups on ''sarga'', or subtle creation, is based upon scriptural adherence to [[Narayana]] or Vishnu being the cause of creation&lt;ref&gt;The Eleventh Canto of ''ÅrÄ«mad-BhÄgavatam'' [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/11/4/3/en(11.4.3-4) describes Lord {{IAST|MahÄpuruá¹£a}}: ''{{IAST|bhÅ«tair yadÄ paÃ±cabhir Ätma-sá¹á¹£á¹­aiá¸¥  puraá¹ virÄjaá¹ viracayya tasmin svÄá¹Åena viá¹£á¹­aá¸¥ puruá¹£ÄbhidhÄnam  avÄpa nÄrÄyaá¹a Ädi-devaá¸¥}}'' &quot;When the primeval Lord {{IAST|NÄrÄyaá¹a}} created His universal body out of the five elements produced from Himself, and then entered within that universal body by His own plenary portion, He thus became known as the {{IAST|Puruá¹£a}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; expanding into Viraja and then {{IAST|Maha-Viá¹£á¹u}} glancing over ''pradhana'', and that is the start of actual function of creation. This view is not contradicted by Krishna-centered Vashnavism and does not appear to be in contradiction with ''Svayam Bhagavan'' who as [[Vasudeva]] (son of Vasudeva, Krishna) is according to Pancaratra is at the source of creation.

Pancaratra sources are accepted by all of Vaishnava traditions, and confirmed by [[Yamunacarya]] who preceding in the line of [[Ramanuja]], summarizing in his ''Agamapramanya'', a defense of the revelation of the ''tantric'' Vaishnava Pancaratra, defending whole body of the texts being part of the Veda: &quot;The Pancadratra Tantra is authoritative like the Vedic sentences ordaining sacrifice on the grounds that it is based on knowledge free from all defects&quot;. Amalananda, also defends Pancaratra and while confirming that [[Ägama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] do not have the same self-authenticating validity, as the four Vedas, but the authenticity of it assured because Veda bear witness to the omniscience of [[Vasudeva]]. This position also forms the basis of [[Bhagavata Purana]] based theology.&lt;ref name=2Flood2006&gt;&quot;self-authenticating validity as the Veda, but their authenticity is nevertheless assured because the Veda bear witness to the omniscience of Vasudeva.&quot; p. 53-54, Flood. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a view of [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]]s that [[Sanatana Goswami]]s ''Brihad Bhagavatamrita'',  has illustrated this principle, not just in terms of comparative cosmology or ''avatara'' hierarchy as in Vaishnava Pancaratra, but also in terms of cosmology of ''adi-rasa''.&lt;ref name=KDasa&gt;{{cite journal

===Original Purusha of the Vedas===

{{See also|Gopala Tapani Upanishad|l1=Dating of early Tapani Upanishads}}

The form of [[Narayana]] is linked with the concept of sacrifice in the earliest known references to him. In Vedic sources such as the [[Purusha Sukta]], Narayana is given as the name of the self-offering of the great cosmic sacrifice of the [[Rig Veda]].&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 10.90&lt;/ref&gt; Narayana is not mentioned in Rig Veda itself, but came to be regarded as the seer who authored the [[hymn]]. It is possible that the sage who composed the Purusha Sukta hymn has been assimilated to the Purusha whose praise he had sung, and he himself became the object of worship. Mentions of a divine sage named [[Nara-Narayana|Narayana, along with counterpart Nara]], appears in many [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts.&lt;ref name = Krishna5&gt;

In the {{IAST|á¹g-Veda}} ({{IAST|á¹g.}} 1.22.23):

: ''{{IAST|divÄ«va caká¹£ur Ätataá¹ viá¹£á¹or yat paramaá¹ padam}}''

&quot;The Personality of Godhead, {{IAST|Viá¹£á¹u}}, is the Absolute Truth whose lotus feet all the demigods are always eager to see. His lotus-feet are only visible to those endowed with spiritual vision, for they are completely transcendental and supreme like {{IAST|ÅrÄ« Ká¹á¹£á¹a}}, Himself.&quot;

Again, in the {{IAST|á¹g-Veda}} (1.22.164 sÅ«kta 31) we find this verse:

Sometimes, He is clothed in many robes and at other times differently dressed; in this way, He is repeatedly appearing and disappearing in this universe.&quot; 

The next verse establishes the eternal aspect of {{IAST|ÅrÄ« Ká¹á¹£á¹a}}'s transcendental pastimes as found in the {{IAST|á¹g Veda}} (1.54.6):

In another place of the [[Bhagavata Purana]] 10.83.5-43 those who are named as wives of Krishna all explain to Draupadi how the 'Lord himself' (''Svayam Bhagavan'', [[Bhagavata Purana]] 10.83.7) came to marry them.

While some place Krishna-centered worship as ''Svayam Bhagavan'' in the medieval times of Indian history, there is some evidence suggesting the opposite. In the antiquity Krishna images were worshiped at many places. Quoting Curtius, Dr. D.C. Sircar says that an image of Herakles (i.e. Vasudeva-Krishna according to Sircar) was being carried in front of the Paurava army, as it advanced against the Greeks led by Alexander the Great (''The Cultural Heritage of India'', vol. 4. p.&amp;nbsp;115) An interesting terracotta plague showing Vasudeva carrying the infant Krishna over his head across the flooded Yamuna river, belonging to c. first century is housed in the Mathura Museum. A Mora stone inscription of about the same time refers to some images of Bhagavata Vrshni Panchaviras, Sankarshana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Samba and Aniruddha - which were very beautifully carved in stone.&lt;ref name = Krsnat&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=vNiKM-ky3DQC Chapter: ''Krishna and His Cult''. Krishna Theatre in India By M.L. Varalpande], p.6; 2002. ISBN 8170171512&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Gupta period]] research makes a &quot;clear mention of [[Vasudeva]] as the exclusive object of worship of a group of people,&quot; who are referred as [[bhagavatas]].&lt;ref name=1Banerjea1966&gt;Banerjea, 1966, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Verifying the antiquity of the exclusive worship of ''Svayam Bhagavan'', Krishna, the early [[Jainism|Jaina]] texts repeatedly stress two categories of [[Baladeva]]s and [[Vasudeva]]s that clearly can not be attributed to the Buddhist tradition, and can not be traced to the earlier strata of the Jaina canon itself. The introduction of these novel categories in the Jaina tradition, therefore, can hardly be explained without references to the legends surrounding the two popular figures of the early Vaishnava tradition, namely [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] of Mathura.&lt;ref name = &quot;Doniger&quot;/&gt; 

Archaeological remains found in the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] support the fact that the popularity of these two divine figures had reached its zenith in the [[Mauryan]] and the [[Sunga]] period and associated Bhagavata religion had become widespread throughout Mathura and Western India areas. This period coincides with the large migrations of Jainas from Magadha to [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. Baladeva is referred to by Jaina Puranas as Halabhrit, without any support from Brahminical texts. All the Vasudevas are modeled after the description of Krishna found in the [[Purana]]s. They are called blue-black (nila) in complexion and are designated by several names that are normally applied exclusively to Krishna e.g. Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, Vishnu and Narayana (which is used as synonym for the name Vasudeva). List of opposites (or ''prati'' categories) include most of the names associated with [[Asuras]] in Puranas.&lt;ref name = &quot;Doniger&quot;&gt;

In the [[Bhagavata purana]] the term is used for other forms of God, including [[Dhanvantari]],&lt;ref&gt;Bhag.P. 2.7.21: ''{{IAST|dhanvantariÅ ca bhagavÄn svayam eva kÄ«rtir nÄmnÄ ná¹á¹Äá¹ puru-rujÄá¹ ruja ÄÅu hanti}}

{{IAST|Äyuá¹£ya-vedam anuÅÄsty avatÄ«rya loke}}.'' The Lord in His incarnation of Dhanvantari very quickly cures the diseases of the ever-diseased living entities simply by his fame personified, and only because of him do the demigods achieve long lives. Thus the Personality of Godhead becomes ever glorified. He also exacted a share from the sacrifices, and it is he only who inaugurated the medical science or the knowledge of medicine in the universe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vamana]],&lt;ref&gt;Bhag.

There Lord Krishna, the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, enjoys blissful pastimes.&quot; [http://nitaaiveda.com/All_Scriptures_By_Acharyas/Bhaktivinoda_Thakura/Amnaya_Sutra.htm Amnaya Sutra] 3.5 Sampatti-prakarana, Sutra 114&lt;/ref&gt;
