'''Google Reader''' is a Web-based [[Feed aggregator|aggregator]], capable of reading [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] and [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] [[Web feed|feeds]] online or offline. It was released by [[Google]] on October 7, 2005 through [[Google Labs]]. Reader was graduated from [[Software_release_cycle#Beta|beta]] status on September 17, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/09/breaking-up-isnt-hard-to-do.html &quot;Official Google Reader Blog: Breaking up isn't hard to do&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
===Interface===

Google made major revisions to Reader's user-interface on September 28, 2006. Product manager Nick Baum described the redesign as a movement toward making news aggregation something for the general public to enjoy. Kevin Fox, the designer of the revised Google Reader, noted that the original version was optimal for those who want to read a &quot;river&quot; of news. The new version took into account that most readers segment their reading by feed, group, tag, folder, or into &quot;must read&quot; and &quot;maybe if I get to it&quot; feeds.&lt;ref&gt;

Features of Google Reader {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} include:

* a front page that lets you see new items at a glance
* import and export subscription lists as an [[OPML]] file
* keyboard shortcuts for main functions
* choice between ''list view'' or ''expanded view'' for item viewing (showing either just the story title or including a description, respectively)
* automatic marking of items as read as they are scrolled past (expanded view only)
* search in all feeds, across all updates from subscriptions&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/09/we-found-it.html &quot;Official Google Reader Blog: 'We found it!'&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the visual redesign of all Google products in 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/07/17/andy-hertzfeld-on-google-ui-design-and-how-bob-dylan-influenced-the-mac/ TheNextWeb: Andy Hertzfeld on Google+, UI design and how Bob Dylan influenced the Mac]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/evolving-google-design-and-experience.html Official Google Blog: Evolving the Google design and experience]&lt;/ref&gt;, a new Google Reader interface was available on October 31, 2011. Beside the sweeping visual changes, former social features (&quot;share&quot; and &quot;like&quot; buttons) has been removed and replaced by [[Google+]]'s +1 button and the &quot;share on Google+&quot; box. It's said that now Reader is on its fourth social model, after using [[Google Talk]] contacts, allowing people to manage friends from the Reader interface, integrating with [[Google Buzz]] and then with Google+.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-readers-new-interface.html Google Operating System: Google Reader's New Interface]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.persistent.info/2011/10/google-reader-social-retrospective.html persistent.info: Google Reader Social Retrospective]&lt;/ref&gt; The changes have been received unfavorably by multiple online blogs and technical writers, including former Google Reader product manager Brian Shih&lt;ref&gt;[http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/02/ex-google-reader-product-manager-posts-scathing-review-of-reader-redesign/ TechCrunch: Ex-Google Reader Product Manager Posts Scathing Review Of Reader Redesign]&lt;/ref&gt; and former Google Reader lead designer Kevin Fox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fury.com/2011/11/my-offer-to-google-reader/ My offer to Google Reader]&lt;/ref&gt; and by writers in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/11/why-curated-content-matters-a-lament-for-reader-share/ Wired: Why Curated Content Matters: A Lament for Reader Share]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/11/02/the-google-reader-redesign-is-an-ugly-lonely-user-experience/ Forbes: The Google Reader Redesign is an Ugly, Lonely User Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNET]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-57317619-264/what-needs-fixing-with-google-reader-redesign/?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 cnet: What needs fixing with Google Reader redesign]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[InformationWeek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/google/231902111 InformationWeek: 3 Google Reader Changes Need Repair Now]&lt;/ref&gt;. Over 15,000 users have signed an online petition asking Google to reinstate the original interface&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdkeller.com/2011/10/save-google-reader/ Save Google Reader]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Organization===

Users can subscribe to feeds using either Google Reader's search function, or by entering in the exact URL of the RSS or Atom feed. New posts from those feeds are then shown on the left-hand side of the screen. One can then order that list by date or relevance. Items can also be organized with labels, as well as being able to create &quot;Starred Items&quot; for easy access.

===Sharing===

From 2007 to 2011, items in Google Reader could be shared with other Web users. Previously this was done by sending a link through e-mail, directing the user to the shared article; or by creating a basic webpage that includes all shared items from a user's account. In December 2007, Google changed the sharing policy so that items the user marked as shared were automatically visible to their [[Google Talk]] contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/12/reader-and-talk-are-friends.html | author = Chrix Finne | title = Reader and Talk are friends! | publisher = Google Reader Blog | date = December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users criticized this change because there is no way to opt out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-howdoi/browse_thread/thread/318c4559e2ac5bbe/e2a7a7d782571c38 | title =  New Feature: Sharing with Friends | publisher = Google Reader Help | date = December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The URL for a user's page of shared items contains a random string, and Google originally advertised this as a way to limit sharing to only those people to whom you give the address.

Google removed the sharing functionality built into Reader on October 31, 2011, and replaced it with a [[Google+]] +1 button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html | author = Alan Green | title = New in Reader: a fresh design, and Google+ sharing | publisher = Google Reader Blog | date = October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users criticized this change because it effectively dismantled existing social networks that had formed around these features and disabled sharing and publishing functions that served as a communications medium for Iranians seeking news sources that couldn't be blocked by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/25/iranians-upset-over-google-reader-changes/ | author = Sarah Perez | title = Iranians Upset Over Google Reader Changes | publisher = TechCrunch | date = October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offline access===

Google Reader was the first application to make use of [[Google Gears]], a browser extension that lets online applications work offline. Users who have installed the extension can download up to 2000 items to be read offline. After coming back online, Google Reader updates the feeds. Google Reader stopped supporting this feature on June 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile access===

A mobile interface was released&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/05/you-can-now-use-google-reader-from.html  &quot;Official Google Reader Blog: You can now use Google Reader from your phone.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; on May 18, 2006, and is accessible at [http://www.google.com/reader/m/view/ www.google.com/reader/m/view]. It now can be used by devices that support [[XHTML]] or [[Wireless Application Protocol#WAP 2.0|WAP 2.0]]. On May 12, 2008, Google announced a version of Google Reader targeted at iPhone users. It can be found at [http://www.google.com/reader/i/ www.google.com/reader/i].&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/05/brand-new-google-reader-for-iphone.html &quot;Official Google Reader Blog: 'Brand new Google Reader for iPhone'&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010 Google released a Google Reader app for Android, which is available from the [[Android Market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/11/android-google-reader-app-is-here.html The Android Google Reader app is here!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===iGoogle===

On May 4, 2006, Google released a new feature&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/05/theres-some-reader-in-my-homepage.html &quot;Official Google Reader Blog: There's some Reader in my Homepage!&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; which enables feeds from Reader to be displayed on [[iGoogle]] (formerly Google Personalized Homepage).

===Mozilla integration===

Google Reader is included within [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[SeaMonkey]]'s feed recognition, which can automatically redirect users to Google Reader's ''Add Subscription'' screen.

===Wii version===

On May 8, 2007, Google created a version of Google Reader specifically formatted for the [[Wii browser|Wii web-browser]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/reader/wii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Play===

On March 10, 2010, Google announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/03/and-now-for-something-completely.html &quot;Official Google Reader Blog: And now for something completely different&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and released&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/reader/play &quot;Google Reader Play&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Google Reader Play.  Play presents a slideshow interface which displays popular items one at a time.  These items are drawn from assorted sites' feeds, and their appearance in Play is based on the data provided by Reader users' responses, e.g., how many people liked or shared the item.  Unlike Google Reader, a Google Account is not required to access Play.
