'''Chicago Fire NPSL''' is an American [[association football|soccer]] team based in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[United States]]. Founded in 2007, the team plays in [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL), a national amateur league at the fourth tier of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]], in the Midwest Division. 

The team plays its home games on the turf practice field at [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park]] in [[Bridgeview, Illinois]], where the senior [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] team plays. The team's colors are red and white.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
The team began an offshoot of the [[Rockford Raptors]] organization, who were members of the old [[USISL]] in the early 1990s, and played for seven seasons in the [[USL Second Division|USISL Pro League]] and [[USL Premier Development League]], reaching the Conference Playoffs on two occasions before leaving the league at the end of the 2000 season. 

The team re-formed in 2007 and played their first season in the [[National Premier Soccer League]] in [[Rockford, Illinois]] as the Raptors, before moving to Bridgeview and adopting their current name prior to the 2008 season after signing a formal agreement to become an official development program for the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] [[Major League Soccer]] programme. The NPSL team often shares players with its [[Chicago Fire Premier|counterpart]] in the [[USL Premier Development League]], with players moving from the NPSL team to the PDL team when the NPSL season ends.
