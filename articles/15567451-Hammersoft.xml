A local doctor, Dr. Luis Gamboa, initiated plans for establishing the school; he later became its first President. Another local resident, Ramon Legaspi, secured the necessary government permits, drew up the first [[curriculum]] and procured instructional materials for the institution.

== Alma Mater song==

by: Romeo I. Perales
&lt;poem&gt;
Alma Mater, Alma Mater
The Silay Institute
Alma Mater a tribute of praise
To thy glory and fame we raise

To thy glory, to thy glory
To thy glory and fame we raise

In all our lands our voices raise
To hymn thy name and sing thy praise
Thy wonder the people will know
Thy worth to the school we'll show

Dear Alma Mater our hearts we lay
Dear Alma Mater we're loyal to thee
Thy motherly love in us will bring
In life to thy standard will cling
&lt;/poem&gt;
==S.I. Loyalty March==

&lt;poem&gt;
Silay Institute Alma Mater dear
Oh pride of Negros hall of fame
To you we raise our voices loud and clear 
To praise your honored name

In true abiding faith and loyalty
We stand united all
To spread your glorious name throughout the land
S.I. our beloved school

So faithfully we'll treasure evermore
The truth and knowledge you impart
And all your loving cherished memories
Will live within our hearts

Although the changing years may come and go
We may be far or near
We will remember you beloved school
S.I. Alma Mater dear.
&lt;/poem&gt;
