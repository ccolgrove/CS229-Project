'''CinePaint''' is an [[open source]] [[computer program]] for [[paint]]ing and retouching [[bitmap]] [[frame (film)|frame]]s of [[film]]s. It is a [[fork (software)|fork]] of version 1.0.4 of the [[GIMP|GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)]].  It enjoyed some success as one of the earliest open source tools developed for feature motion picture visual effects and animation work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The main reason for this adoption over mainline gimp was its support for high bit depths (greater than 8-bits per channel) which can be required for film work. The mainline gimp plans to add (but has not yet added) these features &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Under its former name '''Film Gimp''', CinePaint was used for films such as ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' (2002), ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001), ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' (2003) and ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinepaint.org/about.html CinePaint home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Features that set CinePaint apart from its photo-editing predecessor include the frame manager, [[onion skinning]], and the ability to work with 16-bit and floating point pixels for [[high dynamic range imaging]] (HDR). CinePaint supports a 16-bit [[color management|color managed]] workflow for photographers and printers, including [[Lab color space|CIE*Lab]] and [[CMYK]] editing. It supports the [[Cineon]], [[DPX]], and [[OpenEXR]] image file formats. HDR creation from bracketed exposures is easy.

CinePaint is currently available for [[Unix-like]] OSes including [[Mac OS X]] and [[IRIX]].

Glasgow, a completely new code architecture being used for CinePaint, is expected to make a new Windows version possible and is currently under production. The Glasgow effort is [[FLTK]] based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinepaint.bigasterisk.com/WhyMigrateFromGTKToFLTK CinePaint Documentation: Why Migrate from GTK to FLTK], Retrieved on March 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This effort appears to have stalled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinepaint.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
