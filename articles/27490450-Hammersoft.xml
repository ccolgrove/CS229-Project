'''Disney Junior''' is a current [[program block]] on [[Disney Channel]] and an upcoming [[United States|American]] [[basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[Television network|network]] intended to replace [[SOAPnet]] in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118043061?refCatId=19 Disney Junior acing frosh year], ''Variety'', September 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It began airing on February 14, 2011, replacing [[Playhouse Disney]].

The first new programs were ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]'', ''[[Tinga Tinga Tales]]'' and ''[[Babar and the Adventures of Badou]]''.  Carrying over from Playhouse Disney were ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', ''[[Little Einsteins]]'', ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', ''[[Chuggington]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'',  ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', and ''[[Timmy Time]]''.

==History==
In May 2010, it was announced that [[Playhouse Disney]] and [[SOAPnet]] will rebrand as '''Disney Junior'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/05/26/disney-abc-television-group-announces-disney-junior-a-new-24-hour-channel-for-preschoolers-and-their-families-35879/20100526abc03 Disney/ABC Television Group Announces Disney Junior, a New 24-Hour Channel for Preschoolers and Their Families], ''The Futon Critic'', May 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney Junior first launched as a programming block on February 14, 2011, replacing Playhouse Disney. The first program was ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''. In its first week since its debut, Disney Junior delivered Disney Channelâs best ratings ever in the daypart among Kids 2-5 (474,000/2.8 rating). 

==Separate channel==
A 24-hour [[basic cable]] and [[satellite]] channel for Disney Junior will launch in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118043061?refCatId=19 Disney Junior acing frosh year], ''Variety'', September 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  It will replace the woman-targeted soap opera channel, [[SOAPnet]]. The channel was originally set to debut in January 2012, but got pushed to spring 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/soapnet-to-stay-on-the-air-longer-into-the-new-year/2011/07/28 SOAPnet to stay on the air longer into the New Year!], ''Michael Fairman Soaps'', July 28, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt; but as of September 2011, it got pushed again to February 2012. 

The channel is expecting its original series (''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]'', ''[[3rd &amp; Bird]]'', etc.), shows from the Playhouse Disney library (that are currently airing on the block) (''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', etc.), movies appropriate for very younger viewers (''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Dumbo]]'', etc.) and short-form series in its lineup. On June 17, 2011, it has been comfirmed that the Disney Junior channel will include &quot;old-school&quot; [[Playhouse Disney]] series in its lineup when the channel launches.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.dealiciousmom.com/24-hour-disney-junior-channel-coming-in-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; Examples for &quot;old-school&quot; Playhouse Disney series include ''[[Stanley (2001 TV series)|Stanley]]'', ''[[Higglytown Heroes]]'', ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', and ''[[JoJo's Circus]]''. 

When the channel launches, it will also provide affiliate partners with a robust video-on-demand offering, a high-definition network (marketed as '''Disney Junior HD''') and a Spanish language [[Second audio program|SAP]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID10038450.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thedisneyblog.com/2010/05/27/disney-junior-to-replace-soapnet-in-cable-lineup/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by Disney Junior}}

''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Chuggington]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'', ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', ''[[Little Einsteins]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'' and ''[[Timmy Time]]'', all popular [[Playhouse Disney]] series, were moved to the block and continue to broadcast.

Disney Junior broadcasts from September until late May from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm ET (5:00 am to 1:00 pm CT) on weekdays, and from 6:00 am to 9:00 am ET, (5:00 am to 8:00 am CT) on weekends and also during major holidays ([[Christmas]], [[Easter]], [[Labor Day]], [[Columbus Day]], [[Veterans Day]]) and also 6:00 am to 10:00 am ET (5:00 am to 9:00 am CT) on weekdays from late May (post-[[Memorial Day]] through [[Labor Day]]), each running a different schedule. They feature 25-minute standard length shows, interspersed with short 5 minute shorts and music videos. Between these times, there are no commercials played during Disney Junior (though Disney Channel, being a commercial-free cable channel, does not air regular commercials anyway), though short &quot;promotional spots&quot; do run every so often, such as often seen on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Between 4:00 and 6:00, when Disney Channel animated programs air under the regular Disney Channel branding, there are commercials for Disney properties as there are for other Disney Channel programs.

Former shows on the former Playhouse Disney block will air reruns by popular demand on the Disney Junior channel in its launch on February 2012, replacing [[SOAPnet]].

===Disney Junior HD===
[[Image:Disney Junior HD logo.gif|thumb|Logo for Disney Junior HD in 2012.|200px]]

'''Disney Junior HD''' will be a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed, broadcasting a moderate amount of Disney Junior's programming in [[720p]] HD.  It will begin broadcasting in February 2012.  Many cable providers will carry the HD simulcast feed, along with DirecTV, AT&amp;T U-verse and Verizon FIOS. Currently, Dish Network does not carry the Disney/ABC Cable Networks' HD simulcast channels due to a retransmission consent dispute with the Walt Disney Company, so it will probably not carry the channel. 

HD versions of Disney Junior had already launched in Canada, Asia , France and The Netherlands. Currently, Disney Junior HD appears to be a block on the HD feed version on [[Disney Channel]].

===Disney Junior On Demand===
'''Disney Junior On Demand''' is the video-on-demand service, which offers select episodes of Disney Junior's original series. It is available to most digital cable and IPTV providers.
