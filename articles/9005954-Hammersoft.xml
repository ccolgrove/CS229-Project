{{2002 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''2002 Penn State Nittany Lions football team''' represented the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in the [[2002 NCAA Division I-A football season|2002â2003 college football season]]. The team's head coach was [[Joe Paterno]]. It played its home games at [[Beaver Stadium]] in [[University Park, Pennsylvania]].

==Preseason==
The Nittany Lions returned 16 starters from the previous season, who won five of its final seven games. Six starters returned on defense, led by defensive tackle [[Jimmy Kennedy (American football)|Jimmy Kennedy]], who returned for his fifth year despite speculations he would enter the [[NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedydraft&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011002aaa.html|title=Kennedy To Return For Senior Season|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics|date=2002-01-10|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offensive unit averted a possible quarterback controversy when last year's starter [[Matt Senneca]] announced that he would not be returning for his final year of eligibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;senneca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011602aaa.html|title=Matt Senneca Not Returning for Senior Season|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics|date=2002-01-16|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redshirt sophomore [[Zack Mills]] would lead the offense, with expectations high after showing flashes of brilliance coming off the bench in 2001. [[Larry Johnson (American football)|Larry Johnson]] would also become the featured back, after spending three seasons playing in a tailback-by-committee that had inconsistent production. Johnson will have the luxury of running behind an offensive line that returned all five starters.

Penn State was ranked number 24 in both the [[Associated Press|AP]] and [[Coaches Poll|Coaches]] college football preseason polls.

After a sloppy first half, Penn State scored 17 unanswered points in the second half and then withstood a late charge to hold off the [[2002 UCF Knights football team|Golden Knights]] for a 27â24 win. [[Zack Mills]] was 13 of 20 for 194 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. On defense, [[Anthony Adams]] recovered a fumbled snap to set up a field goal, and [[Derek Wake]] blocked a field goal attempt.

After trailing the [[2002 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Hawkeyes]] by 22 points in the fourth quarter, [[Zack Mills]] threw for three touchdowns in the final 7:13 to tie the game 35â35 and force overtime, but the Nittany Lions were unable to score in overtime and lost 42â35. For the game, Mills completed 23 of 44 passes for a school record 399 yards and four touchdowns.

But the play that was most shown repeatedly on sports highlights shows throughout the rest of the season happened after the game. Following a couple questionable calls by the line judge in overtime, [[Joe Paterno]] sprinted down the field to catch up with referee [[Dick Honig]] as he approached the tunnel and grabbed Honig by the back of the shirt to voice his displeasure with the way the game ended. Paterno was angered that Penn State wide receiver [[Tony Johnson (wide receiver)|Tony Johnson]] caught a pass with both feet in bounds according to the stadium's video replay board, but the play was ruled an incompletion.&lt;ref name=&quot;honig&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/20021002psu1002p4.asp|title=Football: Paterno says no apology needed|last=Fittipaldo|first=Ray|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2002-10-02|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2002 Michigan Wolverines football team|Wolverines]] beat Penn State 27â24 in overtime. A slow first half gave way to a shootout in the second half. The game was tied 7â7 at halftime, and the teams combined for only 240 yards. Penn State led 13â7 late in the third quarter and looked to seize control of the game after forcing a Michigan punt at their own 20, but a roughing the punter penalty kept the drive alive, and Michigan found the end zone eight plays later. [[Zack Mills]] finished the day 19 of 31 for 264 yards and two touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101202aaa.html|title=Penn State falls to Michigan 27â24 in Overtime|date=2002-10-12|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Paterno]] expressed his displeasure with the officials for the second time this season as he yelled at referee [[David Witvoet]] after regulation. There were a number of odd and questionable actions by the officials during the game, as pointed out by the TV commentators, including the roughing the punter penalty and the referee refusing to ask for measurements when it appeared Michigan had been stopped short of first down. Each time he glanced at the sideline and signaled first down. It was most noticeable in the third quarter when he signaled first down even as Michigan was lining up in short-yardage formation, thinking it was third-and-1.

But Paterno and the coaching staff were most livid about a blown call with 40 seconds remaining in regulation and the score tied at 21â21. Receiver [[Tony Johnson (wide receiver)|Tony Johnson]] had just made a leaping catch of a Mills pass at the Michigan 22. The side judge ruled Johnson out of bounds despite replays showing he had both feet at least a yard inbounds. Numerous replays on TV showed the large divot in the field where Johnson's feet had landed. Instead of a field goal opportunity to win the game in regulation, the game was forced into overtime.

==Post season==

Penn State finished the season ranked #16 in the final [[Associated Press|AP]] college football poll and #15 in the final [[Coaches Poll|Coaches]] college football poll, earning Penn State its 25th Top 15 finish under Joe Paterno.&lt;ref name=&quot;rankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/010403aaa.html|title=Nittany Lions Earn 25th Top 15 Final Ranking Under Paterno|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics|date=2003-01-04|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tailback [[Larry Johnson (American football)|Larry Johnson]] would finish the season as the first Nittany Lion to lead the nation in rushing and all-purpose yardage. Johnson become the ninth player in Division I-A history to gain 2,000 yards rushing in the regular season, finishing third in [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011603aaa.html|title=Larry Johnson Is First Nittany Lion to Lead Nation in Rushing &amp; All-Purpose Yardage; Haynes Among NCAA Defensive Leaders|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics|date=2003-01-16|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State claimed second place in football attendance for the second consecutive season, averaging 107,239 through eight home games, ranking in the top four for the 12th consecutive year. The Nittany Lions also broke the NCAA record for total season attendance with 1,247,707 during the 13-game schedule, including a Beaver Stadium record of 110,753 for the Nebraska game.&lt;ref name=&quot;attendance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/021003aaa.html|title=Penn State Claims Second In NCAA Football Attendance; Breaks NCAA Record For Total Attendance with 1.2 Million Fans|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics|date=2003-02-10|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instant replay===
A few other conference coaches had lobbied for instant replay before, but they had fallen on deaf ears until [[Joe Paterno]], who had been against instant replay citing the length of games as a factor, changed his opinion after a number of questionable officiating calls in the Iowa and Michigan games. Paterno and Penn State athletic director Tim Curley called for a comprehensive review of Big Ten officiating. At the news conference after the Michigan game, Paterno went further and said that the conference should change the way that officials are assigned, referring to the assignment of the officiating crew that worked the Michigan game, three of whom live in the state of Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;officiating&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/college_football/20021015-1555-fbc-pennst-paterno.html|title=Paterno wants further review of Big Ten officiating practices|last=Lewerenz|first=Dan|publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=2002-10-15|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Big Ten concluded its comprehensive review of its officiating, the conference implemented a pilot program during the 2003 season to evaluate the use of [[Instant Replay|instant replay]]. The pilot was used to gather data and did not interfere with games or overturn any missed calls.&lt;ref name=&quot;replaypilot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/notebooks/20030815bigten0815p1.asp|title=Big Ten to experiment with program for instant replay|last=Fittipaldo|first=Ray|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2003-08-15|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2004 season, the Big Ten introduced college football's first instant replay system. A technical advisor in the press box with access to the television feeds will be able to stop a game for a replay review and potentially overturn a play, with no limit on the number of plays that can be reviewed.&lt;ref name=&quot;replay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04218/356960.stm|title=Instant replay comes to Big Ten for a one-year look|last=Fittipaldo|first=Ray|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2004-08-04|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
