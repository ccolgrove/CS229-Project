The '''Football League Cup''', commonly known as the '''League Cup''' or, from current sponsorship, the '''Carling Cup''', is an [[football in England|English association football]] competition. Like the [[FA Cup]], it is played on a knockout (single elimination) basis. Unlike the FA Cup, where 762 teams entered in [[2008â09 FA Cup|2008â09]], only 92 clubs can enter the League Cup â the 20 [[Premier League]] clubs, and the 72 clubs of [[The Football League]], which organises the competition. Also unlike the FA Cup, the semi-finals are played over two legs. The winners qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League]], unless they have qualified for European competition through the Premier League or by winning the [[FA Cup]], in which case the Europa League berth goes to the highest-placed team from the Premier League not already qualified for Europe. [[Birmingham City]] are the current holders.
Although the League Cup is one of the three major domestic trophies attainable by English league teams, it is perceived by some larger clubs as a lower priority than the league championship and the FA Cup. Some clubs have made a point of fielding a weaker side in the competition, making the opportunity for [[giant-killing]] of the larger clubs more likely. Many of the top English sides, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in particular, have used the competition to give young players valuable big-game experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=/2009/2/28/sports/3371444&amp;sec=sports|title=MU boss vows to field young guns in the League Cup final|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=28 February 2009|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in response to [[ArsÃ¨ne Wenger|ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's]] claim that a League Cup win would not end his trophy drought, [[Alex Ferguson]] described the trophy as &quot;a pot worth winning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport-news/man-utd-fc/2010/02/26/carling-cup-worth-winning-says-manchester-united-manager-sir-alex-ferguson-55578-25917633/|title=Carling Cup worth winning says Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post|Daily Post]]|date=26 February 2010|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that nadir, the League Cup has recovered somewhat, embracing the 'youth' football ethic, and maintaining its niche as an early season trophy.

[[Women's football in England|The women's game]] has its own [[FA Women's Premier League Cup|League Cup]], which is open to the 36 women's clubs in the three divisions of the [[FA Women's Premier League]], although the women's competition is governed by [[The Football Association|The FA]] and not [[The Football League]].

==History==
During the late 1950s, the majority of senior English clubs equipped their grounds with [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]]s. This opened up the opportunity to exploit weekday evenings throughout the winter. The League Cup was introduced in the [[1960â61 in English football|1960â61]] season specifically as a mid-week floodlit tournament. In the early years of the competition, many of the top teams declined to take part. It was only when automatic entry to the [[UEFA Cup]] was promised to the winners that the full League membership took part.

In the last 10 years, following restructuring of European football, and the introduction of the restructured format of the [[UEFA Champions League]], the League Cup was threatened with losing its [[UEFA Cup]] berth for its winners. It has retained it thus far however, and along with France is the only nation to offer a UEFA cup berth to its second cup competition winners. Therefore it retains enough importance and popularity, especially with fans of clubs for whom the League Cup offers a realistic chance of qualifying for Europe.

[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] were the inaugural winners in 1960â61 defeating [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] 3â2 in the final over two legs. [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] have won the cup on the most occasions with seven victories including four successive trophies in the early 1980s. They completed two [[Treble (association football)|trebles]] of trophy wins, in 1984 and 2001. The present holders are [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], who beat Arsenal 2â1 in the [[2010â11 Football League Cup|2011 Final]].

Giant killings are less well remembered in the League Cup than the [[FA Cup]] due to the absence of non-league sides and the fact that many big clubs have fielded very under-strength sides when knocked out. However, there have been some notable upsets, such as [[Football League Division Four|Fourth Division]] side [[Chester City F.C.|Chester]] knocking league champions [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] out 3â0 en route to the semi-finals in [[1974â75 in English football|1974â75]]. In [[1995â96 in English football|1995â96]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were beaten 3â0 at home by [[York City F.C.|York City]] in the second round, first leg, United could only win 3â1 and went out 4â3 on aggregate. United have also been knocked out by [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 2006â07 and 2007â08 respectively: in the match against Southend they fielded a strong side, bucking a trend they had themselves started. In 2001â02, holders [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] were defeated 2â1 at home by [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], then humbled again by [[Northampton Town]] in September 2010. Grimsby recorded another giant killing in 2005 by knocking out [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

==Format==
===Preliminary round===
This is only used when the number of teams in European competition affects the number of byes to the third round ''and'' it would not be easier to give a club a bye to the second round. Matches involve the eligible clubs who finished lowest in the [[English football league system]] last season (normally clubs promoted from [[Conference National]]). This has been used twice to date, in [[2002â03 Football League Cup|2002â03]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccer.mistral.co.uk/books/flctext.htm The Football League Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2011â12 Football League Cup|2011â12]].

The ties are single matches, with [[extra time]] and a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] if necessary, with the winners progressing to the next round.

===First round===
All clubs playing in The Football League (the [[Football League Championship]], [[Football League One]] and [[Football League Two]]), unless they are competing in the [[UEFA Europa League]], enter at this stage and join any Preliminary Round winners. Sometimes (depending on the number of clubs competing in Europe, whether or not they play in The Football League ''and'' whether a preliminary round would be an easier way to even up the numbers) it is necessary to give one or more clubs a bye to the second round. The clubs would be those eligible to compete in the First Round who finished highest in the English football league system last season (normally clubs relegated from the [[Premier League]]).

For this round, the clubs are divided in northern and southern sections (though not always equally, so there could be more clubs in one section than another and, strangely, some of the clubs in the northern section are actually located further south than some of the southern section clubs). Half of the clubs from each section are seeded and half are not. First a draw is made to determine whether the seeded club is to play at home or away, and then the club is drawn against an unseeded club from their section.

The ties are single matches, with extra time and a penalty shootout if necessary, with the winners progressing to the next round.

===Second round===
All clubs playing in the Premier League, unless they are competing in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] or [[Europa League]], as well as any clubs that may have been given a bye to this round, enter at this stage and join the First Round winners, although [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] were not exempt in 2008â09, having qualified for the [[2008â09 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] through the Fair Play league.

The ties are single matches, with extra time and a penalty shootout if necessary, with the winners progressing to the next round.

===Third round===
All clubs competing in the Champions League or Europa League enter at this stage and join the Second Round winners (making for a total of 32 clubs).

The ties are single matches, with extra time and a penalty shootout if necessary, with the winners progressing to the next round.

===Fourth round===
The winners of ties in the previous round play single matches, with extra time and a penalty shootout if necessary.

===Quarter-finals===
The winners of the fourth round ties play each other in single matches in the quarter-finals, with extra time and a penalty shootout if necessary. This stage of the competition is also known as the fifth round.

===Semi-finals===
The four fifth round winners compete in this round. The ties are played over home and away legs, with the aggregate scores being used to determine the winners. If the aggregate scores are level at the end of the 90 minutes, then extra time takes place to determine the winner. If after extra time the aggregate tie still prevails, the [[away goals]] rule determines the winner. However if there is no separation here, a penalty shootout takes place until there is a winner.

===Final===
{{See also|Category:Football League Cup Finals}}
The two semi-final winners compete to win the cup.

The tie is a single match played at a neutral stadium (which was the [[Millennium Stadium]] between the seasons [[2000â01 in English football|2000â01]] and [[2006â07 in English football|2006â07]] but returned to [[Wembley Stadium]] from 2008 onwards), with extra time and a penalty shootout if necessary. The final is usually staged between late February and early March, in the final third of the domestic football season.

Since 1990, the best player in the League Cup final â as chosen by the [[Sky Sports]] television panel â has been presented with the [[Alan Hardaker]] trophy, named after the former secretary of [[The Football League]] who devised the Football League Cup. The current holder of the trophy is [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]'s [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]], the only player to win the award multiple times (in 2009 and 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alan Hardaker Trophy Winners |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/AlanHardakerTrophyWinners/0,,10794~1354852,00.html |work=football-league.co.uk |publisher=The Football League |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television coverage==
The [[BBC]] and [[Sky Sports]] are host broadcasters. From 2009â10, the BBC will show one leg of each semi-final and the final live, with Sky showing at least one match from every round live, including the final. Highlights are shown on [[BBC One]] and the [[BBC Sport website]].

In its early years, coverage of the competition was split between the BBC and [[ITV]], though the final was usually on ITV (and was only shown as highlights until 1984). From 1988â89 to 2008â09, ITV were the only terrestrial broadcaster covering the competition. They showed it exclusively until 1996â97 when Sky began covering it, and gained the exclusive live rights to the final.

In Australia, two matches from each round, the semi-finals and final are shown live on Fox Sports. In the U.S. and Canada, games are broadcast by [[Fox Soccer Channel]] and [[Setanta Sports (Canada)]], respectively. In Africa, [[Super Sport (TV channel)|Super Sport]] telecast the matches while [[Ten Sports]] and [[TEN Action+]] cover the event in India and Pakistan. In Scandinavia, games are broadcast by Canal+.

In Arab countries, most matches from each round, the semi-finals and final are shown live on [[Al Jazeera Sports]] channels.

In Asia, games are broadcasted by Goal TV except Japan and Korea.
