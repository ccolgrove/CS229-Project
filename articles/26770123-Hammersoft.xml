The '''2007â08 [[Memphis Tigers basketball|Memphis Tigers men's basketball]] team''' represented the [[University of Memphis]] in the [[2007â08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007â08 college basketball season]], the 87th season of Tiger basketball. The Tigers were coached by eighth-year head coach [[John Calipari]], and they played their home games at the [[FedExForum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]].

The Tigers finished the season 38â2 (16â0), as [[Conference USA]] regular season and tournament champions. However, all 38 wins were subsequently vacated by the NCAA for rules violations, leaving the team with a final record of 0-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2011/D1.pdf|title=Division I Records|accessdate=July 9, 2011|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;  The Tigers started the season 26â0, the best start to a season in Memphis history. The record start ended with a 62â66 loss to the [[2007â08 Tennessee Volunteers basketball team|Tennessee Volunteers]] in a highly-anticipated No.&amp;nbsp;1 vs. No.&amp;nbsp;2 matchup. The Tigers ultimately advanced to the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA National Championship]] game, though the NCAA tournament appearance was subsequently vacated.  The Tigers fell in overtime to the [[2007â08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas Jayhawks]], 68â75. Memphis finished the season ranked 2nd in the final [[Coaches' Poll]] and 2nd in the [[AP Poll]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/rankings/_/year/2008 2007â2008 Final Rankings].&quot; (Retrieved on 30-03-2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Tigers' 38 wins set an NCAA record for most wins in a single season.  The NCAA eventually invalidated the wins of the 2007â2008 season and placed the Tigers on three years' probation for violating NCAA rules by playing an ineligible player, [[Derrick Rose]].&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=5018281|publisher=ESPN.com|title=NCAA: Memphis must vacate wins|date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
