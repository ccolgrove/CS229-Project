}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two new applications, made their debut in Office 2003: [[Microsoft InfoPath|InfoPath]] and [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]]. OneNote is a [[note-taking]] and organizing application for text, handwritten notes or diagrams, recorded audio and graphics. Office 2003 is the first version to use [[Windows XP]] style icons and colors.

Office 2003 runs only on recent NT-based versions of Windows (it does not support [[Windows 98]], [[Windows Me]] or [[Windows NT 4.0]]).

== Features ==
The core applications, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access have only minor improvements, however Outlook 2003 received a significant &quot;facelift&quot; and improved functionality in many areas, including better email and calendar sharing and information display, search folders, colored flags, [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] authentication, [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] over [[HTTP]], and ''Cached Exchange'' mode. Another key benefit of [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook 2003]] is the improved [[junk mail]] filter. [[Graphics tablet|Tablet]] and pen support was introduced in the productivity applications. [[Microsoft Word|Word 2003]] introduced a ''reading layout'' view, document comparison, better change-tracking and annotation/reviewing, a Research Task Pane, voice comments and an [[Microsoft Office XML formats|XML-based format]] among other features. [[Microsoft Excel|Excel 2003]] introduced list commands, some statistical functions and XML data import, analysis and transformation/document customization features. [[Microsoft Access|Access 2003]] introduced a backup command, the ability to view object dependencies, error checking in forms and reports among other features.

Office 2003 features improvements to [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|smart tags]] such as smart tag Lists, which are defined in XML, by using regular expressions and an extended type library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devx.com/codemag/Article/18232 Using Smart Tags in Office 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Smart tag recognizers were added to [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and [[Microsoft Access|Access]]. [[Microsoft FrontPage|FrontPage 2003]] introduced conditional formatting, ''Find and Replace'' for HTML elements, new tools for creating and formatting tables and cells, dynamic templates ([[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]]), [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] support, [[WebDAV]] and [[SharePoint]] publishing among other features. Publisher 2003 introduced a Generic Color PostScript printer driver for commercial printing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher-help/install-the-generic-color-ps-for-commercial-printing-printer-driver-HP001046429.aspx|title=Install the Generic Color PS for Commercial Printing printer driver|publisher=Microsoft|language=English|accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information Rights Management]] capabilities were introduced in document productivity applications to limit access to a set of users and/or restrict types of actions that users could perform. Support for [[managed code]] add-ins as [[Visual Studio Tools for Office|VSTO]] solutions was introduced.

Office 2003 is the last version of [[Microsoft Office|Office]] to include several features such as fully customizable [[toolbar]]s and menus for all of its applications, the [[Office Assistant]], the ability to [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstream]] [[service pack]]s into the original setup files, [[Office Web Components]], ''Save My Settings Wizard'', allowing users to choose whether to keep a locally cached copy of installation source files and several utility [[Resource Kit|resource kit]] tools. It is also the last Office version to support [[Windows 2000]]. A new picture organizer with basic editing features, called [[Microsoft Office Picture Manager]] replaced [[Microsoft Photo Editor]]. Because [[WinHelp]] has been deprecated, context-sensitive help (What's This help) is removed in Office 2003.&lt;ref&gt; [http://blogs.msdn.com/apblog/archive/2005/05/20/420590.aspx Deprecating WinHelp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only basic clipart and templates were included on the disc media, with most content hosted online and downloadable from within the Office application. Microsoft advertised [[Office Online]] as a major Office 2003 feature &quot;outside the box&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA010873071033.aspx The newest feature of Office isn't in the box--it's on the Web]&lt;/ref&gt; Office Online provides how-to articles, tips, training courses, templates, clip art, stock photos and media and downloads (including Microsoft and third-party extensibility add-ins for Microsoft Office programs).

The last cumulative update for Office 2003, Service Pack 3 resolves several compatibility and stability issues with [[Windows Vista]] and later operating systems. Mainstream support for Office 2003 application ended in April 2009 and extended support ends in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9131051/Microsoft_to_limit_Office_2003_support Microsoft to limit Office 2003 support], ComputerWorld&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enterprise features ==
Office 2003 features broad [[XML]] integration (designing customized XML schemas, importing and transforming XML data) throughout resulting in a far more data-centric model (instead of a document-based one). The [[MSXML]] 5 library was introduced specifically for Office's XML integration. Office 2003 also has tight [[SharePoint]] integration to facilitate data exchange, collaborated workflow and publishing. InfoPath was introduced for collecting data in XML-based forms and templates based on information from databases.
