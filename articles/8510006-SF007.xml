'''InfraRecorder''' is an [[open source]] [[Optical disc authoring|CD and DVD writing]] program for [[Microsoft Windows]]. First started by Christian Kindahl in the [[Google Summer of Code]] 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/soc/2006/winlibre/appinfo.html?csaid=C6CB0DCBBB4F5CB8 |title=Application Information |accessdate=2008-04-04 |publisher=[[Google Code]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; InfraRecorder uses the [[cdrtools]] software library to perform the actual burning.

Since 0.46, InfraRecorder is released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] 3 and is [[free software]]. In November 2007, [[CNET]] rated InfraRecorder the best free alternative to commercial DVD burning software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029471,49294100-9,00.htm Open-source software rated: Ten alternatives you need - Page 9], By Nate Lanxon on 19 November 2007, Crave at CNET UK&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
InfraRecorder supports disk rewriting and dual-layer DVDs. InfraRecorder can also burn a disc from an [[ISO image]] file. This program is completely portable on the Windows operating system.

As of version 0.40, InfraRecorder offers features similar to most CD- and DVD-authoring software, including the creation and burning of data and audio disc images, the ability to work with rewritable and multisession discs, and the ability to extract [[WAV]] and [[ISO image]] files from discs. One can also use the [[LAME]] [[MP3]] encoder to save [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Audio CD]] tracks.

InfraRecorder is available in a version that will run natively on 64-bit versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]; however, this version doesn't include an [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]] decoder or libsnd library due to compilation difficulties with [[MinGW]] on the 64-bit Windows platform.
