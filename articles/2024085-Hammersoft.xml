{{compactTOC}}

==0â9==
===3-D glasses===
[[File:Anaglyph glasses.png|thumb|right|[[Anaglyph image|Anaglyphic]] 3D glasses are used as detectors for radiation created by the Void in the world of ''Doctor Who'']]
The [[Tenth Doctor]] used red-blue [[anaglyph image|anaglyphic]] 3D lenses to examine the Void ship and the &quot;ghosts&quot; in &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot;. The glasses enable the wearer to see the &quot;[[List of Doctor Who planets#Others|Void Stuff]]&quot;, background radiation from the Void which surrounds and infuses an object or person that has crossed between parallel universes.

===500 year diary===
First appears in the [[Second Doctor]] serial ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]''

===900 year diary===
Seen among the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s belongings in the [[TARDIS]] in the [[Doctor Who (1996)|''Doctor Who'' television movie]].

==A==
===Anti-oil===
A red coloured liquid used to clog machinery or gears. The [[Tenth Doctor]] uses a wine glass full of multi-grade anti-oil to immobilise the clockwork androids in &quot;[[The Girl in the Fireplace]]&quot;.

===Anti-plastic===
A blue liquid that the [[Ninth Doctor]] carries as a weapon against the living plastic body of the [[Auton|Nestene Consciousness]] in &quot;[[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]]&quot;. It appears to break down plastics chemically, without any effect on other materials.

===Anti-Regeneration Gun===
In &quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot;, [[Martha Jones]] claims that the [[Torchwood Institute]] and [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|U.N.I.T.]] created a gun and four phials of coloured chemicals, which, when slotted into the gun and injected into a Time Lord, will kill the Time Lord and prevent [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]]. After the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] destroys the gun with his [[#L|laser screwdriver]], Martha reveals that the weapon is a fake, a ruse to conceal her actual mission and to engineer her return to the ''Valiant''.

===Archangel Network===
A worldwide mobile phone satellite [[cellular network|network]] (composed of fifteen satellites) seen in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, the Archangel network creates a global low-level telepathic field which allows the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] to subtly influence the behaviour of the world's human population. It was first used to convince a substantial number of the British public to vote for his [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Mr Saxon|Mr. Saxon]] personaâindividuals not affected included [[Clive Jones]] and Vivian Rook. It was later used to keep most of the human race afraid of the Master. The network also masks the Master's Time Lord nature from the Doctor. In &quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot;, the Doctor uses the network to channel the combined psychic energy of the entire human race, after Martha had convinced them to think of the Doctor by name at the same moment.

===Astral Map===
A device which the [[First Doctor]] has on board the [[TARDIS]]. In ''[[The Web Planet]]'', the Doctor was going to use his Astral Map to help the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Zarbi|Zarbi]] &quot;queen&quot; find the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Menoptra|Menoptra]] &quot;invasion force&quot;.

==B==
===Bazoolium===
A metal that Rose Tyler gives to her mother in &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot;. It can be used to predict the weather, warming up when it will be hot and cooling down when it is about to rain.

===Black Scrolls of [[Rassilon]]===
From ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', these contain forbidden knowledge from the Dark Time of [[Gallifrey]], the home of the [[Time Lord]]s. Their discovery falsely implicates the [[Castellan (Doctor Who)|Castellan]] in the abductions of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] and others.

===Biodamper===
An item intended to screen the wearer from certain kinds of detection. A biodamper resembling a ring is placed on [[Donna Noble]]'s finger in &quot;[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]&quot;, but [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] later realises it is ineffective, because Donna had been infused with [[List of Doctor Who items#Huon particles|Huon particles]].

===Blue crystal===
In ''[[The Green Death]]'', the Third Doctor takes a perfect blue [[crystal]] from the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#M|Metebelis Three]], which has the ability to focus and amplify thoughts. He gives it to [[Jo Grant]] as a wedding present, but she sends it back to him in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'', setting in motion a series of events that end with the Doctor's regeneration. In ''[[Destiny of the Doctors]]'', the Doctor had a similar crystal hidden in a [[greenhouse]] within his [[TARDIS]]. Graak had to find it and give it to [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] in order to continue his quest to save the seven incarnations of the Doctor.

==C==
===Celery===
The [[Fifth Doctor]] wears a sprig of [[celery]] in his lapel. He claims that he is allergic to certain gases in the praxis range. If those gases were present, the sprig would turn purple, whereupon he would eat it. Actor [[Peter Davison]] asked for this explanation to be included in ''[[The Caves of Androzani]]'' as it was his final story. It was referred to later in the same story by the Doctor as &quot;a powerful restorative where I come from...&quot;  The Doctor first affixes the celery in ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'', and replaces it in ''[[Enlightenment (Doctor Who)|Enlightenment]]''. The Tenth Doctor teases his earlier self about the celery (referring to it as a &quot;decorative vegetable&quot;) in the [[Children in Need]] special &quot;[[Time Crash]]&quot; (2007). A piece of plastic celery from the series fetched Â£5,500 for charity when it was sold at auction in November, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Chameleon Arch===
The Chameleon Arch is a device that rewrites every cell of an individual to a specific species. The conversion, which causes extreme pain, also provides a set of false memories to match the new persona. The [[Tenth Doctor]] uses it in &quot;[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]&quot;, enabling him to hide from the [[Family of Blood]] in 1913 as the school teacher, John Smith. He retains a small amount of &quot;residual awareness&quot;, resulting in dreams about his life before the change. The Chameleon Arch stores the Doctor's Time Lord identity in a [[#F|fob watch]] that slots into the device as it is operated. In &quot;[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]&quot;, Martha discovers that [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] used the same process, generating &quot;Professor Yana&quot; as his persona.

===Chameleon circuit===
{{Redirect|Chameleon circuit|the rock band|Chameleon Circuit (band)}}

A component of a [[TARDIS]] which allows it to change shape to match its surroundings and remain inconspicuous. The circuit on the Doctor's TARDIS has malfunctioned, leaving it stuck in the shape of a 1960s-style British [[police box]]. Attempts to repair the circuit have led to unpredictable results, including the TARDIS taking on the form of a pipe-organ (on which the Doctor plays a few notes of [[J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D minor]]''). Since these episodes, the Doctor has said that he has become fond of the police box form, and so has stopped trying to repair it. The TARDISes owned by [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], [[Rani (Doctor Who)|the Rani]], and the [[Meddling Monk]] had fully functioning chameleon circuits. In [[Doctor Who (series 1)|series one]] episode &quot;[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]&quot;, the [[Ninth Doctor]] explains to [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] and [[Mickey Smith]] about the chameleon circuit and why the TARDIS has been &quot;permanently&quot; imaged as a police box. In the episode &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, when [[Donna Noble]] has the Doctor's knowledge in her head due to an instantaneous biological metacrisis, she starts to tell the [[Tenth Doctor]] how he can fix the chameleon circuit, but does not finish before the knowledge in her head overwhelms her. The [[Eleventh Doctor]] explains to [[Amy Pond]] (set between &quot;[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Beast Below]]&quot; in a deleted scene featured on the [[Doctor Who (series 5)|Series 5]] Boxset special ''Meanwhile in the TARDIS'') that the TARDIS takes a 12-dimensional scan of the surrounding area and determines what the best thing to turn itself into is, then it changes into a 1960s police box. Despite the fact that the circuit is broken, the TARDIS can still turn invisible as shown in &quot;[[The Impossible Astronaut]]&quot;.

===Charged Vacuum Emboitment===
Abbreviated CVE, this is part of a system created by the mathematicians of [[List of Doctor Who planets#L|Logopolis]] to allow the universe to survive past its point of [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] by shunting excess [[entropy]] into other universes (''[[Logopolis]]''). The Fourth Doctor and Romana unwittingly travel through a CVE into a parallel universe known as E-Space at the start of ''[[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]]''.

===Chronon Loop===
An energy ring used by the [[Daleks|Dalek]] to withdraw power from inside the [[TARDIS]] during the Tenth Doctor episode &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;.

===Cloister bell===
An alarm that tolls, in the manner of a heavy church bell, in the TARDIS to warn the crew of impending disaster. It usually signifies a problem with the fabric of reality, such as a [[temporal paradox|paradox]] or [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative realities]] bleeding together. First heard in ''[[Logopolis]]'', it rings again in ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'', ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'', [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|the 1996 television movie]], the [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|2005 Children in Need special]], &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, &quot;[[Time Crash]]&quot;, &quot;[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Waters of Mars]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Doctor's Wife (Doctor Who)|The Doctor's Wife]]&quot;, and [[The_God_Complex|&quot;The God Complex&quot;.]]

The commentary on the ''Logopolis'' DVD says that the sound of the bell was produced by lowering a gong into a vat of water to deaden the reverberation.

===Compression field===
A device worn around the necks of the [[Slitheen]] so they may shrink themselves down slightly, allowing them to fit in the [[#S|skinsuits]] of people slightly smaller than they are. It causes the release of pent-up energy in a manner that mimics [[flatulence]]. In ''[[The Lost Boy (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Lost Boy]]'', the Slitheen use an improved version of this technology which allowed them to disguise themselves in smaller bodies.
Also, in Season 6, the Teselecta used a compression field to fit hundreds of people in a robot of human size.

===Coronet of Rassilon===
Worn by [[Borusa]] in ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', it allows the wearer to impose his will on others, though it can be resisted.

===Crystal of Kronos===
From the Third Doctor serial ''[[The Time Monster]]'', this is used by the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] to power his [[#T|TOMTIT]] machine, but turns out to be much more powerful.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}
{{-}}

==D==
===Data Ghost===
A Data Ghost is a short-lived imprint of the consciousness of the user of a Lux Industries spacesuit, created at the moment of death by the suit's built-in communications unit, which links to the user's nervous system to allow thought-based communication. The concept first appeared in &quot;[[Silence in the Library]]&quot;, when a member of Professor [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song's]] archaeology team, Miss Evangelista, is killed by a swarm of [[Vashta Nerada]]. Consciousness remains active in the device for a few minutes, and then the individual's last thought repeats in a loop until the device is shut down. In &quot;[[Forest of the Dead]]&quot;, the Doctor finds out that the [[sonic screwdriver]] he gave to Professor Song in the future contains a neural relay that stored her data ghost into the device when she died rescuing the 4022 people trapped inside the library's computer. He uses the screwdriver to store her Data Ghost in the computer, whereupon she is &quot;resurrected&quot; and can live on forever inside the computer, along with Miss Evangelista and the other members of her team who were killed by the Vashta Nerada.

===Dalekanium===
The material out of which Dalek casing is made. It is first mentioned in the First Doctor serial ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'', and is also referenced in ''[[Day of the Daleks]]'' and &quot;[[Daleks in Manhattan]]&quot;.

===Dalek-enhanced [[Thompson submachine gun]]s===
As seen in &quot;[[Evolution of the Daleks]]&quot;, the [[Dalek variants#Daleks in Manhattan and Evolution of the Daleks|Dalek Humans]] used these weapons to kill Dalek Thay and Dalek Jast. They function in the same manner as a standard Dalek weapon, but seem to be inferior in terms of firepower. These also appear in the opening montage to the [[Torchwood]] season 2 episode &quot;[[Adam (Torchwood)|Adam]]&quot;.
{{-}}

===Deadlock seal===
A deadlock seal is a type of locking mechanism introduced in &quot;[[Bad Wolf]]&quot; that sonic devices, such as the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[sonic screwdriver]], cannot open. Deadlock seals are often used as a plot device to prevent the Doctor from using his sonic screwdriver to easily escape or otherwise defeat his opponents. The [[TARDIS]] can also be deadlocked, preventing entry even with a key; it does not, however, prevent the sonic screwdriver from interfering with the ship itself; in &quot;[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]&quot;, the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] exploited this to steal the Doctor's TARDIS.

===Decadron Crucible===
As seen in ''[[Pyramids of Mars]]'', a decadron crucible is a temporary containment device that materialises around an unsuspecting person. It looks like a large, [[acrylic glass]] cylinder with air vents for the victim. The device has two switches on the frontâboth shut off the device, but only one does so without killing the occupant.

===Delta Wave===
A [[delta wave]] is a [[Electroencephalography|brain wave]] associated with deep sleep. The Fifth Doctor builds a delta wave augmenter in ''[[Kinda (Doctor Who)|Kinda]]'' to help [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] sleep.  In &quot;[[The Parting of the Ways]]&quot;, the Ninth Doctor builds a delta wave projector to use against the [[Dalek]]s, but does not activate it. The projector generates a wave of &quot;Van Cassadyne energy&quot; that will destroy the brain patterns of all living creatures within its field of effect; given the time constraints it could not be adjusted to affect only the Daleks.

===De-mat gun===
A Time Lord weapon from the serial ''[[The Invasion of Time]]'' that can remove its target from [[space-time]] altogether. It cannot be armed without the [[#G|Great Key of Rassilon]].

=== Defabricator ===
A device used by androids Trin-ee and Zu-zana in &quot;[[Bad Wolf]]&quot; to disintegrate [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]]'s clothes. Jack later modifies it to make a gun capable of destroying a Dalek.

===Dimensional Stabiliser===
A component of TARDIS circuitry that bridges between the outerplasmic shell and the internal space of the ship's interior. In  ''[[The Armageddon Factor]]'', the dimensional stabiliser is used to shrink the Doctor and Drax.

===Dimension Vault===
A piece of Dalek technology stolen by the Cybermen, they used it to escape the Void; it is covered with Dalek bumps and contains a gun. The gun needs to be charged for some time before it can be used. The Doctor uses the Dimension Vault's gun in &quot;[[The Next Doctor]]&quot; to teleport the Cyberking into the time vortex to break apart safely.

===Doomsday Weapon===
In the serial ''[[Colony in Space]]'' the Time Lords sent the [[Third Doctor]] on a mission to recover this weapon, the plans for which the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] had stolen from [[Gallifrey]].

===Dwarf-star alloy===
A super-dense material obtained from [[white dwarf]] stars in the serial ''[[Warriors' Gate]]''. It is used as a building material in the hulls of spaceships and can also be used to contain temporally sensitive beings. In &quot;[[The Family of Blood]]&quot;, the Doctor imprisoned Father of Mine in chains made of this material. In &quot;[[Day of the Moon]]&quot;, the Doctor is trapped by the FBI in a prison made of dwarf-star alloy, only to escape when the TARDIS de-cloaks in the prison, revealing its presence there from the beginning as the prison was built around it.

===Dynatrope===
In ''[[The Krotons]]'', a machine created by the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Kroton|Krotons]] that transforms mental power and intelligence into energy.

==E==
===Edible ball bearings===
In &quot;[[Fear Her]]&quot; the [[Tenth Doctor]] admits that edible ball bearingsâsilver [[dragÃ©e]]sâare amazing and that no other species in the universe has created such a thing. At the end of the episode Rose gives him a cupcake decorated with silver dragÃ©es.

===EMP unit===
A cylindrical device used in &quot;[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]&quot;, taken from Bannakaffalatta's [[cyborg]] body as the only effective weapon against [[List of Doctor Who robots#H|the Host]]. It produces an [[electromagnetic pulse]] which neutralises the robots, but must be periodically recharged. A similar device, built as a grenade, appears in the episode &quot;[[The Age of Steel]]&quot;, where it serves to neutralise a [[Cyberman]]. The EMP inadvertently disables the Cyberman's emotional inhibitor, allowing it to remember who it was prior to conversion. This led the Tenth Doctor to deactivate the robot body and kill the victim with the sonic screwdriver.

===Everlasting matches===
Everlasting matches first appeared in the Target novelisation ''[[The Daleks#In print|Doctor Who and the Daleks]]'', in which the [[First Doctor]] states that they are &quot;an invention of his&quot;. They subsequently appeared in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Sanctuary (Doctor Who)|Sanctuary]]'', the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''[[Venusian Lullaby]]'' and the [[Telos Publishing]] novellas ''[[Time and Relative]]'' and ''[[The Cabinet of Light]]''. The latter includes a brand name Promethean Everlasting Matches, made by the Eternity Perpetual Company (which also made the everlasting generators in ''[[Carnival of Monsters]]'').

The Doctor carries a box of everlasting matches in the [[New Series Adventures]] novels ''[[The Resurrection Casket]]'' and ''[[The Nightmare of Black Island]]''. In ''The Resurrection Casket'' he explains they are made from Umbeka wood, which comes from the planet Umbeka, where winter lasts for centuries, and the summer is very hot and only last a couple of weeks. The heat from the flame makes the wood grow as fast as the flame consumes it, so the match never burns down.

===Eye of Harmony===
{{Main|Eye of Harmony}}
The Eye of Harmony is an artificially created black hole made by Omega, used by the Time Lords as a power source for time travel.

==F==
===Field Gravity Detector===
A [[yo yo]] used by the [[Fourth Doctor]] to determine the presence, magnitude, and direction of gravity in a given area.

===Firestone===
The jewel in a necklace from &quot;[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]&quot;, connected to the Vespiform. [[Donna Noble]] threw the firestone into a lake, drowning the Vespiform as it followed. An additional &quot;monster file&quot; on the BBC's Doctor Who website revealed the firestone was found in the lake, and sold at [[auction]] to [[Jack Harkness|a gentleman in a greatcoat]].

===Fob watch===
{{See also|#Watch|l1=Watch}}
A [[pocket watch|fob watch]], engraved with Gallifreyan symbols, used to store the memories and biology of a Time Lord who uses the [[#C|Chameleon Arch]]. The watch uses a [[#P|perception filter]] to prevent the transformed Time Lord from noticing it. Those with [[telepathy|telepathic abilities]] are apparently immune to the filter, as are those already aware of the watch's nature. The [[List of Doctor Who villains#F|Family of Blood]] can smell the Time Lord stored within the watch. When opened by the Time Lord, it restores their original physiology. Anyone else opening it gets flashes of the memories stored within. Professor Yana had a similar fob watch; when he opened it, he recalled his identity as the Master. In the [[The Next Doctor|2008 Christmas Special]], &quot;The Next Doctor&quot; ([[David Morrissey]]) is discovered to own a fob watch, which the Doctor suspected to be a Time Lord watch. It is revealed to be an ordinary fob watch, and helped identify Jackson Lake as a normal human.

==G==
===Ganymede driver===

A device from the Fourth Doctor's toolbox that he requests from Sarah Jane Smith at the end of &quot;The Hand of Fear&quot;.

===Gas mask===
A gas mask from &quot;[[The Empty Child]]&quot;. Jamie was wearing a gas mask when he was killed. The [[#N|nanogenes]] repaired Jamie's body, but without a proper human template, considered the gas mask part of the child. The nanogenes then replicated gas masks, along with Jamie's other injuries, as part of anyone else with whom Jamie came in contact.

===Genesis Ark===
A Dalek-shaped prison ship created by the Time Lords to store millions of captured Daleks, introduced in &quot;[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]&quot;. Like the TARDIS, it is bigger on the inside, and can contain millions of prisoners, but the outside is only large enough to release one Dalek at a time. It is sucked into the Void after the Doctor opens the breach.

===Giant brain===
A creation of the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] in ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', it was linked to the minds of several geniuses, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Louis Pasteur]], and [[Pierre Curie]].

A giant brain also appears in the 2008 episode &quot;[[Planet of the Ood]]&quot;; in this case, it is part of the [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] mind of the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Ood|Ood]].

===Grachtian statue===
An important symbol to the family of [[List of Doctor Who villains#Count Grendel|Count Grendel]] in ''[[The Androids of Tara]]''. It was one of the disguised pieces of [[The Key to Time]].

===Gravitron===
A device installed on the [[Moon]] in the 21st century to control Earth's weather. In ''[[The Moonbase]]'', the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] attempted to gain control of the device in an attempt to destroy Earth. The [[Second Doctor]] managed to stop the Cybermen by using the Gravitron to send them and their ships into space.

===Gravity globe===
Gravity globes, or grav globes, are small balls that can be thrown or kicked in the air. Once in the air, they will illuminate and float. If opened, anti-gravity material spills out everywhere, causing anything it touches to not be affected by gravity for a short period of time. [[The Eleventh Doctor]] used this property of the anti-matter to get to the Byzantium, which was 30 feet above him, in &quot;[[The Time of Angels]]&quot;.

===Great Key of Rassilon===
A constituent part of the [[#D|De-mat gun]], its location is known only to the Chancellor of the High Council of Time Lords. It is not to be confused with the [[#K|Key of Rassilon]] or the [[#R|Rod of Rassilon]], also known as the Great Key.

===Great Seal of Diplos===
Seen in ''[[The Stones of Blood]]'', an important artefact stolen by the criminal Cessair of Diplos. It was one of the disguised pieces of [[The Key to Time]].

==H==
===Hallucinogenic Lipstick===
[[River Song (Doctor Who)|Doctor River Song]] in &quot;[[The Time of Angels]]&quot; uses a hallucinogenic lipstick to confuse a guard at the ''Byzantium''. She uses it again in &quot;[[The Pandorica Opens]]&quot; to escape the Stormcage prison facility, and once more in the same episode to fool several fake romans into thinking she's Cleopatra.

===Hand of Eldrad===
In the Fourth Doctor serial ''[[The Hand of Fear]]'', the hand was the only surviving part of the Kastrian creature Eldrad, found by the Doctor and Sarah in an English quarry.

===Hand of Omega===
{{Main|Hand of Omega}}
The Hand of Omega is a device which can collapse a star into a black hole. Omega supposedly used this device in order to harness the energy and negative continuum inside it to enable time travel. It could also be used to destroy entire star systems due to it being able to take out the magnetic fields surrounding atoms. The counteraction of this device occurs in the seventh doctor story ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.

===Harp of Rassilon===
In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', one of the many artefacts with Rassilon's name on it, the Harp of Rassilon is accompanied by a painting that shows [[Rassilon]] himself playing it. Playing the tune on the [[sheet music]] in the painting unlocks a secret door leading to the [[#T|Time Scoop]] controls.

===Home Box===
A box on board advanced starships, such as the Byzantium, which record everything that happens on board; it is jettisoned back to the place where it was launched if the ship crashes. It was originally seen in the episode &quot;[[The Time of Angels]]&quot;. It is equivalent to a &quot;[[flight recorder|Black Box]]&quot; in modern aviation. The Doctor steals this home box to find Doctor River Song, as it has ''Hello Sweetie'' written on it in Old High Gallifreyan as a message to the Doctor.

===Huon particles===
Ancient particles from the Dark Times. They are potentially deadly and contain a great amount of energy. Huon particles will attract other sets of Huon particles, causing infused people or objects to teleport. A remnant of Huon particles exist in the heart of the TARDIS. Huon particles were destroyed by the Time Lords, but the queen of the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Racnoss|Racnoss]] developed technology to make her own as revealed in &quot;[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]&quot;. They were also mentioned by [[Jack Harkness]] in [[The Blood Line]].

===Hymetusite===
A crystalline substance in ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]''. The crystals provide power for spaceships and cities.

===Hypersonic sound wave manipulator===
A genetic manipulation device created by Professor Richard Lazarus in the &quot;[[The Lazarus Experiment]]&quot; to reverse ageing. The 76-year-old professor becomes a young man after using the manipulator, but the process awakens dormant genes, causing him to mutate into a monstrous, scorpion-like creature, capable of extracting the life force from humans. Funding for the project was provided by [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Mr Saxon|Mr Saxon]] who is later revealed to be [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. The technology is later incorporated into his weapon which he calls a [[#L|laser screwdriver]] in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot; and is used to incapacitate the Doctor by ageing him.

==I==
===Ice gun===
A [[fire extinguisher]] used by the [[Tenth Doctor]] to immobilise the [[List of Doctor Who robots#Clockwork androids|Clockwork androids]] in &quot;[[The Girl in the Fireplace]]&quot;. The name &quot;ice gun&quot; was suggested by [[Mickey Smith]]. The Doctor called it a fire extinguisher. According to Clarke, speaking in the ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode &quot;From Zero to Hero&quot;, the art department labelled them with the warning &quot;Do not use to cool drinks, freeze food, win arguments, or create Christmas grotto decorations.&quot;
{{-}}

===Info-stamp===

Info-stamps are storage devices created by the Daleks. Cybermen that escaped the Void used stolen info-stamps containing information about many subjects, including the Doctor. When [[Jackson Lake (Doctor Who)|Jackson Lake]] (&quot;[[The Next Doctor]]&quot;) looked into an info-stamp, details about the Doctor were embedded in his memory and he came to believe he was the Doctor's next incarnation. The info-stamp backfired, leading the Cybermen to also believe that Lake was the Doctor. Info-stamps can be used as weapons by removing the cover and releasing an [[electromagnetic pulse]].

==J==
===Jacenite===
A mineral in ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]''. It can be used to power a weapon that can stun or kill a Nimon.

===Jammie Dodger===
A jam-filled biscuit the [[Eleventh Doctor]] used to prevent his extermination in &quot;[[Victory of the Daleks]]&quot;. The [[Jammie Dodger]] was portrayed as a TARDIS self-destruct button, but the New Paradigm Daleks eventually saw through the trick and then the Doctor ate the biscuit.

===Janis thorn===
A poisonous weapon of the Sevateem, used by [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]]. Seen in ''[[The Face of Evil]]'' and ''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'', and mentioned (but not seen) in ''[[The Pirate Planet]]''.

===Jathaa beam weapon===
A weapon reverse-engineered from a ship called the &quot;Jathaa sunglider&quot; is first seen in &quot;[[The Christmas Invasion]]&quot; (2005), where it is a powerful beam weapon used to wipe out a [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Sycorax|Sycorax]] ship. [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood One]] director [[List of Doctor Who villains#Yvonne Hartman|Yvonne Hartman]] first tells the Doctor the origins of the weapon in &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot; (2006). A scaled down version of the weapon is seen in &quot;[[The Poison Sky]]&quot; (2008) aboard [[UNIT]]'s aircraft carrier [[List of Doctor Who vehicles#Valiant|''Valiant'']], and is used to attack a [[Sontaran]] stronghold.

===Jelly babies===
[[Image:Jelly babies.jpg|thumb|100px|Jelly babies]]
[[Jelly baby|Jelly babies]] are a confectionery favoured by a few versions of the Doctor. The [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] is also seen eating jelly babies in the &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;. Both the Doctor and the Master are seen offering them to other people. A Ganger version of the [[Eleventh Doctor]] from &quot;[[The Almost People]]&quot; tries to cope with his past [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerations]], speaking with the [[Fourth Doctor]]'s voice and quoting, &quot;Would you like a jelly baby?&quot;

===Jethrik===
An extremely valuable mineral. A small piece can power an entire fleet of battleships. One of the pieces of [[The Key to Time]] was disguised as a lump of Jethrik in ''[[The Ribos Operation]]''.

===''A Journal of Impossible Things''===
A [[Dream journal|dream diary]], containing notes and sketches by the [[Tenth Doctor]]'s human persona, John Smith, in &quot;[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Family of Blood]]&quot;. The title is handwritten on the journal's first page. Referred to by Smith as &quot;stories&quot;, it is shown on screen as scribbled words and what appear to be charcoal pencil sketches, recording what Smith remembers from dreams about his adventures as the Doctor. Joan Redfern retains the ''Journal'' at the end of &quot;The Family of Blood&quot;, and it is eventually published in 2009 by her granddaughter in ''[[The End of Time]]''.

One two-page spread contains illustrations of all ten Doctors to date, as seen on a [[flash animation]] on the BBC web site at the time of &quot;The Family of Blood&quot; air date. The drawings seen on screen in &quot;Human Nature&quot; are of the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Doctors, the first time each has been depicted in the revived series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fact File HN&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_308.shtml Human Nature] at Doctor Who â Fact File&lt;/ref&gt; The journal also features sketches of the [[TARDIS]] interior and exterior, a [[sonic screwdriver]], the [[Torchwood Institute]] logo, [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], [[Rose Tyler]], [[Auton]]s, clockwork androids, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], [[Dalek]]s, the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Moxx of Balhoon|Moxx of Balhoon]], gas-masked people from &quot;[[The Empty Child]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Doctor Dances]]&quot;, and the [[Slitheen]].

The text includes repeated phrases describing key concepts (such as 'magic box', referring to the TARDIS), along with many misspellings. One repeated phrase, 'bigger inside than outside', also appears in Latin as: 'Maius Intra Qua Extra'. The ''Journal'' prop was created by artist Kellyanne Walker, and incorporates text provided by writer [[Paul Cornell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fact File FB&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_309.shtml The Family of Blood] at Doctor Who â Fact File&lt;/ref&gt;

==K==
===Key of Rassilon===
A Gallifreyan artefact that allows access to the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]], the repository of all [[Time Lord]] knowledge. It is kept by the Keeper of the Matrix. Not to be confused with the [[#G|Great Key of Rassilon]] or the [[#R|Rod of Rassilon]].

===Key to Time===
{{Main|The Key to Time}}

===[[Koh-i-Noor]] Diamond===
A large diamond that had been re-cut several times for use as an element in a telescopic device designed to focus a beam of moonlight to trap and eventually destroy the physical form of a [[Werewolf (Doctor Who)|Werewolf]] in &quot;[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]&quot;.

==L==
===Laser screwdriver===
A weapon used by [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot; which resembles the Doctor's [[sonic screwdriver]]. It can kill with a directed laser beam or artificially age a target (provided the device has a blueprint of the victims biological code).

===Laser spanner===
A device which was owned by the Doctor until it was stolen by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], whom the Doctor referred to as a &quot;cheeky woman&quot;. [[Martha Jones]] initially believed she had coined the term as a joke upon being introduced to the sonic screwdriver.

==M==
===Magnaclamp===
Clamps that negate the weight of items to which they are attached, allowing a person to easily lift something weighing several tons. They appeared in &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot; and &quot;[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]&quot;, as property of the Torchwood Institute. In &quot;Doomsday&quot;, the [[Tenth Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] use these clamps to attach themselves to the walls of Torchwood One to prevent themselves from being sucked into the [[List of Doctor Who planets#Others|Void]] along with the [[Dalek]] and [[Cyberman]] armies.

===Matrix===
{{Main|Matrix (Doctor Who)}}

===Mechanical mouse===
In &quot;[[The Doctor's Daughter]]&quot;, the [[Tenth Doctor]] takes a grey clockwork mouse from his pocket and uses it to distract a guard.

===Melkur===
In ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'', Melkurs are evil beings turned into statues when they arrive on the planet [[Traken]]. The statue featured in the serial is revealed to be the Master's TARDIS.

===Mercury fluid links===
In ''[[The Daleks]]'', the First Doctor claims tubes filled with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are required to make the TARDIS work. The fluid links malfunction again in ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'', this time producing toxic mercury vapour.

===Mergin nut===

A device from the Doctor's toolbox that he requests from Sarah Jane Smith at the end of &quot;The Hand of Fear.&quot;

===Miniscope===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cyberman]] --&gt;
In the Third Doctor serial ''[[Carnival of Monsters]]'' the Doctor found an active miniscope in the hands of the Lurman entertainers Vorg and Shirna on the planet Inter Minor. Their miniscope included Drashigs, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], and humans on board a ship. Its use as a peep show containing various creatures is outlawed.
{{-}}

===Molecular disseminator===
An experimental means of interstellar [[teleportation]] accidentally used to send the First Doctor and his companions from Earth to Kembel in ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]''.

==N==
===Nanogenes===
[[Nanorobotics|Nanotechnological]] robots which can heal damaged tissue. They are Chula technology, seen in &quot;[[The Empty Child]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Doctor Dances]]&quot;. The nanogenes are designed to heal soldiers and ready them for battle, making them [[List of Doctor Who items#O|Om-com]] capable. Without a complete template for a species, the nanogenes restored the Jamie with a gas mask fused to his face, and replicate the gas mask and Jamie's other injuries to anyone Jamie touched.

===Nitro-9===
An explosive substance created and used by the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s companion [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]], often carried in her backpack in [[aerosol spray]] cans, despite the Doctor's warnings.

===Nova Device===
The [[Movellan]]s failed to destroy the [[Dalek]]s' homeworld of [[Skaro]] with this device in the serial ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]''.

==O==
===Om-Com===
A communications system used by Jack Harkness and the revived Jamie in &quot;[[The Empty Child]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Doctor Dances]]&quot;. It allows communication through anything with a speaker grille, even if the device is normally inoperable (such as the TARDIS's external police box phone).

===Opera glasses===
Small binoculars that the Doctor carries with him in the 2005 episode &quot;[[The Empty Child]]&quot;, and in the novel ''The Nightmare of Black Island''. In the latter, he uses them to gain a closer view of Ynis Du's lighthouse. The origin of the glasses is unknown; the fact that they are described as having &quot;computer-enhanced lenses&quot;  suggests they are a product of a future time.

===Osterhagen key===
The Osterhagen (an anagram of &quot;Earth's Gone&quot;) key is a priming device controlled by [[Unified Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] for a series of 25 nuclear warheads placed beneath the Earth's crust at strategic points, for use at a time when Earth's destruction is preferable to the alternative. Osterhagan stations are located in [[Alaska]], Argentina, China, Germany and [[Liberia]]. To be activated, at least three Osterhagen bases must be online. The key was given to [[Martha Jones]] by UNIT in &quot;[[The Stolen Earth (Doctor Who)|The Stolen Earth]]&quot;, but was lost when she was brought by [[teleportation|transmat]] on board the Dalek Crucible. Martha explained that the Osterhagen Key was to be used &quot;if the suffering of the human race was so great, so without hope, then it became the final option&quot;. The Doctor requested that Martha get rid of the Osterhagen system.

==P==
===Paradox machine===
Designed by the Master in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, the device is constructed from the Doctor's [[TARDIS]], centred around the main console with several large pipes leading into it, installed on the airborne aircraft carrier ''[[List of Doctor Who vehicles#Valiant|Valiant]]''. The paradox machine uses the power of the TARDIS to prevent the universe from collapsing under the inherent logical contradiction of a [[grandfather paradox]] when the Toclafane kill their ancestors, modern day humans. When destroyed, it has the effect of reversing time up to the point immediately before it was originally activated. Those in proximity of the &quot;[[Eye (cyclone)|eye of the storm]]&quot; of the device, the radius of which is at least sufficient to encompass the ''Valiant'', are immune to its effect. Jack Harkness destroyed the paradox machine with an assault rifle.

===Perception filter===
A perception filter is a field generated by a [[TARDIS]] that convinces people to ignore it, which in the case of the Doctor's TARDIS makes the normally anachronistic [[police box]] seem ordinary wherever it lands. The field extends to objects associated with the TARDIS, such as the keys used to open it. Perception filters can be added to other objects, such as the [[#F|fob watches]] used by the Doctor and the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] and the identity card often used by the doctor to establish a [[nom de plume]]. The TARDIS also imparts a perception filter to a stone slab near a fountain in Cardiff during the events of &quot;[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]&quot;, which [[Torchwood Institute#Torchwood Three, Cardiff|Torchwood Three]] has attached to an elevator. The field does not work if the object it surrounds draws too much attention to itself, or if someone is specifically searching for the object in question. Those with even minor [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities are also immune. In &quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot; Martha Jones uses the perception filter installed on her TARDIS Key to protect her from the Master's detection during the year he ruled the world. Also, in &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, it is presumed that Prisoner Zero placed a perception filter around an entire room in Amy Pond's house so not even she realises it's there. She becomes aware of it at the age of 19 after the Doctor returns and explicitly tells her that the room is there, which prompts Amy to realise that the room is indeed there. And is again mentioned in &quot;The Vampires of Venice&quot; when the Doctor explains the Countess and her 'vampires' wear one to appear human. In &quot;The Lodger&quot;, the entire second floor of Craig Owens' flat was masked with a perception filter. In this case however, everyone could see the second floor, but their knowledge had been changed due to the filter and made to think that the flat actually had two stories, where, in reality, it only had one.

The concept is similar to the [[Somebody Else's Problem field]] in [[Douglas Adams]]'s novel, ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''.

===Preacher gun (Mk II)===
A large energy gun, capable of causing a [[Dalek]] to explode. They were used by [[Jackie Tyler|Jackie]], [[Mickey Smith|Mickey]] and [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] in &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot; and &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;. They are likely an upgrade of the guns used by the Preachers in &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot;/&quot;[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]&quot;, which were unable to destroy a Dalek even when modified by the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] with the [[sonic screwdriver]].

===President's gauntlet===
A metal glove used by the Lord President of Gallifrey in &quot;[[The End of Time]]&quot;. It is used to disintegrate a female Time Lord when she goes against the wishes of the Lord President, and to revert the Master's actions, restoring the human race to normal.
When Rassilon held up the hand wearing the gauntlet (in the episisode The End Of Time) the Master, judging by the look on his face, immediately seemed to know what it was.

===Progenation machine===
A progenation machine is a device in &quot;[[The Doctor's Daughter]]&quot; that artificially produces a direct descendant of a donor. By taking a sample of the subject's [[diploid]] cells, it can split the cells into [[haploid]]s and rearrange them in a new configuration. The new DNA is then used to grow an adult subject within moments. The subject emerges fully clothed, and the machine can download knowledge directly into their brain, which in the episode is used to create trained soldiers. It is by this process that [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]], the Doctor's titular daughter, is created.

===Progenator===
A device used by the Daleks containing &quot;pure&quot; [[DNA]]. In &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, all Dalek saucers were destroyed, except one, which flew back in time to the 1940s in the Second World War, where one of the progenators was located. However, due to their adapted and changed DNA, the progenator would not recognise these Daleks as 'pure' or 'true' Daleks. The Daleks knew that the Doctor would come, so they devised a strategy so that the Daleks pretend to be Professor Bracewell's inventions (named 'Ironsides') for use in the war. In &quot;[[Victory of the Daleks]]&quot;, the Daleks tricked the Doctor, impelling him to bellow the truth, &quot;I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks&quot;, causing the Progenator to be activated by testimony. It created a new race of Daleks, the Paradigm Daleks, who eventually returned to the universe.

===Psychic credit card===
This item was used in the BBC novel ''[[Only Human (Doctor Who)|Only Human]]'' to open a bank account of half a million pounds sterling in balance for [[Jack Harkness]] and the Neanderthal named Das. According to Captain Jack in the novel, the psychic credit card was banned after the infinite recession of Bayfadarn.

===Psychic paper===
Described as &quot;slightly psychic&quot; paper and first appearing in the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Series 1 (2005)|2005 series]] episode &quot;[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]&quot;, psychic paper is an apparently blank prop kept in a credit card or travel pass holder. It allows those holding it to show people whatever they want to see on the card. It can apparently unlock electronic pass readers (&quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot;) and record transit fares (&quot;[[Planet of the Dead]]&quot;). [[Torchwood Institute]] personnel receive psychic training and are not susceptible to psychic paper. It apparently does not work on those of very high intelligence; [[William Shakespeare]] was shown the paper in &quot;[[The Shakespeare Code]]&quot; and commented that it was blank, which the Doctor notes as proof that Shakespeare is a genius. In the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip &quot;The First&quot;, [[Ernest Shackleton]] also sees the paper as blank, comparing it with an attempt to [[hypnosis|hypnotise]] him which had been equally ineffective.

In the [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[World Game (Doctor Who)|World Game]]'', it is said to be a then-recent invention of the [[Celestial Intervention Agency]]; if this is the case, then from [[List of Doctor Who serials#Series 1 (2005)|2005 series]] episode &quot;[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]&quot; it can be considered as one of the few Time Lord artefacts remaining (besides the TARDIS). 

The use of psychic paper and the results obtained seem to vary. In &quot;[[The Empty Child]]&quot;, [[Jack Harkness]] states that it is a &quot;tricky thing&quot; and Rose says that you &quot;can't let your mind wander when you're handing it over.&quot; Both he and Rose inadvertently give away private details about themselves when passing it between them. In &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;, the Doctor seems surprised when Queen Victoria says &quot;It states clearly here that you have been appointed by the [[Lord Provost]] as my protector.&quot;  In &quot;[[The Idiot's Lantern]]&quot;, the Doctor flashes the paper at a guard, and then has to look at it in order to tell Tommy that the guard thinks he's the [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King of Belgium]]. This is also shown in the [[New Series Adventures]] novel ''[[The Nightmare of Black Island]]'', in which the Doctor is unsure what another character saw, as there is no 'after-image'. At its introduction in &quot;[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]&quot;, the Ninth Doctor shows it to the steward while simultaneously stating what he wanted it to show. The steward's response of &quot;Well, obviously...,&quot;  gives the impression that when the person handing it over specifies what it should say, it does. The Tenth Doctor uses both methods in &quot;[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]&quot;, giving specifics to the Guard Captain, but letting Queen Victoria see what she needed. The paper appears in &quot;[[A Christmas Carol (Doctor Who)|A Christmas Carol]]&quot;, but fails to fool its target into believing that the Doctor is certified as being responsible. Instead, it displays wavy lines, and the Doctor comments, &quot;finally, a lie too big.&quot; 

Psychic paper is able to receive messages from throughout the universe, as shown in &quot;[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]&quot;, when the [[Face of Boe]] sends the Doctor a message, and again in &quot;[[Silence in the Library]]&quot;, where the Doctor receives a message from Professor River Song. In &quot;[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]&quot;, The Doctor also receives a message from the Atraxi to his psychic paper explaining that &quot;Prisoner Zero has escaped&quot; and prompting the Doctor to realise that Prisoner Zero had escaped through the crack in Amelia's wall. In the novel ''The Forgotten Army'', the Doctor is able to psychicly send messages to the psychic paper to tell Amy where he is. In &quot;[[Night Terrors (Doctor Who)|Night Terrors]]&quot;, the psychic paper receives a message from a distressed child to &quot;save [him] from the monsters&quot;, prompting the Doctor to &quot;make a [[house call]]&quot;.
{{-}}

==Q==
===Quantum Accelerator===
A TARDIS component, one of the items exchanged between the Master and the Doctor in ''[[Time-Flight]]''.

===Quantum Crystaliser===
A device featured in the audio drama ''[[Human Resources (Doctor Who)|Human Resources]]'' used by the [[Celestial Intervention Agency]] to control time over a small area. It uses [[Many-worlds interpretation|branching timelines]] to explore various possible futures and select the one it likes. Exposure to two Crystallisers causes dangerous instability, potentially leading to death.

==R==
===Randomiser===
The [[Fourth Doctor]] fitted this device to the [[TARDIS]] console in ''[[The Armageddon Factor]]'' to randomise his travel coordinates and prevent the [[Black Guardian]] from finding him. The Randomiser was removed from the TARDIS and left on the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Argolis]] in ''[[The Leisure Hive]]''. A similar process is seen in ''[[The Price of Paradise]]'', in which the Doctor uses the random shuffle function on Rose's MP3 player to select the TARDIS's destination, and the Doctor is able to &quot;set all the settings to random&quot; in the 2008 episode &quot;[[Planet of the Ood]]&quot;. The [[Eighth Doctor]] also fits a randomiser to his companion [[Compassion (Doctor Who)|Compassion]] in ''[[The Fall of Yquatine]]'' to stop her being traced by the [[Time Lords]].

===Record of Rassilon===
An accounting of a war fought between a Vampire race and the Time Lords. It is found on most Type-40 TARDISes. The Record consists of punchchards which when inserted into the TARDIS console will print out whatever was on the card. In the episode &quot;State of Decay&quot; the [[Fourth Doctor]] uses this Record to find out information about the war, the Vampire's weaknesses, and an edict by Rassilon that any Time Lord that finds one of the Vampires should put them to death immediately.

===Reality Bomb===
A device created by [[Davros]] and the [[Daleks]] which they prepared to use in &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;. It was meant to disrupt the electrical bond between all atoms in every form of matter, using Z-neutrino energy compressed into a single string by an alignment of 27 planets, therefore destroying the whole of the universe and all other universes via a rift at the heart of the Medusa Cascade. It was, however, disabled by [[Donna Noble|Donna]].

===Recorder===
The [[Second Doctor]] was often seen playing a [[recorder]]. It played a pivotal role in the serial ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'' as well as often being used by the Second Doctor to distract and confuse his enemies.

===Rod of Rassilon===
Another name for the Great Key, not to be confused with the [[#K|Key of Rassilon]] or the other [[#G|Great Key]]. It is a control device for the [[Eye of Harmony]], and can be used to drain power from it.

==S==
===Sash of Rassilon===
A control device for the [[Eye of Harmony]], it is used to protect the wearer from the Eye's gravitational and energy forces.

===Scarf===
The [[Fourth Doctor]]'s long, multicolour-striped scarf, which he claimed was knitted for him by Madame [[Nostradamus]] (described by the Doctor as &quot;a witty little knitter&quot;), is one of the images people generally associate with the character. He had more than one in similar designs and during the time he travelled with [[Romana]], he could be seen wearing one while another was hanging on the Console Room hatstand. The scarf the Doctor wore during his [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] at the end of ''[[Logopolis]]'' was unravelled by the [[Fifth Doctor]] in the beginning of ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]''. A Fourth Doctor-style scarf was seen hanging in the [[TARDIS]] Wardrobe Room in the [[Tenth Doctor]] special &quot;[[The Christmas Invasion]]&quot;. The [[Seventh Doctor]] wore a smaller paisley scarf. Romana wore a white version of the scarf during ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]''. The eleventh incarnation of the Doctor was seen wearing the scarf along with the young Kazran Sardic in the Christmas special &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

===Seal of the High Council===
A round metallic object emblazoned with the Seal of Rassilon, this symbol of Time Lord authority was given to the Master in &quot;[[The Five Doctors]]&quot; to prove to the Doctor that he was working with the Time Lords and not against them. The Third Doctor believes that the Master has stolen it from the Time Lords and takes it from him. When the Master tries to explain to the Fifth Doctor that one of his other selves has taken it he does not believe him.

===Seal of Rassilon===
A spiralling insignia somewhat reminiscent of a [[Celtic knot]], it serves as a logo of the [[Time Lords]]. It is seen in multiple episodes of the series to designate the Time Lords and [[Gallifrey]]. The Seal is most often seen on Time Lord architecture and artefacts, as well as badges on ceremonial clothing. The Seal was featured heavily in the interior design of the [[Eighth Doctor]]'s [[TARDIS]]. It was seen most recently in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, set in stonework beneath the [[#U|Untempered Schism]].
{{-}}

===Security disk===
In the 2007 episode &quot;[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]]&quot; the Doctor retrieves his TARDIS after losing it by means of a security disk. This was essentially a DVD with specific code compatible to the TARDIS. He entrusts the DVD to Sally Sparrow, who inserts the disk into the TARDIS console, causing it to dematerialise, leaving her and Larry Nightingale behind. The security disk is valid for one journey. The TARDIS seems to automatically detect these disks and generates an accompanying hologram of the Doctor to announce this detection as a result.

===Severed hand===
{{See also|List of Torchwood items#Severed hand}}
The [[Tenth Doctor]]'s [[List of Torchwood items#Severed hand|severed right hand]] in a transparent case filled with a preservative liquid. The hand was severed by a [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Sycorax|Sycorax]] sword during their invasion of Earth (&quot;[[The Christmas Invasion]]&quot;). The Doctor regrew the hand due to the healing after-effects of his recent regeneration. Captain [[Jack Harkness]] retrieved the hand and stored it at the Torchwood Hub.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Inside the Hub&quot;. (21â27 October 2006) ''Radio Times'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Torchwood episode &quot;[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]&quot;, the hand glows when the [[TARDIS]] is heard materialising in Cardiff. Alerted by the hand, Jack finds the Doctor in &quot;[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]&quot;, and he describes the hand as a &quot;Doctor detector&quot;; at the end of the episode, the hand is stolen by the Master along with the Doctor's TARDIS. In &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, the Master reveals he has used the hand to derive the Doctor's biological code, with which he accelerates the Doctor's ageing by one hundred years using his [[#L|laser screwdriver]]. Following the events of &quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot;, the Doctor recovers the hand.

It is later seen at the end of the episode, &quot;[[The Poison Sky]]&quot;, where it glows as it did in &quot;[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]&quot;. In &quot;[[The Doctor's Daughter]]&quot;, this instance of glowing is explained as sensing the appearance of the Doctor's genetic material, in the form of [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]], in another time period.

At the end of the episode &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot;, the Doctor is shot by a [[Dalek]] and is forced to regenerate, but in the following episode, &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]], the Doctor transfers the regeneration energy into the hand, allowing him to heal his wounds but still keep the same form. Donna later touches the hand while it is still infused with regeneration energy, causing the hand to regenerate into a half human, half [[Time Lord]] copy of the Doctor, with the side effect of giving Donna the knowledge of a Time Lord.

===SIDRAT===
Dimensionally transcendent time machines named SIDRATs were provided by the [[List of Doctor Who villains#War Chief|War Chief]] to the alien race known as the War Lords in ''[[The War Games]]''. According to the novelisation of the story by [[Malcolm Hulke]], SIDRAT is an acronym for Space and Inter-Dimensional Robot All-purpose Transporter, as well as the backwards spelling of TARDIS.

===Skinsuit===
The name given to a 'suit' made from victims of the [[Slitheen]]. It is made by hollowing out a victim's body and creating a zipper across the forehead, and with the aid of a [[#C|compression field]] the Slitheen then use it as a disguise. Disguised Slitheen can also perfectly replicate the voice of the person they are disguised as, even when not wearing the skinsuit (although tinges of the alien voice are thrown in when not wearing it), although it is not made clear how this works. As the Slitheen are very large, up to eight feet in height, and the compression field only has a limited ability the skinsuits tend to be made from large people. The compression field creates a big gas exchange, which explains why the Slitheen seem to suffer from flatulence when wearing their skinsuits. According to the book ''[[The Monsters Inside]]'', the events of which are referenced in the episode &quot;[[Boom Town]]&quot;, [[Raxacoricofallapatorians]] in the far future have perfected the technology so they can fit into skinsuits far smaller than they are. This is also shown in the ''[[Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' story ''[[The Lost Boy (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Lost Boy]]''.

===Sonic blaster{{anchor|Squareness gun}}===
Featured in &quot;[[The Doctor Dances]]&quot;, the sonic blaster, also known as a &quot;squareness gun&quot;, is a handheld weapon from the 51st century, produced in the weapon factories of Villengard, that can disintegrate as well as reintegrate its targets. The latter function quickly runs down its batteries when used repeatedly. The one featured is owned by [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]]. It fires in a peculiar square shape rather than the more traditional round pattern of most science fiction weapons. The factory that produced the blasters was destroyed, which the [[Ninth Doctor]] implies responsibility for; he claims to have visited it just once, and that there is now a nice banana grove in its place. In &quot;[[Silence in the Library]]&quot;, set in the 51st century, Professor [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] possesses a weapon which acts in exactly the same manner, and author of both stories Steven Moffat says it was the same item, left in the TARDIS by Captain Jack and taken by River during her time with the Doctor, a time which is actually in the future of the Doctor's personal timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial | title = [[Doctor Who Confidential#Series 4 .282008.29|River Runs Deep]] | series = [[Doctor Who Confidential]]| network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC Three|BBC3]] | city = London | began = 2008-06-07 | ended = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sonic cane===
In &quot;[[Let's Kill Hitler]]&quot; the dying Doctor has a sonic cane (supposedly provided by the TARDIS console) which functions in a similar manner to the Sonic Screwdriver, when used the orb at the tip opens up akin to the screwdriver's claws opening.

===Sonic knife===
A tool used by [[List of Doctor Who villains#Scaroth|Scaroth]] in stealing the [[Mona Lisa]] in ''[[City of Death]]''.

===Sonic lance===
A handheld tool used by the [[Sixth Doctor]] in ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]''. It was used as a detonator to explode an unstable material which resulted in the destruction of the [[Cyberman]] base on [[Telos (Doctor Who)|Telos]]. A different sonic lance was seen in an earlier serial, ''[[Robot]]'' as an add-on to the [[sonic screwdriver]].

===Sonic pen===
Wielded by [[List of Doctor Who villains#Matron Cofelia|Miss Foster]] in &quot;[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]&quot;, the sonic pen has a similar range of functions to the sonic screwdriver, but was described as &quot;sleek&quot; in comparison. It looks like a normal black and silver pen with a blue light at the top, similar to the sonic screwdriver. It has the ability to open a 'triple-deadlocked' door, but whether this refers to all deadlocked doors, or just doors with deadlocks created by Miss Foster, the original owner of the pen, is unknown. The pen was last seen thrown in a bin by the Doctor.

[[Gwen Cooper]] is seen using a similar pen (complete with &quot;sonic&quot; sound effects and blue light at top) throughout Torchwood's [[Children of Earth|third season]]. The full range of this pen's abilities is also unknown. After introducing it to Clement Macdonald while visiting him at a psychiatric clinic, she named it as a &quot;Gizmo&quot;. It is primarily used on-screen to disable video cameras.

===Sonic screwdriver===
{{Main|Sonic screwdriver}}

===Space-time telegraph===
A device given by the Doctor to [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] that can contact the Doctor throughout time and space. It was supposed to be used only in the gravest of emergencies. The Doctor received its signal at the end of ''[[Revenge of the Cybermen]]'', leading to the events of ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]''. This is now obsolete, as in &quot;[[The Sontaran Stratagem]]&quot;, [[Martha Jones]]'s Superphone was used instead.

===Sphere (''[[Shada]]'')===
A device used as a weapon by Skagra in ''[[Shada]]''. It was capable of removing a person's mind from their body, as well spreading the singular mind that Skagra wished to cover the entire universe with.

===Sphere (''[[The Abominable Snowmen]]'' &amp; ''[[The Web of Fear]]'')===
Silver spheres which contain the consciousness of each [[Yeti (Doctor Who)|Yeti]].

===Squareness Gun===
As coined by Rose Tyler, this gun is a sonic device used to create square holes in walls, then seal them up by using the reverse settings. First seen in &quot;[[The Doctor Dances]]&quot;, in the possession of [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], it was most recently seen in &quot;[[Silence in the Library]]&quot; and &quot;[[Forest of the Dead]]&quot;, when the Doctor and Professor River Song's remaining team use it to try and escape the [[Vashta Nerada]] which had started to invade their spacesuits.

===Stattenheim remote control===
A device used by the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] to control her [[TARDIS]] remotely. The [[Second Doctor]] also had a Stattenheim in the serial ''[[The Two Doctors]]'', to the envy of the [[Sixth Doctor]]. The Doctor has also used the Stattenheim control in the spin-off media. The novels ''[[Christmas on a Rational Planet]]'' and ''[[The Quantum Archangel]]'' claim that Stattenheim was a human scientist from sixteenth century Berlin who, with his associate Waldorf, developed a working theory of TARDIS configuration.

===Superphone===
The &quot;Superphone&quot; is an upgraded mobile phone that can make calls across time and space. It even calibrates to the user's home time period, as shown by [[Adam Mitchell (Doctor Who)|Adam Mitchell]]'s ability to call his home time on [[Rose Tyler]]'s phone (&quot;[[The Long Game]]&quot;), despite their native time periods being about six years apart. In addition, it can send signals in places ordinary phones cannot, such as the sealed Cabinet Rooms at [[10 Downing Street]] (&quot;[[World War Three (Doctor Who)|World War Three]]&quot;). However, its range is not infinite (&quot;[[The Impossible Planet]]&quot;). The Doctor describes the Superphone as being able to &quot;...Call anyone, in any time, so long as you know the area code.&quot;

The superphone first appears in &quot;[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]&quot;, where the [[Ninth Doctor]] modifies Rose's [[Nokia 3200]] mobile phone with a special device that goes in place of the battery. In &quot;[[Rise of the Cybermen]]&quot;, the Nokia 3200 is replaced by a [[Samsung D500]], but otherwise seems to function the same. A Samsung D500 is also seen used by [[Tish Jones]] in [[The Sound of Drums]]. It is also able to link with the Cybus Industries Ear-Pod network. Rose gives the phone to [[Mickey Smith]] at the end of &quot;[[The Age of Steel]]&quot;, but replaces it soon after.

After [[Martha Jones]] becomes an ongoing companion to the [[Tenth Doctor]] in &quot;[[42 (Doctor Who)|42]]&quot;, he gives her phone, the [[BenQ-Siemens EF81]] a similar upgrade. This phone, however, is upgraded by the Doctor's sonic screwdriver, and the feature itself is referred to as &quot;Universal [[Roaming]]&quot;. Martha's phone has the [[#A|Archangel network]] logo on its display, the significance of which is revealed in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;. At the end of the episode &quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot;, Martha gives her phone to the Doctor, so she can contact him if trouble occurs. 

The Doctor uses the same process to upgrade [[Donna Noble]]'s phone in &quot;[[The Doctor's Daughter]]&quot;, but it is only used once onscreen to contact Martha's similarly upgraded phone. When his allies try contact the Doctor in &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot; by means of Martha's superphone now in his possession, the number displayed onscreen is 07700 900461. After the airing of this episode, 2500 fans tried dialling the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2261219/Doctor-Who-phone-number-has-fans-in-frenzy.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Doctor Who phone number has fans in frenzy | first=Aislinn | last=Simpson | date=7 July 2008 | accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, Wilfred mentions that he has received a phone call from Donna, presumably by means of her Superphone.  

In &quot;[[Planet of the Dead]]&quot;, the Doctor uses the sonic screwdriver to create Barclay's phone into a superphone to contact, and be contacted by, [[List of UNIT personnel in Doctor Who#Malcolm Taylor|Malcolm Taylor]] from UNIT, who is on the other side of the wormhole. The phone is of the [[Nokia]] Prism series. ([[Planet of the Dead]])

There are at least two superphones available for use in the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS; [[Amy Pond]]'s phone and a flip phone sometimes used by the Doctor. Delaware used Amy Pond's cell phone to receive a call from the Doctor's flip phone in 1969, before cell networks existed, indicating that both phones must have been upgraded by the Doctor at some point ([[Day of the Moon]]). In [[The Doctor's Wife]], the Doctor uses Amy's phone to keep in touch with her and Rory, who are trapped inside the TARDIS.

==T==
===TARDIS===
{{Main|TARDIS}}
[[File:TARDIS.jpg|thumb|100px|The TARDIS]]
A TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimensions In Space) is a spaceship invented by the Time Lords that can travel through space and time. The Doctor travels in a Type 40 TARDIS. A TARDIS can travel to any time and place in the universe, except to events that are Time-Locked, such as the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. The TARDIS is bigger on the inside than the outside. The TARDIS' main fuel is Artron energy, a positive time energy that can almost penetrate time gates.{{clarify|date=December 2010}} In ''[[The Impossible Planet]]'' it is stated that TARDISs are grown, rather than built, and that no other TARDIS could be created, as the last seeds for them were destroyed in the Time War.

In ''[[The Next Doctor]]'', Jackson Lake made a typical [[hot-air balloon]], which he called his TARDIS (Tethered Aerial Release Developed In Style).

===TARDIS comparator===
A TARDIS component, in ''[[Planet of Fire]]'', [[Kamelion]] removes it from the TARDIS and gives it to [[Peri Brown]] so that [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] cannot use it.

===TARDIS shields===
According to the [[Fifth Doctor]] in &quot;[[Time Crash]]&quot;, the [[Tenth Doctor]] failed to turn the shields on after &quot;repairing the TARDIS&quot;. Thus causes two TARDISes to combine and [[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|the ''Titanic'' to crash into the TARDIS]].

===Temporal Limiter===
A TARDIS component, one of the items exchanged between the Master and the Doctor in ''[[Time-Flight]]''. Without this component, the [[TARDIS]] can only travel in its current [[Time Zone]].

===Terraforming device===
A round glass container made in a laboratory that holds gases and liquids designed specifically for making a barren planet habitable. Even when the device is in a transit state vegetation grows in the area surrounding it. Used in &quot;[[The Doctor's Daughter]]&quot; to make the planet Messaline habitable.

===Time Cabinet===
A primitive time machine used by [[Magnus Greel]] in ''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'' which is deadly to the user.

===Time Destructor===
Powered by a core of taranium, the rarest element in the Universe, and able to accelerate the flow of time, the [[Dalek]]s hoped to gain control of the Solar System with this device in ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]''.

===Time Log===
In ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'' the Doctor is noted to have once kept Time Logs. These were records of journeys made in the [[TARDIS]] and he used the Time Logs to attempt to refresh his memory of visiting the planet Traken. Eventually, the Doctor ceased keeping Time Logs, claiming he had better things to do.

===Time Ring===
Given to the [[Fourth Doctor]] in the serial ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' by the Time Lords so that he could escape [[Skaro]] on successful completion of his mission to avert the creation of the Daleks. The Doctor, [[Harry Sullivan]], and [[Sarah Jane Smith]] use the Time Ring at the end of the adventure and are taken to the Nerva station where they go on to participate in the events of ''[[Revenge of the Cybermen]]''. Another Time Ring makes an appearance at the end of the [[Tenth Doctor]] novel ''[[I am a Dalek]]''. [[Bernice Summerfield]] and [[Jason Kane (Doctor Who)|Jason Kane]] were also given time rings as a wedding present by the [[Seventh Doctor]] in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] spin-off novel ''Happy Endings'' by [[Paul Cornell]]. These were used (and destroyed) by [[List of Bernice Summerfield characters#S|Peter Summerfield]] in the [[Big Finish Productions]] audio adventure ''[[The Grel Escape]]''. The [[Eighth Doctor]] was also given a Time Ring by a rather smug Time Lord by the name of Straxus to go back and rescue [[Lucie Miller]] in the audio drama ''[[Human Resources]]''.

===Time scoop===
The Time Scoop was a primitive 'Time Corridor' technology created on Gallifrey during the Dark Time, similar in sophistication to Dalek time-travel technology. Its purpose was to remotely 'scoop' individuals from their own time period and deposited them within the Death Zone, a securely controlled environment on Gallifrey. Those kidnapped were then expected to compete in [[gladiator|gladiatorial games]]. In &quot;[[The Five Doctors]]&quot;, the Scoop was used to fetch various incarnations of the Doctor and his [[companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to the Death Zone, along with various foes such as the Daleks, Cybermen, and [[Yeti (Doctor Who)|Yeti]]. The Time Scoop plays a minor role in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[The Eight Doctors]]'', and a major role in the final chapter of the [[Gallifrey (audio series)|''Gallifrey'' audio series]].

===Time/Space Visualiser===
A device given to the [[First Doctor]] at the end of ''[[The Space Museum]]'', it is a &quot;time television&quot;, allowing the operator to tune in on any event in history. The [[TARDIS]] crew used it to watch various historical events at the beginning of ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]''.

===Timelash===
A doorway that exiles a person pushed into it down a corridor of Time and Space. Used in the [[Timelash|episode of the same name]].

===&quot;Timey-wimey&quot; detector===
A detector of temporal disturbances constructed by the Tenth Doctor in &quot;[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]]&quot; when he and Martha Jones are sent back to 1969 without the TARDIS by the [[Weeping Angels]]. The unserious sounding name appears to be the Doctor's joking reference to his own inability to describe temporal theory in succinct layman's terms; he describes its operation as &quot;Goes ding when there's stuff.&quot; He also says it can boil eggs at thirty paces, whether the user wants it to or not, and that he has therefore learned to avoid [[chicken|hens]], because it is not pleasant to be around them when they explode. Visible elements of the device's construction include a [[lunchbox]], a [[Handset|telephone handset]], some [[Magnetic tape|tape reels]], a [[postcard]], and the Doctor's [[sonic screwdriver]].

===Tissue Compression Eliminator===
The [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]]'s weapon of choice, it shrinks people to doll size, killing them in the process. He no longer used it by the time of ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]''. The weapon was also used by the Doctor to shrink the alien mechanoid [[Death's Head]] in his [[Marvel Comics]] adventures. However, as with all non-televised Doctor Who media, the [[Whoniverse#Inclusion and continuity|canonicity]] of this story is unclear. The Tissue Compression Eliminator was also parodied in the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] comedy series ''[[Nebulous]]'', in which the arch-enemy of Professor Nebulous, Doctor Klench, miniaturises his foes, but unlike the Master's victims, they are not dead and Klench carries them around with him.

===TOMTIT machine===
Ostensibly a teleportation device, seen in the Third Doctor serial ''[[The Time Monster]]''. The [[acronym]] stands for '''T'''ransmission '''O'''f '''M'''atter '''T'''hrough '''I'''nterstitial '''T'''ime.

===Toxic Lipstick===
Rather than a hallucinogenic lipstick, [[River Song]] has a toxic lipstick made from a Judas tree. Having been trained to assassinate the [[Eleventh Doctor|Doctor]] by the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]], she kisses him in &quot;[[Let's Kill Hitler]]&quot;, causing the Doctor to be poisoned to the verge of no [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]]. He, in the end, manages to persuade River to save him who gives up the rest of her regenerations in order to revive him.

===Transmat===
A device which disperses matter, transmits it to and then reconstitutes it in another location. Transmats are used in the serials ''[[The Seeds of Death]]'', ''[[The Ark in Space]]'', ''[[Revenge of the Cybermen]]'', ''[[The Armageddon Factor]]'', ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'', ''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'', ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'', &quot;[[Bad Wolf]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, among others. The word &quot;transmat&quot; is also used as a verb.

===Travel dial===
In ''[[The Keys of Marinus]]'', devices that could teleport the user from one place to another (similar in appearance to a [[wristwatch]]).

===Tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator===
An interstellar transportation platform that utilises massive energy to create a force bubble that protects the rider while riding the shockwave to its destination â in short, a &quot;pan-dimensional [[surfboard]]&quot;. It was introduced in &quot;[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]&quot; and thereafter used to create a force field, first around the TARDIS and later the Game Station, in &quot;[[The Parting of the Ways]]&quot;. It was also used in &quot;[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]&quot; to shunt the TARDIS two hundred yards when it was forcibly summoned by the Empress of the [[List of Doctor Who aliens#Racnoss|Racnoss]]. In this latest appearance, the Extrapolator is partly covered by a coral-like crust similar to that found in the console room's construction, indicating that the TARDIS has somehow begun to absorb it into its systems. It is unknown where the extrapolator came from originally, though Margaret Blaine (the [[Slitheen]]) comments it 'fell into her hands', [[Jack Harkness]] claims it was way beyond her to build it. Though he later suggests she stole it in a major heist, Blaine makes no confirmation to this theory.

===Trilogic game===
A devious game designed by the [[Celestial Toymaker]] in the [[The Celestial Toymaker|story of the same name]] â it is essentially the [[Tower of Hanoi]].
The Doctor won.

===Trisilicate===
An ore used primarily in computers and as spaceship fuel. Originally mined on [[Mars (Doctor Who)|Mars]] (as seen in ''[[The Curse of Peladon]]''), it was later found on [[List of Doctor Who planets#P|Peladon]] ''([[The Monster of Peladon]])''. It occurs in abundance on [[List of Doctor Who planets#L|Laylora]], as described in the novel ''[[The Price of Paradise]]''.

==U==
===Ultraviolet Torch===
In &quot;[[The Vampires of Venice]]&quot;, the Doctor takes a large ultraviolet emitting (artificial sunlight) torch with him to protect against the Saturnyne, who cannot withstand sunlight. When he pulls it out of his (dimensionally transcendental) jacket pocket, Rory looks at his own penlight and remarks, &quot;Yours is bigger than mine,&quot; to which the Doctor replies, &quot;Let's not go there.&quot;

===Umbrella===
The [[Seventh Doctor]] carried, from ''[[Delta and the Bannermen]]'' onwards, an umbrella with a question-mark shaped handle. He had ceased using it by the time of his last appearance in the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|''Doctor Who'' television movie]]. The [[Sixth Doctor]] occasionally carried a different umbrella, a multicolored model with a straight handle. This was destroyed in the Seventh Doctor's first story, ''[[Time and the Rani]]''. The first time the Doctor is seen on screen with an umbrella (a simple black one), is in the Second Doctor serial ''[[The Krotons]]''.

===Universal Roaming===
''See [[List of Doctor Who items#Superphone|superphone]].

===Untempered Schism===
A gap in the fabric of reality, the Untempered Schism allows one to look directly into the [[Time vortex (Doctor Who)|Time Vortex]]. It is depicted as a stonework portal through which one sees the Time Vortex unaided. Gallifreyan children are taken to the Schism at the age of eight and made to face the Schism as a form of initiation into the Time Lord Academy. According to [[Tenth Doctor]], Gallifreyan children who look into the time vortex through the Untempered Schism were either inspired, ran away, or went mad. In a flashback during &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] is seen looking into the Schism as a child, an event that Tenth Doctor describes as the moment the Master went mad. The Doctor says he himself was one of those who &quot;ran away, and never stopped&quot;.

The Schism is also implied in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] story &quot;[[A Good Man Goes to War]]&quot; as being at least partially responsible for the Time Lords' existence and abilities. The [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurian]] warrior Madame Vastra suggested that, just as exposure to the Time Vortex via the Schism allowed the Gallifreyan species to evolve over aeons into Time Lords, so [[Melody Pond]]'s exposure to the Time Vortex ''in utero'' via the TARDIS could have led to her semi-Time Lord physiology.

==V==
===Validium===
A living metal created on [[Gallifrey]] that has the power of life and death. It appears in the serial ''[[Silver Nemesis]]''.

===VCR===
In &quot;[[The Idiot's Lantern]]&quot;, the Doctor uses parts obtained from an electrical supplies shop in the 1950s to construct a [[videocassette recorder]]. He uses it to defeat [[List of Doctor Who villains#The Wire|the Wire]], trapping the villain by recording her on a [[Betamax]] videotape. He assures Rose that he will destroy the Wire by recording over it.

===Void ship===
A vessel capable of travelling in the void, the area between dimensions outside of time and space. The Doctor expresses surprise at encountering one, saying, &quot;I thought it was just a theory,&quot; and so such technology was presumably beyond the Time Lords. However, the Cult of Skaroâa secret order of Daleksâmanage to obtain one, and thus survive the Time War with the Time Lord prison ship referred to as the [[Genesis Ark]]. The Void Ship is a dark brown sphere which gives off a great deal of light when opened. Torchwood claim to be interested in it as it is undetectable by any means apart from seeing it in front of you; for example, it gives off no heat and is not affected by gravity. It is possible that these properties allow it to survive the void.

===Vortex magnetron===
A device used by Daleks in ''[[Day of the Daleks]]''  which could draw time travellers to a certain location.

===Vortex manipulator===
A more primitive form of time-travel technology, a vortex manipulator allows the user to travel through time by minimally controllable (and apparently uncomfortable) &quot;hops&quot; through the [[Time vortex (Doctor Who)|Time Vortex]]. The technology is compact enough to be worn on one's person easily, such as the [[List of Torchwood items#Time Agent Wrist-Strap|wrist-mounted device]] in the possession of [[Jack Harkness]], which he obtained during his stint as a Time Agent. The [[List of Doctor Who villains#Family of Blood|Family of Blood]] also had one capable of moving a small spaceship. When Jack notes that such technology means the Doctor is not the only person capable of travelling through time, the Doctor disdainfully compares the &quot;[[space hopper]]&quot; vortex manipulator to his &quot;[[sports car]]&quot; [[TARDIS]]. The device also allows travel through space by harnessing the energies of wormholes (such as the [[Cardiff Rift]]), as demonstrated by [[List of Torchwood characters#Captain John Hart|Captain John Hart]] and [[List of Torchwood characters#Gray|Gray]] in series 2 of ''[[Torchwood]]''. As seen in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, the Manipulator can also be programmed to teleport its operator (and anyone hanging on) from place to place once the Doctor has used his [[sonic screwdriver]] to jump-start it. The Doctor disables Jack's manipulator at the end of &quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot;, but Jack figures out how to re-enable it (or at least restore its teleport function) in &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot;. In the last episode of the 2008 series &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot; the Doctor once again disables Jack's vortex manipulator with his [[sonic screwdriver]]. In the final episode of &quot;[[Children of Earth]]&quot;, it is revealed that the Vortex Manipulator (or at least Jack's) is indestructible, capable of surviving an explosion that destroyed the Torchwood Three building. In &quot;[[The Pandorica Opens]]&quot;, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] gets a vortex manipulator from a black market dealer in order to meet the Doctor, the dialogue suggests the manipulator is still on the disembodied hand of a Time Agent. River is able to use it to travel wherever she wants with no apparent problems. Later, the manipulator ends up in the hands of the Doctor who uses it to travel back in time and have the Auton copy of [[Rory Williams]] free himself trapped in the Pandorica. As the TARDIS is destroyed, the Doctor uses it to teleport through time, travelling to 1996 to meet the resurrected Amy Pond then using it to travel back in time to set the events in motion by giving Rory the screwdriver and leaving young Amy the notes that led her to the Pandorica. After learning River is still alive and is trapped in a time loop in the destroyed TARDIS (an emergency protocol to protect anyone inside), the Doctor is able to teleport into the TARDIS and rescue her. The Doctor later uses the manipulator to travel back in time 12 minutes to trick a [[Dalek]] and then pilot the Pandorica into the heart of the TARDIS explosion. After he is brought back from being erased from existence, the Doctor returns the manipulator to River who uses it to teleport away, presumably back to her own time.

==W==
===Warpstar===
A small crystalline device carried by [[Sarah Jane Smith]] in &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot; that looks like a necklace, but is in fact a highly explosive device (a &quot;Warp-fold conjugation&quot;) inside a carbonised shell. According to Sarah Jane, it was given to her by a Verran soothsayer to be used at &quot;the end of days&quot;. Jack Harkness wires it into the Dalek Crucible's mainframe and threatens to use it; however, he does not get the opportunity as the Daleks swiftly transmat Jack, Sarah Jane, and their companions away.

===Watch===
{{See also|#Fob watch|l1=Fob watch}}
The Doctor sometimes carries a watch, either a wristwatch or a pocket watch. In ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s pocket watch has an alarm signalling planetary disaster and could also be used as a scanner (as seen in ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]''). The [[Sixth Doctor|Sixth]], [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s watches could also indicate the era he was in (cf. ''[[The Mysterious Planet]]'', &quot;[[The Long Game]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Pandorica Opens]]&quot;, respectively).

===White Point Star===
A White Point star is a perfect uncut diamond found only on Gallifrey and is used by Lord President in ''[[The End of Time]]'' to bridge the gap between the end of the Time War and present day Earth. The Master uses this to summon the remaining Time Lords from the Time War. The Doctor then destroys it by shooting it with [[Wilfred Mott]]'s gun.

===Wormhole Refractor===
A device the Doctor mentions as useful for crossing the universe in the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|2006 series]] episode &quot;[[Fear Her]]&quot;.

===Worshipful and Ancient Law of Gallifrey, The===
An ancient book from Gallifrey, seen in ''[[Shada]]''. It was created by [[Rassilon]], but later stolen by [[Professor Chronotis]]. Time runs backwards over the book. It has the power to grant access to the planet Shada. In various spin off media, it is shown to be able to erase a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] and trap an entity.

==Z==
===Zero Cabinet===
A cabinet made from the remnants of The Zero Room which was a room in the TARDIS. The room had walls that shielded it from the rest of the universe, providing a restful environment for the [[Fifth Doctor]] to recover from his [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regeneration]] in ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]''. When the room is later jettisoned in an emergency, its doors are made into the &quot;Zero Cabinet&quot;, a coffin-sized box with the same shielding properties. In the Big Finish audio &quot;[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]&quot;, the TARDIS is able to create a potion of &quot;Zero Matter&quot; which has similar properties.

===Zeus Plugs===
At the end of [[Fourth Doctor]] serial &quot;[[The Hand of Fear]]&quot;, the Doctor asks [[Sarah Jane Smith]] for a zeus plug to help him repair the [[TARDIS]] [[thermocouples]]. He then changes his mind and uses the [[sonic screwdriver]] instead. They are also mentioned in &quot;[[The Girl in the Fireplace]]&quot;. While their function is unknown, the Doctor said he had earlier been using them as [[castanets]] while at a party with [[Madame de Pompadour]] in 18th century Versailles, France.
