==Early life==
Nicky Scarfo, Jr. was born to Nicodemo and Domenica Scarfo. He has an older half-brother, Chris (born in 1957), and a younger brother, Mark (born in 1970).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt; Nicky is the cousin of [[Phil Leonetti]], an admitted former [[underboss]] of the Philadelphia crime family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt;

Nicky Scarfo, Sr. was allegedly banished from Philadelphia to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], before Nicky Jr.'s birth. The elder Scarfo had allegedly killed a man in a brawl unrelated to mob business. Then-boss [[Angelo Bruno|Angelo &quot;Gentle Don&quot; Bruno]] is said to have exiled him to Atlantic City, which at the time was a dying family beach resort town.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastGangster&quot;&gt;Anastasia, George.

M. &quot;The Fat Lady Sings.&quot; ''Philadelphia City Paper.'' November 29âDecember 6, 2001.] Accessed April 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicky Scarfo, Jr. grew up on North Georgia Avenue in the [[Ducktown, Atlantic City|Ducktown]] section of Atlantic City. His grandmother, Catherine Scarfo, owned the building and lived there. Phil Leonetti also lived in the building, and later roomed with the Scarfos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MobTrial&quot;&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;Mob Trial Hears Scarfo Jr., On Tape, Psyching For A Hit.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' November 4, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his father's position within the Philadelphia mob, the Scarfos were not wealthy while Nicky was growing up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt;

Nicky graduated from [[Holy Spirit High School (New Jersey)|Holy Spirit High School]] in [[Absecon, New Jersey]], in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt; Gambling was legalized in Atlantic City in 1976, and Nicodemo Scarfo, Sr. allegedly became deeply involved in organized crime's infiltration of the casino industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Novak&quot; /&gt; Among the elder Scarfo's closest associates was [[Salvatore Merlino|Salvatore &quot;Chuckie&quot; Merlino]]. Scarfo Sr.'s rule over organized crime in Atlantic City has been characterized as one of the most violent and murderous in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Novak&quot; /&gt; While Nicky was in high school, his father was brought back to Philadelphia by the mob. In 1980, Scarfo Sr. was named the Philadelphia outfit's [[consigliere]], and in 1981 he was named boss. Only then did the Scarfos begin to live a more lavish lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt; By one account, Nicky Scarfo, Jr. was not involved in crime during his teens, and did not intend to become involved in the syndicate. As one classmate noted, &quot;When I knew him, he was a good guy. He was just a regular guy. Everyone knew who his father was, but we never talked about that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Anastasia, George. &quot;'Nicky Jr.': Where Does the Boss' Son Fit In?&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' March 10, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years in the Scarfo crime family==
After graduation, Nicky Scarfo allegedly became involved in organized crime.  He became a close friend of [[Joseph Merlino|Joseph &quot;Skinny Joey&quot; Merlino]], the son of Scarfo crime family underboss Chuckie Merlino.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey&quot; /&gt; However, the relationship with Joey Merlino was to prove inauspicious. Their friendship, which was very close, ruptured in 1988 when Chuckie Merlino was convicted of [[racketeering]] and sentenced to 45 years in a federal penitentiary.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey&quot; /&gt; Merlino was then demoted by the elder Scarfo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Recalling&quot;&gt;Caparella, Kitty. &quot;Recalling A Bloody Hit.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.'' April 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nicky Scarfo, Jr. allegedly ended his friendship with Joey Merlino at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey&quot; /&gt; Philadelphia crime family boss [[Ralph Natale]] later testified in court that Merlino &quot;hated&quot; Scarfo from this time onward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descent&quot;&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;Mob Boss Natale Tells of 'Descent Into Hell'.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' March 31, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Nicky Scarfo, Sr. came under increasing legal pressure as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] conducted a massive investigation of the Scarfo crime family's operations. Twenty members of Scarfo's organization were imprisoned, and many more came under indictment. Five members of the Philadelphia crime family turned [[state's evidence]] against the elder Scarfo, including [[Soldato|soldiers]] Nicholas Caramandi and [[Eugene Milano]], [[caporegime|capos]] [[Thomas DelGiorno]] and [[Lawrence Merlino]] (Chuckie Merlino's brother), and underboss (and Scarfo relative) Phil Leonetti.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastGangster&quot; /&gt;

During the trial, Mark Scarfo attempted suicide on November 1, 1988. Mark, then only 17 years old, had been taunted for years by classmates about his father's criminal activities. Increasingly despondent over his father's possible imprisonment, Mark Scarfo hanged himself in the office of his father's concrete supply company in Atlantic City. He was discovered by his mother, and paramedics were able to resuscitate him. He suffered [[cardiac arrest]] and his brain was deprived of oxygen. He entered a coma, from which he had yet to emerge as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Kathy. &quot;Scarfo's Son 'Put Through Hell'.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.''

November 2, 1988; &quot;Son's Hanging Halts Alleged Mob Chief's Trial.&quot; ''Associated Press.'' November 2, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 1988, just three days after Mark's suicide attempt, Nicky Scarfo, Jr. and a friend assaulted a woman in an elevator at [[Hahnemann University Hospital]] in Philadelphia. The woman said the two men had looked menacingly at her, and she pretended to reach for a gun in her coat. The two men then punched her, pushed her to the floor, and kicked her several times. Scarfo was arrested for assault, convicted, fined, and put on [[probation]] for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Caba, Susan. &quot;Scarfo Jr. Gets Probation and Fine for Conviction in Hospital Beating.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' June 13, 1990; Caparella, Kitty. &quot;Scarfo Jr. Guilty in Beating Case.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.'' June 13, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicodemo Scarfo, Sr. was convicted on November 19, 1988, on more than 32 counts of [[racketeering]], which included eight counts of murder, four counts of [[attempted murder]], two counts of illegal distribution of [[methamphetamine]], one count of [[loansharking]], 14 counts of [[extortion]], and one count of [[illegal gambling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastGangster&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v.

Nicky Scarfo, Jr. may have attempted to use his father's conviction as a means of rising within the syndicate. In October 1989, Scarfo Jr. bodyguard [[George Fresolone]] turned state's evidence and began wearing a [[covert listening device|wire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wire&quot;&gt;[http://www.citypaper.net/articles/041901/news.mob.shtml Barry, Jim. &quot;Trouble With a Capital N.&quot; ''Philadelphia City Paper.'' April 19â26, 2001.] Accessed April 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Fresolone taped Scarfo Jr. discussing the death of his cousin, Phil Leonetti, an act which would have allowed him to rise within the Philadelphia criminal organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My father says, he says, this one is definitely my responsibility. He can't rest.... I told him, I says, &quot;I ain't resting till it's f-ing done&quot; ... How can I rest? How could I sleep at night?... It's always eating at me, eating at me.&lt;ref name=&quot;MobTrial&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The evidence was later used to help indict Scarfo Jr. on [[racketeering]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wire&quot; /&gt;

===Halloween assassination attempt===
His father's conviction severely undermined Nicky Scarfo, Jr.'s position in the Philadelphia crime family, as many family members were angry at the elder Scarfo's alleged mismanagement of organized crime enterprises and his arrogance.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey&quot; /&gt;

On the evening of October 31, 1989, Nicky Scarfo, Jr. was dining at an Italian restaurant in Philadelphia when a man wearing a Batman mask and holding a plastic Halloween candy bag entered the restaurant and approached Scarfo's table. The man pulled a [[MAC-10]] [[machine pistol]] from the bag and fired at Scarfo. Scarfo was struck eight times in the neck, arms and torso, but no vital organs were hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrison&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastGangster&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DetailsMobHits&quot;&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;Scafidi Details Mob Hits, Attempts.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''

Theories for the hit took several forms. Initially, law enforcement officials believed that the hit had been ordered by one of the [[Five Families]] in [[New York City]] in an attempt to take over Philadelphia's organized crime operations.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;Authories: Hit Was Ordered in N.Y.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''

November 2, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; But police later said they suspected Joey Merlino of being the gunman, with Nicky Scarfo, Jr. seen as a proxy for his fatherâthe message being that the elder Scarfo was no longer in control of the Philadelphia crime family.&lt;ref name=&quot;BodyEvidence&quot;&gt;Caparella, Kitty and Smith, Jim. &quot;Body of Evidence Against Mob Grows.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.''

Scafidi said he was asked to participate in the hit, but refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;DetailsMobHits&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BodyEvidence&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=12330 Cipriano, Ralph. &quot;Straight From the Horsehead's Mouth.&quot; ''Philadelphia Weekly.''

April 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by testimony from former Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale, who also turned state's evidence and said that Merlino told him about committing the crime while they served time together in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descent&quot; /&gt; At least one other mobster testifying on behalf of the government alleged that soldier [[Peter Caprio|Pete &quot;Pete the Crumb&quot; Caprio]] also knew of the hit and attempted to prevent it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ComingSoon&quot; /&gt; Authorities also suspected Charles &quot;Chaz&quot; Iannece of the attempted murder because he delivered a controversial kiss on the cheek to Scarfo shortly before the gunman attacked.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chaz&quot; Iannece is the son of jailed mob soldato Charles &quot;Charlie White&quot; Iannece. The younger Iannece is allegedly a hitman and extortionist, and deeply involved in the distribution of [[methamphetamine]] for the Scarfo crime family in the 1980s. See: DiFilippo, Dana. &quot;Giant Meth Ring Busted.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.'' September 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicky Scarfo, Jr. became an unimportant player in the Philadelphia mob after the hit. He adopted a very low profile to avoid drawing attention to himself, most likely (police assumed) because he had few allies who would protect him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fumes&quot; /&gt; Scarfo moved to [[Newark, New Jersey]], shortly afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;Smith, Jim. &quot;Scarfo Jr. Jailed for Bookmaking.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.''

ISBN 0671779052&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officials alleged that Scarfo Sr. had his son inducted into the Lucchese crime family in [[New York City]] in order to protect him from further attempts on his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glimpse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At least one source says that Scarfo Jr. was inducted into the [[Gambino crime family]], not the Lucchese. See: Smith, Jim. &quot;Scarfo Jr. Jailed for Bookmaking.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.'' June 29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 court affidavit filed by the New Jersey State Organized Crime Control Bureau, Scarfo Jr. was later &quot;[[Made man|made]]&quot; and elevated to the position of soldier within the Luccese crime familyâeffectively protecting him from any additional murder attempts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glimpse&quot; /&gt;

==Post-hit criminal career==
As a member of the Lucchese crime family, Nicky Scarfo, Jr. became involved in a number of criminal enterprises. In 1990, Nicky Scarfo and Gaetano &quot;Tommy Horsehead&quot; Scafidi were allegedly ordered to beat mobster [[Martin Angelina]] because he refused to stop associating with Chuckie Merlino. According to court testimony by Scafidi (who had turned state's evidence by this time), they beat Angelina with aluminum bats to make sure the bats wouldn't break.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recalling&quot; /&gt; In August 1990, Scarfo was arrested on federal charges of racketeering and conspiracy to manufacture and distribute illegal [[video poker]] machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wire&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LeDuc, Daniel and Anastasia, George. &quot;Mobster-Information Leads to Arrests of Nicodemo Scarfo, Jr., 28 Others.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''

During his imprisonment, Scarfo was placed in &quot;protective isolation&quot; by prison authorities. Government officials claimed to have received information indicating that Scarfo's life was in danger in prison. Thus, they isolated him from the rest of the prison population, permitting him limited exercise and other time out of his cell. Scarfo and his attorneys claimed that no such information existed, and that the involuntary isolation was punishment for Scarfo's other alleged (but unproven) criminal activity. Scarfo sued, and a court ordered him returned to the general prison population in June 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fumes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;State Is Ordered to Review Scarfo Jr.'s Custody In Prison.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''

===Mob war, 1993-1995===
While Nicky Scarfo, Jr. was living in Newark and serving time in prison, his father, Nicky Scarfo, Sr., attempted to run the Philadelphia crime family from his own prison cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MobTrial&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fumes&quot; /&gt; But the elder Scarfo soon lost control of the syndicate, and in 1991 [[John Stanfa|Giovanni &quot;The Dour Don&quot; Stanfa]] was named Acting Boss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Acquitted&quot;&gt;&quot;7 Reputed Mafia Figures Are Acquitted of Murder.&quot; ''New York Times.''

In alleged retaliation, Stanfa's son was shot in the face on August 31 during an attempted hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastGangster&quot; /&gt; Stanfa reportedly ordered Merlino's assassination at least ten more times,&lt;ref&gt;Kocieniewski, David. &quot;Decline and Fall of an Empire.&quot; ''New York Times.'' January 17, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; but he survived every attempt. Merlino was sent to jail in 1994 for violating his parole.&lt;ref name=&quot;PoisedtoPlay&quot;&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;Merlino Posed to Play 'Big Part'.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' November 13, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 

But Merlino's imprisonment did not hurt his chances of taking over the Philadelphia outfit. According to mobster Ralph Natale, he and Merlino began plotting to take over the Philadelphia crime family while they were cellmates in a federal penitentiary in 1990. Natale named [[Steven Mazzone]], [[George Borgesi]] and Martin Angelina (as previously noted, an opponent of Nicky Scarfo, Jr.), all Merlino associates, as co-conspirators in the take-over plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recalling&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Descent&quot; /&gt; Whether Natale's allegations are true or not, Merlino received Natale's backing even while in prison in 1994. Natale was close to the [[Genovese crime family]], which had taken over part of the Atlantic City operations of the Philadelphia mob after the murder of boss [[Angelo Bruno]] in 1980. With the support of Natale and the Genovese crime family, Merlino was able to retain control of his crew and was promised the underboss position if Natale succeeded in displacing Stanfa.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Mark. &quot;'Hood Edgy Over Hood.&quot; ''Philadelphia Daily News.'' November 14, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; But with Merlino in prison, Natale was not able to consolidate his power, and Stanfa stabilized his control of the family in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;New Mob Turns to Revenge By Proxy.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' October 8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanfa's rule did not last, however: He and 23 other members of the Philadelphia syndicate were indicted on March 17, 1994, on a wide variety of charges, including labor racketeering, extortion, loansharking, murder and conspiracy to commit murder.&lt;ref&gt;Hinds, Michael Decourcy. &quot;F.B.I. Arrests Reputed Leader of Philadelphia Mob and 23 Others.&quot; ''New York Times.''  March 18, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; As Stanfa and most of his regime sat in prison awaiting trial, the Gambino crime family withdrew its support for him and Natale was able to take control of the Philadelphia mob. On November 21, 1995, Stanfa was convicted of all charges and sentenced to five consecutive life sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Selwyn. &quot;Jury Convicts Philadelphia's Mob Leader.&quot; ''New York Times.'' November 22, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merlino was released from prison in 1994, and named Natale's underboss in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rubinkam&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PoisedtoPlay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anastasia, George. &quot;Taking Care of Family Business.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''

''Unfinished Business: Shocking Declassified Details from the FBI's Greatest Undercover Operation and a Bloody Timeline of the Fall of the Mafia.'' Philadelphia: Running Press Book Publishers, 2007. ISBN 0762427079&lt;/ref&gt;

Natale's reign was not long-lived, either. In the summer of 1999, he was arrested and indicted on a number of federal charges, including murder, attempted murder, extortion, bribery, and drug trafficking. Natale turned state's evidence, and pled guilty in May 2000 to seven murders, four attempted murders, and numerous other charges.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mob Boss Pleads Guilty For His Entire Career.&quot; ''New York Times.''

With Natale in prison, Merlino became the boss of the Philadelphia crime family. But in July 2001, Merlino was convicted of racketeering, extortion, illegal gambling and receiving stolen property (although he was acquitted on a number of much more serious charges, such as murder and attempted murder).&lt;ref name=&quot;Acquitted&quot; /&gt; [[Joseph Ligambi|Joseph &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; Ligambi]] was named Acting Boss while Merlino served a 10-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;WeaponsCharge&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Acquitted&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SJerseyNews&quot;&gt;[http://blog.nj.com/gloucester/2007/08/mob_insider_scarfo_jr_looking.html &quot;Insider: Scarfo Jr. Looking to Head Phila.

===New mob leadership relationship with Scarfo Jr.===
The ruptured friendship between Scarfo Jr. and Merlino took on more ominous tones in the late 1990s. Scarfo Jr. had been released from prison in 1997, and largely sat out the Philadelphia mob war. But once Natale was in prison and Merlino was in control of the syndicate, it is alleged that Merlino focused his attention back on Scarfo. One mobster who turned state's evidence testified that in 1999 or 2000, Merlino allegedly sent capo Peter &quot;Pete the Crumb&quot; Caprio and associate [[Daniel D'Ambrosia]] to watch Scarfo and gather evidence about his movements so that a hit might be planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;BodyEvidence&quot; /&gt; Court testimony later asserted that Caprio also stopped a Merlino-ordered hit on Scarfo while Scarfo served time in a federal prison in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ComingSoon&quot; /&gt;

In June 2002, Nicky Scarfo, Jr., went to jail again. He had been arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for helping to run a multi-million-dollar illegal gambling and [[loan shark]]ing operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrackDown&quot;&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2012228251_apusmobindictment.html Porter, David. &quot;NY, NJ Crack Down on Alleged Mob Gambling Rings.&quot; ''Associated Press.''

==Post-imprisonment activities==
Nicky Scarfo, Jr. was released from prison on April 6, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGarvey2&quot; /&gt; The media reported that Scarfo moved to the [[Jersey Shore]] after his release and began an effort to take over the Philadelphia crime family again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glimpse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SJerseyNews&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/20070808_Scarfos_son_nestles_in_at_the_Shore.html &quot;Scarfo's Son Nestles In At the Shore.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''

Shortly afterward, federal investigators began tapping Scarfo's phones and put him under surveillance as part of an inquiry into an illegal gambling, [[extortion]], [[fraud]], and [[labor racketeering]] operation run by Scarfo's best friend and close mob ally, [[Andrew Merola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Glimpse&quot;&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20100111_Scarfo_pal_s_conviction_offers_glimpse_into_mob.html Anastasia, George. &quot;Scarfo Pal's Conviction Offers Glimpse Into Mob.&quot;] ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''

In December 2007, the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported that Scarfo, Jr. had been demoted within the Lucchese crime family in part because of ongoing media coverage of his activities and in part because he intended to start a mob war to regain control of the Philadelphia outfit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20071224_Probes_detailed_view_of_mob_life.html Anastasia, George. &quot;Probe's Detailed View of Mob Life.&quot; ''Philadelphia Inquirer.''
