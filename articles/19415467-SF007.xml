'''Autopackage''' is a [[free software|free]] computer [[package management system]] aimed at making it simple to create a package that can be installed on all [[Linux distribution]]s.

In August 2010, [[Listaller]] and Autopackage announced that the projects will merge&lt;ref&gt;[https://launchpad.net/listaller/+announcement/6593/ Launchpad.net announcement: Listaller and Autopackage will merge]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Projects such as [[aMSN]] and [[Inkscape]] offered an Autopackage installer, and [[Freshmeat.net]] offers content submitters a field to put the URL of Autopackages. The list of available packages is very limited, and most program versions are obsolete (for example, the most recent Autopackage of [[GIMP]] is 2.2.6, even though GIMP is now at version 2.6.10, as of August 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.com/articles/60124/ Autopackage struggling to gain acceptance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autopackage.org/packages/ Projects using Autopackage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

Autopackage is intended to be used for installing binary, or pre-compiled, versions of non-core applications such as [[word processor]]s, [[web browser]]s, and [[personal computer game]]s, rather than core [[library (computer science)|libraries]] and applications such as [[operating system shell]]s. Autopackage is not intended to provide installation of core applications and libraries for compatibility reasons. Using Autopackage to distribute non-core libraries is something of a thorny issue. On the one hand distributing them via Autopackage allows installation on a greater range of systems, on the other hand there can be  conflicts with native package dependencies.

Autopackage is intended as a complementary system to a distribution's usual packaging system, such as [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] and [[deb (file format)|deb]]. Unlike these formats, Autopackage verifies [[dependency (computer science)|dependencies]] by checking for the presence of deployed files, rather than querying a [[database]] of installed packages. This simplifies the design requirements for autopackage by relying on available resources, rather than necessitating tracking all the package choices of all targeted distributions.

Programs that use autopackage must also be relocatable, meaning they must be installable to varying directories with a single binary.  This enables an autopackage to be installed by a non-root user in the user's home directory.

==Package format==

Autopackage packages are indicated by the .package extension.  They are executable [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] scripts, and can be installed by running them. Files in an Autopackage archive are not easily extracted by anything other than Autopackage itself as the internal format must be parsed in order to determine file layout and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/autopackage_designed_by_monkeys/ Criticism of Autopackage format by author of Alien, a package adapter tool]&lt;/ref&gt;

Autopackage programs are installed to hard-coded system paths, which may conflict with existing packages installed by other means, thus leading to corruption. This can usually be remedied by uninstalling an older version of a package being installed with Autopackage.

The Autopackage files can also be installed and removed using the Listaller toolset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listaller.nlinux.org/ Listaller Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Listaller simply includes the Autopackage packages into its own package container format and handles Autopackage like any other Listaller package file.
