==Episodes==
===Pilots (1964â1965)===
''Star Trek's'' [[television pilot|pilot episode]], &quot;The Cage&quot;, was completed between November 1964 and January 1965,&lt;ref&gt;David Alexander, ''Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry'', p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and starred [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Captain Christopher Pike]], [[Majel Barrett]]  as [[Number One (Star Trek)|Number One]], and [[Leonard Nimoy]] as [[Spock]]. After the pilot was rejected by [[NBC]] as being &quot;too cerebral&quot; (among other complaints),&lt;ref name=&quot;cerebral&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Shatner|first = William| title = Up Till Now: The Autobiography| publisher = [[Thomas Dunne Books]]| location = New York| year = 2008| pages = 119| isbn = 0-312-37265-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Hunter chose to withdraw from the role of Pike&lt;ref&gt;David Alexander, ''Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; when creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was asked to produce a second pilot episode (&quot;[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]&quot;) of which an edited version of the same name aired in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry|author=Alexander, David|publisher=Roc|year=1994|isbn=0-451-45440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Star Trek|year=1968|publisher=Ballatine Books|author=Whitfield, Stephen E and Roddenberry, Gene|isbn=1-85286-363-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The Cage&quot; never aired during ''Star Trek's'' original run on NBC. It was presented by Roddenberry as a black-and-white [[workprint]] at various [[science fiction convention]]s over the years after ''Star Trek's'' cancellation, but was not released on [[home video]] until 1986, when [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Home Video]] produced a &quot;restored&quot; release of &quot;The Cage&quot; (a combination of the original black-and-white footage and color portions of the Season 1 episode &quot;[[The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Menagerie]]&quot;) complete with an introduction by Gene Roddenberry.&lt;ref name=&quot;cagehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trekweb.com/articles/2008/11/12/A-Look-Back-at-The-History-of-Star-Trek-First-Pilot-The-Cage.shtml|title=A Look Back at The History of Star Trek's First Pilot &quot;The Cage&quot;|publisher=TrekWeb.com|date=2008-11-12|accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 1988, Paramount Pictures aired a two-hour television special, hosted by [[Patrick Stewart]], called &quot;The ''Star Trek'' Saga: From One Generation To The Next&quot; which featured, for the first time, a full-color television presentation of &quot;The Cage&quot;. In some markets, the special did not air until October 15, 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;cagehistory&quot; /&gt; In the United States, &quot;The Cage&quot; was first released to DVD in December 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;cagedvd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaseinfo.cfm?ReleaseID=470|title=Volume 40: Turnabout Intruder/The Cage|publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com|accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later included on the final disc in both the original and &quot;remastered&quot; Season 3 DVD box sets (listed with the original air date of October 15, 1988).&lt;ref name=&quot;s3_dvd&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;s3_rem&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd_listing&quot;&gt;Both the original Season 3 and &quot;remastered&quot; Season 3 sets list the original air date for &quot;The Cage&quot; as October 15, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The also planned-as-pilot &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; in its original form (production number 02a) had been forwarded to the NBC, but only a re-worked, re-edited, re-formatted, cut version was later aired under the same name not as a pilot but as the third episode of the series (production number 02b). Afterwards, over the years the original &quot;alternate&quot; version was thought to be lost, but later appeared as bootleg VHS tapes at conventions, until a print of it was discovered in 2009 and subsequently released on home video under the title ''&quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot; - The Restored, Unaired Alternate Pilot Episode'' as part of the TOS season 3 box set on Blu-ray&lt;ref name=&quot;DVD News&quot;/&gt;; it has not been released on DVD, yet. This version remains unaired.

===Season 1 (1966â1967)===

Kirk|Captain Kirk]], [[James Doohan]] as chief engineer [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]], and [[George Takei]] as physicist (later, helmsman) [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]]. [[DeForest Kelley]] and [[Nichelle Nichols]] joined the cast as ship's surgeon [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]] and communications officer [[Uhura]] in &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, the first aired episode of the series.

Although her character of Number One was not retained from &quot;The Cage&quot;, [[Majel Barrett]] returned to the show as a new character, nurse [[Christine Chapel]], and made her first of many [[recurring character|recurring appearances]] in &quot;[[The Naked Time]]&quot;. [[Grace Lee Whitney]] appeared in eight episodes as yeoman [[Janice Rand]], beginning with &quot;The Man Trap&quot;.
