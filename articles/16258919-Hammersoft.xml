'''Wyatt Cephus Hedrick''' (December 17, 1888, in [[Chatham, Virginia|Chatham]], [[Pittsylvania County]], [[Virginia]] - May 5, 1964, in [[Houston]], [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], [[Texas]]) was an American [[architect]], [[engineer]], and [[developer]] most active in Texas and the [[American South]].

In 1922, Hedrick began his work as an architect in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas, and three years later opened his own office. He was responsible for many of the tallest buildings in Fort Worth, and several of his works are included on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  In 1918 he married Pauline Stripling.  In 1925, he married Mildred Sterling, and in 1931 his father-in-law, [[Ross S. Sterling]], became [[governor of Texas]].  

Hedrick worked mainly in a stripped-Classical style.  With his extensive university and government work, at one time his firm was the third-largest in the United States.
