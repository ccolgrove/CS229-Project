'''VenevisiÃ³n''' ({{IPA-es|beneÎ²iËsjon}}) is one of [[Venezuela]]'s largest television networks and a Venezuelan [[cable television|cable]] and [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] [[television network]], which is owned and presided over by [[Gustavo Cisneros]]. In the [[United States]], many of VenevisiÃ³n's popular programs have been seen on the [[Univision]] network until 2009.

==History==
The company's roots date back to May 4, 1953, with the establishment of [[Televisa (Venezuela)|TelevisiÃ³n Venezolana Independiente S.A, (Televisa)]], which operated the channel 4 in Caracas and channel 5 in Maracaibo. When TELEVISA went bankrupt in 1960, [[Diego Cisneros]] purchased the remaining assets of the company.  On February 27, 1961, VenevisiÃ³n was officially inaugurated with a special inaugural show in which thousands of people attended, and took place in the stations [[parking lot]].  VenevisiÃ³n began with a capital of 5,500,000 [[Venezuelan bolÃ­var|bolÃ­vares]] and 150 employees including artists, administrators, and technical personnel.  VenevisiÃ³n's original administrators were Diego Cisneros (president), Alfredo Torres (transmission manager), HÃ©ctor BeltrÃ¡n (production manager), and Orlando Cuevas (general manager).

Initially, VenevisiÃ³n broadcast live because they hadn't yet installed the [[videotape|videotape system]]. Except for the news, the elaboration of their programs utilized the technical formats used in movies at that time. In a short period of time, VenevisiÃ³n greatly expanded nationally, and was seen in most of Venezuela on many [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] channels.

In March 1961, the newly created VenevisiÃ³n and the [[United States|American]] television network, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], signed two agreements:  one for technical support and the other for the rights to broadcast each others programs.  Thanks to these agreement, VenevisiÃ³n later began using the videotape system.  In their first year of existence, VenevisiÃ³n made approximately 800,000 bolÃ­vares a month in advertisements.

In 1976, VenevisiÃ³n moved their transmitters, which were located on the top of a building in La Colina, a neighborhood in [[Caracas]] where VenevisiÃ³n's studios can be found, to Los Mecedores, near [[Venezolana de TelevisiÃ³n]]'s studios and [[CANTV]]'s installations.  In Los Mecedores, a tower with an altitude of 100 meters was placed and a powerful new antenna was installed.  With this new antenna, VenevisiÃ³n's signal was able to reach [[Petare]], [[Caricuao]], and [[Guarenas]] with better quality.  In the 1970s, like other television stations in Venezuela, VenevisiÃ³n began experimenting with color broadcasts.  In 1978, the Ministry of Transport and Communications fined VenevisiÃ³n 4,000 bolÃ­vares on two different occasions in one week for violating the regulations for color broadcasting.

In 1982, VenevisiÃ³n began preliminary work in the city of [[El Tigre]] (located in the [[AnzoÃ¡tegui|AnzoÃ¡tegui State]]) to install equipment that would expand and improve their coverage in that region.

On November 1, 1986, VenevisiÃ³n was the first television station in Venezuela to have their very own satellite dish.

On May 27, 1987, The president [[Jaime Lusinchi]], VenevisiÃ³n begin broadcast license in Venezuela on 20 years.

On February 4, 1992, [[Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez]] addressed the nation from VenevisiÃ³n's studios during a [[Venezuelan coup attempts of 1992|coup attempt]] against his government.

Beginning on March 22, 1992, VenevisiÃ³n would broadcast for 24 hours on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. In April 1994, it started broadcasting for 24 hours seven days a week. Today, VenevisiÃ³n is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

In 1995, VenevisiÃ³n was the first television station in South America to include news and movies with [[closed caption]] and the movies in [[Second audio program]] sound.

VenevisiÃ³n held the broadcasting rights to Venezuelan [[baseball]] games during the 2004-2005 and the 2005-2006 baseball seasons.

Since VenevisiÃ³n was inaugurated in 1961, their [[mascot]] has been a [[tiger]].

In 2007, it started simulcasting [[Copa America]] and [[Miss Venezuela]] 2007 in [[HDTV|high-definition]] format.

==International broadcasts==
Many of VenevisiÃ³n's programs can be seen in other countries on [[VenevisiÃ³n Continental]], [[Venevision Plus]], [[Venevision International]] a cable channel completely owned by VenevisiÃ³n.  Other channels, such as [[Univision]] in the [[United States]] and [[Televisa]] in [[Mexico]], broadcast some of VenevisiÃ³n's shows.

==Political position==
VenevisiÃ³n was a vocal opponent of [[President of Venezuela|President]] [[Hugo ChÃ¡vez]]'s government up until 2005, when its criticism was notably toned down.  On April 11, 2002, VenevisiÃ³n, along with most of the other private networks in Venezuela, simultaneously showed ChÃ¡vez's address to the nation in split screen with the shooting of people in a demonstration prior to the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'Ã©tat attempt]]. The next day, [[IsaÃ­as RodrÃ­guez]] announced in a [[news conference]] that ChÃ¡vez had not resigned and that there had been a coup.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Opponents of ChÃ¡vez claim that the government is abusing freedom of speech and press, especially after periodic inspections of the Venezuelan National Telecommunications Commission ([[CONATEL]]) and the implementation of the controversial Social Responsibility in Radio and Television Law (best known as [[Ley Resorte]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Lately, VenevisiÃ³n has been criticized by the Venezuelan opposition and Anti-ChÃ¡vez groups. Since the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2006|Presidential election in 2006]], VenevisiÃ³n has quieted its opposition to ChÃ¡vez, similar to rival [[Televen]] after the [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|2004 recall referendum]]. For the presidential election, Venevision devoted 84% of its coverage to Chavez's positions, and only 16% to the opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;cisneros-nyt&quot;&gt;SimÃ³n Romero, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/05/world/americas/05venez.html?_r=2&amp;n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Venezuela&amp;oref=slogin Media Mogul Learns to Live With ChÃ¡vez], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Many in the opposition and the other anti-ChÃ¡vez TV networks, [[RCTV]] and [[GlobovisiÃ³n]], saw it as a betrayal, and accused VenevisiÃ³n to submitting to ChÃ¡vez. The criticism of VenevisiÃ³n by the opposition increased during the [[May 2007 RCTV protests|closure of RCTV]] by the ChÃ¡vez government. RCTV was the most watched channel in Venezuela, and VenevisiÃ³n was second. Many viewed Venevision of secretly supporting the closure since it would benefit itself. Cisneros, however, said he expected only around a 5% increase in advertising revenue, after accounting for inflation.&lt;ref name=&quot;cisneros-nyt&quot; /&gt;
