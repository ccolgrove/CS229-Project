'''Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X''', or '''LGX''' (pronounced ''igg-drah-sill''), was an early [[Linux distribution]] developed by [[Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated]], a company founded by [[Adam J. Richter]] in [[Berkeley, California]].

Yggdrasil was the first company to create a [[Live CD]] Linux distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;groklaw&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20051031235811490 | title = The Daemon, the GNU and the Penguin, by Dr. Peter H.

The last release of Yggdrasil was in 1995.

[[Yggdrasil]] is the World Tree of [[Norse mythology]].  The name was chosen because [[Yggdrasil]] took disparate pieces of software and assembled them into a complete product. Yggdrasil's company motto was &quot;Free Software For The Rest of Us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanjose&quot;/&gt;

Yggdrasil was compliant with the Unix [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot;&gt;[http://linux.feldt.com/meeting_notes/1996/0215/ygg_pnp.html Linux SIG - Yggdrasil's Plug and Play Linux&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and releases ==

Yggdrasil announced their âbootable Linux/GNU/X-based UNIX(R) clone for PC compatiblesâ&lt;ref name=&quot;96ibiblio&quot; /&gt; on 24 November 1992&lt;ref name=&quot;announce&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | title = ANNOUNCE: Alpha release of turnkey Linux/GNU/X system on CDROM | url = http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-activists/1992/11/25/16649 | first = Adam J | last = Richter | date = 24 November 1992 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | work = linux-activists mailing list | publisher = Kernel Trap }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made the first release on 8 December 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;groklaw&quot; /&gt;
This alpha release contained the 0.98.1 version of the [[Linux kernel]], the v11r5 version of the [[X Window System]] supporting up to 1024x768 with 256 colours, various GNU utilities such as their C/C++ compiler, the GNU debugger, bison, flex, and make, [[TeX]], groff, [[Ghostscript]], the [[Elvis (text editor)|elvis]] and [[Emacs]] editors, and various other software. Yggdrasil's alpha release required a 386 computer with 8MB RAM and 100MB hard disk.&lt;ref name=&quot;announce&quot;/&gt; The alpha release was missing some of the [[source code]] of some of the packages, such as elvis.&lt;ref name=&quot;announce2&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | title = Re: ANNOUNCEMENT: Alpha release Linux/GNU/X unix clone on CDROM for PC's | url = http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-activists/1992/11/25/16676 | first = Adam J | last =  Richter | date = 25 November 1992 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | publisher = Kernel Trap | work = linux-activists mailing list }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beta release was made on 18 February 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;96ibiblio&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | title = THE YGGDRASIL LINUX/GNU/X OPERATING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTION BETA CDROM | date = 18 February 1993 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | work = Order form | publisher = Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated | url =

LGX's beta release in 1993 contained the 0.99.5 version of the Linux kernel, along with other software from [[GNU]] and X.&lt;ref name=&quot;distrowatch&quot;/&gt; By 22 August 1993, the Yggdrasil company had sold over 3100 copies of the LGX beta distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;usenet&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | title = Re: Linux CD-ROMs in general --&gt; Yggdrasil in particular | url = http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-activists/1993/8/22/40419 | first = Adam J | last =  Richter | date = 22 August 1993 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | publisher = Kernel Trap | work = linux-activists mailing list }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production release version carried a pricetag of US$99.&lt;ref name=&quot;groklaw&quot;/&gt; However, Yggdrasil was offered for free to any developer whose software was included with the CD distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;offer&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | first = Adam J | last =  Richter | date = 17 March 1993 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | title = Re: Linux Foundation | work = linux-activists mailing list | publisher = Kernel Trap | url = http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-activists/1993/3/17/26677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an email from the company's founder the marginal cost of each subscription was $35.70.&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;[http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-activists/1992/11/30/16884 Re: ANNOUNCEMENT: Alpha Linux/GNU/X &amp;&amp; Windows/NT SDK/DDK | KernelTrap&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1995, Yggdrasil was believed to be defunct. However, one can still find updates for this system online. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

== Yggdrasil, Incorporated ==

Adam J. Richter started the Yggdrasil company together with [[Bill Selmeier]]. Richter spoke to [[Michael Tiemann]] about setting up a business, but was not interested in joining forces with [[Cygnus Solutions|Cygnus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;groklaw&quot;/&gt;

Richter was a member of [[League for Programming Freedom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kerneltrap&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | first = Adam J | last =  Richter | date = 30 November 1992 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | title = Improvements to Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X CDROM offer | work = linux-activists mailing list | publisher = Kernel Trap | url = http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-activists/1992/12/1/16961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richter was using only a 200 MB hard disk when building the alpha release of LGX, which prohibited him from including the source code of some of the packages contained in the CDROM.&lt;ref name=&quot;announce2&quot;/&gt;

Yggdrasil Incorporated published some of the early Linux compilation books, such as ''The Linux Bible: The GNU Testament'' (ISBN 978-1883601201), and contributed significantly to file system and X Window System functionality of Linux in the early days of their operation.

The company moved to [[San Jose, California]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanjose&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/1996/04/msg00816.html | title = Yggdrasil Debian replacement CD's have arrived | first = Adam J | last = Richter | date = 17 April 1996 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | work = debian-user mailing list | publisher = Debian.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Yggdrasil Incorporated released the Winter 1996 edition of ''Linux Internet Archives''; six CDs of Linux software from Tsx-11 and Sunsite, the GNU archive on prep.ai.mit.edu, the X11R6 archives including the free contributed X11R6 software from ftp.x.org, the Internet RFC standards, and a total of nine non-Yggdrasil Linux distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Linux Internet Archives | work = New Products | publisher = Linux Journal | date = 1 May 1996 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company remained active until at least year 2000, when it released the Linux Open Source DVD, but its website was taken offline afterwards and the company has not released anything since.&lt;ref name=&quot;distrowatch&quot;/&gt;

The company once made an offer to donate 60% of the Yggdrasil CDROM sales revenues to [[CSRG]], but founder Adam J. Richter later indicated that the company would lose too much money and changed the offer accordingly, while still maintaining donations to CSRG.&lt;ref name=&quot;csrg&quot;&gt;[http://www.dnull.com/bsd/oldnews/bsdnew1861.html *BSD News Article 1861&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also had volume discount plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;discounts&quot;&gt;[http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-activists/1992/12/1/16966 Frequently Asked Questions on Linux/GNU/X OS CDROM from Yggdrasil | KernelTrap&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
