==History==
[[Image:Paterson New Jersey from airplane.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Paterson as seen from an airplane, looking south]]
In 1791, [[Alexander Hamilton]] helped found the [[Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures]] (SUM), which helped encourage the harnessing of energy from the [[Great Falls of the Passaic River]], to secure economic independence from British manufacturers. Paterson, which was founded by the society, became the cradle of the industrial revolution in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patersongreatfalls.org/significance.html District Significance], Paterson Friends of the Great Falls. Accessed September 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson was named for [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]], statesman, signer of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and [[Governor of New Jersey]] who signed the 1792 charter that established the Town of Paterson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpunj.edu/university/history/WilliamPaterson_Bio.dot Who Was William Paterson?], [[William Paterson University]]. Accessed September 4, 2011. &quot;He also supported a proposal by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and a group of investors to incorporate them as the [[Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures]] (SUM). In 1792 he signed the charter incorporating SUM as well as a municipal charter covering 36 square miles for the Corporation of the Town of Paterson at the site of the Great Falls of the Passaic River.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect, engineer, and city planner [[Pierre L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]], who had earlier developed the initial plans for [[Washington, D.C.]], was the first planner for the SUM project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jusserand|first=Jean Jules|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u2MUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jusserand,+Jules#v=onepage&amp;q=Paterson&amp;f=false|title=With Americans of Past and Present Days|chapter=Major L'Enfant and the Federal City|location=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|page=184|year=1916|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plan proposed to harness the power of the Great Falls through a channel in the rock and an aqueduct. However, the society's directors felt he was taking too long and was over budget. He was replaced by Peter Colt, who used a less-complicated reservoir system to get the water flowing to factories in 1794. Eventually, Colt's system developed some problems and a scheme resembling L'Enfant's original plan was used after 1846.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patersongreatfalls.org/sum.html Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures], Paterson Friends of the Great Falls. Accessed August 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson was originally formed as a [[township (New Jersey)|township]] from portions of [[Acquackanonk Township, New Jersey|Acquackanonk Township]] on April 11, 1831, while the area was still part of [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]]. Paterson became part of the newly created Passaic County on February 7, 1837. Paterson was incorporated as a city on April 14, 1851, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The city was reincorporated on March 14, 1861.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;&quot;The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968&quot;, John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The industries developed in Paterson were powered by the 77-foot high Great Falls, and a system of water raceways that harnessed the power of the falls. The city began growing around the falls and until 1914 the mills were powered by the waterfalls. The district originally included dozens of mill buildings and other manufacturing structures associated with the textile industry and later, the firearms, silk, and railroad locomotive manufacturing industries. In the latter half of the 19th century, [[silk]] production became the dominant industry and formed the basis of Paterson's most prosperous period, earning it the nickname &quot;Silk City.&quot; In 1835, Samuel Colt began producing firearms in Paterson, although within a few years he moved his business to [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Later in the 19th century, Paterson was the site of early experiments with submarines by Irish-American inventor [[John Phillip Holland]]. Two of Holland's early models &amp;mdash; one found at the bottom of the Passaic River &amp;mdash; are on display in the [[Paterson Museum]], housed in the former [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works]] near the Passaic Falls.

The city was a mecca for [[immigrant]] [[laborers]] who worked in its factories. Paterson was the site of historic labor unrest that focused on anti-child labor legislation, and the six-month long [[Paterson silk strike of 1913]] that demanded the [[eight-hour day]] and better working conditions, but was defeated by the employers with workers forced to return under pre-strike conditions. Factory workers labored long hours for low wages under dangerous conditions, and lived in crowded tenement buildings around the mills. The factories then moved south where there were no labor unions, and later moved overseas. 

In 1919, Paterson was one of eight locations bombed by self-identified anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;Salerno, Salvatore. [http://libcom.org/history/patersons-italian-anarchist-silk-workers-politics-race-salvatore-salerno &quot;Paterson's Italian Anarchist Silk Workers and the Politics of Race by Salvatore Salerno&quot;], libcom.org, February 5, 2011. Accessed November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Paterson opened [[Hinchliffe Stadium]], a 10,000-seat stadium named in honor of [[John V. Hinchliffe]], the [[Mayor of Paterson, New Jersey]] at the time. Hinchliffe originally served as the site for high school and professional athletic events. From 1933â1937, 1939â1945, Hinchliffe was the home of the [[New York Black Yankees]] and from 1935 to 1936 the home of the [[New York Cubans]] of the [[Negro National League (1933-1948)|Negro National League]].  The historic ballpark was also a venue for many professional football games, track and field events, boxing matches and auto and motorcycle racing. [[Abbott and Costello]] performed at Hinchliffe prior to boxing matches. Hinchliffe is one of only three [[Negro League]] stadiums left standing in the United States, and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In 1963, the Paterson Public Schools acquired the stadium and used it for public school events until 1997, but it is currently in a state of disrepair, while the schools have been taken over by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/northeast-region/hinchliffe-stadium.html Hinchliffe Stadium], [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]. Accessed September 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] Paterson played an important part in the aircraft engine industry. By the end of WWII, however, there was a decline in urban areas and Paterson was no exception, and since the 1970s the city has suffered high unemployment rates ([[white flight]]).

Once a premier shopping and leisure destination of northern New Jersey, competition from the malls in upscale neighboring towns like [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]] and [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]] have forced the big-chain stores out of Patersonâs downtown. The biggest industries are now small businesses because the factories have moved overseas. However, the city still, as always, attracts many [[immigrants]], who have revived the city's economy, especially through small businesses.

The downtown area was struck by massive fires several times, most recently January 17, 1991. In this fire, a near full city block (bordered on the north and south by Main and Washington Street and on the east and west by Ellison Street and College Boulevard, a stretch of Van Houten Street that is dominated by [[Passaic County Community College]]) was engulfed in flames due to an electrical fire in the basement of a bar at 161 Main Street and spread to other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patersonfirejournal.blogspot.com/2008/06/last-alarm.html Paterson Fire Journal: Last Alarm]&lt;/ref&gt; Firefighter John A. Nicosia, 28, of Engine 4, went missing in the fire, having gotten lost in the basement. His body was located two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/nyregion/firefighter-s-body-is-found.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Firefighter's Body Is Found | date=January 21, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque honoring his memory was later placed on a wall near the area. The area was so badly damaged that most of the burned buildings were demolished, with an outdoor mall standing in their place. The most notable of the destroyed buildings was the Meyer Brothers department store, which closed in 1987 and since had been parceled out.

Paterson boasts numerous locations on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Passaic County, New Jersey|National Register of Historic Places]], including museums, civic buildings such as [[Paterson City Hall|City Hall]], Hinchliffe Stadium, [[Public School Number Two]] and the [[Danforth Memorial Library]], churches ([[Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (Paterson, New Jersey)|Cathedral of St. John the Baptist]] and [[St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church]],) individual residences and districts of the city, such as the [[Paterson Downtown Commercial Historic District]], the [[Great Falls (Passaic River)|Great Falls/Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures Historic District]] and the Eastside Park Historic District.

In 2011, Paterson was severely affected in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], particularly by flooding of the Passaic which led to the displacement of thousands and the closure of bridges over the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = dolnick  | first = Sam   | title = River, at 100-Year High, Ravages a City That Once Thrived on It  | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 1, 2011    | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/nyregion/paterson-nj-is-devastated-by-floods-after-hurricane-irene.html | accessdate = 2011-09-11   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Touring the area on August 31 with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] Administrator [[Craig Fugate]], U.S. Homeland Security Secretary [[Janet Napolitano]] declared, &quot;This is as bad as Iâve seen, and Iâve been in eight states that have been impacted by Irene.&quot; The president the same day declared New Jersey a [[disaster area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = President Obama declares N.J. a disaster area as residents continue to deal with Hurricane Irene's impact  | newspaper = [[The Star-Ledger]] | date = September 1, 2011  | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/president_obama_declares_nj_a.html | accessdate = 2011-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced that he would visit the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Friedman | first = Matt | title = President Obama to visit Paterson to survey Hurricane Irene damage | newspaper = The Star-Ledger | date = August 31, 2011 | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/president_obama_to_visit_pater.html | accessdate = 2011-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cityblog | title = Obama to visit Paterson on Sunday and the Overflowing Passaic River | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 1, 2011 | url = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/obama-to-visit-paterson-on-sunday-and-the-overflowing-passaic-river/ | accessdate = 2011-09-01   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Herb.

==Neighborhoods==
[[Image:Patercityhall.JPG|thumb|left|City Hall]]
{{Paterson, New Jersey neighborhoods}}
'''The Great Falls Historic District''' is the most famous neighborhood in Paterson, because of the landmark Great Falls of the Passaic River. The city has attempted to revitalize the area in recent years, including the installation of period lamp posts and the conversion of old industrial buildings into apartments and retail. Many artists live in this section of Paterson. A major redevelopment project is planned for this district in the coming years. The [[Paterson Museum]] of industrial history at [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works]] is situated in the Historic District.

'''[[Downtown Paterson]]''' is the main commercial district of the city and was once a shopping destination for northern New Jersey. After a devastating fire in 1902, the city rebuilt the downtown with massive [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts-style]] buildings, many of which remain to this day. These buildings are usually four to seven stories tall. Downtown Paterson is home to [[Paterson City Hall]] and the Passaic County Courthouse Annex, two of the city's architectural landmarks. City Hall was designed by the New York firm [[Carrere and Hastings]] in 1894, and was modeled after the HÃ´tel de Ville (city hall) in [[Lyon, France]], capital of the silk industry in [[Europe]].

The former Orpheum Theatre located on Van Houten street, has been converted to a [[Mosque]] by The Islamic Foundation of New Jersey. The massive structure now known as Masjid Jalalabad, can accommodate 1,500 worshippers.

As with many other old downtown districts in the United States, Downtown Paterson suffered as shoppers and retailers moved to the [[suburban]] shopping malls of the region. Many historic buildings are in disrepair or are abandoned after years of neglect. In addition, Downtown Paterson is an [[Urban Enterprise Zone]]. The city has, in recent years, begun initiatives in hopes of reviving the downtown area. A project called the Center City project will convert a downtown parking lot into a commercial and entertainment center with office space. Downtown Paterson is located in the city's 1st Ward.

'''Eastside Park Historic District''' consists of about 1,000 homes in a variety of architectural styles, including [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudors]], [[Colonial Revival architecture|Georgian colonials]], [[Victorian house|Victorians]], [[Italianate architecture|Italianate villas]] and [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch colonials]]. It is located east of downtown. Once the home of the city's industrial and political leaders, the neighborhood experienced a significant downturn as industry fled Paterson. In recent years, [[gentrification]] has begun to occur in the neighborhood and some of the area's historic houses have been restored. The Eastside Park Historic District is a state and nationally registered historic place. The jewel of the neighborhood is Eastside Park and the mansions that surround it. This section of Paterson once had a large [[American Jews|Jewish]] population that reached 40,000 at its peak, and there is still a [[synagogue]] left.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Vicki. [http://www.nj.com/homegarden/homeimprovement/index.ssf/2009/07/colonial_mansion_restored_in_p.html &quot;Colonial mansion restored in Paterson's once- (and again) grand Eastside Park&quot;], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', July 1, 2009. Accessed September 22, 2011. &quot;Smaller but no less spectacular examples of Tudor, Craftsman, Dutch Colonial, Federal, Greek Revival, Spanish and even mid-century modern homes sprang up over the next half-century. Eastside Park at one point was home to as many as 40,000 Jews, but they decamped rapidly to burgeoning suburbs starting in the late 1950s (though Temple Emanuel, the octogonal art deco neighborhood landmark, didn't pull up roots until 2005).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Eastside Park and what is commonly known as the Upper Eastside are located in Paterson's 3rd Ward. 

'''Manor Section''' is a residential neighborhood in Paterson. It is located east of East 33rd Street, north of Broadway and south-west of Route 20 and the [[Passaic River]]. The Manor section of Paterson is located in the city's 3rd Ward.

'''South Paterson''' is a diverse neighborhood in the city's 6th Ward with a significant [[Arab]] as well as [[Turkish people|Turkish]], and [[Hispanic]] community located east of Main Street and west of West Railway Avenue. A majority of the city's Arabs live in this section of Paterson. Many of the retail shops and restaurants cater to this community. The neighborhood is also characterized by [[Halal]] meat markets which offer goat and lamb, and shop signs in Arabic. South Paterson's Arab community is mostly made up of [[Jordanians]], [[Palestinians]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] people.&lt;ref&gt;La Valle-Finn, Lisa.

Accessed November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lakeview''' is situated in the southern part of the city, the Lakeview Section is a [[middle class]] neighborhood. Interstate 80 runs north of this district. Lakeview is home to the Paterson Farmers Market, where people from all across North Jersey come to buy fresh produce. The neighborhood consists primarily of [[Hispanics]] and [[African American]]s, although this neighborhood also has a sizable [[Europe]]an descent, [[Middle-Eastern]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] population, including a significant [[Filipino American|Filipino]] presence. Lakeview also shares some of the same characteristics as neighboring [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]] as they both share the neighborhood bearing the same name. The Lakeview section of Paterson is located in the city's 6th Ward.

'''Hillcrest''' is a large mostly residential, [[middle class]] [[enclave]], to the west of the downtown area. Its borders' limits are Preakness Avenue to the east, Cumberland Avenue to the west and Totowa Avenue along with West Side Park and the Passaic River to the south. Hillcrest is one of Paterson's most desirable neighborhoods. The Hillcrest section of Paterson is located in the city's 2nd Ward.

'''People's Park''' is a vibrant neighborhood located north of 23rd Avenue and South of Market Street.
Twenty-First Avenue or &quot;La Ventiuno&quot; as it's known by most of Paterson's Spanish-speaking community, is located in the People's Park section of Paterson. It is an active and vibrant retail strip featuring a variety of shops and services catering to a diverse clientele. Twenty First Avenue, home to SLD, used to have a large [[Italian people|Italian]] population. Although there is still a significant Italian presence left in the neighborhood, it also has a large first-generation [[Hispanic]] population, particularly [[Colombian people|Colombian]].

'''Wrigley Park''' is a neighborhood that has suffered from years of poverty, crime, and neglect. It is mostly [[African-American]]. Poverty, crime, open-air drug markets, prostitution, vacant lots, and boarded-up windows are common in this area. However, there are new houses being built and crime has dropped in recent years. This neighborhood is located north of Broadway.

'''Sandy Hill''' is a neighborhood in Paterson located roughly west of Madison Avenue, north of 21st Avenue, south of Park Avenue and east of Straight Street. Due to Paterson's significant population turn-over, this neighborhood is now home to a large Hispanic community, mostly first-generation [[Dominican Republic|Dominicans]]. The Sandy Hill section of Paterson is located in the city's 5th Ward. [[Roberto Clemente]] Park, which was originally known as Sandy Hill Park is located in this neighborhood.

'''Northside''', located north of Downtown, suffers from some of the social problems currently facing the Wrigley Park neighborhood but to a lesser extent. This neighborhood borders the boroughs of [[Haledon, New Jersey|Haledon]] and [[Prospect Park, New Jersey|Prospect Park]] and it is known for its hills and having sweeping views of [[New York City]]. The Northside section of Paterson is located in the city's 1st Ward.

'''Totowa Section''' is a large neighborhood located west of the [[Passaic River]], south-west of West Broadway and north-east of Preakness Avenue. It is mostly [[Hispanic]] but with an increasing [[South Asian]] community, mainly [[Bangladesh]]i. Many Bengali grocery stores and clothing stores are locating on Union Avenue and the surrounding streets. Masjid Al-Ferdous is located on Union Ave, which accommodates the daily Bangladeshi pedestrian population.

A large [[Italian people|Italian]] presence remains in this neighborhood. Many [[Peru]]vian and other [[Latin American cuisine|Latin American]] restaurants and businesses are located on Union Avenue. Colonial Village and Brooks Sloate Terraces are located in this neighborhood. The Totowa Section is located in parts of the 1st and 2nd Wards of Paterson.

'''Stoney Road''' is Paterson's most south-west neighborhood, bordering [[Woodland Park, New Jersey|Woodland Park]] to the south and Totowa across the Passaic River to the west. This neighborhood is home to Pennington Park, Hayden Heights, [[Lou Costello]] Pool, the Levine reservoir, Murray Avenue, Mc Bride Avenue and Garret Heights. A strong [[Italian people|Italian]] presence remains in this neighborhood. The Stoney Road section of Paterson is located in the city's 2nd Ward.

'''Riverside''' is a larger neighborhood in Paterson and, as its name states, this neighborhood is bound by the [[Passaic River]] to the north and east, separating the city from [[Hawthorne, New Jersey|Hawthorne]] and [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]]. Riverside is a [[working-class]] neighborhood. The neighborhood is mostly residential with some industrial uses. Madison Avenue cuts through the heart of this district. Route 20 runs through the eastern border of Riverside providing an easy commute to Route 80 East and [[New York City]]. This section is ethnically diverse with a growing Hispanic community concentrating mostly north and along River Street. Many [[Albanians]] make their home in the East 18th Street and River Street areas. River View Terrace is located in this neighborhood. Riverside is located in parts of the 3rd and 4th Wards of Paterson.

'''Bunker Hill''' is a mostly [[industry|industrial]] area west of River Street and east of the Passaic River.

'''Westside Park''' located off Totowa Avenue and probably best known to young boys of days past for storing the Holland Submarine. Built in 1897 for the U.S. Navy, it became the target of graffiti artists because the fence surrounding it was too low and too close to the submarine itself. The sub is now located in the Great Falls State Park [http://www.patersongreatfalls.org/ Paterson Great Falls National Park], Paterson, NJ.

==Diversity==
Since its early beginnings, Paterson has been a melting pot.  [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans]], [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and [[Jews]] settled in the City in the 19th century. [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an immigrants soon followed. As early as 1890, many [[Syria]]n and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] immigrants also arrived in Paterson.

Many 2nd and 3rd generation [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]] have been calling Paterson home since the 1950s but most recently first generation [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]], [[Peru]]vian, [[Colombia]]n, [[Mexican people|Mexican]], [[Central America]]n, and various [[South American]] immigrants have arrived.
Western Market Street, sometimes called [[Little Lima]] by tourists, is home to many [[Peru]]vian and other Latin-American businesses. In contrast if one travels east on Market Street, a heavy concentration of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]]-owned restaurants, beauty salons, barber shops and other businesses can be seen. The Great Falls Historic District, Cianci Street, Union Avenue and 21st Avenue have several Italian businesses. To the north of the Great Falls is a fast-growing [[Bangladesh]]i population. Park Avenue and Market Street between Straight Street and Madison Avenue is heavily [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]]. Main Street, just south of downtown, is heavily Mexican with a declining [[Puerto-Rican]] community.  [[Costa Ricans]] and other [[Central American]] immigrant communities are growing in the Riverside and Peoples Park neighborhoods. Broadway or Martin Luther King Jr. Way is predominantly black, as is the Fourth Ward and parts of Eastside and Northside. Paterson's black community is made up of a declining population of [[African Americans]] of Southern heritage and more recent [[Caribbean]] and [[African]] immigrants. Main Street between the [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]] border and Madison Avenue is heavily [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Arab]]. 21st Avenue in the People's Park section is characterized by [[Colombia]]n and other [[Latin America]]n restaurants and shops.

Every summer, Patersonians have enjoyed an African-American Day Parade, a Dominican Day Parade, a Puerto Rican Day Parade, a Peruvian Day Parade, and a Turkish-American Day Parade, though budget cuts in 2011 have meant that parade organizers have been asked to contribute to cover the costs of police and other municipal services.&lt;ref&gt;Schectman, Joel; and Patberg, Zach. [http://www.northjersey.com/news/123730599_Budget_cuts_doom_ethnic_parades.html &quot;Ethnic parades in Paterson likely to be victims of city budget stress&quot;], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', June 13, 2011.

Peruvians were set to celebrate their 25th annual parade in Paterson next month. The event has brought in more than 35,000 people from as far away as Florida.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson is considered by many the capital of the [[Peru]]vian [[Diaspora]] in the U.S. Paterson's Peruvian community celebrates what is known as [[SeÃ±or de los Milagros]] or &quot;Our Lord of Miracles&quot; in English on October 18 through 28th of every year. In the 2000 Census, 4.72% of residents listed themselves as being of [[Peruvian American]] ancestry, the third-highest percentage of the population of any municipality in New Jersey and the United States, behind [[East Newark, New Jersey|East Newark]] with 10.1% and [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]] with 7.01%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epodunk.com/ancestry/Peruvian.html Peruvian Communities], [[EPodunk]]. Accessed July 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson is home to the third-largest Dominican-American Community in the United States, after [[New York City]] and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. In the 2000 Census, 10.27% of residents listed themselves as being of [[Dominican American]] ancestry, the eighth highest percentage of the population of any municipality in the United States and the third highest percentage in New Jersey, behind [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]]'s 18.81% and [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City's]] 11.46%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epodunk.com/ancestry/Dominican-Republic.html Dominican Republic Ancestry], [[EPodunk]].

Paterson is home to the largest [[Turks in the United States|Turkish-American]] immigrant community in the United States ([[Little Istanbul]]) and the second largest [[Arab American|Arab-American]] community after [[Dearborn, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=ST2004/&gt; The Greater Paterson area which includes the cities of [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]] and [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]] and the boroughs of [[Haledon, New Jersey|Haledon]], [[Prospect Park, New Jersey|Prospect Park]], [[North Haledon, New Jersey|North Haledon]], [[Totowa, New Jersey|Totowa]], [[Woodland Park, New Jersey|Woodland Park]], and [[Little Falls, New Jersey|Little Falls]], is home to the nation's largest [[North Caucasian peoples|North Caucasian]] population, mostly [[Adyghe people|Circassians]], [[Karachays]], and a small [[Chechens|Chechen]] community. Reflective of these communities, Paterson and Prospect Park public schools observe [[Muslim holidays]].

Paterson has incorporated a rapidly growing [[Bangladeshi American]] community, the largest in the United States outside [[New York City]]. A branch of the Sonali Exchange Company Inc. has opened on Union Avenue in the Totowa Section; the Sonali Exchange Company is a subsidiary of [[Sonali Bank]], the largest state-owned commercial bank in [[Bangladesh]].

==The greater Paterson area==
The following municipalities border Paterson and are considered to be its [[suburb]]s: The boroughs of [[Prospect Park, New Jersey|Prospect Park]], [[Haledon, New Jersey|Haledon]], [[Totowa, New Jersey|Totowa]], [[Woodland Park, New Jersey|Woodland Park]] (formerly West Paterson), and [[Hawthorne, New Jersey|Hawthorne]], the township of [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], and the City of [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]], all in Passaic County; and the boroughs of [[Elmwood Park, New Jersey|Elmwood Park]] (formerly East Paterson) and [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]].

==Government==
===Local government===
The City of Paterson Municipal Council was created as a result of a 1974 decision to change its form of government from a 1907 statute-based form, to a [[Faulkner Act (New Jersey)|Faulkner Act]] Plan-D [[Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)|Mayor-Council]] form.&lt;ref&gt;''2005 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book'', [[Rutgers University]] [[Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy]], April 2005, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1907 statute-based form consisted of various boards. A Board of Aldermen, Board of Finance, Board of Health, Board of Public Works, Board of Fire and Police Commissioners.

The Mayor-Council plan consisted of the [[Mayor of Paterson, New Jersey]] and nine Council members. Six of the Council members represent the city's six wards while the other three are elected as [[at-large]] members by the entire city. The Municipal Council has the responsibility of reviewing and approving Municipal legislation.

Under the Mayor-Council plan, the Mayor is the chief executive and is responsible for administering the City's activities. The Mayor is elected for a four-year term by the citizens and is responsible for them. His/Her function includes enforcing the charter and the ordinances and laws passed by the City Council. The Mayor appoints all department heads including the business administrator, with the advise and consent of the Council s/he may also remove and or all department heads after giving them notice and an opportunity to be heard.

With the assistance of the business administrator, the Mayor is responsible for preparation of the municipal budget. The Mayor submits the budget to the Council along with a detailed analysis of expenditures and revenues. The Council may reduce any item or items in the budget by a majority vote, but can only increase an item by a two-thirds vote.

{{asof|2011}}, the [[Mayor of Paterson, New Jersey]] is Jeffrey Jones, who defeated two-term incumbent Jose &quot;Joey&quot; Torres in the May 2010 Paterson elections and was sworn into office on July 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/070110_Patersons_new_mayor_sworn_in.html Jeffery Jones sworn in, vows more open Paterson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; City Council Members are Council President Aslon Goow, Sr. (Second Ward), Vice President Anthony Davis (First Ward), Vera Ames (Fourth Ward), William C.

Wimberly (At-Large).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patersonnj.gov/council/ City Council], City of Paterson. Accessed February 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the May 2010 Paterson city elections, City Council President Jeff Jones defeated the incumbent mayor Joey Torres in a three-way election with sixth ward councilman Andre Sayegh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/051110_Jones_wins_mayors_seat_in_Paterson.html Jeffery Jones wins mayor's seat in Paterson upset&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Incumbent Councilman At-Large Kenneth Morris was returned to office and Paterson recreation director and former Paterson Catholic football coach Benjie Wimberly was elected to one of the other At-Large seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;northjersey.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/051110_Wimberlie_Patersons_recreation_director_wins_city_council_seat.html Wimberly, Patersonâs recreation director, wins city council seat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Council At-Large position has been in dispute since the results of the May 2010 election, where newcomer Kenneth McDaniel and incumbent councilman Rigo Rodriguez have engaged in various court battles over the results of the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;northjersey.com&quot;/&gt; When the initial count was completed McDaniel was ahead of Rodriguez by 25 votes. An automatic recount was conducted and Rodriguez gained nineteen votes, with 49 mail-in ballots in dispute. A New Jersey court ruled that 47 of the ballots had to be counted, and Rodriguez's name was on all 47. This gave the councilman a 41-vote victory and he was sworn in with the rest of the council in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/060210_Mail-in_ballots_put_Rodriguez_on_top_in_Paterson_council_race.html Mail-in ballots put Rodriguez on top in Paterson council race&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; McDaniel has continued to insist the ballots were tampered with and filed a motion in state court to overturn the results of the election, but the same judge that ordered the recount dismissed his motion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/104622224_Judge_finds_no_evidence_of_voter_fraud.html Judge finds no evidence of voter fraud in Paterson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, McDaniel appealed to New Jersey Attorney General [[Paula Dow]] to investigate, and the resulting findings caused several Rodriguez aides to be arrested on November 30 and December 1, 2010 and eventually the councilman himself on December 2, 2010 on charges of witness tampering in the court case where McDaniel's claim was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/12/02/winning-candidate-arrested-in-new-jersey-voter-fraud-case/?icid=maing|main5|1|link4|28983 Winning Candidate Arrested in New Jersey Voter Fraud Case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of the Fourth Ward seat currently held by Vera Ames-Garnes is in question as well. Councilwoman Ames-Garnes is standing trial in a [[Hawthorne, New Jersey]] court on a disorderly persons charge. The councilwoman was arrested by a [[Prospect Park, New Jersey]] police officer after she allegedly interfered with a traffic stop the officer made in Paterson after the suspect in the incident crossed over from Prospect Park into Paterson. Ames-Garnes contends that the officer had no right to issue a summons to the suspect, a Paterson resident, while the officer maintains the infraction occurred in Prospect Park and Ames-Garnes' interference was unwarranted. In December 2010 the trial concluded with the councilwoman being convicted, but she was only required to pay a fine and was not forced to forfeit her office. As of January 3, 2011, the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office has not decided whether it will appeal the decision to allow Ames-Garnes to keep her office.

==Education==
The [[Paterson Public Schools]] serve students in kindergarten through twelfth grade and also includes the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology. The district is one of 31 [[Abbott District]]s statewide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090515214519/http://www.nj.gov/cgi-bin/education/abbotts/abbotturls.pl?string=code&amp;maxhits=100 Abbott Districts], [[New Jersey Department of Education]], backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of May 15, 2009. Accessed July 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The school system has over 30,000 students who speak 25 different languages. The school system currently has 52 schools with over 6,000 employees, with a per pupil expenditure of nearly $16,000, of which $8,148 goes towards classroom instruction.

In 2011, all of Paterson's high schools were changed to theme schools, as part of a goal to give students a better choice in areas they wanted to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Leslie. [http://www.northjersey.com/news/030711_Paterson_to_split_JFK_high_school_into_four_academies.html &quot;Paterson to split JFK high school into four academies&quot;], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', March 7, 2011. Accessed November 14, 2011. &quot;Paterson school officials will split the troubled John F. Kennedy High School into four smaller academies so that starting next fall, all public high school students in the city will be enrolled in a âchoiceââ magnet school.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

However the school system in the city has a very poor record in terms of education. A recent statement made by the school broad had declared that out of the city's 30,000 students K-12 only 15,000 ever graduate from the districts high schools. Despite many attempts to improve the over all education outlook, many of the programs have yet to make any real changes. With the city's test scores lacking in many areas, control by the State of NJ was almost certain. In 1988, New Jersey became the first state in the nation to authorize its State Department of Education to take over local school districts that were failing according to an established monitoring process. In 1991, the city of Paterson became the second of the three troubled districts forced to cede control of its public schools to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/08/nyregion/state-seizes-paterson-schools.html &quot;State Seizes Paterson Schools&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 8, 1991. Accessed November 14, 2011. &quot;The New Jersey Board of Education today seized administrative control of the Paterson schools, thus placing two of the three largest districts in the state under its control.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption was that improvement would follow. To date, Paterson Public schools are still controlled by the [[State of New Jersey Department of Education]]. As such, Paterson public schools are managed by a state-appointed Superintendent and a School Advisory Board that serves in an advisory capacity only.

The city is host to the state's annual robotics competition that is held at [[Passaic County Community College]]. The competition called the North Jersey Robotics Competition or NJRC began with the idea to place high educational merit on the students of Paterson.  The competition brings schools from around NJ, to take part in the event. Three events make up the meet which takes place on two different days. As of 2011 the competition has gone on for 10 years. With the 2011 winner being Panther high school of Paterson, New Jersey.

==Arts and recreation==

Paterson boasts a significant parks and recreation system, including larger areas such as Eastside, Westside and Pennington Parks, as well as neighborhood parks such as Wrigley, Robert Clemente, and People's. The [[Great Falls (Passaic River)|Great Falls of the Passaic]] are part of the state, and unofficially the national, park system.

{{Main|Paterson Museum}}
The [[Paterson Museum]], located in the [[Great Falls Historic District]], was founded in 1925 and is owned and operated by the city of Paterson. Its mission is to preserve and display the industrial history of the city. Since 1982 the museum has been housed in the Thomas Rogers Building on Market Street, the former erecting shop of [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works]], a major 19th-century manufacturer of railroad steam locomotives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patersonnj.gov/department/index.php?fDD=24-0 Paterson Museum], City of Paterson. Accessed November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Lambert Castle}}
Belle Vista, locally known as [[Belle Vista (Paterson, New Jersey)|Lambert Castle]], was built in 1892 as the home of [[Catholina Lambert]], the self-made owner of a prominent silk mill in Paterson. After Lambert's death in 1923, his family sold the building to the city, which in turn sold it to the County of Passaic a few years later. The county used the building for administrative offices, and in 1936, provided one room to the fledgling Passaic County Historical Society to serve as its historical museum. As time went by the museum grew, room by room, until the entire first floor became the historical museum. 

In the late 1990s, the Castle underwent a multi-million dollar restoration and all four floors of the building were developed into a museum and library. Today, Passaic County remains the owner of the building and generously supports the facilities' operation; however, the Passaic County Historical Society is solely responsible for the operation and management of Lambert Castle Museum with its historical period rooms, long-term and changing exhibition galleries, educational programs for elementary and middle-school students, and research library/archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambertcastle.org/ Lambert Castle], Passaic County Historical Society. Accessed November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Above Lambert Castle stands an 75-foot observation tower, located at the peak of [[Watchung Mountains|Garret Mountain]], which while technically standing in [[Woodland Park, New Jersey|Woodland Park]], was constructed when the property was considered part of Paterson. The tower is part of the [[Garret Mountain Reservation]] and was recently renovated to its original condition as built by Lambert in 1896, who used the tower to impress guests with its view of the [[New York City skyline]].

Attempts are being made to fund the restoration of the [[Paterson Armory]] as a recreation and cultural center.
