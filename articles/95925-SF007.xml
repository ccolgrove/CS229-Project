'''Maxima''' is a [[computer algebra system]] based on a 1982 version of [[Macsyma]]. It is written in [[Common Lisp]] and runs on all [[POSIX]] platforms such as [[Mac OS X]], [[Unix]], [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], and [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] as well as under [[Microsoft Windows]].  It is [[free software]] released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

==History==
Maxima is based on a 1982 version of [[Macsyma]], which was developed at [[MIT]] with funding from the [[United States Department of Energy]] and other government agencies. A version of [[Macsyma]] was maintained by [[Bill Schelter]] from 1982 until his death in 2001. In 1998 Schelter obtained permission from the Department of Energy to release his version under the GPL. That version, now called Maxima, is maintained by an independent group of users and developers. Maxima does not include any of the many modifications and enhancements made to the commercial version of [[Macsyma]] during 1982â1999. Though the core functionality remains similar, code depending on these enhancements may not work on Maxima, and bugs which were fixed in Macsyma may still be present in Maxima, and vice-versa.

==Features==
Maxima includes a complete programming language with [[ALGOL]]-like syntax but Lisp-like semantics. It is written in [[Common Lisp]], and can be accessed programmatically and extended, as the underlying Lisp can be called from Maxima. It uses [[Gnuplot]] for drawing.

===Numeric calculations===
Maxima is a full-featured CAS ([[computer algebra system]]) that specializes in [[symbolic computation|symbolic operations]] but it also offers numerical capabilities&lt;ref&gt;D. Barnes and D. Chu, Introduction to Modeling for Biosciences, chapter 5,  Springer 2010&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]]: [[integer]]s and [[rational number]]s which can grow to sizes limited only by machine memory, and [[Floating point|floating point numbers]] whose precision can be set arbitrarily large (&quot;bfloats&quot;).

For calculations which use floating point and arrays heavily, Maxima offers the possibility of generating code in other programming languages (notably [[Fortran]]) which may execute more efficiently.

Maxima is a general-purpose system, and special-case calculations such as factorization of large numbers, manipulation of extremely large polynomials, ''etc.'' are sometimes better done in specialized systems.

===Example===

The first 32 rows of [[Pascal's triangle]] (beginning with row [[zeroth|zero]]) may be calculated with

 makelist(makelist(binomial(n, i), i, 0, n), n, 0, 31);

==Interfaces==
Various [[graphical user interface]]s are available for Maxima. '''wxMaxima''' is a popular cross-platform GUI using [[wxWidgets]]. Starting with [[KDE Software Compilation 4#KDE SC 4.4|version 4.4]], the [[KDE Software Compilation]] contains '''[[Cantor (Software)|Cantor]]''' -- which can interface with Maxima (along with [[Sage (mathematics software)|Sage]], [[R (programming language)|R]], and [[KDE Education Project#Mathematics|Kalgebra]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor&quot;&gt;[http://edu.kde.org/cantor/ Cantor], an interface to Maxima (and other mathematics software).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GNU]] [[TeXmacs]] and [[LyX]] mathematical editor programs can be used to provide an interactive GUI for Maxima, as can Sage. Other options include the '''Imaxima''' front end, as well as an [[Emacs]] and [[Xemacs]] interaction mode which is activated by '''Imaxima'''.
