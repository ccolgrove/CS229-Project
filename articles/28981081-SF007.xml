'''LibreOffice''' (pronounced {{IPA-en|ËliË.brÉËÉ.fÉªs|}}) is a [[free and open source]] [[office suite]] developed by [[The Document Foundation]] as a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of [[OpenOffice.org]]. It is largely compatible with other major office suites, including [[Microsoft Office]], and available on a variety of platforms. Its developers' goal is to produce a vendor-independent office suite with [[ODF]] file support, accessible to anyone and led by developers which do not have to sign their name to the product. 

''LibreOffice'' is a [[hybrid word]], meaning &quot;Free Office&quot;. ''Libre'' means ''free'' ([[Gratis versus libre|as in freedom]]) in French and Spanish.

LibreOffice has been downloaded approximately 7.5 million times since its first stable launch in January 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Register&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/28/libreoffice_celebrates_first_birthday/ |author=Iain Thomson |title=On its first birthday, LibreOffice has reason to celebrate |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the default office suite in many [[Linux distribution]]s, such as [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/LibreOffice |accessdate=2 April 2011 |title=Features/LibreOffice |work=fedoraproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linux Mint]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Linux-Mint-11-Katya-released-1250921.html |title=Linux Mint 11 &quot;Katya&quot; released |work=The H |publisher=[[Heinz Heise]] |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[openSUSE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/07/opensuse-11-4-will-be-first-to-roll-out-with-libreoffice/ |title=openSUSE 11.4 Will Be First To Roll Out With LibreOffice |work=opensuse.org |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/features/office-applications |title=Features/Office applications |work=ubuntu.com |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NOTE:

LibreOffice can be run on [[Microsoft Windows]] 2000 (with Service Pack 4 or newer) or newer, [[Mac OS X]] 10.4 Tiger or newer, and [[Linux]]-based systems running [[Linux kernel]] version 2.6.18 or newer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sys&quot; /&gt; Ports for [[FreeBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]] are being maintained by contributors to those projects, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://github.com/bapt/libreoffice-ports |title=bapt/libreoffice-ports - GitHub |author=bapt |date=13 August 2011 |work=libreoffice-ports |publisher=GitHub |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [http://openports.se/editors/libreoffice OpenBSD port of LibreOffice] is being [http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/01/21/developer-interview-robert-nagy/ maintained by Robert Nagy in collaboration with The Document Foundation].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openbsd.org/49.html#new LibreOffice was ported to OpenBSD in time for the 4.9 release.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Initial release===
[[File:libreoffice writer .png|thumb|LibreOffice Writer 3.3 running on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]]]
On 28 September 2010, several members of the [[OpenOffice.org]] project formed a new group called &quot;The Document Foundation&quot;. The Document Foundation created LibreOffice from their former project in response to [[Oracle Corporation]]'s purchasing of [[Sun Microsystems]] over concerns that Oracle would either discontinue OpenOffice.org, or place restrictions on it as an open source project, as it had on Sun's [[OpenSolaris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;doc foundation announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.documentfoundation.org/contact/tdf_release.html |title=OpenOffice.org Community announces The Document Foundation |accessdate=9 November 2011 |author=The Document Foundation |date=28 September 2010 |work=documentfoundation.org |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100930085933/http://www.documentfoundation.org/contact/tdf_release.html |archivedate = 30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;collins-29-09-10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Barry|title=OpenOffice group breaks away from Oracle|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/361516/openoffice-group-breaks-away-from-oracle|publisher=PC Pro|accessdate=9 November 2011}}

It was originally hoped that the LibreOffice name would be provisional, as Oracle was invited to become a member of The Document Foundation. Oracle rejected requests to donate the OpenOffice.org brand to the project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OpenOffice.org Community announces The Document Foundation |publisher=[[The Document Foundation]] |date=28 September 2010 |url=http://www.documentfoundation.org/lists/announce/msg00000.html |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded that all members of the OpenOffice.org Community Council involved with The Document Foundation step down from the OOo Community Council, citing a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArsTechnica1010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ryan|title=Oracle wants LibreOffice members to leave OOo council |url= http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/10/oracle-wants-libreoffice-members-to-leave-ooo-council.ars |work=Ars Technica|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Go-oo]] project was discontinued in favour of LibreOffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go-oo.org/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6344C4AJM|archivedate=9 November 2011|accessdate=9 November 2011|title=Your Office Suite|publisher=Go-oo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements made by the project were merged into LibreOffice. Enhancements made in other forks are also expected to be incorporated into LibreOffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Document Foundation FAQ |publisher=[[The Document Foundation]] |date=28 September 2010 |url=http://www.documentfoundation.org/faq/ |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Edge |first=Jake |title=Michael Meeks talks about LibreOffice and the Document Foundation |work=[[Linux Weekly News]] |publisher=Eklektix |date=28 September 2010 |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/407339/ |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also underway is the reduction of Java dependency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listarchives.documentfoundation.org/www/announce/msg00016.html |title=[tdf-announce&amp;#93; TDF offers preview of future product and technology developments - The Document Foundation Mailing List Archives |publisher=listarchives.documentfoundation.org |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of minimizing security issues and improving application stability.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As a result of the fork of OpenOffice.org into LibreOffice, and the resulting loss of developers, Oracle announced in April 2011 that it was terminating the commercial development of OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARS18Apr11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/04/oracle-gives-up-on-ooo-after-community-forks-the-project.ars|title=Oracle gives up on OpenOffice after community forks the project |accessdate=19 April 2011|last=Paul|first=Ryan|year=2011|month=April|work=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Oracle announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statements on OpenOffice.org Contribution to Apache|publisher=Oracle Corporation|date=1 June 2011|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/statements-on-openofficeorg-contribution-to-apache-nasdaq-orcl-1521400.htm|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would contribute the OpenOffice.org code and trademark to the [[Apache Software Foundation]], which decided to accept the offer and start an incubation process within the foundation.

[[Google]] and [[Red Hat]] began to contribute programmers to LibreOffice in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noyes|first=Katherine|title=Google Throws Its Weight Behind LibreOffice|work=Linux Line|publisher=[[PC World]]|date=20 June 2011|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/230728/google_throws_its_weight_behind_libreoffice.html|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 3.3===
[[File:LibreOffice Impress 3.3.png|thumb|Impress in LibreOffice 3.3.0]]
[[Image:LibreOffice Calc 3.3.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of LibreOffice Calc 3.3]]
LibreOffice 3.3.0 Beta 1, which was based on the beta release of OpenOffice.org 3.3, was made available on 28 September 2010âthe day &quot;The Document Foundation&quot; was announced to act as the suite's public figurehead. The first stable version of 3.3 was released on 25 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name (required) |url=http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/01/25/the-document-foundation-launches-libreoffice-3-3/ |title=The Document Foundation launches LibreOffice 3.3 |publisher=Blog.documentfoundation.org |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because The Document Foundation and most of the software's new and former developers considered LibreOffice a direct continuation of OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice 3.3 continued the OpenOffice.org version numbering.

LibreOffice 3.3 features several functions not found in its OpenOffice.org counterpart, mainly as a result of Oracle's strict policies on tracking copyright ownership. Most of the features found in the 3.3 release were directly adapted from several already-created plugins, as well as the Go-oo fork. Among features unique to LibreOffice are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libreoffice.org/download/new-features-and-fixes/ |title=New Features |publisher=LibreOffice |date= |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LibreOffice has [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] macro support. It can import files from [[MS Works]] and [[Lotus Word Pro]]. [[LibreOffice Draw]] has native functionality to open [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] files, whereas [[OpenOffice.org]] Draw requires an extension.&lt;ref name=&quot;svg&quot;&gt;[http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/SVG_Import_Filter SVG Import Filter] - OpenOffice.org wiki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/svgimport SVG Import Extension] - OpenOffice.org repository for extensions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/SVGTiny2OO SVG Tiny Import/Export] (does not work with OOo 3.1) - OpenOffice.org repository for extensions&lt;/ref&gt;  There is improved [[Windows Metafile|EMF]] drawing and [[WordPerfect]] Graphics import.

Exporting to a number of non-editable formats is supported. All documents can be exported to the [[PDF]] format,&lt;ref name=&quot;LOFeatures&quot; /&gt; as well as presentations to [[Adobe Flash]] (SWF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libreoffice.org/features/impress/ |title=Impress Features |publisher=LibreOffice |date= |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; LibreOffice also has the ability to import documents in read-only mode in the [[Uniform Office Format]],&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenOffice and LibreOffice share the same source code and data formats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Getting_Started/File_formats |title=File formats - Apache OpenOffice.org Wiki |publisher=Wiki.services.openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data Interchange Format]]&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenOffice and LibreOffice share the same source code and data formats&quot; /&gt; and the formats of Microsoft Works,&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenOffice and LibreOffice share the same source code and data formats&quot; /&gt; WordPerfect,&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenOffice and LibreOffice share the same source code and data formats&quot; /&gt; Lotus 1-2-3.&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenOffice and LibreOffice share the same source code and data formats&quot; /&gt;

===Common features===
Unlike OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice uses the [[GStreamer]] multimedia framework in Linux to render multimedia content such as videos in Impress and other programs. Visually, LibreOffice uses the large &quot;[[Tango Desktop Project|Tango]] style&quot; icons that are used for the application shortcuts, quick launch icons, icons for associated files and for the icons found on the toolbar of the LibreOffice programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tango&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom#OpenOffice.org |title=Tango style OpenOffice.org |publisher=Tango.freedesktop.org |date=12 September 2008 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ooo3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ui.openoffice.org/nonav/VisualDesign/OOo30MimeType.html |title=OpenOffice.org 3.0 icons |publisher=Ui.openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used on the toolbars and menus by default. OpenOffice.org uses small icon sizes and the &quot;Classic&quot; or &quot;Galaxy&quot; icon style by default.&lt;ref name=&quot;tango&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnomejournal.org/article/52/dancing-tango-on-the-desktop |title=Dancing Tango on the desktop |publisher=GNOME Journal |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;icons&quot;&gt;[http://www.oooninja.com/2008/04/galaxy-icon-set-theme-look.html OpenOffice.org icon sets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;icons-evolution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ui.openoffice.org/VisualDesign/OOo_icon_evolution.html |title=Evolution of toolbar icons |publisher=Ui.openoffice.org |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LibreOffice also ships with a modified theme which looks native on GTK based Linux distributions. It also renders fonts via [[cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] on Linux distributions; this means that text in LibreOffice is rendered the same as the rest of the Linux desktop.&lt;ref name=&quot;LibreOffice34&quot;/&gt; The first run wizard from OpenOffice.org that guides a user through the setting of user name and the registration process has been removed from LibreOffice.&lt;ref name=&quot;wizard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Administration_Guide/Deactivating_Registration_Wizard |title=OpenOffice.org first start wizard |publisher=Wiki.services.openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future Developments===
In 2011, it was announced that plans are under way to port LibreOffice to both [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ars technia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/10/libreoffice-gaining-momentum-heading-to-android-ios-and-the-web.ars |author=Ryan Paul |title=LibreOffice gaining momentum, heading to Android, iOS, and the Web |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
LibreOffice Online will allow for the use of LibreOffice through a simple web browser by using the [[canvas element]]. Development is ongoing and it has not yet been released.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars technia&quot; /&gt;

==Users==
As of September 2011, The Document Foundation estimates that there are 10 million users worldwide who have obtained LibreOffice via downloads or CDs. Over 90% of those are on Windows, with another 5% on Mac OS X. There are an estimated 15 million Linux users, with most having obtained the software directly from their distribution. This gives a total estimated user base of 25 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;1st ann&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 2011, the administrative authority of [[Ãle-de-France (region)|Ãle-de-France]] (which includes the city of [[Paris]]) has decided to include LibreOffice in a [[USB key]] given to students which contains free open source software. The USB key is given to approximately 800,000 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars technia&quot;/&gt;

The Document Foundation has set a target of 200 million users worldwide before the end of the decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;1st ann&quot;/&gt;
