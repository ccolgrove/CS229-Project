'''Walter Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Medal bar|&amp; Bar]] [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (29 March 1880 &amp;ndash; 6 November 1944) was a [[Anglo-Irish]] politician and businessman. He served as the British minister of state in the Middle East until November 1944, when he was assassinated by the militant Jewish [[Zionist]] group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]. The assassination of Lord Moyne sent shock waves through [[Palestine]] and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac07.htm The 'Hunting Season'. Accessed: 1 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Walter Guinness was born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], the third son of the [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|1st Earl of Iveagh]]. His family homes were at [[Farmleigh]] near Dublin, and at [[Elveden Hall|Elveden]] in Suffolk. At [[Eton College|Eton]], Guinness was elected head of 'Pop', the club for prefects, and was appointed Captain of Boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilson |first=D. A. |title=Dark and light |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=1998 |isbn=0297817183 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 1903, he married Lady Evelyn Hilda Stuart Erskine (1883â1939),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p3019.htm#i30184 |title=Lady Evelyn Hilda Stuart Erskine |publisher=thePeerage.com |date=2006-03-09 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; third daughter of the 14th Earl of Buchan. The [[Earls of Buchan]] were an ancient family in the Scottish nobility. They had three children, [[Bryan Guinness|Bryan]], Murtogh and [[Oswald Phipps, 4th Marquess of Normanby|Grania]].

==Military career==
Guinness volunteered for service in the [[Second Boer War]]. He was wounded, was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] and was awarded the [[Queen's South Africa Medal]] with four clasps, serving as a Captain in the 44th company of the [[Imperial Yeomanry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angloboerwar.com/imperial-yeomanry/2359-44th-company-12th-battalion 44th company IY, list of members&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilson, &quot;they had a devil-may-care ethos and distaste for military discipline...they made lightning raids on [[Afrikaner]] positions; they skirmished ahead of advancing columns.&quot;. At the end of May 1900, led by Major-General Hamilton, they assaulted the ridge at [[Doornkop]], though Guinness was wounded immediately after the battle in mopping-up at Witpoortjie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=153â154
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], he served with distinction in the [[Suffolk Yeomanry]] in [[Egypt]], and at [[Gallipoli]]. He was appointed a [[Brigade Major]] in the [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th division]] in 1916. In the fighting around [[Passendale|Passchendaele]], he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] in 1917, and a bar to it in 1918 during the German [[Spring Offensive]], for personal bravery, which was rare for an elected politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=172â173

His laconic war diaries were published in 1987, edited by Professor [[Brian Bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Guinness | first=W. | title=Staff Officer: The diaries of Walter Guinness 1914-1918 | editor=Brian Bond &amp; Simon Robbins | publisher=Leo Cooper | location=London | year=1987 |isbn=0850520533 | page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==

In 1907, Guinness was elected to the [[London County Council]] and also to [[British House of Commons|the House of Commons]] as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member for [[Bury St Edmunds (UK Parliament constituency)|Bury St Edmunds]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burystedmundsconservatives.com/page/1/336/  pdf - has some results.&lt;/ref&gt; which he continued to represent until 1931. He took the conservative line on [[Home Rule]] for Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]] 5th series, 39, 1129&lt;/ref&gt; suffragism&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]] 5th 19, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and reform of the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]] 5th 22, 311.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the editor of the magazine Guinness owned, ''[[The Outlook (London)|The Outlook]]'', broke the [[Marconi scandal]], accusing [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and other Liberal ministers of share frauds. Other publications developed the story but it could not be proven after lengthy debate. When his role was debated, Guinness explained that he was on safari in Africa at the start, and that his editorâs target was inefficiency, not corruption.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1913-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt; He visited eastern [[Anatolia]] in 1913 and reported that Armenians were being armed secretly by Russia,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 1913-12-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Davison |first=R. H. |title=The Armenian crisis, 1912-1914  |publisher=American Historical Review |location=New York |date=April 1948 |oclc=14285148 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War I]] reduced Guinness's attendances and opponents accused him of cowardice for being in the House at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]] 5th, 84, 658, 1023, 2159.&lt;/ref&gt; In a heated [[Armistice with Germany (CompiÃ¨gne)|Armistice]] speech, he insisted that Germany pay full war reparations, that no ties be made with Russian bolshevism, and: âSince the days of Mahomet no prophet has been listened to with more superstitious respect than has [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]â (of the USA).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1919-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish political developments after 1916 were a concern as the [[Guinness]] business was in Dublin. During the [[Easter Rebellion]] the brewery first aid teams helped both sides. The Guinnesses were opposed to the [[Sinn FÃ©in]] rebels, who hailed the [[Central Powers]] as 'gallant allies'. This had to change and by the time of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] debates in 1922 which established the [[Irish Free State]] he said he preferred âa slippery slope to a precipiceâ and voted in favour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]] 5th, 153, 2330; [[The Times]] 1922-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their politics, during the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the [[Irish Civil War]] his family was popular enough to escape loss or injury. In 1922, the [[Chanak crisis]] caused the coalition Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] to step down unexpectedly in favour of [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]]. Guinnessâs comments on Turkey were a part of the debate; he had come to admire [[Kemal AtatÃ¼rk|AtatÃ¼rk]], despite serving at [[Gallipoli]] and he was appointed [[Under-Secretary of State for War]] under [[Edward George Villiers Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]]. Hereafter, his pronouncements appear less dogmatic. He lost office on the Labour election victory in January 1924, but the following month, Guinness was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. 

Though they had generally been political opponents in 1907-21, Guinnessâs working political relationship with [[Winston Churchill]] started after the election victory in late 1924, when he was made [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury|Financial Secretary]] under Churchill, the new [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]. Together, they put the [[Pound sterling]] back on the gold standard; a point of pride, but not a policy that lasted for long. A ministerial vacancy enabled him to join the Cabinet as [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food|Minister of Agriculture]] from November 1925 until June 1929, where his main success was in increasing the [[sugar beet]] area. The first beet processing factory was built in his constituency, partly on the advice of Martin Neumann (a grandfather of [[Stephen Fry]]), who became a manager there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/past-stories/stephen-fry.shtml [[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)]] online notes; downloaded October 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|Conservative defeat in 1929]], he had to retire from office. He did no stand for re-election in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 election]] and was created [[Baron Moyne]] of Bury St Edmunds in January 1932.

==Business and charitable interests==
[[Image:Kenwood House.jpg|thumb|Kenwood House]]
During his adult life, Moyne was a director of the brewing firm [[Guinness]], established at the [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] by his great-great-grandfather [[Arthur Guinness]] in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S.R. |last=Dennison |coauthors=MacDonagh, O. |title=Guinness 1886-1939 : from incorporation to the Second World War |location=Cork |publisher=Cork University Press |year=1998 |format=the whole book |isbn=1859181759}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm had been listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1886 by his father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinness.com/ Error Page&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.guinness.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moyne also established British Pacific Properties in [[Vancouver]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishproperties.com/ British Properties: West Vancouver Luxury Real Estate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There he commissioned the [[Lion's Gate Bridge]], then the longest bridge in the [[British Empire]], which was opened by King [[George VI]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Browne |title=Bridges : masterpieces of architecture |location=New York |publisher=Smithmark |year=1996 |isbn=0765199424 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was also a trustee of the two charitable housing trusts set up by his father, the [[Guinness Trust]] in London (estd.1888)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnesstrust.org.uk/ &lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.guinnesstrust.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Iveagh Trust]] in Dublin (estd.1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=F.H.A. |last=Aalen |title=The Iveagh Trust: The first hundred years 1890-1990 |location=Dublin |publisher=Iveagh Trust |year=1990 |pages=58â93 |isbn=0951594206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927-28, he helped arrange the gift to the nation of [[Kenwood House]] which contains his father's art collection.

==Yachts==
===Arpha===
{{main|HMS Arpha}}
In 1926, Guinness bought the [[passenger ferry]] SS ''Canterbury'' from the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]]. She was converted to a [[steam yacht]] and renamed ''Arpha''. She was sold to Sark Motorships Ltd in 1938.

===Roussalka===
{{main|SS Brighton (1903)}}
In 1931, Guinness bought the passenger ferry SS ''Brighton'' from the Southern Railway. She was converted to diesel power and renamed ''Roussalka''. On 25 August 1933, ''Roussalka'' was wrecked in [[Killary Harbour|Killary Bay]] but all on board were rescued.

===Rosaura===
{{main|SS Dieppe (1905)}}
In September 1933, Moyne purchased the passenger ferry SS ''Dieppe'' from the Southern Railway. She was converted to diesel power and renamed ''Rosaura''. He used this boat for social cruises, including a voyage in September 1934 from Marseille on to Greece and Beirut with the Churchills as his guests of honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=223â226
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1934, he ventured further to the Pacific, with Clementine Churchill as a guest, and brought the first living [[Komodo dragon]] back to Britain. He wrote two books about the cultures that he had encountered in thousands of miles of travel around the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans. They are now quite rare: ''Walkabout; a Journey between the Pacific and Indian oceans'' (1936) and ''Atlantic Circle'' (1938).

The Rosaura explains Moyne's closer ties to [[Winston Churchill]] which were to result in his untimely death. In 1930, they agreed that the government policies of dropping the [[Pound sterling]] off the gold standard and de-rating to cope with the Great Depression were inadequate, along with proposals for dominion status for India. When the 1931 coalition government was formed, their criticisms meant that as former ministers they were now out in the political cold. From 1934, they also warned about [[Hitler]]'s rise to power and German rearmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=206
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ties to Churchill were also strengthened through '[[The Other Club]]', an informal dining club for politicians in London that Churchill had founded in 1911, which Moyne later joined. A rule was that members had to freely express their opinions. Moyne was there on 29 September 1938 when the bad news came of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s capitulation to Hitler at [[Munich Agreement|Munich]]. Also present were [[Brendan Bracken]], [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], [[Robert Boothby|Bob Boothby]], [[Duff Cooper]], [[James Louis Garvin|J.L. Garvin]], editor of ''[[The Observer]]'', and [[Walter Elliot (Scottish Unionist MP)|Walter Elliot]]. &quot;Winston ranted and raved, venting his spleen on the two government ministers present and demanding to know how they could support a policy that was 'sordid, squalid, sub-human and suicidal'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=222, 227
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, they still shared the minority view in parliament; the majority agreed with Moyne's cousin-in-law [[Henry Channon|'Chips' Channon MP]], who recorded about [[Munich Agreement|Munich]] that 'the whole world rejoices whilst only a few malcontents jeer.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. |last=Channon |coauthors=James, R.R. |title=Chips: the diaries of Sir Henry Channon |location=London |publisher=Weidenfield &amp; Nicolson |year=1967 |pages=172â173 |oclc=53427734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Munich crisis Churchill wrote an oft-repeated comment in a letter to Moyne: &quot;Owing to the neglect of our defences and the mishandling of the German problem in the last five years, we seem to be very near the bleak choice between War and Shame. My feeling is that we shall choose Shame, and then have War thrown in a little later, on even more adverse terms than at present.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gilbert]], ''Churchill A Life'' Henry Holt &amp; Company, New York, 1991; page 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later political career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lord Moyne in 1941.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lord Moyne, signs a Bristol Blenheim bomber of No 139 (Jamaica) Squadron during a visit in September 1941.]] --&gt;
Though an &quot;elevation&quot; to the Lords ends many political lives, Moyne spent part of 1932 in the then-colony of [[Kenya]] overseeing its finances. In 1933, he chaired a parliamentary committee supervising English slum clearances, in light of his experience gained in his family's charitable trusts mentioned above. In 1934, he joined the [[Royal Commission]] examining [[Durham University]] as well as a 1936 committee investigating the British film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=222
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Moyne was appointed chairman of the West Indies Royal Commission which was asked to investigate how best the British colonies in the [[Caribbean]] should be governed, after [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934â1939|labour unrest]] there. The Report and notes were published in 1939 and are held by the [[Public Record Office|PRO]] at Kew, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=4714&amp;inst_id=16 |publisher=AIM25: Institute of Commonwealth Studies |title=Moyne papers on West India Royal Commission |date=1938-1945 |first=W.E. |last=Guinness |id=GB 0101 ICS 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely as a result of his travels and his work in the [[West Indies]], Lord Moyne was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] by his friend [[Winston Churchill]], serving from 8 February 1941 to 22 February 1942. Just before he returned from the Caribbean, his wife Evelyn died on 21 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=228
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, Moyne sought the internment of [[Diana Mosley]], his former daughter-in-law, who had left his son [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan]] in 1932. She had remarried in 1936 in Berlin to the British fascist leader [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]], with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] as witnesses. File No KV 2/1363 at the [[Public Record Office|PRO]], Kew, is part of a collection released in 2004 on British right wing extremists. The PRO's on-line archivist notes that: âDiana Mosley was not interned on the outbreak of war, and remained at liberty for some time. There is a [[Home Office]] letter of May 1940 explaining the [[Home Secretary]]'s decision not to intern her at that time, and then correspondence from her former father-in-law, Lord Moyne, which seems to have resulted in her detention the following month.â Moyne's friend Churchill had become [[Prime Minister]] on 10 May 1940. Moyne's last letter, dated 26 June 1940, is quoted in Anne de Courcy's book on Diana Mosley. Later that day her order of detention was signed by J.S. Hale, a principal Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=de Courcy |title=Diana Mosley |publisher=Vintage |location=London |year=2004 |pages=220â222, 367â368 |isbn=0099470276}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From September 1939, given Hitler's [[Invasion of Poland (1939)]], Moyne chaired the Polish Relief Fund in London and gave over his London house at 11 Grosvenor Place (which is beside [[Buckingham Palace]]) for the use of Polish officers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=229
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the elevation of Churchill, Moyne was invited back to serve in the [[Ministry of Agriculture]] as a Joint Secretary. In a cabinet reshuffle in February 1941, he took on his post in the [[Colonial Office]] and led the Churchill government's business in the [[House of Lords]], with the honorific title of Leader of the House of Lords.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

Moyne was next appointed Deputy Resident Minister of state in [[Cairo]] from August 1942 to January 1944, and Resident Minister from then until his death. Within the British system at that time, this meant control over [[Persia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]. The main task was to ensure the defeat of the [[Axis Powers|Axis forces]] in [[North Africa]], principally the [[Afrika Korps]], who were led by General [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]]. Another concern was the influence on Arab opinion of the [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni|Grand Mufti]], a leader of a [[1936â1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolt]] in 1936-39, who had moved on to Berlin in 1941.

==&quot;Blood for trucks&quot; proposal==
[[Joel Brand]], a member of the Jewish-Hungarian [[Aid and Rescue Committee]], approached the British in April 1944 with a proposal from [[Adolf Eichmann]], the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer in charge of deporting [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungary's Jews]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Eichmann's so-called &quot;blood for trucks&quot; (''Blut FÃ¼r Ware''; literally &quot;blood for goods&quot;) proposal was that the Nazis would release up to one million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. 

Brand was arrested and taken to Cairo, where he was questioned for several months. Brand reported that during one of the interrogations an Englishman he did not know had asked him about Eichmann's proposal, then replied &quot;What can I do with a million Jews? Where can I put them?&quot;. On leaving the room, Brand reported, his military escort had told him that the man who had made that remark was Lord Moyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Brand |coauthors=Weissberg-Cybulski, A. |title=Advocate for the Dead - the Story of Joel Brand |location=London |publisher=Andre Duetsch |year=1958 |oclc=1199641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand told this story to the [[Rudolf Kastner|Kastner]] libel trial in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Y. |last=Bauer |title=The Holocaust in Historical Perspective |location=Canberra |publisher=Australian National University Press |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his autobiography published in 1956, he added a caveat &quot;I afterwards heard that the man with whom I spoke was not, in fact, Lord Moyne, but another British statesman. Unfortunately I have no means of verifying this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weissberg, pp. 167. According to [[Ben Hecht]] ({{Cite book |last=Hecht |first=B. |title=Perfidy |publisher=Milah Press |year=1997 |pages=280 |isbn=0964688638 |location=Jerusalem |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}), Jewish Agency official [[Ehud Avriel]] had demanded that Brand &quot;change the name of Lord Moyne and state that the man ... was another, unknown, British official.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Brand later testified in the [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]] trial in 1961 that it was Moyne who said &quot;What shall I do with those million Jews?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vex.net/~nizkor/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Sessions/Session-059-05.html |title= Eichmann Trial relevant transcript, Session 59 |publisher=vex.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the remark, attributed to Moyne, is regularly quoted by historians. Historian Bernard Wasserstein believes that &quot;the truth is that Brand almost certainly never met Moyne&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wasserstein |year=1980 |pages=34
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Brand's incarceration, both Brand and Moyne were interviewed by [[Ira Hirschmann]], who had been appointed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] as the World Refugee Board delegate in [[Turkey]]. According to Hirschmann, Moyne suggested sending Brand back to Hungary with a noncommittal reply that would enable the Jews there to continue talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Y. |last=Bauer |title=Jews for Sale? |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1994 |pages=194â5 |isbn=0300059132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moyne also supported a proposal to offer money to the Germans instead of trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. |last=Friling |title=Nazi-Jewish negotiations in Istanbul in mid-1944 |journal=[[Holocaust and Genocide Studies]] |volume=13 |date=Winter 1999 |pages=405â436 |oclc=95792215 |doi=10.1093/hgs/13.3.405 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British government did not adopt either proposal.

Derek Wilson has weighed up the matter from the British side: &quot;They concluded that the offer [by Brand] was genuine and reflected the desperation of Hitler's high command. They recommended that it could be safely ignored on the grounds that all the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]s would be liberated within weeks and that, in any case, there could be no negotiations with the Nazis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |year=1998 |pages=238
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British released Brand in October 1944, about one month before Moyne's assassination, after which he joined the group ''[[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'' which would commit the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bauer |year=1994 |pages=194 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long after the war, Brand commented: &quot;I made a terrible mistake in passing this on to the British. It is now clear to me that [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sought to sow suspicion among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi-Western coalition against Moscow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Allied Rift Called Aim of '44 Nazi Ransom Plan' |publisher=''New York Times'' |date=1964-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==

In the early afternoon of 6 November 1944, [[Eliyahu Bet-Zuri]] and [[Eliyahu Hakim]] both Jews of dark skinned Egyptian and Lebanese descent respectively, of the Jewish underground group [[Lehi (group)|''Lehi'']] waited for Moyne near his home in Cairo following a well-planned and much practised plan of action to assassinate Moyne.&lt;ref&gt;http://myrightword.blogspot.com/2008/04/my-historical-curiosity.html 'My Historical Curiosity' by Samir Raafat. Cairo Times, 8 June 2000. Accessed: 1 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They were hanged for the assassination.

Moyne arrived in his car with his driver, Corporal Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to open the front door of the residence and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times, while Bet-Zuri killed the driver. The two assassins fled on their bicycles, pursued by an Egyptian motorcycle policeman who had been alerted by Major Hughes-Onslow. Hakim tried to shoot the policeman but he fired back and Hakim fell, wounded. The two were surrounded by an angry mob until they were extracted by the police. 
Moyne was rushed to hospital but died of his wounds that evening.
As the principal witness at the trial, Major Hughes Onslow became a marked man and was sent to Aden and then to Khartoum for his safety. He subsequently said: &quot;No doubt Lord Moyne could have been regarded as a target for political assassination, but the shooting of the chauffeur was pure murder.&quot; [Source: Major Hughes-Onslow's son, journalist James Hughes-Onslow.]

According to Lehi leader [[Natan Yellin-Mor]], the group's founder [[Avraham Stern|Ya'ir Stern]] had considered the possibility of assassinating the British Minister Resident in the Middle East as early as 1941 (before Moyne held the position).&lt;ref name=BenYehuda-207&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ben-Yehuda |year=1993 |pages=207

As well as being the highest British official within ''Lehi'''s reach, Moyne was regarded as personally responsible for Britain's Palestine policy. In particular, he was regarded as one of the architects of Britain's strict immigration policy, and to have been responsible for the British hand in the ''[[Struma (ship)|Struma]]'' disaster.&lt;ref name=BenYehuda-207/&gt; According to Bell, Lord Moyne was known to the underground as an [[Arabist (political)|Arabist]] who had consistently followed an [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[J.

According to [[Yaakov Banai]] (Mazal), who served as the commander of the fighting unit of Lehi, there were three purposes in the assassination:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=á¸¤ayalim almonim : sefer mivtseÊ»e Leá¸¥i (Unknown Soldiers The Operation Book of Lehi) |first=Y.|last=Banai |coauthors=Eldad, I. |year=1987 |oclc=45473424 |page=276}}{{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#To show the world that this conflict wasn't between a government and its citizens like Britain tried to show but between citizens and a foreign rule.
#To prove that the conflict was between the Jewish People and the [[British Empire|British Imperialism]].
#To take the &quot;War of Liberation&quot; out of the [[Land of Israel]] and the [[Yishuv]]. The trial wasn't planned but the action had to capture a place in the world press and lead political thoughts.

===Moyne's 1942 speech===

Moyne's views were partly outlined in a speech about recruitment of Jews into the British Army in the [[House of Lords]] on 9 June 1942. Moyne said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government have already explained what has been done to arm the Jews for the legitimate purpose of self-defence, and we shall no doubt hear from the noble Lord, Lord Croft, to-day how that process has continued in the last few weeks; but is it not clear that Lord Melchett and the responsible leaders of the Jews in this country generally seek to be saved from [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Lord Wedgwood]] in his attempt to make political capital out of the natural desire of the Jews to do their utmost to defend the cause of freedom against Nazi tyranny?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In regard to the problems of settlement he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It must surely have a deplorable effect upon our Allies to be told by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, and that there are enough Anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This suggestion is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis it is surely those who wish to force an imported rÃ©gime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish rÃ©gime is inconsistent with the [[Atlantic Charter]], and that ought to be told to America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1942/jun/09/recruitment-of-jews#S5LV0123P0-00335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the House of Lords in the 1940s Moyne spoke on many other subjects as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/search/Moyne?decade=1940s&amp;page=12 Hansard searched for &quot;Moyne&quot; in 1940s]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
After the assassination, ''Lehi'' announced: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We accuse Lord Moyne and the government he represents, with murdering hundreds and thousands of our brethren; we accuse him of seizing our country and looting our possessions... We were forced to do justice and to fight&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Bet-Zuri and Hakim initially gave false names, but their true identities were soon discovered. They were tried in an Egyptian court.

Eventually, the Lehi members were found guilty and on 11 January 1945, they were sentenced to death. Their appeals for clemency were dismissed, probably partly in response to pressure from Winston Churchill, who had been Moyne's ally and close personal friend.&lt;ref name=Hecht280/195&gt;[[Ben Hecht|Hecht, B.]]. ''Perfidy''(1999). Jerusalem: Milah Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;280, footnote 195. ISBN 0-9646886-3-8; Wasserstein (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were [[hanged]] on 23 March. The gun used to shoot Moyne was found to have been used in a sequence of killings in Palestine going back to 1937. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Incongruously for people so opposed to the [[British Empire]], while awaiting execution the two asked for (and were given) the poems of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]; most likely because of [[Recessional (poem)|&quot;Recessional&quot;]].

==Aftermath==
Although the group had been targeting British Mandate personnel since 1940, Moyne was the first high-profile British official to be killed by them (several failed attempts had been made to assassinate the British High Commissioner in Palestine, Sir [[Harold MacMichael]]). This was therefore the opening shot in the new ''Lehi'' campaign.

Jewish authorities in Palestine, fearful of British retribution, were quick to distance themselves from ''Lehi'' actions. On the news of Moyne's death, [[Chaim Weizmann]], who later became the first [[President of Israel]], is reported to have said that the death was more painful to him than that of his own son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht280/195&quot;/&gt; 

British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]], who once described himself as a &quot;Zionist&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=726 The Last Romantic Zionist Gentile] winstonchurchill.org&lt;/ref&gt; for the time being tempered his support for Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M.J. |last=Cohen |title=Churchill and the Jews |location=London |publisher=Frank Cass |year=1985 |pages=306â308, 340 |isbn=0714632546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wasserstein |year=1980 |pages=36â37
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyne had been sent to Cairo because of their long personal and political friendship, and Churchill told the House of Commons:

:&quot;If our dreams for Zionism are to end in the smoke of an assassin's pistol, and the labours for its future produce a new set of gangsters worthy of Nazi Germany, then many like myself will have to reconsider the position we have maintained so consistently and so long in the past&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Gilbert |title=Churchill A Life |location=New York |publisher=Holt |year=1991 |isbn=080500615X |page=803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' of London quoted ''[[Ha'aretz]]'''s view that the assassins &quot;have done more by this single reprehensible crime to demolish the edifice erected by three generations of Jewish pioneers than is imaginable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times, 1944-11-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyne's parliamentary friend and cousin-in-law, [[Henry Channon|Henry 'Chips' Channon M.P.]] told his diary: 

:&quot;I went to sleep last night with strange emotions. Walter Moyne was an extraordinary man, colossally rich, well-meaning, intelligent, scrupulous, yet a viveur, and the only modern Guinness to play a social or political role... He was careful with his huge fortune, though he had probably about three millions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. |last=Channon |coauthors=James, R.R. (ed.) |title=Chips: the diaries of Sir Henry Channon |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=1967 |pages=396â397 |oclc=12190801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1943, a committee of the British Cabinet had proposed a partition of Palestine after the war, based loosely on the 1937 [[Peel Commission]] proposal. The plan included a Jewish state, a small residual mandatory area under British control, and an Arab state to be joined in a large Arab federation of Greater Syria. The Cabinet approved the plan in principle in January 1944, but it faced severe opposition from the Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] among others. &quot;Moyne's position differed from that of nearly all the British civil and military officials in the Middle East: the consensus of British official opinion in the area opposed partition and opposed a Jewish state; Moyne supported both.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wasserstein |year=1980 |pages=36
 | title = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The partition plan was before the Cabinet for final approval in the same week that Moyne was assassinated, but the assassination caused it to be immediately shelved and never resurrected. Moyne's successor in Cairo, Sir [[Edward Grigg]], was opposed to partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Sofer |coauthors=Shefer-Vanson, D. |title=Zionism and the Foundations of Israeli Diplomacy |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0521630126 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians, such as Wasserstein and Porath, have speculated that a Jewish state soon after the war had been a real possibility.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Y. |last=Porath |title=In Search of Arab Unity 1930-1945 |location=London |publisher=Frank Cass |year=1986 |pages=134â148 |isbn=0714632643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Brenner writes that the purpose of the attack on Moyne was also in order to show the efficacy of armed resistance and to demonstrate to the British that they were not safe in any place as long as they remained in Palestine. The assassination also seemed to have an impact on the Arab side, particularly in stimulating Egyptian nationalism. Brenner makes a comparison between Moyneâs death and the assassination of pro-British [[Ahmad Mahir Pasha]]. There were Lehi members who advocated the formation of a &quot;Semitic Bloc&quot; opposing foreign domination, and this made it possible for Arabs to actually join Lehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Y.S. |last=Brenner |title=The 'Stern Gang' 1940-48 |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |date=October 1965 |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the bodies of Ben Zuri and Hakim were returned to Israel in exchange for twenty prisoners from Gaza and Sinai.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times27&quot;&gt;Mr Rabin leads Israel mourning for assassins, ''The Times'', 1975-06-27, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They were laid in state in the Jerusalem Hall of Heroism, where they were attended by many dignitaries including Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin|Rabin]] and President [[Ephraim Katzir|Katzir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JP27&quot;&gt;Beit-Tzuri and Hakim are reinterred, ''Jerusalem Post'', 1975-06-27, pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Then they were buried in the military section of [[Mount Herzl|Mount Herzl cemetery]] in a state funeral with full military honors.&lt;ref name=&quot;JP27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel honours British minister's assassins, ''The Times'', 1975-06-26, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain lodged a formal protest.&lt;ref&gt;Israel defends honours for Moyne killers, ''The Times'', 1975-07-01, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, postage stamps were issued in their honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ben-Yehuda |year=1993 |pages=210 |title=small image of stamps here |url=http://www.bait-tov.com/store/products/6110s391.jpg |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
