'''xMule''' â the [[X11]] Mule â is a client for the [[EDonkey Network|eDonkey]] [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] network, originally intended to bring it to virtually all the major [[Unix]] platforms, with a particular emphasis on [[Linux]]. The project is no longer being developed, and users of xMule are encouraged to move to the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] network or use [[aMule]] in the official xMule website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xmule.ws/node/59 | title = Development Status | accessdate = 2009-01-26 | work = xMule }}&lt;/ref&gt;

xMule is a [[Fork (software)|fork]] of the [[lMule]] client, which itself was originally a Linux-only port of the [[eMule]] client.  Due to severe differences between the developers, a new fork was created with the [[aMule]] project on August 18, 2003; the day that one of xMule's maintainers, Ted R. Smith, was sued by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

xMule has since suffered from negative publicity through anonymous comments on software review sites such as [[GnomeFiles]] and Zeropaid, some of them even suggesting that the xMule project had stopped (while promoting [[aMule]]) when it was not the case at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gnomefiles.org/comment.php?soft_id=462 | title = GnomeFiles posts | accessdate = 2006-07-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060522111118/http://gnomefiles.org/comment.php?soft_id=462 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = xMule | url = http://www.zeropaid.com/xmule/ | work = Zeropaid | accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official [[aMule]] page solely states that &quot;relations between the two projects are sadly in a rather sorry state&quot;, whereas xMule's site contains an extensive manifesto on the issue, which goes as far as drawing comparisons to the different coding philosophies behind [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Mozilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amule.org/wiki/index.php/XMule | title = xMule | work = AMule Project wiki | accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.xmule.ws/phpnuke/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2 | title = The Coding Philosophies of xMule vs aMule | accessdate = 2006-07-23 | work = xMule }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
The name xMule was created as the new official name for the [[lMule]] project when it was first ported to FreeBSD in early May [[2003]] and the maintainers effectively lost control of the lMule website.[http://www.xmule.ws/lmuleorg_takeover.txt] [http://lmule.sourceforge.net/news.php]
