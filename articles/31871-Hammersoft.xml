In the course of ordinary activities, someone &quot;using&quot; [[ubiquitous]] computing engages many computational devices and systems simultaneously, and may not necessarily even be aware that they are doing so. This model is usually considered an advancement from the [[Desktop environment|desktop paradigm]]. More formally Ubiquitous computing is defined as &quot;machines that fit the human environment instead of forcing humans to enter theirs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. York, P.C. Pendharkar, &quot;Humanâcomputer interaction issues for mobile computing in a variable work context,&quot; Int. J. Human-Computer Studies 60 (2004) 771â797&lt;/ref&gt;

This paradigm is also described as '''pervasive computing''', [[ambient intelligence]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pervasive Computing: The Mobile World|last=Hansmann|first=Uwe|year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540002189}}&lt;/ref&gt; where each term emphasizes slightly different aspects. When primarily concerning the objects involved, it is also '''physical computing''', the ''[[Internet of Things]]'', ''haptic computing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''things that think''.
Rather than propose a single definition for ubiquitous computing and for these related terms, a taxonomy of properties for ubiquitous computing has been proposed, from which different kinds or flavors of ubiquitous systems and applications can be described.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poslad&quot;&gt;

== Core concept ==
At their core, all models of ubiquitous computing share a vision of small, inexpensive, robust networked processing devices, distributed at all scales throughout everyday life and generally turned to distinctly common-place ends. For example, a domestic ubiquitous computing environment might interconnect lighting and environmental controls with personal biometric monitors woven into clothing so that illumination and heating conditions in a room might be modulated, continuously and imperceptibly. Another common scenario posits refrigerators &quot;aware&quot; of their suitably tagged contents, able to both plan a variety of menus from the food actually on hand, and warn users of stale or spoiled food.

Ubiquitous computing presents challenges across computer science: in systems design and engineering, in systems modelling, and in user interface design. Contemporary human-computer interaction models, whether [[command-line]], menu-driven, or [[GUI]]-based, are inappropriate and inadequate to the ubiquitous case. This suggests that the &quot;natural&quot; interaction paradigm appropriate to a fully robust ubiquitous computing has yet to emerge - although there is also recognition in the field that in many ways we are already living in an ubicomp world. Contemporary devices that lend some support to this latter idea include [[mobile phone]]s, [[digital audio player]]s, [[radio-frequency identification]] tags, [[GPS]], and [[interactive whiteboard]]s.

[[Mark Weiser]] proposed three basic  forms for ubiquitous system devices, see also [[Smart device]]: tabs, pads and boards.
* ''Tabs'': wearable centimetre sized devices
* ''Pads'': hand-held decimetre-sized devices
* ''Boards'': metre sized interactive display devices.
These three forms proposed by Weiser are characterized by being macro-sized, having a planar form and on incorporating visual output displays. If we relax each of these three characteristics we can expand this range into a much more diverse and potentially more useful range of Ubiquitous Computing devices. Hence, three additional forms for ubiquitous systems have been proposed:&lt;ref name=&quot;Poslad&quot;/&gt;
* ''Dust'': miniaturized devices can be without visual output displays, e.g., Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]), ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres. See also [[Smart dust]].
* ''Skin'': fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers, organic computer devices, can be formed into more flexible non-planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains, see [[OLED display]]. MEMS device can also be painted onto various surfaces so that a variety of physical world structures can act as networked surfaces of MEMS.
* ''Clay'': ensembles of MEMS can be formed into arbitrary three dimensional shapes as artefacts resembling many different kinds of physical object (see also [[Tangible interface]]).

In his book ''The Rise of the Network Society'', [[Manuel Castells]] suggests that there is an ongoing shift from already-decentralised, stand-alone microcomputers and mainframes towards entirely pervasive computing. In his model of a pervasive computing system, Castells uses the example of the Internet as the start of a pervasive computing system. The logical progression from that paradigm is a system where that networking logic becomes applicable in every realm of daily activity, in every location and every context. Castells envisages a system where billions of miniature, ubiquitous inter-communication devices will be spread worldwide, &quot;like pigment in the wall paint&quot;.

==History==
[[Mark Weiser]] coined the phrase &quot;ubiquitous computing&quot; around 1988, during his tenure as Chief Technologist of the [[Xerox]] [[Xerox PARC|Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)]]. Both alone and with PARC Director and Chief Scientist  [[John Seely Brown]], Weiser wrote some of the earliest papers on the subject, largely defining it and sketching out its major concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiser91&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/SciAmDraft3.html|title=The Computer for the 21st Century|year=1991|last=Weiser|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Weiser|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/384/weiser.html|title=Ubiquitous computing|date=1999-05-11|author = Weiser; Gold; Brown|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiser96&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html|title=Ubiquitous computing|date=1996-03-17|last=Weiser|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Weiser|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing that the extension of processing power into everyday scenarios would necessitate understandings of social, cultural and psychological phenomena beyond its proper ambit, Weiser was influenced by many fields outside computer science, including &quot;[[philosophy]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[post-Modernism]], [[sociology of science]] and [[feminist criticism]].&quot; He was explicit about &quot;the humanistic origins of the âinvisible ideal in post-modernist thought'&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiser96&quot;/&gt; referencing as well the ironically [[dystopia]]n [[Philip K. Dick]] novel [[Ubik]].

[[Ken Sakamura|Dr. Ken Sakamura]] of [[University of Tokyo]], [[Japan]] leads the Ubiquitous Networking Laboratory (UNL), [[Tokyo]] as well as the [[T-Engine Forum]]. The joint goal of Sakamura's Ubiquitous Networking specification and the T-Engine forum, is to enable any everyday device to broadcast and receive information.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1427641 T-Engine, arguably the most advanced ubiquitous computing platform in the world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t-engine.org/forum-guide/t-engine-summary&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradiso]] and [[Rosalind Picard]]) at the [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttt.media.mit.edu|title=MIT Media Lab - Things That Think Consortium|publisher=[[MIT]]|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CSAIL effort known as [[Project Oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxygen.csail.mit.edu/Overview.html|title=MIT Project Oxygen: Overview|publisher=[[MIT]]|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major contributors include [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing|College of Computing]], [[New York University|NYU]]'s [[NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program|Interactive Telecommunications Program]], [[UC Irvine]]'s Department of Informatics, [[Microsoft Research]], [[Intel]] Research and Equator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/equator/ |title=Equator |publisher=[[University College London|UCL]]|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ajou University UCRi &amp; CUS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center_of_excellence_for_Ubiquitous_System|url=http://www.cuslab.com|publisher=CUS|accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An introduction to the field appropriate for general audiences is [[Adam Greenfield]]'s book ''Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing'' (ISBN 0-321-38401-6). Greenfield describes the interaction paradigm of ubiquitous computing as &quot;information processing dissolving in behavior&quot;.
