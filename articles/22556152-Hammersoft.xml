In 2000, the School of Arts and Sciences of the university, which comprises the College and the Graduate School, restructured into the four Loyola Schools of Humanities, Management, Science and Engineering, and Social Sciences. The School of Management was named after the Filipino businessman John Gokongwei who donated Php 200 million for the construction of the school's main building, which was dedicated in 2002. The school offers undergraduate programs in management and entrepreneurship.
