==League History==
===1920s===
*The league began slowly in the 1920s with baseball and basketball serving as the primary sports of competition between the schools.  The first 16 teams to be members were '''Apple Creek''', '''Big Prairie''', '''Burbank''', '''Chester''', '''Congress''', '''Creston''', '''Dalton''', '''Doylestown''', '''Fredericksburg''', '''Marshallville''', '''Mount Eaton/Paint Township''', '''Rittman''', '''Shreve''', '''Smithville''', '''Sterling''', and '''West Salem'''.  
*Apple Creek, Dalton, Doylestown and Rittman had the earliest (and at times, the only) football programs in the league.  They competed in the '''Wayne County 'B' League''' beginning in 1924.
*Apple Creek dropped football after the 1928 season.

===1930s===
*In the later 30s, Rittman left the league after becoming an exempted village school while Big Prairie became part of the [[Holmes County, Ohio|Holmes County]] school system. 
*In the spring of 1938, a Wayne County Coaches Association was formed to help organize the league's athletic play.
*Marshallville lost their high school in 1938 when the state told them they could no longer function as a three-year high school.  They began sending their students to Dalton for the 1938-39 school year.  

===1940s===
*The former Marshallville High School was torn down in 1940 and replaced with an updated elementary school.

===1950s===
*In 1951, '''Northwestern''' was created by merging Chester, Congress and West Salem with the northwestern areas of the county.  They began calling themselves the 'Huskies' and borrowed Chester's blue and Congress' gray as their new colors.
*In 1953, '''Norwayne''' was created with the merger of Burbank, Creston, and Sterling.  The original proposed name for the district was 'Burlington' (BURbank, SterLING, and CresTON), but residents preferred the acronym for &quot;Northern Wayne&quot; County.  They chose the nickname 'Bobcats.'
*In 1954, the first official football season began for the Wayne County Athletic League with Dalton, Doylestown, and Rittman playing right away.  Norwayne began playing the following year, while Shreve, Smithville, and Waynedale started up in 1956.
*In 1955, Apple Creek, Fredericksburg, and Mt. Eaton/Paint Township consolidated to make '''Waynedale''' (the [[valley|dale]] area of Wayne County).  They became the 'Golden Bears.' 
*Also in 1955, to prevent Marshallville students from being bused across the [[Orrville City School District|Orrville]] school district territory into Dalton, Marshallville's district was merged with Smithville's.  This move enabled the Smithies to start up a football team, but also caused a rivalry to start up with Dalton. 
*The league makeup was now at 8 schools: Dalton, Doylestown, Northwestern, Norwayne, Rittman, Shreve, Smithville, and Waynedale.

===1960s===
*Rittman was invited back into the league in 1961 as a full-time member.
*'''Triway''' was created in 1963 when Shreve ([[Clinton Township, Wayne County, Ohio|Clinton Township]]) combined with [[Franklin Township, Wayne County, Ohio|Franklin]] and [[Wooster Township, Wayne County, Ohio|Wooster]] townships.  They called themselves the 'Titans', after the new [[American Football League|AFL]] [[New York Jets|team]] based in [[New York City]].
*Northwestern began league football play in 1965.

===1970s===
*In 1970, Triway left the league for the [[Chippewa Conference (OHSAA)|Chippewa Conference]] and was replaced by '''Hillsdale''', who had come over from the [[Firelands Conference (OHSAA)|Firelands Conference]].
*Upon opening a much-needed new high school in 1971, Doylestown changed their name to '''Chippewa High School''' to reflect the trend that most of the district's residents were living in Chippewa Township and not within Doylestown itself.  They felt it redundant to call themselves the 'Chippewa Chippewas', so they shortened their nickname to the 'Chipps.'  Despite these changes, many locals still refer to the school as &quot;Doylestown.&quot;

===2010s===
On December 3, 2011, the WCAL had its first-ever state football champion when Norwayne defeated Kenton 48-42 in the Division IV championship at Paul Brown Tiger Stadium in [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dorksen| first = Aaron| title = STATE CHAMPIONS!
