The fourth season of ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'' premiered on August 9, 2009. All three judges and host [[Mario Lopez]] and backstage correspondent [[Layla Kayleigh]] from the previous seasons signed on for season 4. However, for the first time since the beginning of ABDC, DJ Rashida was not present as the show's DJ, as she was touring with [[Lady GaGa]] and [[JabbaWockeeZ]].&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/DJRashida&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the first broadcast, MTV announced in a broadcast trailer that the show would be moving to its new Sunday night slot at 9pm ET/PT for the duration of the season. In Canada, [[MuchMusic]] aired this season at the same time as its MTV broadcast. In previous seasons, it was aired 3 days after MTV aired it. Unlike previous seasons, there was no live audition special.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reality-tv-online.com/blog/americas-best-dance-crew-season-4-premier-august-9th-at-900-pm-on-mtv/&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2009, [[We Are Heroes]] was declared the winner of Season 4 and received the $100,000 ([[United States dollar|USD]]) prize.&lt;ref&gt;http://bloggingbestdancecrew.blogspot.com/2009/06/its-official-first-episode-airs-august.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 2009, as a prologue for the season four, the show premiered a special hosted by Randy Jackson called &quot;The Top 10 Performances of All Time&quot; where Randy showed his top 10 picks of the first three seasons.

This was also the last season to feature Shane Sparks as a judge.

==Crews==
Like [[America's Best Dance Crew (Season 3)|season 3]], nine crews were selected in this season of ''America's Best Dance Crew''. Also, like the previous season, there was no Live Audition special. The nine crews were not divided into the usual four regions (East, West, Midwest, and South), but each crew's banner still listed where each crew was from. This was also the first season to showcase crews from three regions instead of the four. Continuing the show's crossover with [[So You Think You Can Dance (US)|So You Think You Can Dance]], among the competitors this season is Donyelle Jones from Artistry in Motion, a finalist from the [[So You Think You Can Dance (season 2)|second season]] of So You Think You Can Dance.

[[MTV]] began casting for season 4 on June 6, 2009 in Los Angeles. The crews were chosen from across America from the four audition cities ([[New York, New York]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Orlando, Florida]]; and [[Los Angeles, California]]) and were recently announced by MTV.&lt;ref&gt;http://bloggingbestdancecrew.blogspot.com/2009/07/season-4-crews-are-announced.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

New York's Vogue Evolution made ABDC history as the first group featuring five openly gay members; one of them being a transgender female. [[We Are Heroes]] of Los Angeles made ABDC history as well by becoming the first all-female crew to win the title of America's Best Dance Crew.
