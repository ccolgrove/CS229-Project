'''''Abacab''''', released in 1981, is the 11th studio album by British band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. It reached No.1 in the UK, where it remained in the charts for 27 weeks.

==Background and recording==
The album continues the band's sharp stylistic shift, begun on the preceding album ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'', toward a [[Music radio|radio]]-friendly pop music sound. &quot;No Reply At All&quot; features the [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] [[horn section]] (as did Collins' solo album ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' earlier in 1981).

Genesis produced ''Abacab'' solely by themselves. Engineer [[Hugh Padgham]], who assisted Collins on ''Face Value'', would continue to work on Genesis and Collins recordings through the end of the decade.

The album takes its name from an early [[arrangement]] of the title track. [[Mike Rutherford]] said on the US radio show In the Studio with Redbeard (which spotlighted ''Duke'' and ''Abacab'' in one episode): &quot;There were three bits of music in 'Abacab', and we referred to them as 'section a', 'section b', and 'section c'... and at different times, they were in different order. We'd start with 'section a' and then have 'section c'... and at one point in time, it spelled Abacab. On the final version, it's not that at all, it's like 'Accaabbaac'.&quot;

Three songs from the ''Abacab'' sessionsâ&quot;Paperlate,&quot; &quot;You Might Recall,&quot; and &quot;Me &amp; Virgil&quot;âwere issued on the ''[[3 X 3]]'' [[Extended play|EP]]. They were also issued on the non-UK releases of 1982's ''[[Three Sides Live]]''. Two other songs from the sessions, &quot;Naminanu&quot; and &quot;Submarine&quot;, appeared as B-sides on the &quot;Abacab&quot; singles, but were originally intended to be part of &quot;Dodo/Lurker&quot;, where the order would have been &quot;Naminanu/Dodo/Lurker/Submarine&quot;.

&quot;[[No Reply at All]]&quot; was performed live by [[Phish]] as a tribute to Genesis at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 2010 induction ceremony.

==Release==
The album was released with four different embossed covers simultaneously across the country, all depicting the same collage but with the paper shapes in different colours. The four different cover variants are usually identified by the colour of the largest upper shape adjacent to the title lettering; this shape being coloured navy blue, red, peach, and yellow.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised the album for shedding the &quot;ivory-tower artistry&quot; of their previous albums, turning to sparse arrangements and &quot;highly rhythmic interplay&quot; and drawing inspiration from popular contemporaries such as [[XTC]] and [[The Police]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone review&quot;/&gt; [[Allmusic]]'s retrospective review echoed this sentiment with greater emphasis, declaring &quot;''Duke'' showcased a new Genesis... but ''Abacab'' was where this new incarnation of the band came into its own.&quot; They also argued that although the album is far richer in pop hooks and accessibility than the band's previous works, at it its heart ''Abacab'' &quot;is truly modern art rock.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt;

===2007 SACD/CD/DVD Release===
A new version of ''Abacab'' was released in the UK and Japan on 2 April 2007. It was released in the US and Canada as part of the ''[[Genesis 1976-1982]]'' box set on 15 May 2007. This includes the entire album in remixed stereo, the entire album in surround sound, and related video tracks.

The stereo layer includes the remixed tracks, and the SACD layer is a multichannel [[surround sound]] remix.&lt;ref&gt;Formats described at [http://www.genesis-news.com/genesis/reviews/sacds/1976-1982.htm Genesis-news.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disc 1, in the Canadian and U.S. releases, is a standard CD, containing the stereo remixes. No SACD layer is included.&lt;ref name=&quot;genesis-news.com&quot;&gt;Explained in interview with producer and remixer Nick Davis, at [http://www.genesis-news.com/genesis/reviews/sacds/interview-with-nick-davis.htm Genesis-news.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disc 2, in all releases, is a [[DVD-Video]] disk containing both audio and video tracks.

If the Dolby 5.1 option is chosen on a system that does not support surround sound, the Dolby stereo mix is played.&lt;/ref&gt; The DTS surround sound is a slightly compressed version of the surround sound on the SACD,&lt;ref name=&quot;genesis-news.com&quot;/&gt; and the Dolby surround sound is of slightly inferior quality to the DTS.&lt;ref&gt;Comparison from ''Sound and Vision'' magazine article online at [http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/musicreviews/2285/genesis-in-surround.html Soundandvisionmag.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In 1993, when the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat (arcade game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' was ported to the [[Sega Genesis]], the development team made a secret code in the game that spelled out &quot;Abacabb&quot; (with two &quot;B&quot;s) on the controller pad. When activated, it would enable uncensored blood. This was a deliberate reference to [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], one of [[Ed Boon]]'s favourite bands which happened to share the same name as the console the code was exclusive to.
* Another Sega Genesis video game has a [[cheat code]] that shares the title. 1994's [[Shadowrun (Sega)|Shadowrun]] has a secret code entered at the title screen to unlock an in-game cheat menu. The code is &quot;Abbacab.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamefaqs.com/genesis/366854-shadowrun/cheats Shadowrun Cheats, Codes, and Secrets for Genesis]. GameFAQs. Retrieved on 11 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[Kimagure Orange Road]]'' manga and anime, the restaurant ABCB was named in homage to the album. (The intended pronunciation of the letters in Japanese is similar in pronunciation to &quot;Abacab.&quot;)
* During an on-air discussion about the song, [[Artie Lange]] of ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' stated that when he was in high school he would sometimes use ''&quot;A,B,A,C,A,B&quot;'' to select answers on [[multiple choice]] exams. He claims to have usually got ''&quot;about half of them right&quot;'' by using this method.

==Tour==
Genesis toured in support of the ''Abacab'' album between September and December 1981, beginning in Barcelona, Spain. Shows in New York and Birmingham, England comprised the ''[[Three Sides Live]]'' album released the following year. It was the first tour in which audiences booed the band due to the sudden appearance of multiple pop and punk tracks in their setlist and a lack of their earlier progressive numbers, which fans were to get used to in the eclectic years that followed.

The tour also marked the first ever appearance of the [[Vari-Lite]] automated lighting system, the development of which had been paid for by the band.
