==Music career==
===Early career===
Lil B began rapping at age 16 with hip hop group the Pack. After two locally successful mixtapes, and at the peak of the Bay Area's [[Hyphy|hyphy movement]], the group's song &quot;[[Vans (song)|Vans]]&quot; became a surprise hit. The song was ranked as the fifth best of 2006 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. The strength of &quot;Vans&quot; led the group to release [[Skateboards 2 Scrapers]], featuring a &quot;Vans&quot; remix with Bay Area rappers [[Too $hort]] and [[Mistah F.A.B.]]. In 2007, Lil B and the Pack released its first album, ''[[Based Boys]]''.

===Solo success (2010âpresent)===
Aside from his involvement with the Pack, Lil B garnered popularity through the use of social media Web sites. He created over 155 MySpace pages in order to upload all of his music. He recorded over 1,500 tracks as of July 2010, including hits &quot;Wonton Soup,&quot; &quot;Pretty Bitch,&quot; and &quot;I'm God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Steven|title=Lil B Is Taking The Net By Storm, One Freestyle At A Time|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1644772/lil-b-taking-net-by-storm-one-freestyle-at-time.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=2010-07-30|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lil B signed with [[Amalgam Digital]] in 2010 for a multiple album deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Enigmue|title=Lil B The Based God Signs with Amalgam Digital, Preps New Albums|url=http://www.amalgamdigital.com/blog/4854/2010/12/29/|publisher=Amalgam Digital|date=2010-12-29|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/lil-b-signs-with-amalgam-digital/47455/ |title=Lil B Signs With Amalgam Digital &amp;#124; Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] columnist Jonah Weiner labeled him as one of a growing number of weird-o emcees, calling him a brilliantly warped, post-Lil-Wayne deconstructionist from the [[Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=Joseph|title=The Triumph of the Weirdo. Rapper|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2281158/entry/2281606/|accessdate=19 January 2011|date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lil B released his first studio album, ''Angels Exodus'', on January 18, 2011, through Amalgam Digital. The album serves as a prelude to his forthcoming album titled ''Glass Face''. The album features ''based'' tracks such as &quot;All My Life (Remix)&quot; and &quot;Exhibit 6&quot;.

===Controversy===
When Lil B titled his newest album ''I'm Gay'' he received several death threats. Although he is [[heterosexual]], he says the title is a message of support to the [[LGBT]] community. Referring to the alternative definition of gay, he says he is [[gay]] because he is happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/24/lil-bs-im-gay-album-title-death-threats_n_852994.html |title=Lil B's 'I'm Gay' Album Title Results In Death Threats |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
