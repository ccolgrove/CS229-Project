The '''Associated Public Schools of Victoria''' (APS) are a group of eleven elite independent schools in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], similar to the [[Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales]] in [[New South Wales]]. 

The association was established in 1900&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apssport.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/History/APSV_-_Celebrating_100_Years_1908-2008.pdf Associated Public Schools of Victoria, Celebrating 100 Years]&lt;/ref&gt; so that students of the member schools may compete against each other on the sporting fields, the original competition sports were [[Australian Rules Football]], [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] and [[Cricket]]. Students now compete in a variety of sports, which are split into three seasons, Summer, Winter and Spring. Students in Year 7 and above compete on Saturdays and students in primary year levels compete on Friday afternoons. Major annual competitions include the APS [[Head of the River (Australia)|Head of the River rowing regattas]], the APS Combined Swimming &amp; Diving Championships and the APS Athletics Championships. 

In March 2005, the APS member schools formed a set of guidelines regarding the awarding of sporting scholarships to students, following criticism of recruiting practices employed by the schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Leung | first=Chee Chee | title=Top schools pledge to play fair | date=March 29, 2005 | publisher=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Top-schools-pledge-to-play-fair/2005/03/28/1111862322316.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the APS is known as APS House and is situated on Morrison Street, [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]].
