===Key free agent signings===
{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}

*On May 7, 2009 the Lions signed Detroit native and former [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverine]] linebacker [[Larry Foote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Detroit News May 7, 2009 Larry Foote wants to help hometown team, Lions history aside|url=http://detnews.com/article/20090507/OPINION03/905070401/1126/SPORTS0101/Larry-Foote-wants-to-help-hometown-team--Lions-history-aside|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hgp2npK7|archivedate=2009-06-21|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played on the Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers in 2008.

===Corey Smith disappearance===
On March 1, 2009 it was reported that free agent defensive end [[Corey Smith]] (who played for the Lions from 2006â2008) boarded a fishing boat off the Gulf Coast of Florida with former teammate [[Marquis Cooper]] (most recently of the [[Oakland Raiders]]) and former [[South Florida Bulls football|University of South Florida]] players Nick Schuyler and William Blakely on February 28. Smith and Cooper played together on the [[2004 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004]]. They did not return as expected and the men and their boat were searched for by the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] for 3 days. The [[National Weather Service]] said waves were about 2 to 4 feet Saturday morning and increased to 3 to 5 feet in the afternoon. Late Saturday night, a small craft advisory was issued, when winds were around 20 knots and waves were up to 7 feet or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-missingboaters-nfl&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns Yahoo! News March 1, 2009 Agent: 2 NFL players among Fla. missing boaters]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, at approximately 1:30 PM, Coast Guard Petty Official James Harless reported that Schuyler had been found alive &quot;clinging to an overturned vessel&quot;. He was later diagnosed with [[hypothermia]] and [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/02/florida.missing.boaters/index.html CNN.com March 2, 2009 Boater found, NFL players still missing]&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 3, the Coast Guard called off the search.&lt;ref name=cgsearchends/&gt;
Later that day, the Lions released this statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Detroit Lions reaction to news that Coast Guard will cease search and rescue efforts for Corey Smith, Will Bleakley and Marquis Cooper|url=http://www.detroitlions.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=482242|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hgoziC9v|archivedate=2009-06-21|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Todayâs news is a sobering reminder about how truly precious and fragile life can be. We will continue to pray for a miracle, though we fully understand and respect the decision of the Coast Guard.

We were thrilled yesterday with the news of Nickâs rescue, and it gave all of us hope that Corey, Will and Marquis would also be found alive.

While we still have that hope, we have begun to cope with the grim reality of this sad and tragic situation.

We cannot adequately express our heartfelt appreciation to the Coast Guard and all the Florida authorities involved in the rescue mission. Their heroic efforts saved at least one life, and we know they did everything possible for Corey, Will and Marquis.

We also want to thank everyone across the country for their expressions of support. We ask that you join us as we continue to pray for Corey, Will, Marquis and their families.|200|200|Detroit Lions Press Release, March 3, 2009}}

A private search led by the families of the still missing men began on March 4.&lt;ref name=cgsearchends&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/03/florida.missing.boaters/index.html CNN.com March 4, 2009 Coast Guard suspends search for NFL players, friend]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lions have also announced that Smith's jersey number, 93, will not be issued for the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Yahoo! Sports March 21, 2009 In Smithâs memory, no Lion will wear 93 this fall|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=Av02IJjMbMLyrB4UsXEW.QRDubYF?slug=ap-missingboaters-nfl&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hgp09LEX|archivedate=2009-06-21|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Lions also wore a 93 on the back of their helmets.

===2009 NFL Draft===
{{Main|2009 NFL Draft}}
With their league worst record in 2008, the Lions secured the #1 overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. Detroit also had the #20 overall pick in the first round, which they received from the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as part of the [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]] trade in 2008. The trade also gave them additional picks in the 3rd and 6th rounds. 

The Lions traded its 2009 fourth-round selection (101st overall) and its 2008 third-round selection (111th overall, which was traded to Cleveland) to Dallas for its 2008 third-round selection (92nd overall, used to select [[Cliff Avril]]). 

The Lions selected [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] [[quarterback]] [[Matthew Stafford]] for the #1 overall pick. The six-year contract reportedly contains $41.7 million in guaranteed money (the most guaranteed to any player in NFL history) and carries a total value of up to $78 million.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit negotiated a deal with Stafford on April 24, 2008, less than 24 hours before the draft. {{cite web | title = Sources: Stafford will be No. 1 pick | publisher = ESPN.com | date = April 24, 2009 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4097641/news/story?id=3358424 | accessdate = April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80ffa6de NFL.com Video player Matt Stafford official draft announcement with analysis and interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

With 2 seconds left, Matt Stafford threw a pass into the end zone which was intercepted, but it was called back on a pass interference penalty, giving the Lions one more play with no time left on the clock. Although Stafford was brutally hit by two Browns defenders on the play, and suffered what turned out to be a major shoulder separation of his non-throwing arm, he told the coaches he wanted to return for the final play (pleading to coaches &quot;If you need me to throw the ball, I can throw the ball&quot;) and was allowed to go back in. He then threw a touchdown to Brandon Pettigrew, and Jason Hanson tacked on the extra point for the win. Matt Stafford became the youngest QB to throw 5 touchdown passes in a game since the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970. He also set a record for passing yards in a game by a rookie with 422.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=291122008 ESPN.com NFL Recap Browns at Lions week 11]&lt;/ref&gt; For his performance, Stafford won NFC Offensive Player of the Week and Pepsi Rookie of the Week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitlions.com/news/article-1/Stafford-Named-NFC-Offensive-Player-of-the-Week/f8de6f01-97b1-48ed-89aa-6bf31d9a1c8d Detroit Lions.com November 24, 2009 â Stafford Named NFC Offensive Player of the Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitlions.com/news/article-1/QB-Matthew-Stafford-Voted-Week-11-Pepsi-NFL-Rookie-of-the-Week/7e2feed7-e1f6-47bc-b11a-70f3d1299275 Detroit Lions Official Site November 27, 2009 QB Matthew Stafford Voted Week 11 Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local TV Blackouts ==
In the 2009 season, the Lions had four of their 8 home games televised on local TV. The Lions sold out their home opener against the Vikings, as well as a week 5 match up against the Steelers, the Thanksgiving Classic against Green Bay, and their season finale against the Bears. Both of the Lions wins in 2009  were blacked out on local television (the Detroit, Flint/Tri-Cities, Lansing/Jackson and Toledo markets) because the game didn't sell out by the 72 hour deadline. In the games that Detroit didn't sell out, the attendances were announced at just over 40,000 and quite often, the stadium looked only half full. Since the Lions 0â16 season in 2008, popularity in the team has decreased and the Lions have struggled to sell tickets.
