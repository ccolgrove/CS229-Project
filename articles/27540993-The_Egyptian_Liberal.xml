[[Secularism]] is defined as an indifference to, rejection or exclusion of religion and religious consideration.&lt;ref name=Secularism&gt;{{cite web|title=Secularism Definition|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secularism|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Israel]] this applies to the entirely secular community that identifies with no religion and the secular community within the [[Jewish]] community which identifies with no particular division of the religion.  When Israel was established as a new state in 1948, a new and different Jewish identity formed for the newly created Israeli population. This population was defined by the Israeli culture and [[Hebrew]] language, their experience with the [[Holocaust]], and the need to band together against conflict with hostile neighbors in the Middle East. This is not an identity that Jews outside of the Israel can easily identify with.&lt;ref name=Religion&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Secularism in Israel|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,469996,00.html|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
	Since 1922 many official documents originating in the land of Israel gave rise to religious freedom and secularism. In 1922 the [[Palestinian Mandate]] prohibited discrimination based on religious affiliation. In 1948, at the establishment of the state of Israel, the Declaration of Independence again protects freedom of religion.&lt;ref name=Freedom&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Religion in Israel|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/freedom.html|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration of Establishment of the State of Israel was approved by members of the Jewish community of Palestine and the [[Zionist movement]]. The documents first section sheds light on the relationship between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name=Declaration&gt;{{cite web|title=The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/decind.html|work=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reads âthe Land of Israel,[ Palestine] was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped.â The history of the Jews establishing the State of Israel is long. The right of the Jewish people to the land was recognized in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. The United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution that called for a Jewish state to be established in Eretz-Israel on November 29, 1947.&lt;ref name=Establishment&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DECLARATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Declaration%20of%20Establishment%20of%20State%20of%20Israel|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation of Religion and State==
	When the idea of political Zionism was introduced by [[Theodor Herzl]], his idea was that Israel would be a secular state which would not be influenced at all by religion. When [[David Ben-Gurion]] founded the state of Israel he put religious leaders at the head of the government next to secular Jews in the government. Many westernized Israelis feel constrained by the strict religious sanctions imposed on them. Many businesses close on [[Shabbat]], including EL AL, Israelâs leading airline, many forms of public transportation, and restaurants.&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt;

===Policies controlled by Religious Leaders===
In order to be formally married in Israel, a couple has to be married by a [[Rabbi]]. This also applies when and if a couple would like to divorce, they must seek out rabbinical council. Since many secular Israelis find this absurd they often go abroad to be married, often in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt; Marriages officiated abroad are recognized as official marriages in Israel.&lt;ref name=NonJewish&gt;{{cite web|title='Non-Jewish' Jews endure challenges living in Israel|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/nonjewish_jews_endure_challenges_living_in_israel_20080104/|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, all food at army bases and in cafeterias of government buildings has to be [[Kosher]] even though the majority of Israelis do not follow these dietary laws.&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt;

===Religious Influences in Politics===
	Many religious symbols have found their way into Israeli national symbols. For example, the flag of the country is similar to a tallit, or prayer shawl, with its blue stripes. The national coat of arms, also displays the [[menorah]].&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt; The Israeli National Anthem also brings a few references of religion. âAs long as the Jewish spirit is yearningâ and âthe two-thousand-year-old hopeâ are both lines in the anthem HaTikvah- âThe Hopeâ.&lt;ref name=HaTikvah&gt;{{cite web|title=HaTikvah|url=http://stateofisrael.com/anthem/|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
	 In Israel certain cities and regions are known for their more secular or religious qualities. [[Tel Aviv]], the port city, for example, is a direct example of a secular city. Tel Aviv is the type of city that Theodor Herzl had envisioned for Israel when the country was first established. It is very cosmopolitian with modern hotels, boutiques, coffee shops, and loud music on Friday night. Non-Jews and secular Jews alike feel very comfortable in this city because of the lack of religious bearing. Tel Aviv is a modern city similar to a costal city in the United States like [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=TelAviv&gt;{{cite web|title=Tel Aviv: Secular City|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/95dec/telaviv/telaviv.htm|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tel Aviv is even considered one of the top party cities in the world. It would be typical to find bars and night clubs open until dawn, even during Shabbat.&lt;ref name=Party&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Top 10 Party Towns|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/activity/food-and-wine/the-worlds-top-10-party-towns-20091118-im4q.html|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in the Jewish population==
	With the Jewish population of Israel, Jews can be divided into four groups. The two largest groups, the non-observant or secular Jews and the âtraditional Jewsâ make up 80% of the population, with the remaining 20% being made up of the orthodox and ultra-orthodox population. In a broader sense, two groups can be derived: The Secular and the Orthodox. In Israel there are rarely distinctions made such as Conservative and Reform Judaism, although this is a popular practice in much of the diaspora.

===Secular and Traditional===
	 Secular Jews in Israel identify as being Jewish because they serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (army), they celebrate [[Jewish holidays]] (differently from the Orthodox), and speak Hebrew.&lt;ref name=American&gt;{{cite web|title=An American in Israel|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/weinerinis.html|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the population is the largest making up 45% of the Jewish population. Secular Jews are largely supporters of the [[Israeli Labor Party]] and a Secular Zionist state.&lt;ref name=Camps&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ISRAELI JEWS: 4 DISTICT CAMPS|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/29/world/the-israeli-jews-4-distict-camps.html|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many secular Israelis identify with being Jewish however the religion is only one aspect of their identity. However, even many secular Jews practice certain aspects of the religion, such as having a [[Passover Seder]] or fasting during [[Yom Kippur]]. It would not be uncommon to see a secular family to light Shabbat candles, say the blessings over food and wine, have a Shabbat dinner together and then for the parents to get into their car and drive their children to the movies.&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt; Traditional Jews make up 35% of the Jewish population in Israel. This is the second largest group. By identifying as traditional in general it means they are observant but not in a particularly strict way. They fully support the Zionist state. Traditional Jews make up most of the [[Likud]] political party.&lt;ref name=Camps /&gt;

===Orthodox===
15% of the Jewish population identifies as Orthodox or âdati.â This is an incredibly observant faction of the religion and regularly attend [[synagogue]]. Unlike the Ultra Orthodox, they believe that secular Zionist nationalism and Judaism can successfully work and life together in Israel. Politically they align with [[National Religious Party]], the Morasha Party and by the two state-appointed Chief Rabbis. Orthodox Jews are often seen wearing knitted [[yarmulkes]].&lt;ref name=Camps /&gt; The Ultra Orthodox (Hariedi) are the smallest part of the population, representing only 5% of Jews living in Israel.&lt;ref name=Camps /&gt; The Hariedi tend to live in their own communities and live according to Jewish law by following moral and dress codes passed down from ancestors.&lt;ref name=American /&gt; This part of the population are often seen wearing black hats or yarmulkes and some [[Hasidic]] sects are related to Hasidic sects in the United States.&lt;ref name=Camps /&gt;

==Membership of the United Nations==
	In 1949 Israel became part of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=Members&gt;{{cite web|title=Member States|url=http://www.un.org/en/members/|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a state becomes part of the United Nations, the state adopts the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In the Declaration there are many instances that reflect a countryâs need for religious freedom.  The Preamble of the Declaration states that it is  âa common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.â In the Declaration both articles 2 and 18 reference freedom of religion. In article 2 it states that everyone is entitled to all the rights without any distinction such as religion. Article 18 states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and has the right to show their religion in teaching, practice, worship and observance.&lt;ref name=Declaration&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|work=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Jews In Israel==
	In Israel to be considered Jewish you have to have a Jewish mother. This excludes a large portion of the immigrant population that moved to Israel from the former [[Soviet Union]] and many parts of Europe and had previously identified as Jewish even though they did not have a Jewish mother.  This part of the population accounts for around 320,000 people who serve in the Israeli Defense Forces and celebrate Jewish holidays.&lt;ref name=NonJewish /&gt;
	There is also a [[Christian]] population. Many of whom live with Jewish communities.&lt;ref name=NonJewish /&gt; Rather than have their own education and medical institutions they have integrated into state institutions. The Christian population in Israel is the only Christian population in the Middle East that has grown in the last half century.  Christians choose to live in Israel because they have freedom of speech and the freedom to practice religion.&lt;ref name=Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=Myth and Fact: Christians in Israel|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=104341|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	The population of [[Muslim]]âs living in Israel is expected to increase by 66% by 2030 making the Muslim population 23.2% of the population of Israel. However, Israel is the only country in the region where Muslims are a minority.&lt;ref name=Arabs&gt;{{cite web|title=ARABS AND MUSLIMS IN ISRAEL|url=http://www.middle-east-info.org/gateway/arabsinisrael/index.htm|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim population in Israel lives mostly in the northern part of the country. The population of the Muslim community has the highest population growth of any community in Israel.&lt;ref name=Growth&gt;{{cite web|title=1.16 Million Muslims in Israel, Growth Rate Slowing|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128757#.Tp8d19TczsM|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	Many [[Arab]]âs enjoy living in Israel because of the freedoms they have. In a survey taken, 77% of Arab Israelis would live in no country in the Middle East other than Israel.  They are free under the law to vote, practice religion, be members of the [[Israeli parliament]] and can use the same Israeli education system as the rest of the country. Many Arabs are a part of the Israeli government and politics. Almost one 10th of the parliament are Arab and there is a [[mosque]] in the parliament building ([[Knesset]]) for those who are Muslim. A supreme court justice and a minister of the Israeli cabinet are also Arab Muslims.&lt;ref name=Arabs /&gt;
