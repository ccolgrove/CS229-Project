[[File:Janitor.png|thumb|right|220px|Janitor]]

A '''janitor''' or '''custodian''' (called '''caretaker''' in [[British English]] but also '''janitor''' in [[Scottish English]], see [[American and British English differences]]) is a professional who takes care of [[buildings]], such as [[hospitals]] and [[school]]s.  Janitors are responsible primarily for [[cleaning]], and often (though not always) some [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] and [[security]]. Similar but more managerial duties (and usually not including cleaning, for example) are performed by a [[building superintendent|superintendent]], often called ''building superintendent''.

== Occupational tasks ==
Typical janitor duties often consist of the following tasks:
* Cleaning and restocking bathrooms
** [[Sink]]s
** [[Toilet]]s
** [[urinal (restroom)|Urinal]]s
** [[Floor cleaning|Cleaning floors]] (sweeping, mopping)
** Clearing garbage bins
** restocking toilet paper and/or paper towel dispensers
** Cleaning mirrors

* [[Floor cleaning|Cleaning floors]] (mopping, sweeping, polishing)
* Cleaning (vacuum) [[carpet]]ing
* Cleaning [[stainless steel]] and other special surfaces
* Clearing lunch room/kitchen
* Cleaning [[Table (furniture)|tables]] in cubicles, meeting rooms, etc...
* Emptying trash and [[recycling bin]]
* [[Locking]] and unlocking buildings at the beginning and end of the day
* Stripping and waxing floors using [[Floor buffer]]
* Mopping
* Cleaning air-conditioner vents

Office cleaning staff perform many of the same duties as janitors, however the tasks are divided among different members. Additional tasks include:

* watering plants (pruning as well)
* cleaning sinks, refrigerators, microwaves and toasters in office kitchens; clearing recycling and garbage bins
* dusting furniture and computer equipment (monitors and desk area, but excluding keyboards) and tables

Office cleaning often takes place after hours or later in the evening or even overnight.

== Outsourcing ==
Cleaning is one of the most commonly [[outsourcing|outsourced]] services. Some of the reasons for this include:
* Basic cleaning tasks are standardised, with little variation among different enterprises.
* The nature of the job and required standard of performance can be clearly defined and specified in a contract, unlike more technical or professional jobs for which such specification is harder to develop.
* Many organizations which predominantly employ higher paid workers feel uncomfortable dealing with labour relations with low paid employees; by outsourcing, these labour relations issues are transferred to a contractor whose staff are comfortable and experienced in dealing with these issues, and their approach can benefit from [[economies of scale]].
* If a janitor is unavailable due to sickness or leave, a contractor which employs many janitors can easily assign a substitute. A small organisation which employs one or a few janitors directly will have much more trouble with this.
* 17% to 22% of the employed illegal immigrant population in the United States work in the cleaning industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weltin |first=Dan |url=http://www.cleanlink.com/cp/article/Immigration-Reform-Theres-Always-An-Excuse--12050 |title=Immigration Reform: There's Always An Excuse |publisher=Cleanlink.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to this population offering an abundant source of inexpensive labor, janitorial duties are mostly undertaken at night, making it an appealing option for undocumented workers seeking clandestine employment.
