==Religion and philosophy==

* The scattered skulls of prehistoric [[pygmy elephants]] on [[Crete]], and near [[Catana]], [[Sicily]], featuring a single large [[nasal cavity]] at the front, may have formed the basis of belief in existence of [[cyclops]], the one-eyed [[giant (mythology)|giants]] featured in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].

* A [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephant]] is considered holy in [[Thailand]].

* Elephants are used in festivals in [[Sri Lanka]], such as the [[Esala Perahera]].

* [[Temple elephant]]
* [[Guruvayur Keshavan]] famous temple elephant in Kerala, India

* The story of the [[blind men and an elephant]] was written to show how reality may be viewed by different perspectives. Its source is unknown, but it appears to have originated in India. It has been attributed to [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Jainism|Jainists]], and [[Sufism|Sufis]], and was also used by [[Discordianism|Discordians]].

* [[Ganesh]] or [[Ganesha]], the [[Hindu]] god of wisdom and one of the most popular gods in this religion's pantheon, is very distinctive in having the head of an elephant. As reconted in the Hindu sources, this was put on instead of the human head with which he was born and which was cut off or burned (there are various versions).

* In [[Judeo-Christian]] accounts, including [[Midrash]] on the sixth chapter of the [[apocrypha]]l book of [[1 Maccabees]], the youngest of the [[Hasmonean]] brothers, [[Eleazar]] the [[Maccabee]] stuck a spear under the foot of a [[war elephant]] carrying an important [[Seleucid]] general, killing the elephant and the general at the cost of Eleazar's own life.

* In [[Islamic]] tradition, the year [[570]], when the Prophet [[Muhammad]] was born, is known as the [[Year of the Elephant]]. In that year, as recounted in the Muslim sources, [[Abraha]], ruler of [[Yemen]] (most likely a [[viceroy]] for the [[Axumite Empire]] of [[Ethiopia]]), sought to conquer [[Mecca]] and demolish the [[Kaaba]], reportedly in retaliation for the previous Meccan defilement of a [[cathedral]] Abraha had constructed in [[Sana'a]]. He launched an expedition of forty thousand men, led by a white elephant named Mahmoud (and possibly with other elephants - some accounts state there were several elephants, or even as many as eight)&lt;ref name=&quot;Hajjah&quot;&gt;Hajjah Adil, Amina, &quot;''Prophet Muhammad''&quot;, ISCA, Jun 1, 2002, ISBN 1-930409-11-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt&quot;&gt;William Montgomery Watt (1974), p.7&lt;/ref&gt;). However, his design was foiled when Abraha's elephant reportedly refused to cross the boundary of Mecca and sat down. It could not be persuaded otherwise, either by reason or violence. The accounts state that if the elephant was turned towards [[Syria]] or Yemen it would walk without hesitation, but when it was turned towards the Kaaba it would kneel on its knees as if it would adore the city that its master was intent on destroying. &quot;[[Al-Fil]]&quot; (&quot;The Elephant&quot;) - 105th [[Sura]] (chapter) of the [[Koran]] - commemorates this event with the verse: &quot;''Hast thou not observed how thy Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant? Did He not bring their stratagem to nought?''&quot;

==Politics and secular symbolism==

* The Elephants of Kerala are an integral part of the daily life in [[Kerala]], [[South India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=Elephants+Kerala+culture&amp;as_brr=3 Encyclopaedia of Indian literature vol. 1.

Footprint Travel Guides, 2000. ISBN 1900949814. P.4]&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants in Kerala are often referred to as the 'sons of the ''[[Sahyadri|sahya]]''.' The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the [[Government of Kerala]].(See [[Elephants in Kerala culture]].)
* After Alexander's victory over the Indian king [[King Porus|Porus]], the captured [[war elephants]] became a symbol of imperial power, used as an emblem of the [[Seleucid]] [[diadoch]] empire, e.g. on coins.
* The elephant, and the [[white elephant]] (also a religious symbol of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) in particular, has often been used as a symbol of royal power and prestige in Asia; occurring on the flag of the kingdom Laos (three visible, supporting an umbrella, another symbol of royal power) till it became a republic in 1975, and other Indochinese and Thai realms had also displayed one or more white elephants.
[[Image:Keten Olifant.jpg|thumb|Collar of the Danish Order of the Elephant.]]
* The [[Order of the Elephant]] ({{lang-da|Elefantordenen}}) is the highest [[Order (decoration)|order]] of Denmark, instituted in its current form on 1693 by [[King Christian V]]. The collar of the order consists of alternating elephants and towers, and its badge shows an elephant bearing a watch tower, in front of which a [[Moors|Moor]] is sitting, holding a golden spear.

[[File:Bernini-Elefant.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ''Pulcino della Minerva'', a famous [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] elephant sculpture, a base supporting one of the eleven Egyptian obelisks in Rome (in [[Piazza della Minerva]]).]]
* The city of [[Catania]], [[Sicily]] has an elephant coat of arms, part of the city's immemorial connection with this animal. Well-preserved remnants of [[dwarf elephant]]s/[[elephas falconeri]] had been found in the Catana area, from prehistoric times up to the present. The local sorcerer [[Heliodorus]], in Classic Greek times, was credited with either riding a magic elephant or transforming himself into this animal. Under Medieval Arab rule Catania was known as ''Balad-Al-Fil'' or ''Medinat-Al-Fil'' (Country/City of the Elephant). The symbol of the city is the ''Fontana dell'Elefante'' (Fountain of the Elephant - see image), assembled in its present form in 1736 by [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], but including a far older lavic elephant - considered to be a prehistorical sculpture reforged in the Byzantine Era.
* In [[Shatranj]] - the Medieval game from which [[Chess]] developed - the piece corresponding to the modern [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] was known as ''Pill'' or ''Alfil'' (&quot;Elephant&quot; in, respectively, Persian and Arabic). In the Indian [[Chaturanga]] game the piece is also called &quot;Elephant&quot; (''Gaja''). The same is true in [[Chinese chess]] which has an elephant piece (&quot;XiÃ ng&quot;, è±¡), and the move of blocking this piece is known as &quot;blocking the elephant's eye&quot;. In the Japanese [[Shogi]] version, the piece used to be known as the &quot;''Drunken'' Elephant&quot;; it was, however, dropped by order of the [[Emperor Go-Nara]] and no longer appears in the version played in contemporary Japan. Even with modern Chess, the word for the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] is still ''Alfil'' in Spanish, ''Alfiere'' in Italian ''Feel'' in Persian and &quot;Elephant&quot; (Ð¡Ð»Ð¾Ð½) in Russian. As all these games were originally a kind of simulation of a battlefield, the piece was evidently intended to represent a [[war elephant]]. In the present-day canonical chessmen ([[Staunton chess set]]), the  piece's deep groove, which originally represented the elephant's tusks, is now regarded as representing a bishop's (or abbot's) [[mitre]].
[[Image:Elephant &amp; Castle, London, England.jpg|thumb|right|Elephant &amp; Castle statue, [[London]].]]
* The &quot;[[Elephant and Castle]]&quot; or in short &quot;The Elephant&quot; is a well known name in the geography and popular culture of [[London]] - being officially the name of a major [[road]] intersection and a [[London Underground]] station and unofficially used for the entire surrounding district, largely displacing its official name ([[Newington, London]]). The name is supposedly derived from a vision that someone had on London Bridge when they saw an elephant with a castle on its back in the clouds. A pub of this name had continually existed in the area since at least 1765, when a manorial [[court leet|Court Leet]] had met there - though the pub was several times demolished and rebuilt. The name of the North American [[Elephant and Castle Pub and Restaurant]] chain is derived from the British name.
*[[Elephanta Island]] (also called &quot;Gharapuri Island&quot;) in [[Mumbai Harbour]] was given this name by  17th century [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers who saw a monolithic basalt sculpture of an elephant near the entrance to what became known as the [[Elephanta Caves]]. The Portuguese attmpted to take it home with them but ended up dropping it into the sea because their chains were not strong enough. Later, the [[United Kingdom|British]] moved this elephant to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum (Mumbai)|Victoria and Albert Museum]] (now [[Dr Bhau Daji lad Museum]]) in [[Mumbai]] &lt;ref&gt;HT Cafe, Mumbai, Monday, June 4, 2007 pg.31 - Article 'Lord of the Islands&quot; by Jerry Pinto&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Castororpollux.jpg|thumb|right|One of the elephants shot for its meat at Paris in December 1870.]]
* The killing and eating of the elephants [[Castor and Pollux (elephants)|Castor and Pollux]] during the 1870 [[Siege of Paris]] got considerable attention at the time and later, and became emblematic of the hardships and degradation caused by siege and war - especially since previous to the war, the two elephants were highly popular with the Parisian public.

*[[Republican Party (United States)]]
The elephant as the symbol for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the United States originated in an 1874 cartoon of an Asian elephant by [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (Nast also originated the [[donkey]] as the symbol of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]).
