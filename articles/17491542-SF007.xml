'''Jennie Muskett''' is a British [[Emmy]] winning and [[Bafta]] nominated film and TV composer.

==Biography==
Jennie Muskett has lived in London, South Africa and LA and has established an international reputation as a composer for film and television, having written scores for [[Miramax]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Disney]], [[IMAX]], the [[BBC]] and many more.

Over the years Muskett has also made her mark in Hollywood as a composer with scores such as her lyrical music for ''The Prince and Me'' (2004) directed by Martha Coolidge and her comedy score for ''Material Girls'' (2005), starring [[Hilary Duff]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].

She has provided high profile TV scores, most recently for the critically acclaimed BBC film, ''Miss Austen Regrets'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=1120|title=Award Winning Female Composer Jennie Muskett Brings Jane Austen to Life|last=Costa|first=Ray|date=20 January 2008|publisher=SoundtrackNet|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Compulsion'' starring Ray Winston. Muskett has also been awarded 2 BAFTA nominations for her scores for the series ''Spooks'', for which she also composed the theme, and more recently, the mini-series ''The State Within'' received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations.

Muskett trained at the [[Royal College of Music]] in London and soon after began a career as a cellist, playing for named UK orchestras. Her composing career began when she was invited to write the music for a natural history documentary which, in turn, spurred further commissions in this genre. She worked for production companies such as [[National Geographic]], Discovery, the BBC and IMAX. Muskettâs passion for the environment and her fascination with the natural world inspired a diverse ethnicity in her scores. Inevitably Muskettâs documentary work has received praise, winning her 2 Emmyâs and 5 Emmy nominations.

Muskett has a studio in LA and another in Highgate, London and divides her time between them, working in both film and TV.
