'''Lee Donghae (ì´ëí´)''' (born October 15, 1986), better known [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] as '''Donghae''' (lit. ''East Sea''), is a [[Korean people|Korean]] [[singer]] and occasional [[actor]]. He is a part of the thirteen member South Korean boyband [[Super Junior]]. He is one of the three main dancers alongside fellow band members Eunhyuk and Shindong, and is part of its subgroup, [[Super Junior-M]]. Donghae is also one of the first four Korean artists to appear on Chinese postage stamps.

==Biography==
Donghae was born in [[Mokpo]], [[Jeollanam-do|Jeollanam]] on October 15, 1986 . Donghae initially wanted to become an athlete, but under the influence of his father, who once desired to become a singer, Donghae decided to train himself to become a singer. 

In 2001, Donghae successfully signed a contract with [[SM Entertainment]] soon after he jointly won the ''Best Outward Appearance'' award with future band mate [[Sungmin]] on the company's third annual ''SM Youth Best Contest''.&lt;ref&gt;http://ent.cctv.com/20081212/103798.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Under SM Entertainment, Donghae was put in singing, dancing, and acting lessons that same year. He was then recruited into a five-member boy band ''Smile'', with future band mate [[Leeteuk]], but the idea was soon dropped.

In 2004, Donghae- along with Leeteuk- was put into another boy band and formed Super Junior with ten other trainees. The group later became known as Super Junior 05, the presumed first generation of the rotational music group, Super Junior. Several days before the group debuted, Donghae made a brief appearance in November 2005 at [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]'s ''Shin Dong-yup's There Is There Isn't'' panel.

On the 8th of August 2006, Donghae's father died due to cancer. The event still proves to be a difficult memory for him due to the close relationship they shared. In Super Junior's 4th Album (2010), Donghae's thank you is dedicated almost entirely to his father.&lt;ref&gt;http://sup3rjunior.com/2010/05/14/donghaes-thanks-to-his-father-from-4th-jib/&lt;/ref&gt; 

His best friend is his fellow bandmate [[Eunhyuk]], whom he has known for more than 10 years.

===Super Junior===
Super Junior 05 officially debuted on November 6, 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting Bell System|SBS]]'s music program ''Popular Songs'', performing their first single, &quot;[[TWINS (Knock Out)]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://ent.hunantv.com/m/20090425/280145.html&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_Photo.asp?code=Ne10&amp;SpSeq=1601&amp;sys_lang=]. Their debut performance attracted over 500 fans and also garnered oversea viewers from both China and Japan. A full studio album was released a month later, which debuted at #3 on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005twins&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Album Sales of December 2005 | date= | work=Recording Industry Association of Korea | pages=1 | url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_200512.htm | accessdate=2007-10-16 | language=Korean}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Superjuniorshow2.jpg|thumb|alt=Super Junior Super Show 2|Super Junior poster for their April 2010 tour ''[[Super Show 2 Tour]]''.]] --&gt;

In March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. The group dropped the suffix &quot;05&quot; and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group hit big after they released their first CD single &quot;[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]&quot; the following summer, which became Super Junior's most successful single in the music charts until the release of &quot;[[Sorry, Sorry (song)|Sorry, Sorry]]&quot; in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://epaper.jinghua.cn/html/2009-03/14/content_401160.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, Donghae was put into [[Super Junior-M]], the Chinese subgroup version of Super Junior.&lt;ref&gt;http://ent.sina.com.cn/y/2008-05-06/16402015099.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Super Junior-M is the 1st international music group in the Chinese music industry to have members of both [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Koreans|Korean]] descent, and brought an influence in the mainland music industry to produce multi-national music groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;sjm&quot;&gt;{{zh icon}} Jinhua.cn.

Retrieved April 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Super Junior-M debuted in China on April 8, 2008 at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards with the release of their first single music video, &quot;[[U (Super Junior-M song)|U]]&quot;. The subgroup released their first Chinese-language [[studio album]], ''[[Me (Super Junior-M album)|Me]]'' on May 2, 2008 to critical success. The album debuted #1 on many of [[China]]'s and Thailand's music charts and [[Taiwan]]'s G-music combo charts as #2.&lt;ref name=&quot;inmusic&quot;&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://music.yule.sohu.com/s2006/topinmusic/ Top in Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

Donghae has tried his hand at composing and songwriting. In late 2009, his first self-composed and self-written song, &quot;Beautiful&quot; was released with Super Show 2: The 2nd Asia Tour. In 2010, Donghae had composed ì¬í (A Short Journey), which is on Super Junior's ë¯¸ì¸ì (Repackage) 4th album. Another one of his composition is a soundtrack for a Korean drama &quot;It's Okay Daddy's Girl&quot;, which he also co-starred in, entitled &quot;Just Like Now&quot;. This original soundtrack was released as a duet number with his fellow band mate Kim Ryeowook in December 2010.

To add to the list, Donghae also collaborated with One Way's Chance to compose 3 songs: &quot;[[Strong Heart (Korean TV show)]] Logo Song&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; (from their 5th album: [[Mr. Simple]]), and &quot;I Wanna Love You&quot; from Super Show 3.
