'''William James''' &quot;'''Bill'''&quot; '''Murray''' (born September 21, 1950) is an American [[actor]] and [[comedian]]. He first gained national exposure on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which he earned an [[Emmy Award]] and later went on to star in a number of critically and commercially successful comedic films, including ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993). Murray gained additional critical acclaim later in his career, starring in ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (2003), that gave him an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] nomination, and a series of films directed by [[Wes Anderson]], including ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' (1998), ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'' (2001), ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]'' (2004) and ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (2009). 

==Early life==
Murray was born and raised in [[Wilmette, Illinois]], a northern suburb of [[Chicago]], the son of Lucille ([[married and maiden names|nÃ©e]] Collins), a mail room clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II, a [[lumber]] salesman.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill Murray profile at FilmReference.com|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/24/Bill-Murray.html|publisher=Film Reference|accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;familytree&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Murray Family Tree|url=http://landing.ancestry.com/famoustree/Tree.aspx?name=murray&amp;sourceCode=6865|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]|accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's father died in 1967 from complications of [[diabetes]] when Bill was

As a youth, Murray read children's biographies of American heroes like [[Kit Carson]], [[Wild Bill Hickok]] and [[Davy Crockett]].&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' article: [http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/magazine/the-rumpled-anarchy-of-bill-murray.html &quot;The Rumpled Anarchy of Bill Murray&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; He attended St. Joseph grade school and [[Loyola Academy]]. During his teen years, he worked as a [[golf caddy]] to fund his education at the Jesuit high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cinderella&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Bill|coauthors=George Peper|title=Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf|year=1999|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|isbn=0385495714}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his sisters had [[polio]] and his mother suffered several miscarriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;/&gt; During his teen years he was the lead singer of a rock band called the Dutch Masters and took part in high school and community theatre.

After graduating, Murray attended [[Regis University]] in [[Denver]], Colorado, taking premedical courses. However, he quickly dropped out, returning to Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt10&quot;&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' article: [http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/magazine/the-rumpled-anarchy-of-bill-murray.html?pagewanted=10 &quot;The Rumpled Anarchy of Bill Murray&quot;], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, however, Regis awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denver|first=The|url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_6391555|title=Regis University dropout Bill Murray earns stripes with honorary degree|publisher=The Denver Post|date=2007-07-17|accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1971, police arrested Murray at Chicago's [[O'Hare Airport]] for trying to smuggle 9 pounds of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] which he had allegedly intended to sell.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinderella&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt10&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
===Second City===
With an invitation from his older brother, [[Brian Doyle-Murray|Brian]], Murray got his start at [[The Second City|Second City Chicago]], an [[improvisational comedy]] troupe, studying under [[Del Close]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chase&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|title=Bill Murray, A Black Sheep Now in ''Stripes''|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1981-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he moved to New York City and was recruited by [[John Belushi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;carr&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Carr |first=Jay |title=Bill Murray's Somber Side |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=1988-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a featured player on ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'', which aired on some 600 stations from 1973 to 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;chase&quot;/&gt;

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In 1975, an [[Off Broadway]] version of a ''Lampoon'' show led to his first television role as a cast member of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[variety show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' that featured animal acts and little kids with loud voices.&lt;ref name=&quot;chase&quot;/&gt; That same season, another variety show titled ''[[Saturday Night Live|NBC's Saturday Night]]'' premiered. Cosell's show lasted just one season, canceled in early 1976.

After working in Los Angeles with the &quot;guerrilla video&quot; commune [[TVTV]] on a number of projects, Murray rose to prominence in 1976. He joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the show's second season, following the departure of [[Chevy Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getback.com/actor/bio/bill-murray/1074783 Early Career with SNL]{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'' sketch [[Eric Idle]] brought for his appearance on ''SNL'' developed into the 1978 [[mockumentary]] ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' with Murray (alongside other ''SNL'' cast members) appearing as &quot;Bill Murray the K&quot;, a send-up of New York radio host [[Murray the K]], in a segment of the film that is an obvious parody of the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles Brothers]]'s documentary ''[[The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit]]''.

During the first few seasons of ''SNL'', Murray was in a serious, romantic relationship with fellow cast member [[Gilda Radner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;something&quot;&gt;Radner, Gilda. ''It's Always Something''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
[[File:BillMurraySept10TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Murray at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Murray landed his first starring role with the film ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' in 1979. He followed this up with his portrayal of famed writer [[Hunter S. Thompson]] in 1980's ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]''. In the early 1980s, he starred in a string of box-office hits including ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', and ''[[Tootsie]]''.

Murray became the first guest on NBC's ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on February 1, 1982. He would later appear on the first episode of ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in August 1993, when the show moved to CBS.

Murray began work on a [[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''. The film, which Murray also co-wrote, was his first starring role in a [[dramatic film]]. He later agreed to star in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', in a role originally written for [[John Belushi]]. This was a deal Murray made with [[Columbia Pictures]] in order to gain financing for his film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201008/bill-murray-dan-fierman-gq-interview Fierman, Dan (8/2010), &quot;Bill Murray Is Ready To See You Now,&quot;[[GQ]]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghostbusters'' became the highest-grossing film of 1984. But ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', which was filmed before ''Ghostbusters'' but not released until after, was a box-office flop.

Upset over the failure of ''Razor's Edge'', Murray took four years off from acting to study philosophy and history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], frequent the [[CinÃ©mathÃ¨que FranÃ§aise|Cinematheque]] in Paris, and spend time with his family in their [[Hudson River Valley]] home.&lt;ref name=&quot;carr&quot;/&gt; During that time, his second son, Luke, was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;/&gt; With the exception of a [[cameo appearance]] in the [[1986 in film|1986]] movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', he did not make any appearances in films, though he did participate in several public readings in [[Manhattan]] organized by playwright/director Timothy Mayer and in a production of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Man Equals Man|A Man's A Man]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;/&gt;

Murray returned to films in 1988 with ''[[Scrooged]]'' and the sequel ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989. In 1990, Murray made his first and only attempt at directing when he co-directed ''[[Quick Change]]'' with producer [[Howard Franklin]]. His subsequent films ''[[What About Bob?]]'' (1991) and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993) were box-office hits and critically acclaimed.

After a string of films that did not do well with audiences (one of the exceptions being his role in the 1996 comedy ''[[Kingpin (film)|Kingpin]]''), he received much critical acclaim for [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' for which he won Best Supporting Actor awards from the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], [[National Society of Film Critics]], and the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] (tying with [[Billy Bob Thornton]]). Murray decided to take a turn towards more dramatic roles.  Murray then experienced a resurgence in his career as a dramatic actor, taking on roles in ''[[Wild Things]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', ''[[Hamlet (2000 movie)|Hamlet]]'' (as [[Polonius]]), and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''.

In [[2003 in film|2003]], he garnered considerable acclaim for [[Sofia Coppola|Sofia Coppola's]] ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'', and went on to earn a [[Golden Globe Award]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and an [[Independent Spirit Award]], as well as Best Actor awards from a number of film critic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2003/awardsandnominations.shtml |title=2003 Film Awards &amp; Nominations |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2009-11-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080502193917/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2003/awardsandnominations.shtml |archivedate = May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered a favorite to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], although [[Sean Penn]] ultimately won the award for his performance in ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''. In an interview included on the ''Lost in Translation'' [[DVD]], Murray states that this is his favorite movie in which he has appeared. Also in 2003, he appeared in a short cameo for the movie ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'', in which he played himself &quot;hiding out&quot; in a local coffee shop.

During this time, Murray still appeared in comedic roles such as ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''. In 2004, he provided the voice of [[Garfield]] in ''[[Garfield: The Movie]]'', and again in 2006 for ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]''. In 2004, he made his third collaboration with Wes Anderson in ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''. His dramatic role in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' was also well received.

In 2005, Murray announced that he would take a break from acting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/bio|title=IMDb bio|publisher =IMDb|accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he had not had the time to relax since his new breakthrough in the late 1990s. He did return to the big screen, however, for brief cameos in Wes Anderson's ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'' and in ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' as Agent 13, the agent in the tree. In 2008, he played an important role in the [[post-apocalyptic]] film ''[[City of Ember]]'', and in 2009, played himself in a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] role in the [[zombie comedy]] ''[[Zombieland]]''.

Murray provided the voice for the character Mr. Badger for the 2009 animated film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]''. Though there was speculation that he might return to the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|Ghostbusters franchise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38625/round-and-round-we-go-more-from-bill-murray-ghostbusters-3|title=Round and Round We Go - More From Bill Murray on Ghostbusters 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the rumored ''[[Ghostbusters 3]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20949|title=Fans Convince Murray to Do Third 'Ghostbusters'?}}&lt;/ref&gt; he dispelled such speculation in a recent interview with [[GQ]]. In March 2010, Bill Murray appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and talked about his return to ''Ghostbusters III'', stating &quot;I'd do it only if my character was killed off in the first reel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14322 |title=Bill Murray Talks Ghostbusters 3 on Letterman |work=ShockTilYouDrop |publisher=CraveOnline |date=March 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[CraveOnline|Coming Soon]], Murray said: &quot;You know, maybe I should just do it. Maybe it'd be fun to do.&quot; In the interview, when asked &quot;Is the third Ghostbusters movie happening? What's the story with that?&quot;, Bill Murray replied, &quot;It's all a bunch of crock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201008/bill-murray-dan-fierman-gq-interview?currentPage=2 Bill Murray on Ghostbusters 3, Get Low, Ron Howard, and Kung Fu Hustle: Celebrities: GQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this comment, later reports by Dan Aykroyd&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/10/dan-akroyd-writing-ghostbusters-3-script-selling-vodka-out-of-his-rv.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Stefano Paginini&lt;ref&gt;http://comicbookmovie.com/fansites/marvelmoviesuniverse/news/?a=24279&lt;/ref&gt; suggest the movie is well underway, and the script has already been approved.

==Golf-related work==
[[File:Bill Murray (99082849) cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Bill Murray golfing]]
Murray is an avid [[golf|golfer]] who often plays in celebrity tournaments. His [[1999 in literature|1999]] book ''Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf'', part [[autobiography]] and part [[essay]], expounds on his love of the game. In 2002, he and his brothers starred in the [[Comedy Central]] series, ''The Sweet Spot'', which chronicled their adventures playing golf. ''[[Caddyshack]]'', one of Murray's earliest film roles, has him playing assistant greens-keeper Carl Spackler who  lives in the golf course's tool shed. The title of his book is derived from a scene he played in ''Caddyshack'', narrating his own golf fantasy (which was listed as #92 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]] list).

Murray's love for golf is displayed in ''[[Space Jam]]'' and ''[[Zombieland]]''.

On February 13, 2011, Murray, playing with tournament champion [[D.A. Points]], won the Pro-Am championship at the '' [[AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]]''.

==Outside of show business==
He is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant located near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murraybroscaddyshack.com/ |title=Murray Bros. Caddyshack Restaurant |publisher=Murraybroscaddyshack.com |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a part-owner of the [[St. Paul Saints]] independent minor-league [[baseball]] team and occasionally travels to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] to watch the team's games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintsbaseball.com/team/ownership/ St. Paul Saints ownership]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also owns part of the [[Charleston RiverDogs]], [[Hudson Valley Renegades]], and the [[Brockton Rox]]. He invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the [[Utica Blue Sox]], Fort Myers Miracle, [[Salt Lake Sting]] ([[American Professional Soccer League|APSL]]) and [[Salt Lake City Trappers]]. He was also a part-owner of the Auburn Astros (now the [[Auburn Doubledays]]) in Auburn, New York.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Being very detached from the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rodcorp.typepad.com/rodcorp/2005/02/how_we_work_bil.html|title=How we work: Bill Murray, actor|publisher =rodcorp|accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts that he had auditioned for and was interested in, such as that of Sulley in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Bernard Berkman in ''[[The Squid and the Whale]]'', Frank Ginsburg in ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' and [[Willy Wonka]] in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hotlist.uk.msn.com/actors_and_film/bill_murray_gets_lost_in_transportation.aspx|title=MSN Hotlist|publisher =Microsoft|accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also regretted losing the chance to play Eddie Valiant in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' when he heard that he was considered for the role, which he says he would have definitely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096438/trivia|title=Trivia for &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)&quot;|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

During the filming of ''Stripes'', Murray married Margaret Kelly on [[Super Bowl]] Sunday in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] on January 25, 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;chase&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;/&gt; Later, they re-married in [[Chicago]] for their families.&lt;ref name=&quot;chase&quot;/&gt; Margaret gave birth to two sons, Homer (born 1982) and Luke (born 1985).

In 1997, he married Butler. Together, they have four sons: Caleb (born January 11, 1993), Jackson (born October 6, 1995), Cooper  (born January 27, 1997), and Lincoln (born May 30, 2001).

Michael and Lilo Salmon, were able to contact him through his former sister-in-law for support. In 1987 he made a sizeable donation to assist in the development and building of the Nathalie Salmon House. This home has been able to provide affordable housing for low-income seniors. Michael and Lilo Salmon credited him as performing &quot;miracles&quot; for them.&lt;ref&gt;(homeseniors.org)&lt;/ref&gt;
