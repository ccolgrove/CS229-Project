'''Ubisoft Romania''' was founded in October 1992 and was the first production studio established by [[Ubisoft]] outside [[France]].

== History ==
Starting with only 4 programmers and 2 graphic artists, in time, the [[Bucharest]] studio has grown to around 800 people working in different fields of activity, in 2010, and is responsible for several critically acclaimed games such as ''[[Chessmaster|Chessmaster 10th Edition]]'', ''[[Silent Hunter III]]'', ''[[Silent Hunter 4: Wolves of the Pacific]]'', ''[[Blazing Angels: Squadrons of World War II]]'' and its sequel ''[[Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII]]'' and ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''.

{{As of|1998}}, in addition to the production studio, the [[Bucharest]] subsidiary includes a marketing and sales department.  This has allowed the company to become a leader in the [[Romania]]n multimedia market, distributing Ubisoft games and Guillemot products (PC and console accessories from [[Thrustmaster]] and hardware from Hercules).

On July 15, 2008, Ubisoft announced ''Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X'', a game developed by Ubisoft Romania. ''H.A.W.X'' (&quot;High Altitude Warfare eXperimental squadron&quot;) was released on March 6, 2009 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on March 17 for Microsoft Windows.
In 2008 at the official launch of the Brothers in Arms in Romania, an employee said that Ubisoft Romania is working to a fifth title of a series. The only game that has reached the number 4 is the Silent Hunter, so the next likely project is ''Silent Hunter 5''. On 18 August 2009, Ubisoft Romania officially confirmed that they are working on ''Silent Hunter 5''.

In 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hutterer|first=Mina|title=Ubisoft a debarcat in Craiova|url=http://www.hit.ro/jocuri-console/ubisoft-a-debarcat-in-craiova|publisher=hit.ro|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a second Romanian Ubisoft studio was opened in [[Craiova]]. Ubisoft chose Craiova as the place for its new studio because of the close partnership developed between the company and the [[University of Craiova]] and started with only a handful of 12 highly talented and professional young people &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dumitrescu|first=Andrei|title=Ubisoft Opens Craiova Studio|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubisoft-Opens-Craiova-Studio-94480.shtml|accessdate=20 August 2011|publisher=softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
