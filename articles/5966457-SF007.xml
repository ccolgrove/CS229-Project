'''Bazaar''' (formerly '''Bazaar-NG''', command line tool '''&lt;code&gt;bzr&lt;/code&gt;''') is a [[distributed revision control]] system sponsored by [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]].

Bazaar can be used by a single developer working on multiple branches of local content, or by teams collaborating across a network.

Bazaar is written in the [[Python programming language]], with packages for major [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] distributions, [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|MS Windows]]. Bazaar is free software and part of the [[GNU project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;febgnu&quot;&gt;{{cite mailing list

== Features ==

Bazaar commands are quite similar to those found in [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] or [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]].
A new project can be started and maintained without a remote repository server by invoking the '''bzr init''' command in a directory which a person wishes to version.&lt;ref name=&quot;bzr-man-page&quot;&gt;[http://linux.die.net/man/1/bzr '''bzr''' man page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to purely distributed version control systems which don't use a central server, Bazaar supports working with or without a central server.  It is possible to use both methods at the same time with the same project.  The websites [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] and [[Sourceforge]] provide free hosting service for projects managed with Bazaar.

Bazaar has support for working with some other revision control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vernooij | first = Jelmer | coauthors = John Meinel, Olad Conradi, Martin Pool, Wouter Van Heyst, Aaron Bentley | title = BzrForeignBranches | date=  2007-06-15 | url = http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrForeignBranches | accessdate = 2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows users to branch from another system (such as [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vernooij | first = Jelmer | coauthors = Mark Lee, Neil Martinsen-Burrell, Robert Collins, Alexandre Vassalotti, Stijn Hoop | title = BzrForeignBranches/Subversion | date=  2007-06-07 | url = http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrForeignBranches/Subversion | accessdate = 2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), make local changes and commit them into a Bazaar branch, and then later merge them back into the other system. Read-only access is also available for [[Git (software)|Git]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://launchpad.net/products/bzr-git bzr git support plugin in Launchpad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mercurial (software)|Mercurial]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://launchpad.net/products/bzr-hg The Bazaar Hg Plugin in Launchpad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bazaar also allows for interoperation with many other systems (including [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[Darcs]], [[Git (software)|Git]], [[Perforce]], [[Mercurial]]) by allowing one to import/export the history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/fastimport-plugin.html fastimport documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bazaar supports files with names from the complete [[Unicode]] set. It also allows commit messages, committer names, etc. to be in Unicode.

== History ==
=== Baz: an earlier Canonical version control system {{anchor|Baz}} ===

The name &quot;Bazaar&quot; was originally used by a fork of the [[GNU arch]] client ''tla''. This fork is {{As of|2008|alt=now}} called '''Baz''' to distinguish it from the current Bazaar software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Bazaar ===

In February 2005, Martin Pool, a developer who had previously described and reviewed a number of revision control systems in talks and in his weblog, announced that he had been hired by Canonical and tasked with &quot;build[ing] a distributed version-control system that open-source hackers will love to use.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pool|first=Martin|url=http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/personal/at-canonical.html|title=sourcefrog: A beginning|date=2005-02-01|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public website and mailing list were established in March 2005 and the first numbered pre-release, 0.0.1, was released on March 26, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite mailing list

Bazaar was conceived from the start as a different piece of software from both GNU arch and Baz. It has a different command set and is a completely different codebase and design. Bazaar was originally intended as a test-bed for features to be later integrated into Baz, but by mid-2005 many of the major Baz developers had begun working primarily on Bazaar directly and Baz was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;historywiki&quot;/&gt;

Version 1.0 of Bazaar was released in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, Bazaar became a GNU project.&lt;ref name=&quot;febgnu&quot;/&gt;
