The '''Florida Gators men's golf''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[golf]].  The Gators compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  They play their home matches on the [[Mark Bostick Golf Course]] on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Buddy Alexander]].  In the eighty-six year history of the Gators' men's golf program, they have won fifteen SEC championships and four NCAA national tournament championships.

== History ==

The Gators men's golf program was the fifth intercollegiate sports team established by the University of Florida, having begun competition in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Julian M. Pleasants, ''Gator Tales: An Oral History of the University of Florida'', University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 55, 245&amp;ndash;246. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gators won their first two Southeastern Conference team championships twenty years later under coach Andrew Bracken in 1955 and coach [[Conrad Rehling]] in 1956.  Those two SEC championship teams produced future PGA Tour members [[Doug Sanders]], [[Tommy Aaron]] and [[Dave Ragan]].  Rehling's Gators also produced three back-to-back individual SEC titles: Ragan (1956) and Aaron (1957, 1958).

=== Bishop era: 1964&amp;ndash;1978 ===

Physical education professor and former high school football coach [[Buster Bishop]] became the new head coach of the Gators golf team in 1964.  Improvement came quickly for Bishop's Gators, and they finished as the SEC runners-up in 1965.  Gator [[Bob Murphy (golfer)|Bob Murphy]] won the individual NCAA national title in 1966.  And in 1967, the team finished second in the conference behind the [[LSU Tigers]], and second in the nation behind the [[Houston Cougars]] at the [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA championship tournament]].

The 1968 Gators made history; they not only won the program's third SEC team championship, they won the NCAA championship tournament by edging the defending national champion [[Houston Cougars]] by two shots.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Putnam, &quot;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1081336/index.htm  Two Splashes Bring An End To A Long Reign],&quot; ''Sports Illustrated'' (July 1, 1968).

The following year, the Gators finished second by two strokes behind the [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons]] at the 1974 NCAA championship tournament.

Bishop's teams also won three back-to-back SEC team championships in 1973, 1974 and 1975.  Only once in fifteen seasons did his Gators finish worse than third in the ten-team SEC.  Bishop retired from coaching after the 1978 season.

=== Darr and Blevins: 1979&amp;ndash;1987 ===

John Darr, a junior letterman from the Gators' 1968 national championship team, followed Bishop as the team's coach in 1979 and 1980.  In his two seasons, Darr's Gators finished second and third in the SEC, and fifteenth and tenth nationally at the NCAA championship tournament.  Gator golfer [[Rick Pearson (golfer)|Rick Pearson]] won the individual SEC title in 1980.
