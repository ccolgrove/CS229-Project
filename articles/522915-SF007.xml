The now defunct '''OpenCD project''' aimed to introduce users of [[Microsoft Windows]] to the benefits of [[free and open source software]] (FOSS). It is a CD image that can freely be downloaded and copied. The OpenCD team screens programs for stability, quality, and ease of installation, and only distributes programs available under an [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]]-approved [[open source license]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20040702113350/http://theopencd.sunsite.dk/criteria.php TheOpenCD Software Inclusion Criteria]&lt;/ref&gt;, which allows users to freely use and distribute the disc as they wish. It was sponsored by [[Canonical Ltd.]], for a period.

The project was started in April 2002 in response to an article on linux.com by astrophysics student Henrik Nilsen Omma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.com/feature/22405 An idea for Free Software CD] by Henrik Nilsen Omma, April 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, project lead Chris Gray left the project to pursue his own open source disc, called [[OpenDisc]], citing numerous difficulties&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrisgray.me/2007/09/mutiny-aboard-the-good-ship-theopencd Mutiny aboard the good ship OpenCD], September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which he believed were negatively affecting the progress of the OpenCD project. As of September 27, 2007, the OpenCD project is no longer under active development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theopencd.org OpenCD homepage], September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
