He was a friend of the two bishops of [[Oldenburg in Holstein]], [[Vicelinus]] (died 1154) and Gerold (died  1163), who did much to Christianize the [[Polabian Slavs]].

Helmold was born near [[Goslar]]. He grew up in [[Holstein]], and received his instruction in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] from Gerold, the future [[bishop]] of Oldenburg (1139â42). Later he came under the direction of [[Vicelinus]], the Apostle of the [[Wends]], first in the Augustinian monastery of [[Faldera]], afterwards known as [[NeumÃ¼nster]] (1147â53). He became a [[deacon]] about 1150, and finally became a parish priest in 1156 at Bosau on [[GroÃer PlÃ¶ner See]].

At Bishop Gerold's instigation Helmold wrote his ''[[Chronicon Slavorum|Chronica Slavorum]]'', a history of the conquest and conversion of the [[Polabian Slavs]] from the time of [[Charlemagne]] (about 800) to 1171. The purpose of this chronicle was to demonstrate how Christianity and German nationality gradually succeeded in gaining a footing among the Wends, especially in the eastern portion of Holstein. As an eyewitness he gives a clear description in fluent Latin of Vicelinus's missionary labors, of the founding of the bishopric in Oldenburg, of the transfer of this bishopric to [[LÃ¼beck]] when German commerce at the latter place had become more important than in the former city, of the spread of German influence among the Wends, of the merciless subjugation and extermination of these, and of the summoning to their lands of foreign settlers, principally [[Westphalia]]n and [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. The work is divided into two parts: the first covers a period closing with the year 1168, while the second continues to the year 1171. This second part, however, was written subsequently to 1172.

Helmold was a critical historian, calling [[Henry the Lion]] &quot;out for money&quot;, and criticizing the [[Wendish Crusade]]s. He said that among the troops of [[Henry the Lion]] during the Wendish Crusade, there was &quot;only talk of money, never about Christianity&quot; and missionary conversion of the Slavs. 

Helmold drew his knowledge of the earliest period from the church history of [[Adam of Bremen]] and the Saxon records bearing on [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], besides the life of [[Willehadus]], the list of [[Ansgarius]], and perhaps also a life of Vicelinus, but the summaries which he made of these records are unreliable. He is, however, the most important source of information for the history of his own period, his account of which rests on the verbal information of Vicelinus and of Gerold. His fund of information becomes noticeably meager after the latter's death in 1163. His trustworthiness was seriously questioned in the 19th century (see particularly Sehirren, ''BeitrÃ¤ge zur Kritik holsteinischer Geschichtsquellen'', Leipzig, 1876) owing to his antagonism towards the [[Archbishops of Bremen]] and his partiality for the Oldenburg-LÃ¼beck bishopric, but it should not be supposed that be was guilty of an intentional falsification of facts. The chronicle was first published in 1556 at [[Frankfurt]], and later in ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores'', XXI (1868), 11-99, and in &quot;Script. rer. Germ.&quot;

[[Henry the Lion]], Duke of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], was Helmold's patron. The chronicle was continued down to 1209 by Abbot [[Arnold of LÃ¼beck]].
