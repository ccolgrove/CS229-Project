The '''Griffin Poetry Prize''' is [[Canada]]'s most generous [[List of poetry awards|poetry award]].  It was founded in 2000 by businessman and philanthropist [[Scott Griffin]]. The awards go to one Canadian and one international [[poetry|poet]] who writes in the [[English language]].

Effective 2010, the annual Griffin Poetry Prize was doubled from CAD$100,000 to CAD$200,000 in recognition of the prizeâs tenth anniversary. The increased amount of $100,000 will be awarded as follows: CAD$10,000 to each of the seven shortlisted â four international and three Canadian â for their participation in the shortlist readings. The winners, announced at the Griffin Poetry Prize Awards evening, will be awarded CAD$65,000 each, for a total of CAD$75,000 that includes the CAD$10,000 awarded at the readings the previous evening.

==History==
In April 2000, Scott Griffin started the Griffin Trust to raise public awareness of the crucial role poetry plays in society's cultural life. Griffin served as its Chairman, with Trustees [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Robert Hass]], [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[Robin Robertson]] and [[David Young (Canadian playwright)|David Young]]. In June 2004, [[Carolyn ForchÃ©]] joined the board of Trustees. 

The Trust created the Griffin Poetry Prize with the aim of helping to introduce contemporary collections of poetry to the public's imagination. Originally, the award was two annual prizes of CAD$40,000 each, for collections of poetry published in English during the preceding year. One prize for a living Canadian poet, the other to a living poet from any other country, which could include Canada. Qualified judges are selected annually by the Trustees. The prize shortlists are announced in April ([[National Poetry Month]]) every year. The shortlisted poets gather for an evening of public readings every May/June, and the winners are announced and all of the poets are feted the following evening.
 
Eligible collections of poetry must have been published between January 1 and December 31 of the prior year. Submission must come from the publishers only.

In November 2010, Scott Griffin announced a new Griffin Trust initiative called Poetry In Voice/Les voix de la poÃ©sie, a bilingual recitation contest for high school students across Canada.
