'''64 Studio''' is a [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[operating system]] based on [[Debian]] designed for creative users on [[x86-64]] and legacy 32-bit hardware architectures.  It intends to serve as an all-in-one solution for audio and video recording, editing, and other forms of media production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.64studio.com/about About 64 Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 64 Studio is distributed with a [[free software]] [[Software license|license]], anyone with a [[64-bit]] computer can install it on their computer in a single boot or multi-boot configuration.

== Differences with Debian ==
The major differences between this distribution and basic Debian are a custom [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with [[Real-time operating system|realtime]] patches applied, some pre-configuration and a custom [[Package management system|package]] selection designed to meet the needs of creative desktop users. Other packages may also be modified to some extent, as are the basic [[GNOME]] [[Desktop environment|desktop]] themes.

== Releases ==
The project released the first beta of 64 Studio, version 0.9.0 code-named 'Toe Rag', on August 1, 2006. The release was named in honour of the all-analogue [[Toe Rag Studios]] in [[London, England]].

After eighteen months of development, the project made its first stable release available for free download on November 29, 2006. It is named 'Olympic' in recognition of the work of [[Glyn Johns]] and [[Eddie Kramer]] at [[Olympic Studios]] in London.

The second stable release, version 2.0 codename 'Electric', was announced on July 27, 2007. This release was named after [[Electrical Audio]], the studio founded by sound engineer [[Steve Albini]] in Chicago, USA. An update version 2.1 was released on June 9, 2008, named 'A Minha Menina' after a song by [[Jorge Ben]], recorded by [[Os Mutantes]] and covered by [[The Bees (UK band)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.64studio.com/press_release_2.1 64 Studio 2.1 'A Minha Menina' released!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In beginning of May 2011, 4.0 beta 1 images were uploaded to 64 Studio-server, after long time without new releases making users unsure about the future of the project. The Project has apparently been renamed to OpenDAW. There's been a conversation about the new release in 64 Studio's mailinglist. &lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.64studio.com/pipermail/64studio-users/2011-February/004657.html Mailing list talk about 4.0]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://pdk.64studio.com/projects/opendaw/squeeze/images/ OpenDAW 4.0 beta 1 images]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==

Custom variants of 64 Studio have been deployed in commercial products including the Lionstracs Mediastation, the Harrison Xdubber, and the Indamixx from Trinity Audio Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.64studio.com/oem_products 64 Studio OEM Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 64 Studio company maintains the Platform Development Kit (PDK), a [[free software]] tool originally developed at [[Progeny Linux Systems]] for the automated creation and management of custom distributions. PDK is a [[revision control]] system, with support for both [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] platforms (including [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]) and [[RPM Package Manager]] platforms (including [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://trac.64studio.com/pdk/wiki PDK wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the closure of Progeny in 2007, PDK is now made available to the software development community through a [[Trac]] site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trac.64studio.com/pdk/browser PDK source browser]&lt;/ref&gt; PDK is used to create and maintain the 64 Studio distribution, as well as custom variants of the 64 Studio platform that the company produces on behalf of its OEM customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trac.64studio.com/pdk/wiki/PdkProjects PdkProjects]&lt;/ref&gt;
