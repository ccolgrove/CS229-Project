'''Occupy Dallas''' is a [[Nonviolent resistance|peaceful protest]], [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] and [[Occupation (protest)|occupation]] that began on October 6, 2011 with a march to the [[Federal Reserve]] Building in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/10/06/3425755/occupy-dallas-protest.html|title='Occupy Dallas'|accessdate=16 October 2011|publisher=Star Telegram|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/Protesters-Surround-Dallas-Federal-Reserve-Bank-131223449.html|title='Occupy' Movement Comes to Dallas|accessdate=16 October 2011|publisher=NBC DFW|date=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is affiliated with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement that began in [[New York City]], and also with the [[&quot;Occupy&quot; protests]] that have been springing up around the United States and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44864841/ns/local_news-dallas_fort_worth_tx/t/dallas-yanks-occupy-dallas-agreement/|title=Dallas Yanks Occupy Dallas Agreement|accessdate=16 October 2011|publisher=MSNBC|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of meetings that were titled &quot;The General Assembly&quot; or &quot;GA&quot; were held to plan the beginning of the event on October 6, 2011, and have been held on an ongoing basis to create a consensus on policies and planning for the occupation. Committees known as &quot;working groups&quot; have been formulated to utilize the expertise of volunteers who wish to assist in the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://OccupyDallas.org/volunteer |title=Occupy Dallas Volunteer Page |publisher=occupydallas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Occupy Dallas Poster.jpg|thumb|left|Occupy Dallas Poster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupydallas.org/ Occupy Dallas Poster]. [http://www.occupydallas.org Occupydallas.org]. Accessed October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Occupy Dallas's aims are to non-violently reclaim control of the government from the financial interests that have corrupted them, and demands that public servants recognize that the people are the supreme authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OccupyDallas?sk=info |title=Occupy Dallas - Info |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of Occupy Dallas, as with many of the other &quot;Occupy&quot; movements, has been to denounce the role that large corporations have in the American legislative system. The [[protest]]ers in Dallas, as in other movements throughout the world, have described themselves as the &quot;99 percent,&quot; a reflection of the belief that the financial system rewards the richest 1 percent at the expense of the majority of the population.

One of the aspects of the Occupy Dallas movement has been the continued cooperation with local police and the city government.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The organizers and occupiers have been cooperating with the police, and many protesters have expressed appreciation for the role that the [[Dallas Police Department]] has played during the occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

On October 6, 2011, Occupy Dallas marched from [[Little Mexico#Pike Park|Pike Park]] to the Dallas Federal Reserve Branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2011/10/07/occupy-dallas-brings-national.html|title='Occupy Dallas' brings national protest to DFW |accessdate=16 October 2011|publisher=Dallas Business Journal|date=7 October 2011|first1=Lance|last1=Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, [[SMU]] economics professor [[Ravi Batra]] wrote an article stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement heralds the end of &quot;crony capitalismâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474|title=&quot;The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism,&quot; Truthout, October 11, 2011 |author=Ravi Batra|accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that government policies since the Reagan Administration have greatly contributed to increase inequalities and economic problems in the U.S. and that the OWS movement should push for their repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occupywallst.org/forum/the-peoples-contract/ |title= The People's Contract |work=occupywallst.org |author=Gylliwyn|date=October 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 15, 2011, over 350 people attended a solidarity march that was coordinated with all the other Occupy movements across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Occupy News, &quot;Over 350 turn out for solidarity march&quot;, Occupy Dallas, retrieved 2011-10-21 from http://occupydallas.org/over-350-turn-out-solidarity-march&lt;/ref&gt;

To date,{{when|date=October 2011}} roughly 150 protestors remain camped at City Hall Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occupydallas.org/occupydallas-ga-votes-47-21-move-city-hall-park |title=OccupyDallas GA votes 47-21 to move to City Hall Park |publisher=Occupy Dallas |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally camped at [[Pioneer Plaza]], protestors agreed to move to City Hall Park as a settlement with the city of [[Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=North Texas |url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kera/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1863480/North.Texas/City.Offers.New.Location.To.Occupy.Dallas |title=KERA: City Offers New Location To Occupy Dallas (2011-10-13) |publisher=Publicbroadcasting.net |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late at night on November 17, the [[Dallas Police Department]] has raided the encampment of &quot;Occupy Dallas&quot; after several participants broke the city's rules for safer protest movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Dallas-mayor--134054253.html Dallas mayor addresses Occupy Dallas eviction] - ''[[WFAA]]'' (released November 17, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
