Hawthorne, like the rest of the Los Angeles basin, is well-known for its year-round pleasant Mediterranean climate:
*On average, the warmest month is August.
*The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|111|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} in 1961.
*On average, the coolest month is January.
*The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|15|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} in 1963.
*The maximum average precipitation occurs in February.

Hawthorne has a [[Mediterranean climate]] or Dry-Summer Subtropical ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''Csb'' on the coast, ''Csa'' inland), enjoying plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of 263 sunshine days and only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=159227&amp;refer= |title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Los Angeles, California, United States of America |publisher=Weatherbase.com |accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;



The period of April through November is warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of 71 â {{convert|79|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and lows of 50 â {{convert|62|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}.  Due to the moderating effect of the ocean,  temperatures are cooler than more inland areas of Los Angeles, where temperatures frequently exceed 90 Â°F (32 Â°C) and occasionally reach 100 Â°F (38 Â°C).

The period of November through March is somewhat rainy, as shown in the table to left.&lt;ref&gt;www.weather.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomena typical of a [[microclimate]]. As such, the temperatures can vary as much as 18 Â°F (10 Â°C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast inland. California has also a weather phenomenon called &quot;[[June Gloom]] or May Grey&quot;, which sometimes brings overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast, but usually gives way to sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.

The Los Angeles region averages 15&amp;nbsp;inches (385&amp;nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November through April) with generally light rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. On November 6, 1966 the first ever documented tornado touched down with in the city's limits. It caused significant damage, it ran for about a half of a mile, from 132nd St. and Ramona Ave. to 140th St. and Ramona Ave. Snowfall is extremely rare but not impossible in the city basin.
