'''''National Geographic''''', formerly the '''''National Geographic Magazine''''', is the official journal of the [[National Geographic Society]]. It published its first issue in 1888, just nine months after the Society itself was founded. It is immediately identifiable by the characteristic yellow frame that surrounds its front cover.

There are 12 monthly issues of the ''National Geographic'' per year, plus additional map supplements. On rare occasions, special editions are issued.  It contains articles about geography, popular science, history, culture, current events, and photography.

With a late-2011 worldwide circulation in thirty-three language editions {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
of nearly nine million, more than five million people receive the magazine every month in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Society Executive Vice President and President of the Magazine Group Declan Moore has overall responsibility for magazines at the National Geographic Society. He reports to Tim Kelly, President, National Geographic Global Media, and new National Geographic Society president. Terry B. Adamson, Executive Vice President of the Society and the Society's chief legal officer and heads governmental relations, has overall responsibility for the Society's international publications, including ''National Geographic'' magazine. 

==History==
[[File:1915NatGeog.jpg|thumb|right|January 1915 cover of ''The National Geographic Magazine'']]
The first issue of ''National Geographic Magazine'' was published in October 1888, just nine months after the Society itself was founded.  The hallmark of ''National Geographic'', reinventing it from a text-oriented entity closer to a scientific journal, to a magazine famous for exclusive pictorial footage, was its January 1905 publication of several full-page pictures made in Tibet in 1900â1901 by two explorers from the [[Russian Empire]], [[Gombojab Tsybikov]] and Ovshe Norzunov.  The June 1985 cover portrait of 13-year-old Afghan girl [[Sharbat Gula]] became one of the magazine's most recognizable images.

In the late 1990s and 2000s, prolonged litigation over copyright of the magazine as a collective work in ''[[Greenberg v. National Geographic]]'' and other cases caused ''National Geographic'' to withdraw from the market ''The Complete National Geographic'', a digital compilation of all its past issues of the magazine. Two different federal appellate courts have now ruled in ''National Geographic''{{'}}s favor in permitting an electronic reproduction of the paper magazine and the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] denied [[certiorari]] in December 2008. In July 2009 ''National Geographic'' announced a new version of ''The Complete National Geographic'', containing all issues of the magazine from 1888 through December 2008. An updated version was released the next year, adding the issues from 2009; these issues are also available on a separate disc for owners of the original version. Updates for subsequent years of the magazine's archive are scheduled to be made available on an annual basis.

In 2006, ''National Geographic'' writer [[Paul Salopek]] was arrested and charged with espionage, entering [[Sudan]] without a visa, and other crimes by the [[Politics of Sudan|government of Sudan]] while on assignment for a feature article.  After ''National Geographic'' and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', for whom Salopek also wrote, mounted a legal defense and led an international appeal to Sudan, he was eventually released.

==Articles==
[[File:National Geographic december 1983.jpg|thumb|Edition from december 1983 - Byzatine Empire.]]
During the [[Cold War]], the magazine committed itself to presenting a balanced view of the physical and human geography of nations beyond the [[Iron Curtain]].  The magazine printed articles on Berlin, [[Austrian State Treaty|de-occupied Austria]], the [[Soviet Union]], and Communist China that deliberately downplayed politics to focus on culture.  In its coverage of the [[Space Race]], ''National Geographic'' focused on the scientific achievement while largely avoiding reference to the race's connection to nuclear arms buildup.

In later years articles became outspoken on issues such as environment, deforestation, chemical pollution, [[global warming]], and endangered species. Series of articles were included focusing on the history and varied uses of specific products such as a single metal, gem, food crop, or agricultural product, or an archaeological discovery. Occasionally an entire month's issue would be devoted to a single country, past civilization, a natural resource whose future is endangered, or other theme. In recent decades, the National Geographic Society has unveiled [[National Geographic Society#Publications|other magazines]] with different focuses. Whereas in the past, the Magazine featured lengthy expositions, recent issues have shorter, but nevertheless tighter articles.

==Photography==

In addition to being well-known for articles about scenery, history, and the most distant corners of the world, the magazine has been recognized for its book-like quality and its standard of [[photography]]. This standard makes it the home to some of the highest-quality [[photojournalism]] in the world. The magazine began to feature [[color photography]] in the early 20th century, when this technology was still rare. During the 1930s, [[Luis Marden]] (1913â2003), a writer and photographer for ''National Geographic'', convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use small 35 mm cameras loaded with [[Kodachrome]] film over bulkier cameras with [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]]s and [[photographic plate|glass plates]].  In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs. National Geographic photography has quickly shifted to digital photography for both its magazine on paper and its website. In subsequent years, the magazine cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, for a large photograph taken from one of the month's articles inside. Issues of ''National Geographic'' are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectible back-issues. In 2006, ''National Geographic'' began an international photography competition with over eighteen countries participating.

In conservative Muslim countries like [[Iran]] and [[Malaysia]], photographs featuring topless or scantily-clad members of primitive tribal societies are often [[censorship|blacked out]]; buyers and subscribers often complain that this practice decreases the artistic value of the photographs for which National Geographic is world-renowned.

==Map supplements==
Supplementing the articles, the magazine sometimes provides [[map]]s of the regions visited. 

[[National Geographic Maps]] (originally the Cartographic Division) became a division of the National Geographic Society in 1915. The first supplement map, which appeared in the May 1918 issue of the magazine, titled ''The Western Theatre of War'', served as a reference for overseas military personnel and soldier's families alike.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maps of the News - December 2009 Edition&quot;, Contours, The Official National Geographic Maps Blog, posted December 17, 2009, accessed at http://natgeomaps.blogspot.com/2009/12/maps-of-news-december-2009-edition.html&lt;/ref&gt; On some occasions, the Society's map archives have been used by the United States government in instances where its own [[cartography|cartographic]] resources were limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;GG&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[White House]] map room was filled with National Geographic maps. A National Geographic map of Europe is featured in the displays of the [[Winston Churchill]] [[Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms|museum]] in London showing Churchill's markings at the [[Yalta Conference]] where the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders divided [[World War II|post-war]] Europe.

In 2001, ''National Geographic'' released an eight-[[CD-ROM]] set containing all its maps from 1888 to December 2000. Printed versions are also available from [http://ngmapcollection.com/ NGMapcollection.com].

==Language editions==
In 1995, ''National Geographic'' began publishing in Japanese, its first local language edition. &lt;!-- Really? A Spanish language edition wasn't earlier? Already in 1970s, IIRC --&gt; The magazine is currently published in 34&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Press Release (Aug. 25, 2011), [http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&amp;siteID=1&amp;cid=1314284214303]&lt;/ref&gt; language editions around the world, including English on a worldwide basis, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Chinese language|traditional and simplified character Chinese]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], Danish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and an [[Orthodox Jews|Orthodox Hebrew]] edition,  Hungarian, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, two [[Portuguese language]] editions, [[Romanian language|Romanian]], Russian, [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], two [[Spanish language]] editions, Swedish, [[Thai language|Thai]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

In April 2005, an [[Indonesia]]n edition launched, published by Gramedia Majalah. A [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] edition of the magazine published by a Sanoma Publishing joint venture launched in November, 2005 and a Slovenian edition published by Rokus launched in May, 2006. In association with Trends Publications in Beijing and IDG Asia, ''National Geographic'' has been authorized for &quot;copyright cooperation&quot; in China to publish the yellow border magazine, which launched with the July 2007 issue of the magazine with an event in Beijing on July 10, 2007 and another event on December 6, 2007 in Beijing also celebrating the 29th anniversary of normalization of U.S.âChina relations featuring former President [[Jimmy Carter]].  A Serbian edition of ''National Geographic'' was launched with the November 2006 issue in partnership with a joint venture of Sanoma and Gruner + Jahr.

In contrast to the United States, where membership in the National Geographic Society was until recently the only way to receive the magazine, the worldwide editions are sold on newsstands in addition to regular subscriptions. In several countries, such as Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, and Turkey, ''National Geographic'' paved the way for a subscription model in addition to traditional newsstand sales.
===Huaxia Geographic===
The Mainland Chinese edition (CNY20.00) features a few articles written in Chinese, and the original translated text is truncated or even deleted. So the Taiwanese Chinese edition is also sold in China, with a relatively high price (labelled CNY50.00, but generally sold CNY38.00).

==Awards==
On May 1, 2008, ''National Geographic'' won three [[National Magazine Awards]]âan award solely for its written contentâin the reporting category for an article by [[Peter Hessler]] on the [[Economy of the People's Republic of China|Chinese economy]]; an award in the photojournalism category for work by [[John Stanmeyer]] on [[malaria]] in the [[Third World]]; and a prestigious award for general excellence.&lt;ref&gt;PÃ©rez-PeÃ±a, Richard.

Accessed 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Criticism section|date=March 2010}}
Linda Steet&lt;!-- Sic. --&gt; in her book ''Veils and Daggers: A Century of National Geographic's Representation of the Arab World'' criticizes ''National Geographic'' for its {{Quote|masculinist rhetoric, the one-directionality of its cross-cultural contact, its claim of objectivity and representations that build layers of a... world hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Steet, Linda| year=2000| url=http://books.google.com/?id=LJN4Gd7wE9gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Veils and Daggers: A Century of National Geographic's Representation of the Arab World| page=5| publisher=Temple University Press| isbn= 9781566397520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lutz and Collins in their book ''Reading National Geographic'' argue that ''National Geographic'' is intimately tied to the American establishment and &quot;cultivates ties to government officials and corporate interests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=1993| url=http://www.amazon.com/Reading-National-Geographic-Catherine-Lutz/dp/0226497240#reader_0226497240| title=Reading National Geographic| page= 5| publisher=University Of Chicago Press| isbn=9780226497242| author=Lutz, Catherine and Jane Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg suggests that ''National Geographic'', as a part of mainstream popular culture,  has historically helped to articulate a particularly American identity in opposition to &quot;both old Europe and primitive non-Western regions... an identity of civic and technological superiority but yet, a distinctly benign and friendly identity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Rothenberg, Tamar | year=2007| url=http://books.google.com/?id=EYtCuqAb_boC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Presenting America's World: Strategies of Innocence in National Geographic Magazine, 1888â1945| page= 5| isbn= 9780754645108| publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book ''Reading National Geographic'' notes how photos are sometimes electronically manipulated.&lt;ref name=iezza&gt;Iezza, Cora McGovern.

Several of these themes wax and wane in importance through the postwar period, but none is ever absent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=1993| url=http://www.amazon.com/Reading-National-Geographic-Catherine-Lutz/dp/0226497240#reader_0226497240| title=Reading National Geographic| page= 89| publisher=University Of Chicago Press| isbn=9780226497242| author=Lutz, Catherine and Jane Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt;
