*'''Jetix''' - (2004â2009)  Jetix featured action shows, some of which were originally on Fox before Toon Disney India aired, and this block was what Fox Kids eventually became in 2004.It was released when Toon Disney India was released on 2004 as a block in Toon Disney, but now it has taken all of Toon Disney's schedule.
