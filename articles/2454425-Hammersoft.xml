'''Nicole Bobek''' (born August 23, 1977) is an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]]. She is the 1995 [[1995 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Champion]] and [[1995 World Figure Skating Championships|World bronze medalist]].

==Biography==
An [[only child]], Bobek was raised by her [[Czechs|Czech]] mother, Jana, and her friend Joyce Barron.&lt;ref name = control/&gt; Her parents were never married and she has never met her father, nor has any desire to do so.&lt;ref name = control/&gt;&lt;ref name = falling&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/figureskating/columns/story?columnist=nelson_amy&amp;id=4389556 | title=Nicole Bobek: Falling through ice | author = Nelson, Amy K. |work = [[ESPN]] | date = August 11, 2009 |accessdate = August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skating career==
Bobek's fondness for skating started when she was three.&lt;ref name = falling/&gt; She first came to national prominence by placing 2nd at the novice level of the U.S. Championships in 1989; Bobek was 11 years old. In the next few seasons, she worked her way up the competitive rankings at the national level. She was known as an athletic jumper and a charismatic performer, but an erratic competitor and undisciplined student, often arriving late to training and skipping school.&lt;ref name = control/&gt; Bobek placed 4th at the 1992 [[1992 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]], but the next year dropped to 16th at the same event. She made her first appearance at the senior World Championships in 1994, as an alternate (after both [[Nancy Kerrigan]] and [[Tonya Harding]] dropped out of the event), but failed to advance out of the qualifying round.

The 1995 season brought Bobek her greatest competitive success; she won gold at the [[1995 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], followed by the bronze medal at the [[1995 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]]. In late 1995, Bobek toured with an ice show production of [[The Nutcracker]], rather than rehabilitate an ankle injury or train for the upcoming 1996 U.S. Championships.&lt;ref name=in41811/&gt; The injury forced her out of the event, and off the World team for that season. She parted ways with her coach [[Richard Callaghan]] and joined [[Carlo Fassi]].&lt;ref name=in41811/&gt; 

Bobek struggled with back problems during the 1996-97 season but won the bronze medal at the [[1997 United States Figure Skating Championships|1997 U.S. Championships]].&lt;ref name=nyt970216&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/sports/kwan-s-slips-open-door-for-a-younger-champion.html?pagewanted=all | title = Kwan's Slips Open Door For a Younger Champion | first = Jere | last = Longman | work = The New York Times | date = February 16, 1997 | accessdate = October 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her coach Carlo Fassi died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the [[1997 World Figure Skating Championships|1997 World Championships]]. She was coached for a time by his widow, Christa Fassi. She won bronze at the [[1998 United States Figure Skating Championships|1998 U.S. Nationals]]. At the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], she was impaired by a hip injury and finished in 17th-place.&lt;ref name = control/&gt; She withdrew from the subsequent World Championships due to another injury.

Bobek left her coach, Christa Fassi, and returned for the 1998-99 season to Richard Callaghan.&lt;ref name=in41811/&gt; Callaghan got Bobek back into shape and prepared her for the Grand Prix Series. She finished 4th at Skate America and 2nd at TrophÃ©e Lalique. But her season ended quickly with a series of injuries and health problems, which prevented her from competing at the 1999 U.S. National Championships. Bobek then turned professional, touring with [[Champions on Ice]] for several years until 2004.&lt;ref name = control&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/olympics/chi-100911-bobek-hersh,0,2943704,full.story | title=Spinning back into control | author = Hersh, Philip |work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = September 11, 2010 |accessdate = September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in numerous other shows and professional competitions. Bobek then worked as a skating coach in [[Florida]]. In 2006, Bobek added acting to her resume; she appeared in ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]'', as a skater who fascinates Governor Willy Stark.

|style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;|&quot;[Bobek] coupled athleticism with ingenuity, choreographing her own routines and often improvising during performances. She was a master at playing to crowds who were wowed by her beauty and grace and a flexibility that seemed to ease her effortlessly into a trademark spiral move, her leg held straight up to her ear.&quot;

At her peak, Bobek was a strong jumper although some of her jumps did not have the best technique; for instance, she had a very marked [[flutz]], (a lutz jump which is done from the wrong edge). She had a lasting impact on ladies' figure skating because of her signature move, a [[spiral (figure skating)|spiral]] with the free leg extended very high. Television commentators including [[Dick Button]] and [[Peggy Fleming]] were so complimentary of Bobek's spiral that it was widely copied by other U.S. skaters, setting off a fad for extreme flexibility moves.

Bobek was noted for her poor training discipline,&lt;ref name = control/&gt; for  occasionally smoking cigarettes, for wearing a lot of jewelry while performing on the ice, and for changing coaches at least 11 times during her competitive skating career. She trained in [[California]], [[Michigan]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name = control/&gt; At one point she explained her behavior by saying: &quot;I'm a teenager. That's what we do.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In addition to Richard Callaghan and Carlo and Christa Fassi, Bobek's coaches included Debbie Stoery, Kathy Casey, Hoon Kim, [[Barbara Roles]], [[Frank Carroll]], [[Robin Cousins]], and [[Mary Scotvold|Mary]] and Evy Scotvold.

==Endorsements==
Bobek's skating led to  an endorsement contract with [[Campbell's Soup]]. Along with fellow skaters [[Michelle Kwan]] and [[Tara Lipinski]], Bobek appeared in a commercial in the winter of 1998: all three performed dazzling routines at an ice rink.
She also appeared in a commercial of [[Panasonic]]'s [[1998 Winter Olympics]] campaign in Japan.

==Film==
Bobek appeared in the 2006 remake of the film ''All The King's Men'', starring Sean Penn and based on the novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren. She appears on skates in a scene directly from the novel.

==Legal problems==
In November 1994, Bobek was charged with first degree [[home invasion]] after using an access code to enter a friend's garage and home in [[Michigan]]. She allegedly took cash from a purse, but was caught when the home owner arrived, at which point she returned the money. She claimed to have been given permission by another member of the household to enter the house and retrieve the cash.

At that time, Bobek was 17 years old, [[age of criminal responsibility|legally an adult under Michigan criminal law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.co.calhoun.mi.us/quest521.htm &quot;Minors - What are the rights of a 17 year old in criminal proceedings?&quot;], Calhoun County (Michigan) Courts Website, downloaded on February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but eligible for probation with a record of the offense sealed from the public record under a special law for youthful first offenders. She pled guilty under that law, the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act, and in January 1995 was given two years' probation and a choice between 50 hours of [[community service]] and 30 days in jail. Information regarding her case soon spread widely through skating circles, and was leaked to the news media.  Under the Youthful Trainee Act, cases are to remain confidential; so in February 1995, she filed for dismissal of her case. Though journalists and legal scholars have argued that Michigan law allows journalists to release information about juvenile criminals if there is &quot;compelling public interest,&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justicejournalism.org/crimeguide/chapter02/chapter02_pg05.html Jack Kresnak, ''Juvenile Justice''], Chapter 2 of &quot;Covering Crime and Justice,&quot; downloaded on February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which was arguable due to her status as a world class figure skater, Bobek's motion for probation discharge was granted by the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michlaw.com/signup/opinion.cfm?page=mi/opin/coa/183668.HTM  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN V NICOLE BOBEK] legal opinion, downloaded from the MichLaw.com website on February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, Nicole Bobek's mother made and dropped a petition to have her sent to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]], worrying her daughter would break off contact.&lt;ref name = control/&gt; On July 6, 2009, Bobek was charged with conspiracy to distribute [[methamphetamine]] and alleged to be a member of a drug ring.&lt;ref name=&quot;arraignment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arraignment&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Former skating champ Nicole Bobek is charged with 'significant role' in drug ring| journal = [[The Jersey Journal]] | url = http://blog.nj.com/hudsoncountynow_impact/print.html?entry=/2009/07/former_skating_champ_nicole_bo.html | last1 = Zeitlinger | first1 = Ron | date = July 6, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5qhZoE7bI | archivedate = June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 18, 2010 she pled guilty,&lt;ref name=&quot;plea&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper | url = http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2010/06/former_figure_skating_champion.html | journal = [[The Jersey Journal]] | title = Former figure skating champion Nicole Bobek pleads guilty to role in major Hudson County drug ring | date = June 18, 2010 | last1 = Conte | first1 = Michelangelo | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5qhZR7WtI | archivedate = June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on August 16 was sentenced to five years' probation,&lt;ref name=&quot;sentencing2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sentencing&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/ex-figure_skater_nicole_bobek.html | journal = [[The Jersey Journal]] | title = Ex-figure skater Nicole Bobek gets probation for role in N.J. drug ring | date = August 16, 2010  | agency = [[Associated Press]] | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5s1y0IaN6 | archivedate = August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 250 hours of community service, and a $2,500 fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentencing2&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jAJ-XbFGqdafIavkz5uUoXkQyHiwD9HKMEIG0 | title = Ex-skate champ Bobek gets probation on meth count | date = August 16, 2010  | last1 = Henry | first1 = Samantha | agency = [[Associated Press]] | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5s1zBJa4E | archivedate = August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bobek has admitted that she is a former drug addict, and said on NBC's Today Show that she wants to help other addicts beat their addictions and would like to do ice show charity benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/news/jjournal/index.ssf?/base/news-5/128228645220120.xml&amp;coll=3|title=Nicole Bobek, former ice skating champ sentenced this week in Jersey City for role in Hudson County methamphetamine ring, says she wants to help others beat their addictions|author=The Jersey Journal Staff|publisher=The New Jersey Journal|date=August 20, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She began taking classes toward a high school equivalency diploma, and working at Palm Beach Skate Zone in [[Lake Worth, Florida]],&lt;ref name = control/&gt; after having been away from skating for about six years.&lt;ref name=in41811/&gt; She did various jobs around the rink, initially unpaid but later officially hired, with the manager saying she was very professional.&lt;ref name = control/&gt; In 2010, she began teaching power skating and edge skills to junior hockey players at the rink.&lt;ref name = control/&gt; Her friend [[Todd Eldredge]] invited her to a ''Stars on Ice'' show, where she reconnected with her old coach [[Richard Callaghan]] and began visiting him once a week to get back in shape.&lt;ref name=in41811&gt;{{cite news | url = http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110418&amp;content_id=17942688&amp;vkey=ice_news | title = Bobek returns to the ice, with help from friends | last = Rutherford | first = Lynn |date = April 18, 2011 | work = icenetwork | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobek returned to performing at the ''Skate for Love'' benefit for [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]] in April 2011, hosted by her friend [[JoJo Starbuck]].&lt;ref name=in41811/&gt; Bobek said, &quot;I've been back on the ice about a year now. It took me a long time to get my balance again after six years; you really lose the rotation and all of those things. It took three months to do a single Axel again.&quot;&lt;ref name=in41811/&gt;
