'''[[Sailing|Sailing/Yachting]]''' is a [[Olympic sport]] starting from the Games of the 1st [[Olympiad]] ([[Sailing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] in Athens [[Greece]]. With the exception of [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and possible [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916]] sailing was always a part of the Olympic program.
The Sailing program of 1948 consisted of a total of five sailing classes (disciplines). For each class seven races were scheduled from 3â12 August 1948 [[Torquay]]/[[Torbay]], on England's south coast.

The sailing was done on the triangular type Olympic courses. The start was made in the center of a set of 8 numbered marks that were places in a circle. During the starting procedure the sequence of the marks was communicated to the sailors. By picking the mark that was most upwind the start could always be made upwind. This system is, at least in certain certain German lakes, still in use.

== Venue ==

As we quote from the official report: ''&quot;Torquay was, perhaps, an inevitable choice as the venue. It is exposed only to easterly winds, which are rare in summer. Moreover, it is remarkably free from strong tides and currents and other navigational hazards, and thus there is nothing or next to nothing to be gained from the &quot; local knowledge &quot; which is so profitable in difficult waters.&quot;''

The sailing event had, since the distance to the London area a, separate opening ceremony which took place in [[Torquay]]. The opening was made by IOC chairman: [[Sigfrid Edstrom|Mr. J. Sigfrid Edstrom]].

A 14-[[Nautical mile|nm]] course was created for the Dragons and 6 Metres. The Star and Swallow sailed a little more inshore on a 10-nm course, while for the Firefly a 6-nm course was set close to the coast.

The closing ceremony was observed by 10,000 spectators. The medals were handed by [[Sir Ralph Gore]], President of the [[International Yacht Racing Union]].

== Remarks ==
=== Sailing ===
* Modern techniques like cold moulded plywood and Aluminum mast and booms made their enterence in the Firefly.
* This Olympic sailing event was gender independent, but tuned out to be a ''Mens only'' event. This was one of the triggers to create gender specific events. This however had to wait until [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]].
* The series were scheduled over the two Olympic weeks. race 1â4 in each class were sailed from 3â6 August. race 5â7 took place on 10â12 August. This was done so that boats could be overhauled after the first set of races.
* The best feature of this Olympic was the scoring system. Quote from the officiel report: â ''&quot;The number of points awarded to each other competitor diminishes under a given formula, according to the placing of his boat at the finish.&quot;'' â This system was invented by an Austrian sailor. Advantages of this system are:
** Winning races is well awarded, so sailors are likely to fight till the end of the race for each place
** Less ties than with the point for place system
** The score of the winner reflects the number of entries
* Together with the scoring system it was introduced that each team could discard its worst result
* The courses were laid and patrolled by vessels of the [[Royal Navy]]
* The two major [[Axis powers]] of World War II, Germany and Japan, were not invited to the Games.
