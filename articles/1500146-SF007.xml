'''Scientific Linux''' ('''SL''') is a [[Linux distribution]] produced by [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]] and the [[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN). It is a [[free and open source]] [[operating system]] based on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and aims to be &quot;as close to the commercial enterprise distribution as we can get it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificlinux.org/documentation/faq/general1 Scientific Linux - General Questions about Scientific Linux&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This product is derived from the [[free software|free]] and [[open source]] software made available by [[Red Hat]], Inc., but is not produced, maintained or supported by Red Hat. Specifically, this product is built from the source code for [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] versions, under the terms and conditions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux's EULA and the [[GNU General Public License]].

==History==

[[Fermilab]] already had a Linux distribution known as [[Fermi Linux]] LTS 3.0.1, based on RHEL.  [[CERN]] was creating their next version of Cern Linux, also based on RHEL.  CERN contacted Fermilab about doing a joint collaboration. Connie Sieh was the main developer and driver behind the first prototypes and initial release.

The first official release was on May 10, 2004.

At the release of Scientific Linux 3.0.1, [[CERN]] joined in the collaboration and became co-developers of Scientific Linux.

The name Scientific Linux is actually a misnomer, in that it does not contain scientific software and was named instead for the labs that make it.

===Version history===
Historical releases of Scientific Linux are the following.
