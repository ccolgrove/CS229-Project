The '''Michigan State Spartans men's basketball''' team represents [[Michigan State University]] (MSU) and competes in the [[Big Ten Conference]] of [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. The team currently plays at the [[Breslin Student Events Center]].  The men's basketball program is considered one of college basketball's elite, an annual NCAA Tournament contender &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue bloods reign in Friday's |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/9151/bluebloods-reign-in-fridays-late-action|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee hopes to get where Mich.

Michigan State men's basketball team has a long history that is rich in tradition.  The team has won two NCAA championships and 12 [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] championships in men's basketball. The Spartans won the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|National Championship]] in both the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1979 NCAA Tournament]] and [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2000 NCAA Tournament]]. The 1979 National Championship story line was [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNkyv4S67EU highly touted as Magic vs. Bird]. It was achieved by a team under the coaching of [[Jud Heathcote]] that included MVP [[Magic Johnson]], [[Greg Kelser]] and [[Jay Vincent]]. MSU beat the then undefeated [[Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball|Indiana State Sycamores]], led by future NBA hall of famer [[Larry Bird]]. The [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvo44lkyLCo 2000 National Championship] was achieved by [[Morris Peterson]], A.J. Granger, [[Charlie Bell (basketball)|Charlie Bell]], [[Jason Richardson]] and MVP [[Mateen Cleaves]] leading the team in a victory over the [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida Gators]].

Michigan State basketball has been selected for 14 consecutive NCAA tournament bids (1998&amp;ndash;2011) as of the end of the 2010 season, which is the third-longest active streak of NCAA tournament bids, behind [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] (22) and [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] (16). Overall, Michigan State has been to the Final Four a total of eight times in its history (1957, 1979, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2010), which is tied for seventh all time, and has made 25 NCAA Tournament appearances. Only six schools have more total [[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school|Final Four appearances]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The program is also fourth all time in NCAA tournament winning percentage.

On December 13, 2003, Michigan State and [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] played at the most-attended college basketball game in history known as the [[Basketbowl]]. They played this game in front of 78,129 people at [[Ford Field]], a football stadium converted to a basketball court for this game in [[Detroit]]. Kentucky won this game by a score of 79&amp;ndash;74.&lt;ref&gt;MSU Spartans.com [http://msuspartans.collegesports.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/121303aaa.html Men's Basketball Falls To No. 8 Kentucky, 79-74].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaches==
Michigan State coaches have led the Spartans to two NCAA Championships, eight Final Fours, 25 NCAA Tournament appearances, 12 [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball regular season champions|Big Ten Conference Championships]] and two [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] titles.  Michigan State has two coaches that are in the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame (Pete Newell (class of 2006) and Jud Heathcote (class of 2009)).  On November 28, 2009 Tom Izzo passed Jud Heathcote's mark of 340 career wins by beating U Mass 106-68.  Tom Izzo now leads all MSU basketball coaches in wins.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://msuspartans.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/msu/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/mbaskbl-0708-mg-eight Michigan State Michigan State University Spartans, Official Athletic Site - Michigan State&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all MSU coaches who have headed the Spartans basketball squad in at least a dozen games, Izzo is second in winning percentage and no MSU coach tops him since 1910. Former coach George E. Denman won all 11 games he coached between 1901â03 and [[Chester Brewer|Chester L. Brewer]] won 70 of 95 games from 1903 to 1910.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Prior to seeding MSU appeared in the 1957, 1959 and 1978 NCAA Tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/history/ NCAA Basketball - CBSSports.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Invitation Tournament appearances===
The Spartans have played in the 1983, 1989, 1993, 1996 and 1997 NIT Tournaments. MSU's highest finish in the tournament is fourth place, which was accomplished in 1989.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Uniforms==

Tom Izzo's teams have worn [http://www.spartanjerseys.com/michigan-state-basketball-jerseys/tom-izzo-michigan-state-basketball-jerseys.html five different styles of jerseys] during his fifteen years at Michigan State.

The current home jersey, introduced as part of a rebranding effort by the athletic department in April 2010, is white with green uniform numbers and a green custom font &quot;SPARTANS&quot; across the chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;msuspartans.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.msuspartans.com/view.gal?id=68126 Photo Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The road jersey is green with white uniform numbers and a white custom font &quot;SPARTANS&quot; across the chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;msuspartans.com&quot;/&gt; The Spartans do not currently wear an official alternate uniform but the team has worn a silver alternate and a 1979 throwback uniform in the past.

[[Nike, Inc.]] started making jerseys for the team at the start of the 2000-01 season.

==Home court==
The Spartans play home games at the [[Jack Breslin Student Events Center]] on campus in [[East Lansing, Michigan]]. The arena is commonly referred to as &quot;the Breslin&quot; and &quot;the Bres&quot;, and was opened in 1989. It is named for Jack Breslin, an MSU alumnus, former athlete and administrator, who first began pushing for the arena in 1969. Its capacity is 16,280 seats, and the stadium superseded [[Jenison Fieldhouse]].

The arena's current basketball court is the same floor where the Spartans won the [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], which was at the [[RCA Dome]] in [[Indianapolis]]. The school purchased the floor from the NCAA and Final Four floor installer Horner Flooring after the title game. A plaque was installed on the baseline near the Michigan State tunnel to commemorate the floor's purpose in the school's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ramsey | first = Ethan | title = Champs given shot to purchase Final Four court | url= http://www.dailyorange.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=78624dd8-759a-40c5-bc06-b176aad52db3 | publisher = The Daily Orange | date = 2005-03-29 | accessdate = 2008-01-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Breslin Center is home to the [[Izzone]], a large student section named after Coach Izzo, the basketball team's head coach since 1995. The student section had been named Spartan Spirits prior to Izzo's prominence at the school. The Izzone routinely gets mentioned in discussions of the nation's top student fan sections. The Izzone was mentioned as the 3rd best in the land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/sioncampus/02/20/spring.break2/index.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com - Best Student Sections - Feb 22, 2006 | date=February 22, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section helped cheer the Spartans to a 53-game home win streak between 1998 and 2002 and also a 28 game winning streak from 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=250160275 ESPN - Michigan State vs. Wisconsin - Recap - January 16, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
