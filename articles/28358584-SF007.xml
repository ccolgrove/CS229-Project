'''MerriamâWebster''', which was originally the '''G. &amp; C. Merriam Company'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbrookfieldlibrary.org/charles.html |title=About Charles Merriam |publisher=wbrookfieldlibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], is an [[United States|American]] company that publishes reference books, especially [[dictionary|dictionaries]] that are descendants of [[Noah Webster|Noah Websterâs]] ''[[An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1828).

Merriam-Webster Inc. has been a subsidiary of [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]] since 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/376313/Merriam-Webster-Inc |title=Merriam-Webster dictionary |publisher= britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Noah Webster===
In 1806, [[Noah Webster]] published his first dictionary, [[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|''A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language'']]. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took 27 years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned 26 languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]]. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the country used different languages. They also spelled, pronounced, and used English words differently.

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His book contained 70,000 words, of which 12,000 had never appeared in a published dictionary before.  As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing &quot;colour&quot; with &quot;color&quot;, &quot;waggon&quot; with &quot;wagon&quot;, and &quot;centre&quot; with &quot;center&quot;. He also added American words, like &quot;skunk&quot; and &quot;squash&quot;, that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of 70, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2,500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.

Austin (2005) explores the intersection of lexicographical and poetic practices in American literature, and attempts to map out a &quot;lexical poetics&quot; using Webster's dictionaries as a base.  He shows the ways in which American poetry has inherited Webster ideas and has drawn upon his lexicography in order to develop the language. Austin explicates key definitions from both the ''Compendious'' (1806) and ''American'' (1828) dictionaries, and brings into its discourse a range of concerns, including the politics of American English, the question of national identity and culture in the early moments of American independence, and the poetics of citation and of definition. Webster's dictionaries were a redefinition of Americanism within the context of an emergent and unstable American socio-political and cultural identity. Webster's identification of his project as a &quot;federal language&quot; shows his competing impulses towards regularity and innovation in historical terms. Perhaps the contradictions of Webster's project comprised part of a larger dialectical play between liberty and order within Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary political debates.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan W. Austin, &quot;Lost in the Maze of Words: Reading and Re-reading Noah Webster's Dictionaries,&quot; ''Dissertation Abstracts International,'' 2005, Vol. 65 Issue 12, p. 4561&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merriam as publisher===
In 1843, after [[Noah Webster]]'s death, [[George Merriam|George]] and Charles Merriam secured publishing and revision rights to the 1840 edition of the dictionary. They published a revision in 1847, which did not change any of the main text but merely added new sections, and a second update with illustrations in 1859. In 1864, Merriam published a much expanded edition, which was the first version to change Webster's text, largely overhauling his work, yet retaining many of his definitions and the title, &quot;An American Dictionary&quot;. This began a series of revisions known as &quot;Unabridged&quot;, which became increasingly as much &quot;Merriam&quot; as &quot;Webster.&quot; 

With the edition of 1890, the dictionary was retitled &quot;Webster's International&quot;. The vocabulary was vastly expanded in &quot;Webster's New International&quot; editions of 1909 and 1934, totaling over half a million words, with the 1934 edition retrospectively called &quot;Webster's Second International,&quot; or simply &quot;The Second Edition.&quot;  Merriam overhauled the dictionary again with the 1961 &quot;Webster's Third New International&quot; under the direction of [[Philip Babcock Gove|Philip B. Gove]], making changes which sparked public controversy. (For more details on these dictionaries, see [[Webster's Dictionary]].)

The &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot; series was initiated in 1898. Since the 1940s, the company has added many specialized dictionaries, language aides, and other references to its repertoire.  

The ''G. &amp; C. Merriam Company'' lost its right to exclusive use of the name &quot;Webster&quot; after a series of lawsuits placed it in public domain. Its name was changed to ''MerriamâWebster Inc.'' with the publication     of ''Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary'' in 1983. The company has been a subsidiary of [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]] Inc. since 1964.

==Today==
In 1996, Merriam-Webster launched its first website, which provided free access to an online dictionary and thesaurus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As of 2003, the company's two best known dictionaries were:

* ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]], Unabridged'', the most complete current non-specialist American dictionary of English.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} It is also an application for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].
* ''[[Webster's Dictionary#Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|MerriamâWebster's Collegiate Dictionary]]'', Eleventh Edition, the largest and most popular college dictionary, which is available in CD-ROM format for use on personal computers. The company's online dictionary is based on the ''Collegiate Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Merriam-Webster has also published dictionaries of [[synonyms]], [[Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|English usage]], [[geography]] (''[[Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary]]''), [[biography]], [[proper names]], [[medical terminology|medical terms]], [[sports]] terms, [[slang]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]â[[English language|English]], and numerous others. Non-dictionary publications include ''Collegiate Thesaurus,'' ''Secretarial Handbook,'' ''Manual for Writers and Editors,'' ''Collegiate Encyclopedia,'' ''Encyclopedia of Literature,'' and ''Encyclopedia of World Religions.''

On February 14, 2007 MerriamâWebster announced it was working with mobile search and information provider [[AskMeNow]] to launch a mobile dictionary and thesaurus service enabling consumers to access definitions, spelling and synonyms via text message. Services also include MerriamâWebster's Word of the Day and Open Dictionary, a wiki service promising subscribers the opportunity to create and submit their own new words and definitions.

==Pronunciation guides==
The MerriamâWebster company once used a unique set of [[phonetic symbol]]s in their dictionaries which permitted people from various parts of the US to learn how to pronounce new words as others who spoke with the same accent or dialect did. But [[Unicode]] did not specify room for these characters in their list. To enable a variety of computer systems to access the pronunciation, the [[online]] services of MerriamâWebster specify a less-specific use of [[ASCII]] characters, which should not be confused with the former print [[font]]s.
