The '''1951 Maryland Terrapins football team''' represented the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[college football]] in its [[1951 college football season|31st season]] as a member of the [[Southern Conference]]. Maryland outscored its opponents, 381â74, and finished the season with a 10â0 record, including three [[shut out]]s, and held seven opponents held to seven points or less. It was the school's first perfect undefeated and untied season since [[1893 Maryland Aggies football team|1893]]. Maryland also secured its first berth in a major postseason [[bowl game]], the [[1952 Sugar Bowl]], where it upset first-ranked [[1951 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] under head coach [[Robert Neyland]].

Maryland was led by fifth-year head coach [[Jim Tatum]], who ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called &quot;the most successful major college coach in the game&quot; [[Maryland Terrapins football under Jim Tatum (1947â1955)|during his nine-year tenure]] at [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825833,00.html The Coach], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 3, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, Tatum remains the winningest Maryland football coach of the modern era, with a [[winning percentage]] of 0.819.&lt;ref name=records&gt;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/acc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/07fbguide051056.pdf Records] (PDF), 2007 Maryland Terrapins Football Media Guide, University of Maryland, p. 55, retrieved 14 January 2009.

Other key returning players included [[Ed Modzelewski]], [[Ed Fullerton]], [[Bob Ward (American football)|Bob Ward]], and [[Bob Shemonski]].

==Before the season==
[[File:Jack Scarbath pose.jpg|thumb|Quarterback [[Jack Scarbath]] led the team for most of the season]]
Maryland had ended the [[1950 Maryland Terrapins football team|previous season]] on a two-game winning streak, which it extended through the duration of the 1951 season. The [[1952 Maryland Terrapins football team|following year]], the Terrapins continued that streak for seven additional games before a loss to 11th-ranked Mississippi. In total, Maryland won 22&amp;nbsp;straight games from 1950 to 1952, which remains the longest winning streak in program history.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt; One [[Associated Press]] writer characterized the 1950 season's 7&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;1 record as a disappointment to &quot;never-satisfied alumni&quot; who had hoped for an undefeated season and first-ever Southern Conference championship.&lt;ref name=bestseason/&gt;

Respected sports prognosticator [[Grantland Rice]] picked [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]] under [[Carl Snavely]] as the frontrunner to win the Southern Conference championship and predicted they would finish as the 18th ranked team in the nation. Rice estimated Maryland would finish second in the league and 20th in the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UM8bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1AEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6670,4975996&amp;dq=maryland+football&amp;hl=en Granny Rice Makes Annual Grid Forecast For Look], ''The Dispatch'', August 31, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Moore of the Associated Press named Maryland the favorite to win the Southern Conference championship and stated it was &quot;undoubtedly&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the team to beat&quot;, although he acknowledged that at least eight other teams would also be in contention: North Carolina, [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke]], [[NC State Wolfpack football|North Carolina State]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]], [[VMI Keydets football|VMI]], [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons football|Wake Forest]], and [[William &amp; Mary Tribe football|William &amp; Mary]]. Moore was more subdued in his assessments of [[George Washington Colonials football|George Washington]], [[Richmond Spiders football|Richmond]], [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], [[Washington &amp; Lee Generals football|Washington &amp; Lee]], and predicted rebuilding seasons for [[Davidson Wildcats football|Davidson]], [[Furman Paladins football|Furman]], [[The Citadel Bulldogs football|The Citadel]], and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NhwsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j8YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2827,4678116&amp;dq=maryland+football&amp;hl=en Maryland Favorite To Take Southern Crown], ''Times Daily'', September 2, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Press later called Maryland's preseason favorite title a &quot;dubious distinction&quot;, to which few teams in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] had been able to live up. Tatum expressed confidence and said it was &quot;the best team I've ever coached,&quot; but acknowledged the team could lose as many as seven games in a worst-case scenario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MgUQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tYoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5001,48036&amp;dq=maryland+football&amp;hl=en SC Football Teams Start Workouts; North Carolina And Clemson Are Sleepers; VPI, Spiders to Rely Heavily on Freshmen], ''The Free Lance-Star'', September 1, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Associated Press article said most people expected a big season from Maryland as the culmination of five years of Tatum's high-caliber recruiting.&lt;ref name=bestseason&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N2Y0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6qQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2698,3804160&amp;dq=maryland+football&amp;hl=en Maryland Ready For Best Season], ''The Rock Hill Herald'', September 7, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United Press International|United Press]] article had high confidence in Maryland, because of its experienced team and what it assessed as an easier schedule than previous seasons. It predicted [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]], [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]], [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]], and North Carolina as the &quot;only rough spots&quot; on the schedule.&lt;ref name=tops/&gt;

===Personnel===
Maryland lost several players, including fifteen [[letterman (sports)|lettermen]], from the previous season due to the exhaustion of their [[student-athlete|college eligibility]].&lt;ref name=bestseason/&gt; These included [[end (American football)|end]]s [[Elmer Wingate]] and Pete Augsburger, [[tackle (American football)|tackle]]s [[Chet Gierula]] and [[Ray Krouse]], [[center (American football)|center]] Jack Rowden, and [[placekicker|kicker]] Jack Targarona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/terrapinyearbook1951univ ''Terrapin''], University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, pp. 277&amp;ndash;278.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Maryland did not lose a single back &quot;worthy of mention&quot;, and all of the linemen aside from the ends had ready replacements.&lt;ref name=bestseason/&gt;

On the whole, Maryland returned a seasoned team that included 22 lettermen, and the United Press described the team as &quot;bigger and bruisier than ever.&quot;&lt;ref name=tops&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PWQuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ktoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5484,6419819&amp;dq=maryland+football&amp;hl=en Maryland Rated Tops In Southern Grid Conference This Year; No Rival as Strong as Terrapins With 22 Lettermen on Squad, North Carolina Depends on Sophomores], ''Reading Eagle'', September 18, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; They were led by junior [[quarterback]] [[Jack Scarbath]] who gained significant experience in the split-T the previous season,&lt;ref name=tops/&gt; in which he [[starting lineup|started]] the first six games before suffering an injury.&lt;ref name=terp1624/&gt; He was backed up by a capable reservist in sophomore quarterback [[Bernie Faloney]].&lt;ref name=terp1624/&gt; (In 1952, Scarbath was the [[Heisman Trophy]] runner-up,&lt;ref name=&quot;52heisman&quot;&gt;[http://www.heisman.com/winners/b-vessels52.html 1952 â 18th Award], Heisman.com, retrieved December 10, 2008.

Scarbath was accompanied in the [[back (American football)|backfield]] by several other capable players, including &quot;one of the biggest [[fullback (American football)|fullback]]s in captivity&quot;&lt;ref name=tops/&gt; [[Ed Modzelewski]] and [[halfback (American football)|halfback]]s [[Chet Hanulak|Chet &quot;the Jet&quot; Hanulak]] and [[Ed Fullerton]]. Halfback [[Bob Shemonski]], the previous season's conference-scoring leader, was shifted to play mostly on defense, but would rank as the team leader in [[kick return]]s with six for 126 yards.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt; The Terrapins' line was anchored by co-captains [[Bob Ward (American football)|Bob Ward]], a [[guard (American football)|guard]], and [[Dave Cianelli]], the [[center (American football)|center]]. At [[tackle (American football)|tackle]], it featured Ed's brother, [[Dick Modzelewski]], and [[Bob Morgan (American football)|Bob Morgan]].&lt;ref name=terp1624/&gt; The defense was described as particularly deep, anchored by Ward, Cianelli, and Jeff Keith, and with good reserves available into even the third string.&lt;ref name=tops/&gt;

====Coaching staff====
[[Jim Tatum]] served as the head coach for his fifth year at Maryland in the 1951 season. All told, he served a nine-year tenure at [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] and compiled a 73â15â4 record for a winning percentage of 0.819, the highest among Maryland coaches in the modern era.&lt;ref name=records/&gt; Tatum later gained national recognition, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine later calling him &quot;the most successful major college coach in the game&quot;, and 1951 proved to be his breakout season.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Tatum employed the [[split-T]], which he had learned firsthand as the protÃ©gÃ© of its pioneer, [[Don Faurot]]. This new offensive system sought to emulate the &quot;two-on-one&quot; [[fast break]] of [[basketball]], with the aim of creating an undefended [[back (American football)|back]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutigers.com/trads/miss-split-t.html Don Faurot's Split-T Formation], University of Missouri, retrieved June 22, 2009.

The [[1950 Maryland Terrapins football team|year prior]], [[1951 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] had soundly beaten an unprepared and unconditioned Maryland team in the season-opener.

Later in the first quarter, [[Chet Hanulak]] rushed for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Hanulak scored again. Georgia's only score of the game came on a four-yard rush by [[Lauren Hargrove]]. Halftime expired with a score of 17â7. In the third quarter, Ed Modzelewski, [[Ralph Felton]], and Scarbath each scored. Fullerton scored the final touchdown on a then school-record 86-yard run.&lt;ref name=&quot;p167&quot;&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/terrapinyearbook1952univ ''Terrapin''], University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1952, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maryland then traveled to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] to face [[Southeastern Conference]] powerhouse [[LSU Tigers football|Louisiana State]]. A tough LSU defense held Maryland scoreless through the first and most of the second quarter. Late in the first half, LSU's Jim Barton and Bernie Faloney exchanged several punts, until Maryland gained good field position on the Tigers' 43-yard line. Ed Modzelewski helped lead a five-play drive capped by a [[quarterback sneak]] by Scarbath for the first score of the game. On the next Maryland possession, Scarbath dodged several LSU tacklers and ran for a 56-yard touchdown. At halftime, the Terrapins led, 13â0. In the third quarter, Maryland executed a [[sweep (American football)|sweep]] and [[reverse (American football)|double reverse]], which allowed Bob Shemonski to rush for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Ed Modzelewski tossed the ball to Chet Hanulak for the final score of the game.

But Jim Tatum was a coach who could work wonders.&quot; After mechanical issues delayed Maryland's flight, the team became the first to practice at night for a Sugar Bowl. Tatum said, &quot;[Tennessee is] so much better than we are that they probably don't need the practice.

[[File:1952 Sugar Bowl Scarbath sneak.jpg|thumb|right|Scarbath tallied the first points of the game on a successful [[quarterback sneak]].]]
Tennessee was led by triple-threat quarterback and Heisman runner-up [[Hank Lauricella]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wash&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heisman.com/winners/d-kazmaier51.html 1951 - 17th Award], Heisman.com, retrieved 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Neyland's offensive linemen were described as not large but &quot;squatty&quot; and &quot;bruiser[s], not flashy, but slightly murderous.&quot; Neyland considered the split-T offense used by Tatum gimmicky and relied on the more traditional [[single-wing formation]]. He subscribed to the adage that, when the ball was thrown, &quot;three things could happen, and two of them were bad.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wash&quot;/&gt; For the game, Tatum himself abandoned the split-T in favor of a [[Offensive philosophy (American football)#Smash Mouth|smashmouth]] approach to run it up the middle, where he thought &quot;they least expected [it].&quot; Neyland's strategy focused heavily on punting the ball to pin the opponent in their own territory with a goal of creating turnovers, and Tatum likewise adopted it.&lt;ref name=&quot;wash&quot;/&gt;

The game started with both teams exchanging several punts in the first quarter. Maryland gained good field position after Lauricella kicked a short punt. Running backs [[Ed Modzelewski]] and [[Ed Fullerton]] then led an 11-play, 56-yard rushing drive for a touchdown. On the kickoff, Bob Ward hit Lauricella and forced a fumble that Maryland recovered on Tennessee's 13-yard line.&lt;ref name=&quot;wash&quot;/&gt; After four plays, [[Jack Scarbath]] [[lateral pass|pitch]]ed to Fullerton who then threw a six-yard [[forward pass]] to Bob Shemonski in the end zone and expanded the Maryland lead to 14â0.

==After the season==
[[File:1952 Maryland FB celebration.jpg|thumb|right|The team celebrates after its Sugar Bowl victory.]]
Maryland finished as the nation's only untied, undefeated team that had played a ten-game schedule. The final wire service rankings, however, were released prior to the bowl games at the time. Therefore, Maryland held a final ranking as the number-three team in the nation, behind first-ranked Tennessee (10â1) and second-ranked [[1951 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] (9â0).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appollarchive.com/football/ap/seasons.cfm?seasonid=1951 1951 Final AP Football Poll], AP Poll Archive, retrieved January 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the 1951 Terrapins remain Maryland's only undefeated, untied team of the modern era.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt;

Several championship selectors have retroactively named Maryland the 1951 national champions. These include the following NCAA-recognized sources: [[Jeff Sagarin]]'s computer ranking system, the College Football Researchers Association, the DeVold System, the Dunkel System, and the National Championship Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf 2007 NCAA Division I Football Records Book] (PDF), National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2007, retrieved January 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the 1951 season the greatest in Maryland football history, ranking it above the 1953 national championship team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-320427.html Tatum's Undefeated Terps Are Still the Greatest; Undefeated Team Finished No. 3, Beat No. 1 Tennessee in Sugar Bowl], ''The Washington Post'', January 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The season saw Maryland compile its first (and, to date, only) undefeated, untied season since [[Maryland Terrapins football: 1856â1946|1893]].
