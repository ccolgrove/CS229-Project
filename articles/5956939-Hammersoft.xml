&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named '''X''', [[X Japan]] achieved their breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second album ''[[Blue Blood (X Japan album)|Blue Blood]]''. They started out as a [[power metal|power]]/[[speed metal]] band and later gravitated towards a [[Progressive metal|progressive]] sound, at all times retaining an emphasis on ballads. Their sound is extremely raw, sometimes countered by the incorporation of classical style piano passages and vocal melodies. They have well-developed percussion parts and often use harmonized guitar riffs and solos.

Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label,&lt;ref name=&quot;eastern_standard_time&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; They were known in their early years for their excessively large hairstyles, but toned these down in later years.

After sixteen years, four albums, and selling out the 55,000 seat [[Tokyo Dome]] 18 times, X Japan disbanded in 1997. The band did not perform or record any material for another 10 years. However, in 2007, the band reunited and performed live for the first time since their break-up. After performing concerts throughout Asia from 2007 to 2009, the band performed their first North American tour from September 25 to October 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;
