'''Mamarapha College''' is a post-secondary theological institution for [[indigenous Australians]] located in [[Karragullen, Western Australia|Karragullen]], [[Western Australia]]

Students come from all states of Australia, and range in age from 19 to 70 years. Their educational background ranges from marginal literacy to those with a degree.

Mamarapha College is a [[Registered Training Organisation]] and awards range from Certificate 1 through to 4 year [[Advanced Diploma]]. Study is offered via study blocks (âintensivesâ) for some courses while ministers in training study full time for their second and third year, then learn on-the-job with a minister in the field for their fourth year.

== History ==
Mamarapha College was set up by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in 1997 to train indigenous pastors and members in bible and ministry skills. Mamarapha is a composite from western desert [[Aboriginal languages]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] â  meaning âGod makes wholeâ. Personal spiritual development is the primary focus of the college and learning to minister to others is another focus of the program.
