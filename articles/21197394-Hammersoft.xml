'''Warner elevator row''' is a row of historic wood-cribbed [[grain elevators]] with six elevators all standing in a row from south to north, alongside the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], that travels from [[Great Falls, Montana]] to [[Lethbridge, Alberta]], on the east entrance of the village of [[Warner, Alberta|Warner]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. This row is one of two remaining &quot;elevator rows&quot; in Canada.

==History and significance==
[[Image:Alberta Farmers Co-oprative Elevator Co. Warner, Alta 1920.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alberta Farmers Co-oprative Elevator Co. built 1913 then taken over by [[Alberta Wheat Pool|Alberta Pool Elevators]]. Ca. 1920.]]

Since a vast number of the once-dominant wood-crib grain elevators throughout Canada have been torn down, only two elevator rows have survived partial demolition if not complete demolition. An example of such is [[Vulcan, Alberta]], which once boasted a total of 12 grain elevators at one time, more than any location west of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. By 2000 all but one have since been demolished and replaced with two larger concrete [[grain terminal]]s on the southeast side of town.

Warner is one of the last two rows in Canada with a total of six elevators, the other [[Inglis, Manitoba]], with a total of five elevators, these two elevator rows remain the last surviving &quot;elevator rows&quot; in Canada. Warner's elevators have not been protected and may be at risk of demolition. The elevators at Inglis however have since been fully restored back to their original signage and are now fully protected as [[National Historic Sites of Canada]].

Prior to 1911 Warner had two elevators, one was a {{convert|30000|impbu|m3}} house built by Alberta Pacific Elevator Co., and the other was a {{convert|25000|impbu|m3}} elevator built by Jones and Dill. In 1913 the first elevator remaining in the present row was constructed by the [[United Farmers of Alberta|Alberta Farmersâ Co-operative Elevator Co.]]. 

The individual structural and narrative history of the elevators illustrates well developments in the grain industry and individual companies from before [[World War II|WWII]] to the 1980s. 

The row at Warner is of significance for its massing of complexes. The elevators built at Warner date from 1913 to 1960. The row includes an early example of the Alberta Farmersâ Co-operative Elevator company design, and an example of several different complex component arrangements; elevator and twin, elevator and annexes of several types, original type offices and replacement offices. The row has a total of six complexes, with a total of eight elevators. 
The elevator built by Ellison Milling and Elevator Co. in 1939 is an architecturally significant example of a 1940s complex that has undergone almost no change, comprising an elevator, two balloon annexes, and a track side office/warehouse, usually associated with an earlier period. There are only a small number of elevators from the later 1930s left standing in the province; a reminder that few were built for some time after 1934. This elevator was demolished in the early 2000s.

==The grain elevators==

The grain elevators in Warner have a high degree of integrity; few elevators have been removed from the row which is perhaps the most impressive row in Alberta with four complexes (six elevators). The individual elevators, with the exception of the [[United Grain Growers|UGG]] elevator, have had little modification and several have old small scales and air dumps in situ.

===Demolitions===

Since 1999â2001 a total of three elevators have been torn down at Warner, bringing the row to a total of four complexes, with a total of six elevators. Even with the losses of the three that have been torn down, the row still remains significant because it has more than three elevators in a row.

===Histories===

Below is the histories of the elevators in the row from north to south that still stand as well as the ones that have since been torn down.

'''''United Grain Growers'''''
[[Image:United Grain Growers elevator - Warner.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[United Grain Growers]] elevator built 1960. {{convert|134000|impbu|m3}}.]]
This elevator and accompanying annex was built 1957â1960. It was UGGâs second elevator at Warner, the first having been sold to Alberta Pool Elevators in 1928. It was licensed for {{convert|134000|impbu|m3}} in 1960. The elevator has had substantial upgrading in the late 1980s, including the installation of a new leg that has required heightening part of the cupola roof. The metal bin annexes on the south side, complete with drag auger, also date from this time. A cyclone dust collector and truck loading spout have also been installed. A roofed warehouse located track-side on the north side of the elevator, was most likely built at the same time as the elevator. 

'''''X.C. Hadford Company (demolished)'''''

This elevator was built by X. C. Hadford Company in 1950. It was licensed as a {{convert|15000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} seed plant in 1952. It is now operated by Demeter Argo, owned by the Alberta Wheat Pool. In 1992 it was licensed as a primary elevator with a capacity of 240 tonnes. It is used to handle mustard seed. No further information on the structural history of the complex has been found. This elevator has been torn down.

'''''Alberta Farmers Co-operative Elevator Company (twin)'''''
[[Image:Alberta Farmers Co-operative Elevator.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Original 1913 Alberta Farmers Co-opative elevator. {{convert|35000|impbu|m3}}]]
This {{convert|35000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator was built in 1913. It measures {{convert/3|31|Ã|42|Ã|65|ft|m}}. This elevator is one of two oldest extant examples of the standard design used by Alberta Farmersâ Elevator Co. 1913â1917. It is built on the standard plan used by the Alberta Farmers Co-operative elevator company. It has a pyramidal roof with a gable roofed cupola housing the head of the leg. Archival photographs of other Alberta Farmersâ Co-operative Elevator Co. facilities suggest that this elevator probably originally had an office that sat trackside beside the elevator also served as a warehouse. 
[[File:Alberta Wheat Pool No. 2 &amp; Alberta Pacific elevator (TWIN) - Warner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1913 Co-oprative elevator twined with an [[Alberta Wheat Pool]] in 1951.]]
In 1913 the UFA proposed the establishment of the Alberta Farmersâ Elevator Co. as the solution to producersâ problems in Alberta. Shares were issued to farmers at $60 par value, payable in four annual installments. The Alberta government provided financing through a loan for 85% of the share sum. In order to market their grain and guarantee their loans during a time of rapid wartime expansion the Alberta Farmersâ Co-operative Elevator Co. relied on the experience of the Grain Growers Grain Co. of [[Manitoba]]. In 1917 the two companies amalgamated to form the [[United Grain Growers]], with headquarters [[Winnipeg]]. 

In 1928 UGG sold their 1913 Warner elevator to Alberta Pool Elevator Co. A coal shed that had been associated with the elevator since 1926 was sold in 1940 and removed from the site. 
In 1940 a {{convert|35000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} balloon annex, built by F. W. McDougall Construction Company, was added to the elevator. It was removed at an unknown date. The elevator was twinned with a new elevator constructed by the Pool in 1951. A new driveway was constructed at this time. The 1913 elevator has a high degree of structural and mechanical integrity. The trackside loading area has not been modified. The metal cladding is original to the structure. The cupola, however, has been reclad with siding. 

'''''Alberta Wheat Pool (twin)''''' 

This {{convert|60000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator was built in 1951, and subsequently twinned with the 1913 elevator. It measures {{convert/3|38|Ã|42|Ã|65|ft|m}}. The elevator has a high degree of structural and mechanical integrity and appears much as it did in 1951. The short scale and pneumatic dump are still in place. 

'''''Alberta Pool Elevator Co.'''''
[[File:Alberta Pool Elevator - Warner.jpg|thumb|right|150px|1928 [[Alberta Wheat Pool]] elevator. {{convert|40000|impbu|m3}}]]
This elevator was built by Voss Bros for Alberta Pool Elevator Co. in 1928. It was built according to the standard {{convert|40000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} plan, at a cost of $15,300. It measures {{convert/3|34|Ã|35|Ã|62|ft|m}}. A balloon annex was built in 1940, on the south side. It was removed in 1995. The elevator has a high degree of structural and mechanical integrity, and is complete with original scale and pneumatic dump. The rear part of the office, now that the engine has been removed, has been converted into a warehouse. This elevator served as AWPâs No. 2 elevator in the summer of 1997. 

'''''Alberta Pacific Grain Co. (twin)''''' 
[[File:Alberta Pacific Grain Co. &amp; Federal grain Co. elevator (TWIN) - Warner.jpg|thumb|left|210px|1918 Alberta Pacific elevator (right) and Federal Grain co., added 1968 (left).]]

This {{convert|45000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator was built in 1918 by Alberta Pacific Grain Co. It replaced a pre 1911 Alberta Pacific Elevator Co. It may have had an annex as it was licensed in 1918 for {{convert|60000|impbu|m3}} and for only {{convert|45000|impbu|m3}} in 1922. In 1953 a {{convert|23000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} annex was attached to the north side of the elevator. A second annex was added in 1959. In 1967 the elevator was taken over by Federal Grain Ltd. The next year Federal built a new elevator and twinned it with the 1918 elevator. The 1959 annex was then moved to the south side of the new elevator. A driveway was built the length of both elevators at this time. The 1953 annex was removed in 1997. In 1972 the complex was sold to Alberta Wheat Pool; in the summer of 1997 it served as AWP No. 4 house. 

'''''Federal Grain LTD. (twin)'''''

This {{convert|65000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator was built by Federal Grain Ltd. In 1968, and twinned with 1918 elevator Federal had taken over the previous year. It measures {{convert/3|38|Ã|44|Ã|66|ft|m}}. The elevator has no structural upgrading but it does have an electronic scale, and an exterior loading spout for trucks. This elevator was among the last built on the traditional design, before the single composite design came into widespread use. 

'''''Ogilvie Flour Mills (demolished)''''' 

This 35,000 elevator was built by Ogilvie Flour Mills in 1929. A {{convert|30000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} balloon annex was added in 1940, and a second one with {{convert|25000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} capacity in 1952. One of the annexes was removed in 1997. The driveway has been heightened, but despite this is still too low for larger trucks. An auger is used to dump the trucks into the pit. The driveway ramp is very steep. The elevator has a high degree of structural and mechanical integrity. The elevator has an attached office, that appears to be original to the site. A small scale is still in place along with a pneumatic dump. The metal cladding is typical of Ogilvie Flour Co. elevators. The ghost logo of the company is still visible on the walls of the elevator. The elevator was being used to load mustard in the summer of 1997. This elevator has been torn down. 

'''''Ellison Milling &amp; Flour Co. (demolished)''''' 

This {{convert|40000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator was built by Ellison Milling &amp; Flour Co. in 1939. The annexes were undoubtedly constructed during the war as temporary storage. In 1974 the elevator went to [[Parrish &amp; Heimbecker Ltd.|Parrish and Heimbecker]]. It was purchased by UGG in 1985. The positioning of the annexes, one trackside and the other parallel to the driveway is typical of the layout favoured for annexes during the war when two or more were used. 
The elevator has had little upgrading; the trackside loading area is intact apart from the installation of a hopper car loading spout. The P&amp;H ghost logo is visible on the east and west sides of the elevator. The elevator office is a larger rectangular wood frame structure with a [[gable roof]]. It appears to serve as an office and as a warehouse. The position of the office, trackside beside the elevator with the door facing the driveway ramp, is unusual for a complex built at this time. This elevator has been torn down.

==Other notable area grain elevators==
These are grain elevators within the [[Warner County No. 5, Alberta|County of Warner No. 5]] &amp; [[Cardston County, Alberta|County of Cardston]], that are of great significance.

'''''Alberta Pacific Elevator Co. Ltd.'''''
''([[Raley, Alberta|Raley]])''
[[Image:Grain Elevators 130.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1905 Alberta Pacific Elevator Co. Ltd. in Raley]]

The Alberta Pacific Elevator at Raley was built as a {{convert|35000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator and is likely the oldest standing elevator in Alberta&lt;ref&gt;[https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Details.aspx?DeptID=2&amp;ObjectID=HS+69645 Alberta Pacific Elevator Co. Ltd. - Raley] - Alberta Register of Historic Places - Alberta Heritage Survey Program&lt;/ref&gt; constructed shortly after the St. Mary Railway line (succeed by [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]) was constructed in 1900 from [[Stirling, Alberta|Stirling]] to [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] and finished in 1902. The elevator was built in 1905 by the Alberta Pacific Elevator Co. Ltd. A permanent cribbed annex was added to the elevator in 1940. In 1967 the elevator became part of the Federal Line of elevators. Then in 1972 the elevator was taken over by the [[Alberta Wheat Pool]] but was closed very shortly afterwards and taken over by the [[Hutterite]] [[colony]] at Raley. This elevator has high architectural significance as it is an excellent and the only unaltered example of an Alberta Pacific Elevator Co. {{convert|35000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} capacity elevator.

The Alberta Pacific elevator at Raley was the first of a number of elevators operating by 1911. It is the only one that has survived, probably because it is now in private hands. By 1911 there were two other elevators at Raley, one was a {{convert|30000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator built by A.G. Robertson and the other a {{convert|15000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator operated by Sunny Belt Grain Elevator Co. Ltd. This was upgraded to a {{convert|30000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} house in 1917. In 1924 the Raley Hutterite colony took over the A.G. Robertson elevator and in 1940 the Alberta Pacific Grain Co. took over the Sunny belt elevator, by this time owned by the N. Bawlf Grain Co. It was operated in conjunction with the original elevator. Both elevators went to the Alberta Wheat Pool in 1972. There was a fourth elevator at Raley, an Alberta Pool Elevator {{convert|40000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} house built in 1929. This elevator disappears from the records by the late 1930s. The Sunny belt and A.g. Robertson elevators were demolished sometime after 1972.

'''''Ellison Milling And Elevator Co.''''' 
''([[Stirling, Alberta|Stirling]])''

[[Image:Stirling 569.jpg|thumb|right|150px|1922 Ellison And Elevator Co., former [[Parrish &amp; Heimbecker Ltd.|P&amp;H]] elevator now used as a [[Hemp]] plant.]]
This {{convert|30000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} [[metal]]-[[Cladding (construction)|clad]] elevator was built by the Ellison And Elevator Co., in 1922. It was built at the [[railroad junction]] alongside the Ogilvie elevator built in 1910 by O.F. Ursenbach who was hired by George W. green, general manager. In 1941â1942 during the war years, a frame temporary annex was added to increase the handling to {{convert|60000|impbu|m3}}. In 1962 a bolted-steel tank was built to hold another {{convert|12000|impbu|m3}} of grain increasing the capacity to {{convert|72000|impbu|m3}}. [[Parrish &amp; Heimbecker Ltd.|Parrish &amp; Heimbecker]] bought the elevator in 1975.  Later it was sold to a private owner who converted the elevator into a [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] plant.  Today the elevator has once again been converted into a [[hemp]] plant, supplying hemp products around [[Southern Alberta]] and [[North America]]. 

'''''Ogilvie Flour Mills'''''
''([[Wrentham, Alberta|Wrentham]])''

[[Image:Grain elevator in Wrentham Alberta.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1925 Ogilvie Flour Mills Co. in Wrentham]]
This {{convert|32000|impbu|m3|adj=on}} elevator was built for Randell Gee &amp; Mitchell in 1915.  It was then sold to Midland Company Limited in 1919, and then to Ogilvie Flour Mills in 1921.  Ogilvie built the balloon annex on the east side of the elevator in  1951.  The elevator then closed in March 1959, and was sold to an local farmer (Wesley Kuehn) to use.

The elevator itself is still unchanged from its earlier years - the walkway that links the elevator to the office is one of two boxed walkways left in the province. The leg has a rope drive run by a four-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] [[gasoline engine]] under the floor of the office.
