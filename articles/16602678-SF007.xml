'''Ashampoo Burning Studio''' is an [[optical disc authoring software|optical disc authoring program]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed by [[Ashampoo]]. It is one of the most-used alternatives to [[Nero Burning ROM]] on Windows, but not as popular as the latter&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/windows/cd-burners/?tag=mncol%3Bsort&amp;sort=downloadCount+asc CNET Download.com Windows &quot;CD Burners&quot; Total Downloads]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Its main advantages are that it is simple, lightweight, and very easy to use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/CDRWIN-vs-Ashampoo-Burning-Studio-38925.shtml CDRWIN vs. Ashampoo Burning Studio - Burn or get burnt! - Softpedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, that is also one of its weaknesses: it does not contain many extras that power users might find useful.

It is capable of creating compilations of [[Compact disc|CDs]], [[Disk Image|Optical Disc Images]], [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s.

It also allows the creation of DVD movies from video files. 

As a way to promote their brand and software, Ashampoo has released Ashampoo Burning Studio 6 as free software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.download.com/Ashampoo-Burning-Studio-Free/3000-2646_4-10776287.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashampoo Burning Studio 2010 Advanced is a stripped down free version of Ashampoo Burning Studio 9.24 which is available through third party websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.v3.co.uk/p9387-ashampoo_burning_studio_2010_advanced]&lt;/ref&gt;
