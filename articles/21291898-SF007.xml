'''Windows 2.0''' is a 16-bit [[Microsoft Windows]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating environment]] that was released on December 9, 1987 &lt;ref&gt;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/history&lt;/ref&gt; and is the successor to [[Windows 1.0]]. With [[Windows 2.1x]] in 1988, Windows 2.0 was supplemented by [[Windows/286]] and [[Windows/386]]. Windows 2.0, Windows/286 and Windows/386 were superseded by [[Windows 3.0]] in May 1990, but supported by Microsoft for fourteen years until December 31, 2001.

==History==
===Application support===
The first Windows versions of [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Office Excel|Microsoft Excel]] ran on Windows 2.0. Third-party developer support for Windows increased substantially with this version (some shipped the Windows Runtime software with their applications, for customers who had not purchased the full version of Windows). However, most developers still maintained [[DOS]] versions of their applications, as Windows users were still a distinct minority of their market.

There were some applications that shipped with Windows 2.0. They are:
*[[Calculator (Windows)|CALC.EXE]]
*CALENDAR.EXE
*[[Cardfile|CARDFILE.EXE]]
*[[ClipBook Viewer|CLIPBRD.EXE]]
*CLOCK.EXE
*CONTROL.EXE
*CVTPAINT.EXE
*[[Windows_shell#Windows_1.0_and_2.0:_The_MS-DOS_Executive|MSDOS.EXE]]
*[[Notepad (Windows)|NOTEPAD.EXE]]
*[[Paint (software)|PAINT.EXE]]
*[[Program_Information_File|PIFEDIT.EXE]]
*[[Reversi (Windows)|REVERSI.EXE]]
*[[Spooling|SPOOLER.EXE]]
*[[Terminal_(telecommunication)|TERMINAL.EXE]]
*[[Windows Write|WRITE.EXE]]

===Legal conflict with Apple===
{{main|Apple v. Microsoft}}
On March 17, 1988, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.|filed a lawsuit against Microsoft]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]], accusing them of violating copyrights Apple held on the Macintosh System Software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1980 - 1989: An Industrial Milestone|url= http://www.theapplemuseum.com/index.php?id=56|publisher=The Apple Museum|accessdate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Apple claimed the &quot;[[look and feel]]&quot; of the [[Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]], taken as a whole, was protected by [[copyright]] and that Windows 2.0 violated this copyright by having the same icons.

==Features==
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}
Windows 2.0 allowed application windows to overlap each other unlike its predecessor [[Windows 1.0]], which could display only tiled windows. Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard-shortcuts and the terminology of &quot;Minimize&quot; and &quot;Maximize&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Iconize&quot; and &quot;Zoom&quot; in Windows 1.0.
