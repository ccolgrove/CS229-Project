The '''2001 [[South Carolina Gamecocks]] football team''' represented the [[University of South Carolina]] in the [[Southeastern Conference]].  The Gamecocks were led by [[Lou Holtz]] in his third season as USC head coach, and played their home games in [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in Columbia, SC.

Carolina followed up one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history in 2000 with another successful season in 2001. The season was also notable in that the USCâMississippi State game on September 20 was the first Division I-A game played following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/09/21/Sports/South.Carolina.Edges.Mississippi.State.1614-503874.shtml South Carolina edges Mississippi State, 16-14]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2002, the Gamecocks defeated [[2001 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in the [[2002 Outback Bowl]] in Tampa, Florida, and finished the season ranked #13 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls.
