&quot;'''Cinderella and The Little Glass Slipper'''&quot; ({{lang-fr|Cendrillon ou La petite Pantoufle de Verre}}, {{lang-de|Aschenputtel}}) is a [[folk tale]] embodying a [[myth]]-element of [[justice|unjust]] oppression/triumphant reward. Thousands of variants are known throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm|last=Zipes|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack Zipes|year=2001|publisher=W.

The word &quot;[[wikt:cinderella|cinderella]]&quot; has, by analogy, come to mean one whose attributes are unrecognised, or one who unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect. The still-popular story of &quot;Cinderella&quot; continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending plot elements, allusions, and [[trope (literature)|tropes]] to a wide variety of media.

==Early versions==
The Cinderella theme may well have originated in [[classical antiquity]]. The [[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]'' Book 17, 1.33) recorded in the 1st century BC the tale of the [[Greeks in Egypt|Greco-Egyptian]] girl [[Rhodopis]], &quot;rosy-cheeked&quot;, who lived in the [[colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] of [[Naucratis]] in [[Ancient Egypt]]. It is often considered the oldest known version of the story:

{{quote|They tell the fabulous story that, when she was bathing, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid and carried it to Memphis. While the king was administering justice in the open air, the eagle, when it arrived above his head, flung the sandal into his lap. The king, having been stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, sent men in all directions into the country in quest of the woman who wore the sandal. When she was found in the city of Naucratis, she was brought up to Memphis and became the wife of the king...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A3*.html#ref178|title=Strabo's account of Rhodopis|author=Strabo|date=23|work=The Geography|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldokkan.com/art/cinderella.htm &quot;The Egyptian Cinderella&quot;], an embellished retelling.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Herodotus]], some five centuries before [[Strabo]], supplied further information about Rhodopis in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', writing that Rhodopis came from [[Thrace]], and was the slave of Iadmon of [[Samos]], and a fellow-slave of [[Aesop]]. She was taken to Egypt in the time of [[Pharaoh]] [[Amasis II|Amasis]], and freed there for a large sum by Charaxus of [[Mytilene]], brother of [[Sappho]], the lyric poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fairytale in the ancient world|last= Anderson|first= Graham|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237024|page=27|url=http://books.google.com/id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world+rhodopis&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Fairytale%20in%20the%20ancient%20world%20rhodopis|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Histories|last=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?target=en&amp;inContent=true&amp;q=Rhodopis&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126|accessdate=25 March 2010}}, book 2, chapters 134 and 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story later reappears with [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] (ca. 175âca. 235),&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/aelian/varhist13.xhtml#b28 &quot;Various History&quot;, 13.33]&lt;/ref&gt; showing that the Cinderella theme remained popular throughout antiquity.

Another version of the story, ''[[Ye Xian]]'', appeared in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' by [[Tuan Ch'eng-Shih]] around 860. Here, the hardworking and lovely girl befriends a fish, the reincarnation of her mother, who was killed by her stepmother. Ye Xian saves the bones, which are magic, and they help her dress appropriately for a festival. When she loses her slipper after a fast exit, the king finds her slipper and falls in love with her (eventually rescuing her from her cruel stepmother). Another version of the story, which is similar to the Chinese version, exists in the Philippines. The story is known as &quot;Mariang Alimango&quot; (Mary the Crab). In this version, the spirit of her dead mother reincarnates as a crab, hence the title, and serves as her &quot;fairy godmother&quot;.

In the Vietnamese version [[Tam Cam|Táº¥m CÃ¡m]] there is part two of the story in which the protagonist Táº¥m later turned into antagonist by boiling her stepsister alive and then fool the stepmother to being cannibalism by eating her own daughter's flesh, which she told the stepmother that is just a jar of food.

Several different variants of the story appear in the medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', including &quot;The Second Shaykh's Story&quot;, &quot;The Eldest Lady's Tale&quot; and &quot;Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers&quot;, all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others, they are male. One of the tales, &quot;Judar and His Brethren&quot;, departs from the [[happy ending]]s of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a [[Tragedy|tragic]] ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1576072045|page=4|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of Cinderella may be derived from the story of [[Cordelia of Britain|Cordelia]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. Cordelia is the youngest and most virtuous of [[Leir of Britain|King Leir]] of [[Britons (historic)|Briton]]'s three daughters, however her virtue is such that it will not allow her to lie in flattering her father when he asks, so that he divides up the kingdom between the elder daughters and leaves Cordelia with nothing.  Cordelia marries her love, Aginippus, King of the [[Franks]], and flees to [[Gaul]] where she and her husband raise an army and depose her wicked sisters who have been misusing their father.  Cordelia is finally crowned Queen of the Britons.  However her reign only lasts five years.  The story is famously retold by [[King Lear|Shakespeare]], but given a tragic ending.

==Cenerentola, Cinderella and Aschenputtel==
[[File:DBP 1965 485 Wohlfahrt Aschenputtel.jpg|right|thumb|Aschenputtel at her mother's grave, with birds]]

In 1634, [[Giambattista Basile]], a Neapolitan soldier and government official, wrote ''Lo cunto de li cunti'' (The Story of Stories), or [[Pentamerone]]. It featured the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked step mother and step sisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a prince for the owner of the slipper.

==Plot (Cenerentola)==
A widowed prince has a daughter who is the subject of envy and anger towards his new wife, and the girl is ensnared by her governess in killing her stepmother and convincing her father to marry her. The governess succeeds, and then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (the Cinderella figure), and sending her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes into the island of Sardinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her, a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the King gives a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The King falls in-love with her, and on the third night, threads one of her overshoes. The King invites all of the maidens in the land to a feast with a shoe-test, identifies Zezolla after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.

One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written by [[Charles Perrault]] in 1697. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of glass slippers.&lt;ref&gt;An modern edition of the original French text by Perrault is found in Charles Perrault, ''Contes'', ed. Marc Soriano (Paris: Flammarion, 1989), pp. 274-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known version was recorded by the German brothers [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century. The tale is called ''&quot;Aschenputtel&quot;'' (''&quot;Cinderella&quot;'' in English translations) and the help comes not from a fairy-godmother but the wishing tree that grows on her mother's grave.

==Plot (Aschenputtel)==
A rich gentleman's wife lay dying, and calling her only daughter to her bedside, asked her to remain kind and generous, and God will protect her. She then died and was buried. After a transition of seasons (winter and spring) the widower married another woman, who had two daughters of her own; they were beautiful yet cruel and wicked. The stepsisters destroyed the girl's clothes, sent her into the kitchen to do the worst chores, and renamed her Cinderella. Despite all of this the girl remained good and pious, and would always go to her mother's grave to cry and pray to God to give better circumstances for herself.

One day, the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. One asks for beautiful dresses, while the other for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely asks for the first twig that will hit his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes into his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. Under it the girl would pray for thrice a day, and a white bird would always come to talk and grant her everything she would ask for.

The king decides to give a festival that will last for three whole days and nights, and invites all the beautiful maidens in the land to attend, because the prince is supposed to select from one of them a bride for himself. The two sisters were also invited, but when Cinderella begged them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother scoffed her off, because she had no dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insisted, the woman threw a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival, and when the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of two, white doves sent by God from Heaven, the stepmother only redoubled the task and threw down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Cinderella was able to accomplished it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hasted away with them to the ball and left the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard to ask for help. The white bird drops a silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the ball, with the precaution of leaving before midnight. The prince dances with her, but she eludes him before midnight strikes. The next evening, the girl appeared in a grander apparel. The prince fell in-love with her and danced her the whole evening, but when midnight came, she left again. The third evening, she appeared dressed with gold. Now the prince was determined to keep her, and had entire stairway smeared with pitch. Cinderella lost her track of time, and when she ran away to leave, one of her golden slippers stuck on that pitch. The prince proclaimed that he would marry the maiden whose foot would fit the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince went into Cinderella's house and tried the slipper on the eldest stepsister. The sister was advised by her mother to cut off her heel in order to fit the slipper, and while riding with the prince, the two doves from Heaven told the Prince that blood drips from her heel. Appalled at her treachery, he went back again and tried the slipper to the other stepsister. She cut off her toe in order to get in her foot in the slipper, and again the prince was fooled. While he was riding with her on the way to the king's castle, the doves alerted him again about the blood on her foot. He came back to inquire for another girl. The gentleman tells him that they kept a kitchen-maid in the house - yet did not mention that she was his own daughter - and the prince asked him to let her try the slipper. The girl appeared after washing herself, and when she had put on the slipper, the prince recognized her as the stranger he danced at the ball.

In the end during Cinderella's wedding, as she was walking down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, for they had hoped to worm their way into her favor, the doves from Heaven flew down and struck the two stepsister's eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. When the wedding came to an end, and Cinderella and her prince was marching out of the church, the doves flew again, stricking the remaining eyes of the two, evil sisters blind, the punishment they have to endure for the rest of their lives.

==Plot (taken from Perrault)==

[[File:Cinderella - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oliver Herford]] illustrated the fairy godmother inspired from the Perrault version]]
(See above for many variations)

Once upon a time, there was a widower who married a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She had two [[false hero|daughters]], who were equally vain. By his first wife, he'd had a beautiful young daughter, a girl of unparalleled goodness and sweet temper. The Stepmother and her daughters forced the first daughter into servitude, where she was made to work day and night in menial chores. After the girl's chores were done for the day, she would retire to the barren and cold room given to her, and would curl up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm.  She would often arise covered in cinders, giving rise to the mocking nickname &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and dares not tell her father, since his wife controls him entirely.

One day, the [[Prince Charming|Prince]] invites all the young ladies in the land to a [[ball (dance)|ball]], planning to choose a wife from amongst them. The two [[step family|Stepsisters]] gleefully planned their [[ball gown|wardrobes]] for the ball, and taunted Cinderella by telling her maids were not invited to the ball. 

As the sisters depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her [[Fairy Godmother]] magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a [[pumpkin]] into a golden carriage, [[mouse|mice]] into [[horse]]s, a [[rat]] into a [[coachman]], and [[lizard]]s into [[footman|footmen]]. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled [[ball gown|gown]], complete with a delicate pair of glass [[slipper]]s. The Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warned that she had to return before [[midnight]], when the [[magic (paranormal)|spells]] would be broken.

At the ball, the entire [[noble court|court]] is entranced by Cinderella, most especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Godmother. She then greets the stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier and talked of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.

Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Godmother's help. The Prince has become even more entranced, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the [[palace]] in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards watch only a simple country wench leave. The Prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belonged. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which did not disappear when the spell was broken.

The Prince tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the Prince arrives at Cinderella's villa, the [[False hero|stepsisters]] try in vain to win over the prince. Cinderella asks if she might try, while the stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. The stepsisters beg for [[forgiveness]], and Cinderella forgives them for their [[cruelty|cruelties]].

Cinderella [[marriage|marries]] the Prince, and the stepsisters also marry two [[lord]]s.

The first moral of the story is that [[beauty]] is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault06.html Perrault: Cinderella; or, The Little Glass Slipper]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at:
&quot;Another moral: Without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense. These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault06.html Perrault: Cinderella; or, The Little Glass Slipper]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Name==
The name Cinderella may have been derived from the circumstances of her work with her step-mothers family. Supposedly her name was &quot;Ella&quot;, but she was in charge of tending the fire, and while doing this, the cinders would often pop out and burn her. Thus she was meanly nicknamed Cinder-Ella.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

==Types==

===Theater===
====Pantomime====
Cinderella debuted as a [[pantomime]] on stage at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]], [[London]] in 1904 and at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London in 1905. [[Phyllis Dare]], aged 14 or 15, starred in the latter. In 1926, Cinderella was caught on [[film]] in the [[London Palladium]], starring [[Lennie Dean]] in the lead role.

In the traditional pantomime version the opening scene is set in a forest with a hunt in sway and it is here that Cinderella first meets Prince Charming and his &quot;right-hand man&quot; Dandini, whose name and character come from [[Gioachino Rossini]] opera (''[[La Cenerentola]]''). Cinderella mistakes Dandini for the Prince and the Prince for Dandini.

Her father, Baron Hardup, is under the thumb of his two stepdaughters, the [[Ugly sisters]], and has a servant named [[Buttons (pantomime)|Buttons]], who is Cinderella's friend. Throughout the pantomime, the Baron is continually harassed by the Broker's Men (often named after current politicians) for outstanding rent. The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball. However, she must return by midnight, as it is then that the spell ceases.

A version debuted in the USA at the El Portal Theatre, NoHo in 2010. It was produced by Lythgoe Family Productions of So You Think You Can Dance fame and MPI Entertainment.
