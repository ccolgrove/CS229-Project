''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' is a Canadian-American [[military science fiction]] television series created by [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] from its [[sister show]], ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. The series resumes the story of the &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot; and &quot;[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order]]&quot; episodes of ''SG-1'', where a military team led by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] (now Brigadier General) [[Jack O'Neill]], [[Physician|Dr.]] [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]], [[Major (United States)|Major]] (now Lt. Colonel) [[Samantha Carter]] and the [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] [[Teal'c]], use an ancient alien artifact called the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] to travel to different planets to explore and find new technology. The series pilot &quot;[[Rising (Stargate Atlantis)|Rising]]&quot; takes place in the year 2004 after the events of &quot;Lost City&quot; and &quot;New Order&quot;, when they finally find the lost city of the [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancients]].

''Stargate Atlantis'' premiered on July 16, 2004 on the channel [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. The Sci Fi Channel would air all the five seasons made for the series. Since the American broadcast splits each season to allow the production to catch up, the British and Canadian channels [[Sky One]] and [[The Movie Network]] aired the second part of some seasons before their American counterpart. ''Stargate Atlantis''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; finale episode premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on January 9, 2009. The series finale was also the series' 100th episode. All five seasons of ''Stargate Atlantis'' are available on [[DVD]].  A direct-to-DVD film tentatively titled ''Stargate: Extinction'' was planned, but has recently been [http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/04/wright-sgu-continuation-other-movies-dead-for-now/ permanently shelved].

The cast of the first season consisted of [[Joe Flanigan]] starring as Maj. [[John Sheppard (Stargate)|John Sheppard]], [[David Hewlett]] as Dr. [[Rodney McKay]], [[Rachel Luttrell]] as [[Teyla Emmagan]], [[Torri Higginson]] as [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Elizabeth Weir]] and [[Rainbow Sun Francks]] as First Lt. [[Aiden Ford]]. Aiden Ford was reduced to recurring character in [[Stargate Atlantis (season 2)|season two]] and was replaced by [[Jason Momoa]] as the extraterrestrial human [[Ronon Dex]] in episode three of season two. Francks continued to have a recurring role in season 2, until his character's death (although this was not confirmed). After Torri Higginson's departure as a main character from ''Stargate Atlantis'' after Season 3, she was replaced by [[Amanda Tapping]]'s Carter from the sister show. [[Paul McGillion]], [[Robert Picardo]] and [[Jewel Staite]] were also main characters. Gillion became a main character in season two until season three as [[Carson Beckett]], Picardo replaced Tapping's as a main character as the new leader of the Atlantis expedition as [[Richard Woolsey]] and Staite portrayed [[Jennifer Keller]] as a main character in season five.

==Television series==

===Season 1 (2004â2005) {{anchor|Season 1}}===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis (season 1)}}
The series picks up the story arc from ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'''s &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot;, where people from all around the world come together to form an expedition and discover the wonders of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]].

===Season 2 (2005â2006) {{anchor|Season 2}}===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis (season 2)}}
The story continues when the Daedalus arrives and renews the expedition's connection to [[Earth]]. This takes place alongside the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] story arc in SG-1, and the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] become an even larger threat in the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]]. But what they deal with in their second year might be more than they can handle, and Dr. [[Carson Beckett]]'s retrovirus is more in trouble than it's worth.

===Season 3 (2006â2007) {{anchor|Season 3}}===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis (season 3)}}
This season concentrates on more character driven stories. Along with new insight on the characters, the expedition discovers a new threat, one that could be the precursor to the Replicators. Some important characters leave the series in this season, and the fate of Atlantis once again is in the hands of the Humans From Earth or as called by several people on the show the &quot;atlanteans&quot; (because they came from the &quot;great ancient city, atlantis&quot;).
