'''Gzip''' is any of several [[software application]]s used for [[Data compression|file compression and decompression]]. The term usually refers to the [[GNU Project]]'s implementation, &quot;gzip&quot; standing for ''GNU zip''. It is based on the [[DEFLATE]] algorithm, which is a combination of [[LZ77|Lempel-Ziv]] (LZ77) and [[Huffman coding]]. The program was created by [[Jean-Loup Gailly]] and [[Mark Adler]] as a [[free software]] replacement for the &lt;tt&gt;[[compress]]&lt;/tt&gt; program used in early [[Unix]] systems, and intended for use by the Project. Version 0.1 was first publicly released on October 30, 1992, and version 1.0 followed in February 1993.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[OpenBSD]]'s version of gzip is actually the &lt;tt&gt;compress&lt;/tt&gt; program, to which support for the gzip format was added in OpenBSD 3.4. The &quot;g&quot; in this specific version stands for ''[[wikt:gratis|gratis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=gzip#HISTORY|title=OpenBSD gzip(1) manual page|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=OpenBSD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FreeBSD]], [[DragonFlyBSD]], and [[NetBSD]] use a BSD-licensed implementation instead of the GNU version; it is actually a [[command-line interface]] for [[zlib]] intended to be compatible with the GNU implementation's options.&lt;ref&gt;http://man.freebsd.org/gzip&lt;/ref&gt;  These implementations originally come from [[NetBSD]], and supports decompression of [[bzip2]] and Unix pack(1) format.

==Other uses==
The âContent-Encodingâ/&quot;Accept-Encoding&quot; and &quot;Transfer-Encoding&quot;/&quot;TE&quot; headers in [[HTTP]]/1.1 allow clients to optionally receive compressed HTTP responses and (less commonly) to send compressed requests. The specification for HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616) specifies three compression methods: âgzipâ (RFC 1952; the content wrapped in a gzip stream), âdeflateâ (RFC 1950; the content wrapped in a zlib-formatted stream), and &quot;compress&quot; (explained in RFC 2616 section 3.5 as 'The encoding format produced by the common UNIX file compression program &quot;compress&quot;. This format is an adaptive Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding (LZW).'). Many client libraries, browsers, and server platforms (including Apache and Microsoft IIS) support gzip.  Many agents also support deflate, although several important players incorrectly implement deflate support using the format specified by RFC 1951 instead of the correct format specified by RFC 1950 (which encapsulates RFC 1951). Notably, Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 report deflate support but do not actually accept RFC 1950 format, making actual use of deflate highly unusual. Many clients accept both RFC 1951 and RFC 1950-formatted data for the &quot;deflate&quot; compressed method, but a server has no way to detect whether a client will correctly handle RFC 1950 format.

Since the late 1990s, [[bzip2]], a file compression utility based on a block-sorting algorithm, has gained some popularity as a gzip replacement. It produces considerably smaller files (especially for source code and other structured text), but at the cost of memory and processing time (up to a factor of 4). bzip2-compressed archive files are conventionally named either &lt;tt&gt;.tar.bz2&lt;/tt&gt; or simply &lt;tt&gt;.tbz&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[AdvanceCOMP]] and [[7-Zip]] can produce gzip-compatible files, using an internal DEFLATE implementation with better compression ratios than gzip itselfâat the cost of more processor time compared to the reference implementation.

Gzip is based on the [[DEFLATE]] algorithm, which is a combination of [[LZ77 and LZ78|LZ77]] and [[Huffman coding]]. DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for [[LZW]] and other [[patent]]-encumbered [[data compression]] [[algorithm]]s, which, at the time, limited the usability of &lt;tt&gt;compress&lt;/tt&gt; and other popular archivers.

&quot;Gzip&quot; is often also used to refer to the gzip file format, which is:
* a 10-byte header, containing a [[magic number (programming)|magic number]], a version number and a time stamp
* optional extra headers, such as the original file name,
* a body, containing a DEFLATE-compressed [[Payload (computing)|payload]]
* an 8-byte footer, containing a [[CRC-32]] checksum and the length of the original uncompressed data

Although its file format also allows for multiple such streams to be [[Concatenation|concatenated]] (zipped files are simply decompressed concatenated as if they were originally one file), gzip is normally used to compress just single files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Can gzip compress several files into a single archive?| url=http://www.gzip.org/#faq16| accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compressed archives are typically created by assembling collections of files into a single [[tar (file format)|tar]] archive, and then compressing that archive with gzip.  The final &lt;tt&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;.tgz&lt;/tt&gt; file is usually called a &quot;[[tar (file format)|tarball]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=tarball, The Jargon File, version 4.4.7| url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/T/tarball.html| accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gzip is not to be confused with the [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] archive format, which also uses DEFLATE.  The ZIP format can hold collections of files without an external archiver, but is less compact than compressed [[tar (file format)|tarballs]] holding the same data, because it compresses files individually and cannot take advantage of redundancy between files ([[solid compression]]).

[[Zlib]] is an abstraction of the DEFLATE algorithm in library form which includes support both for the gzip file format and a lightweight stream format in its API. The zlib stream format, DEFLATE, and the gzip file format were standardized respectively as RFC 1950, RFC 1951, and RFC 1952.

The corresponding program for uncompressing gzipped files is '''gunzip'''. Both commands call the same binary; &lt;tt&gt;gunzip&lt;/tt&gt; has the same effect as &lt;tt&gt;gzip -d&lt;/tt&gt;.

==gunzip and zcat==
The &lt;tt&gt;gzip&lt;/tt&gt; utility on UNIX systems has some alternative names.

When gzip is invoked as &lt;tt&gt;gunzip&lt;/tt&gt;, it decompresses the data (a file or stdin).  &lt;tt&gt;gunzip&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;gzip -d&lt;/tt&gt;.

When gzip is invoked as &lt;tt&gt;zcat&lt;/tt&gt;, it also decompresses the data, but behaves similarly to &lt;tt&gt;[[cat (Unix)|cat]]&lt;/tt&gt;. It decompresses individual files and [[concatenate]]s them to standard output.
&lt;!-- Traditionally &lt;tt&gt;zcat&lt;/tt&gt; operated on files compressed by &lt;tt&gt;[[compress]]&lt;/tt&gt; but today it is usually able to operate on &lt;tt&gt;[[gzip]]&lt;/tt&gt; or even &lt;tt&gt;[[bzip2]]&lt;/tt&gt; archives. On such systems, it is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;gunzip&amp;nbsp;-c&lt;/tt&gt;.
 It is very doubtful that âusuallyâ able. Only on some systems, but not on others, hence I comment it out until a clarification.

&lt;tt&gt;zcat&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;gzip -d -c&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;ref name='man'&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zcat&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&amp;format=html] zcat manual page in FreeBSD 7.0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* To compress a file with gzip, pass the filename as an argument:

 gzip file.txt

The command will then replace the original file with a new, usually smaller file called ''file.txt.gz''.  To keep the original file ''file.txt'', it is necessary to use the ''-c'' option and redirect the output to a new file.

* To uncompress, use '''gunzip''':

 gunzip file.txt.gz

* Generally, multiple files can be compressed by combining [[tar (file format)|tar]] with gzip:

 tar czf files.tar.gz *.txt
