'''Gregory Kelley''' (1944 â February 15, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]] who competed in men's singles.  He won the junior title at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships]] in 1959 and finished ninth at the 1960 [[World Figure Skating Championships]] after the top three U.S. skaters skipped the event.  In 1961 he won the silver medal at the U.S. Nationals and the bronze at the [[North American Figure Skating Championships]].

Away from the ice, Kelley aspired to be a doctor, like his father.

Kelley was en route to the World Championships in 1961 when his plane ([[Sabena Flight 548]]) crashed near [[Brussels, Belgium]], killing all on board.  He was 16 at the time of his death.  His sister, Nathalie, was also killed in the crash.
