Later, wanting to avoid political troubles HergÃ© invented Khemed and it's port Khemkah), [[The Red Sea Sharks]]

==Australia==

* {{flag|Australia}}
** '''[[Sydney]]''': [[Flight 714]]

== Fictional settings in The Adventures of Tintin ==

* {{flagicon image|Flag of Syldavia.svg}} [[Syldavia]] in the [[Balkans]] is by HergÃ©'s own admission modelled on [[Albania]]&lt;ref&gt;Letter from HergÃ© to Charles Lesne, 12 June 1939, cit. Assouline, Pierre (1996) ''HergÃ©'', Folio (p218)&lt;/ref&gt;, and is threatened by neighbouring [[Borduria]] &amp;mdash; an attempted annexation appears in ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' &amp;mdash; this situation parallels respectively [[Czechoslovakia]] or [[Austria]] and expansionist [[Nazi Germany]] prior to [[World War II]]. It is later home to Sprodj Atomic Centre, which launches the first rocket to the moon.
* {{flagicon image|Flag of Borduria.svg}} [[Borduria]] is the historical rival of Syldavia, and attempts a [[fascist]] [[annexation]] similar to the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[Austria]] in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre''. Borduria is ruled by military dictator Marshal Kurvi-Tasch, who in addition to oppressing his own people, attempts to influence [[Third World]] conflicts by sending &quot;military advisors&quot; to countries such as San Theodoros.
* {{flagicon image|Flag of Khemed.svg}} [[Khemed]], in [[Arabia]]. Khemed is subject to a revolution in [[The Red Sea Sharks]] and in the Land of the Black Gold.
* The events of ''[[Flight 714]]'' take place on the island of Pulau-Pulau Bompa (&quot;pulau-pulau&quot; is Indonesian for &quot;islands&quot;).
* Sondonesia, a country in [[South East Asia]]. Said to be undergoing a civil war or a war for independence, with rebels for hire. [[Rastapopoulos]]'s hired gun, [[Allan Thompson|Allan]], recruits Sondonesians as gun-toting muscle in ''[[Flight 714]]''. They appear to be thinly disguised [[Khmer Rouge]] or [[East Timor]] fighters for independence. HergÃ©'s insistence that Sondonesia is in a state of civil war shows amazing clarity of vision of the true state of conflict in [[Cambodia]] during that period. The name Sondonesia is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Sunda Islands|Sunda]] and [[Indonesia]]. The inclusion of Jakarta's [[Kemayoran Airport|Kemajoran]] airport and the radio message from [[Makassar]] just before the plane is hijacked suggests that the location is not far from the Malay/Indonesian archipelago. Sondonesian conversations (the angry sailor on the boat, and the two bunker guards) in the album are spoken in Indonesian Malay. The Proboscis monkey which appears later in the album is exclusive to [[Borneo]].
* {{flagicon image|Flag of San Theodoros.svg}} [[San Theodoros]] in [[South America]], a prototypical [[banana republic]] where US-based companies and Borduria (meant as an allusion to the [[USSR]] or [[Cuba]]) vie for power, with &quot;advisors&quot; of local generals. The capital is Los Dopicos, which is later renamed Tapiocapolis.
* {{flagicon image|Flag of Sao Rico.svg}} [[SÃ£o Rico]] in South America. SÃ£o Rico was added as a reference in a later versions of ''[[The Shooting Star]]''. The original version had the villainous masterminds as stereotypical Jewish American puppet-masters â the later version darkens their skin tone and inserts Sao Rico as a reference.
* {{flagicon image|Flag of Nuevo Rico.svg}} [[Nuevo Rico]], bordering San Theodoros. The two countries go to [[war]] over [[Petroleum|oil]] in ''[[The Broken Ear]]'', which is parallel to the 1930s [[Chaco War]] between [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]]. The capital of Nuevo Rico is Sanfacion (a play on [[Asuncion]], indicating that it is modeled upon [[Paraguay]]).
* El Chapo, after the South American [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] region. ''The Broken Ear'' is set in a war inspired by the [[Chaco War]].
* Pilchardania and Poldavia are both mentioned in ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''. Pilchardania is mentioned on a [[newsreel]] that Tintin views while hiding in a cinema from the police. The Poldavian consul gets mistaken for Tintin in a beard and [[Wig (hair)|wig]] in the Blue Lotus [[opium den]].
* Gaipajama, an [[India]]n principality based on those that existed during the [[British Raj]], is mentioned in ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''.
