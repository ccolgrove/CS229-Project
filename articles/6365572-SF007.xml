'''Buildix''' is an [[operating system]] which can be used as a [[Live CD]]. It is an [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-based [[Linux distribution]], developed by Global IT professional services firm, [[ThoughtWorks]].

Buildix is aimed at helping [[Agile software development|agile]] developers to get their projects up and running quickly and easily.  The bundled software includes the key ingredients for an [[agile software development]] project including: [[CruiseControl]] (a [[continuous integration]] server), [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] (a [[revision control]] system),   [[Trac]] (a project-management tool) and [[Mingle]] (a commercial tool that aids agile management).

==Contents==
Buildix is intended to run as a server and so the package list is initially quite small.  There is no [[X window manager|window manager]] installed which means that buildix has very modest hardware requirements.
The most significant packages include:
*[[CruiseControl]]
*[[Subversion (software)|Subversion]]
*[[Trac]]
*[[Apache Ant]]
*[[Apache Tomcat]]
*[[Apache HTTP Server]]

==History==
Active development on Buildix has stopped, and will probably not resume &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.chris-read.net/2009/12/16/the-end-of-buildix/ The End of Buildix]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Last version, v2.1 released on 2008-05-02 &lt;ref&gt;[http://buildix.thoughtworks.com/index.php/download/ Last version of Buildix]&lt;/ref&gt;.
