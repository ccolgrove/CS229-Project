<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="3437368" ns="0" title="Ãengus of Moray"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Ãengus of Moray''' (''Oenghus mac inghine Lulaich, ri MorÃ©b'') was the last [[Mormaer of Moray|King of Moray]] of the native line, ruling [[Moray]] in what is now northeastern Scotland from some unknown date until his death in 1130.

Ãengus is known to have been the son of the daughter of [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Ulster'', ''s.a.'' 1130; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  This was perhaps how he attained the Kingship of the ''Men of Moray''. Ãengus' last known predecessor was [[MÃ¡el Snechtai of Moray|MÃ¡el Snechtai]] (d. 1085).  If Ãengus ruled during this whole period, then he would have been the one who incurred the wrath of King [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] when the Moravians (people of Moray) murdered Ladhmunn, his nephew and son of Domnall, the son of King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|MÃ¡el Coluim III Cenn MÃ³r]] by Ingibjorg. 

[[Orderic Vitalis]] wrote that in the year 1130, Ãengus with [[MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair]] invaded [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[Scotia]] with 5000 warriors. The Moravians were met by King [[David I of Scotland|David]]'s general, an old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] noble named [[Edward Siwardsson]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reported &quot;a great slaughter&quot; .&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' tells that 4000 Moravians were killed, and only 1000 [[Gaels]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources''., p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'' makes clear that what Orderic Vitalis wrote regarding the battle having taken place in [[Scotia]] indicates that it was an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Siward defeated the Moravians and Ãengus was killed. The Scoti then invaded Moray, which, as Orderic Vitalis put it, &quot;lacked a defender and lord.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 166-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Ãengus' defeat, Moray was probably granted to [[William fitz Duncan]].  After his death in 1147, it was to some extent colonized by King David's French, Flemish and English followers, although in the longer term, most of these became Gaelicized.
