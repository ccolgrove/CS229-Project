==Development model==
Habari is developed by the Habari community, in a meritocratic process inspired by the [[Apache Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy How the ASF works - The Apache Software Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Permission to commit code is handled liberally, with new contributors easily getting access to their own branches in the main source code repository. The decision-making process always involves the community, and in most cases decisions are made by community consensus. Some decisions, such as the decision that a new version should be released, are finalized by a vote amongst the Habari committers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Cabal Habari Project Wiki - Cabal page]&lt;/ref&gt; This ensures that different opinions are heard and discussion is not stifled.
