'''PartitionMagic''' was a [[computer program]] for [[hard disk drive partitioning]] originally made by the [[PowerQuest]] [[corporation]] but now owned by [[Symantec]]. As of December 8, 2009, the Symantec website stated that they no longer offer Partition Magic. The program runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s including  Windows 2000 and Windows XP, but is incompatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. The utility can also be run from a [[bootable]] [[CD-ROM]] and enables creation and modification of partitions. Existing partitions can be resized without loss of data.

==Details==
PartitionMagic is capable of resizing [[NTFS]] or [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] (16 or 32) partitions without data loss, and can copy and move partitions, including to other disks. It also has various other features, including being able to convert between FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS, modify the cluster size of FAT16/32 and NTFS filesystems, and merge adjacent FAT or NTFS filesystems (all without data loss, though some NTFS-only metadata is lost on conversion to FAT). Additionally, it had somewhat limited support for [[ext2]] and [[ext3]] partitions.

PartitionMagic releases 1&amp;ndash;3 were offered in DOS, OS/2 and Windows versions.  Symantec's PartitionMagic version 8 dropped the OS/2 version. A server version was also offered under the name ''Server Magic'' for Windows and [[Novell Netware]] servers.

==Future versions==
PartitionMagic, while under [[PowerQuest]], was updated regularly, adding new and useful features. Since Symantec purchased the application in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Symantec to Acquire PowerQuest | url=http://www.symantec.com/press/2003/n030923.html | publisher=Symantec  | date=23 September 2003| accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has not been a new release, and Symantec has stated that it has no plans on releasing a new version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.partition-magic-windows7.com/res/split-partition-windows-7.html |title=Ever Thought About Slicing Your Hard Drive? |first=Codrut |last=Nistor |publisher=Softpedia |date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 13, 2011, the Symantec website states, &quot;Sorry, we no longer offer Norton Partition Magic.&quot;

==Compatibility issues==
PartitionMagic is compatible with [[Windows NT]], [[Windows 95|95]]/[[Windows 98|98]], [[Windows ME|ME]], [[Windows 2000|2000]], and [[Windows XP|XP]] desktop editions. However, it is not compatible with [[Windows Server|server editions]] of Windows NT, 2000, nor [[Windows Server 2003|2003]] by design â a more expensive product from the same manufacturer, ServerMagic, would handle these - nor does it run on [[Windows Vista]] or [[Windows 7]]. It can however manage/modify [[Windows Vista]] or [[Windows 7]] partitions when started from a compatible operating system such as Windows XP.

PartitionMagic 2.0.5, VolumeManager 7 and VolumeManager 8 can not resize dynamic disks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Changing volume sizes on dynamic disks | url=http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/215314-46-changing-volume-sizes-dynamic-disks | publisher=Tom's Hardware | date=2005 | accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
