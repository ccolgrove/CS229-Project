==8888 uprising and 1996 arrest==
In the summer of 1988, a series of protests escalated in Yangon and other cities demanding the resignation of General [[Ne Win]], Burma's military ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7012158.stm |title=Burma's 1988 protests |author= |date=25 September 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These protests took their name from the date of the largest march, 8-8-88.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; Mie Mie, a 10th-grade high school student at the time, joined the uprising and became active in the [[All Burma Federation of Student Unions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RFA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfa.org/english/burma/burma_women-20071017.html |title=Burma Crackdown Goes on Amid Fears for Women in Custody |author= |date=17 November 2008 |work= |publisher=Radio Free Asia |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aappb.org/bio_pdf/Thin%20Thin%20Aye%20@%20Mie%20Mie.pdf |title=Mie Mie |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Assistance Association for Political Prisoners]] |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March 1989, she was arrested for the first time for distributing fliers commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of [[Phone Maw]], whose killing by security forces helped prompt the previous year's uprising. She was detained for three months, then released.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt; In 1990, she traveled to campaign on behalf of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD).&lt;ref name=&quot;RFA&quot; /&gt;

In 1996, Mie Mie was studying at [[Dagon University]] in Yangon when she took part in a protest and was subsequently arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt; She was then imprisoned for seven years in [[Tharyarwaddy Prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt;

==Saffron Revolution and third arrest==
Following her 2003 release, she became involved with the pro-democracy [[88 Generation Students Group]]. When rising fuel and commodity prices led to [[2007 Burmese anti-government protests|widespread unrest in Yangon]] in August 2007, the 8888 Generation Students Group played a major role in organizing protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7042885.stm |title=Key activists arrested in Burma |author= |date=13 October 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these rallies drew over one hundred thousand protesters, most notably a number of [[bhikku|Buddhist monks]], giving the uprising the popular nickname &quot;The Saffron Revolution&quot; for the color of their robes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2521951.ece |title=Military junta threatens monks in Burma |author=Jenny Booth and agencies |date=24 September 2007 |work= |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' described Mie Mie as &quot;prominent in photographs and videos of the first small demonstrations&quot;, noting that she appeared in the shots &quot;with her fist raised&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/world/asia/14myanmar.html |title=Myanmar Arrests 4 Top Dissidents, Human Rights Group Says |author=Seth Mydans |date=14 October 2007 |work= |publisher=''New York Times'' |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a government crackdown on protestors, members of the 88 Generation Students Group were swiftly arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;/&gt; On 22 August, the day after several 88 Generation leaders had been arrested, Mie Mie led a protest march and then went into hiding.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt; She was arrested herself on 13 October 2007 at a rubber plantation where she was hiding with fellow leaders [[Aung Thu]], [[Htay Kywe]], [[Zaw Htet Ko Ko]] and Hein Htet.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
Leading up to her trial, Mie Mie was detained with other activists at [[Insein Prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt; On 11 November 2008, she and other 88 Generation members were convicted of four counts of &quot;illegally using electronic media&quot; and one count of &quot;forming an illegal organization&quot;, for a total sentence of 65 years in prison apiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7721589.stm |title=Harsh sentences for Burma rebels |author=Jonathan Head |date=11 November 2008 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=17&amp;art_id=74234&amp;sid=21418178&amp;con_type=1 |title=Burma protesters each get 65 years |author= |date=12 November 2008 |work= |publisher=''Hong Kong Standard'' |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mie Mie reportedly shouted in response to the judge, &quot;We will never be frightened!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/node/84740/section/7 |title=Burma's Forgotten Prisoners |author= |date=19 September 2009 |work= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience and called on multiple occasions for her release.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AI2&quot; /&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] called for the 2007 protesters to be exonerated and freed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/en/content/burma-free-activists-sentenced-unfair-courts |title=Burma: Free Activists Sentenced by Unfair Courts |author= |date=11 November 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Front Line (NGO)|Front Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/1619 |title=Front Line condemns the harsh sentencing of Â´88 Generation members and other human rights defenders |author= |date=12 November 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mie Mie's health is said to be deteriorating as a result of her imprisonment.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions_details.asp?ActionID=572#action |title=Free The 88 Generation Students Group |author= |date=December 2009 |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, an NLD spokesperson alleged that prison authorities were refusing her proper treatment for her heart condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mizzima.com/component/content/article/4-inside-burma/94-88-student-leader-mie-mies-health-deteriorates-in-detention.html |title=88 Student Leader Mie Mie's Health Deteriorates In Detention |author=Maung Dee |date=6 February 2008 |work= |publisher=Mizzima News |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband stated that she also suffers from [[spondylosis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt;
