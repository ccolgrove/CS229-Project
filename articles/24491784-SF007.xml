Computer '''application streaming''' is a form of on-demand software distribution.

The basic concept of '''application streaming''' has its foundation in the way modern computer [[programming]] languages and operating systems produce and run application code. Only specific parts of a computer program need to be available at any instance for the end user to perform a particular function.  This means that a program need not be fully installed on a client computer, but parts of it can be delivered over the network as and when they are required.

Application streaming is usually combined with [[application virtualization]], so that applications are not installed in the traditional sense.

==Stream server==
An application is ''Packaged'' and stored on a streaming server.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSFB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Datamation&quot;/&gt; '''Packaging''' or '''sequencing''' produces an image of the application in a way that either orders delivery and/or predictively optimizes delivery to the client.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSFB&quot;/&gt;

==Launch &amp; Streaming of Application==
The initial launch of an application would be important for the end user and the Packaging process might be optimized to achieve this. Once launched, common functions would be followed. As these functions are requested by the end user, these may be Streamed in a similar manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSFB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Datamation&quot;/&gt; In this case the client is pulling the application from the stream server. Otherwise, the full application might be delivered from the server to the client in background. In this case, the server pushes the application to the client.

==Advantages==
*Given the complexity of modern applications, many functions are never or seldom used, and pulling the application on demand is more efficient in terms of server, client and network usage&lt;ref name=&quot;ZDNet&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/virtualization/application-streaming-and-why-your-organization-should-care/195|title=Application Streaming And Why Your Organization Should Care|date=2007-07-25|publisher=ZDNet.com|author=Dan Kusnetzky|accessdate=2010-9-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
