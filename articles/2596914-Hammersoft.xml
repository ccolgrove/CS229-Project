==History==
[[Image:WASV-logo.jpg|thumb|left|An old WASV logo.]]

The station launched on [[Halloween]] in 1984 as '''WASV-TV'''. It aired an analog signal on UHF channel 62 and was locally-owned. Even though it was licensed as a full-powered outlet, the station initially operated at [[low-power television|low-power]] simulcasting [[Christian]] programming from [[WGGS-TV]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]. WASV began to run [[infomercials]] and [[Shopping channel|shop-at-home]] programming in the early-1990s. It was sold in 1995 to [[Pappas Telecasting]] (a previous owner of rival [[WHNS]]) and began to transmit in analog at full-power in 1996. At that time, Pappas entered into a [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA) with WSPA which took control of WASV's programming and airtime. 

[[The WB Television Network|The WB]] moved from secondary status on WSPA to primary affiliation on WASV in October 1997. This station also became a secondary [[UPN]] affiliate. It identified on-air as &quot;The New 62&quot; from 1997 to 2002 and then &quot;Super 62&quot; from 2002 until early-2004. From 1998 to 2000, WASV aired sporting events pre-empted from [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] (that local affiliates WSPA and [[WYFF-TV]] pre-empted in favor of local programming, special reports, or yearly [[telethons]]). 

The WB affiliation moved to rival WBSC (now [[WMYA-TV]]) on September 6, 1999 and WASV became a full-time UPN station branded as &quot;UPN 62&quot;. WASV continued its local marketing agreement with WSPA even after the latter was sold to Media General in 2000. It was purchased outright by the company in 2001. From 1997 until 1998, WASV signed-off every night around midnight until 7 the next morning. Later in 1998, it began 24/7 broadcasting by running the [[Shop at Home Network]] in during overnight hours. In late-2005/early-2006, it discontinued Shop At Home and now run off-network sitcoms and court shows overnight during the week and off-network dramas/sitcoms as well as movies on weekend overnights. 

On January 24, 2006, The WB and UPN announced the two networks would end broadcasting and merge. The new combined service would be called The CW. The letters would represent the first initial of corporate parents &quot;C&quot;BS (the parent company of UPN) and the [[Warner Bros.|&quot;W&quot;arner Bros.]] unit of [[Time Warner]]. On February 22, [[News Corporation]] announced it would start up another new network called [[MyNetworkTV]]. This new service, which would be a sister network to [[Fox Network|Fox]], would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations]] and its syndication division [[Twentieth Television]]. MyNetworkTV was created in order to give UPN and WB stations, not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates, another option besides becoming [[Independent station|Independent]]. It was also created to compete against The CW. On March 2, 2006, it was announced WBSC (operated by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]) would become an affiliate of MyNetworkTV effective September 5. Nearly four weeks later on March 28, it was confirmed WASV would join The CW. 

Corresponding with the upcoming network change, this station officially changed its call letters to '''WYCW''' on April 22. However, it continued to use the WASV call sign on-air until UPN officially ceased operations on September 15. When The CW launched on September 18, the station branded itself as &quot;Carolinas CW&quot;. Despite the [[DTV Delay Act]] [[United States|national]] [[Digital television transition in the United States|transition]] extension to June 12, 2009, WYCW ceased regular analog programming on UHF channel 62 late in the evening on February 17. For two weeks after, it aired a &quot;[[Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act|nightlight]]&quot; service in the form of a continuously repeating short program about installing digital television converter boxes before finally shutting down its analog signal completely. Since March 1, 2009, WYCW has been carrying sister station WSPA on a second digital subchannel due to a collapse of the latter's broadcast tower on [[Hogback Mountain]]{{dn|date=November 2011}} southwest of [[Tryon, North Carolina]].

==Out-of-market cable coverage==
In [[South Carolina]], WYCW is available on Savannah Valley Cablevision in [[McCormick, South Carolina|McCormick]], which is part of the [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta, GA]] [[media market|DMA]]. WYCW is also available on [[Northland Communications]] in [[Saluda, South Carolina|Saluda]], which is part of the [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] DMA. The CW affiliate for that DMA, [[WZRB]], is not available.

==Newscasts==
[[File:Wycw news 2011.png|thumb|right|Nightly news open.]]

WSPA produces a nightly prime time newscast on WYCW known as ''NewsChannel 7 at 10 on Your CW''. The show airs for thirty minutes competing with an hour-long broadcast seen on WHNS and half-hour news offered on WMYA (produced by WLOS seen weeknights). There is also a two-hour extension of WSPA's weekday morning show seen on WYCW. Known as ''NewsChannel 7 Daybreak on Your CW'', this is seen from 7 until 9 and has competition with WHNS's newscast. On September 16, 2007, WSPA upgraded its newscasts to high definition as the first station in the market to do so. 

WYCW's newscasts were included in the upgrade which introduced a graphics package similar to Media General flagship [[WFLA-TV]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. In 2008, news anchor Amy Wood launched &quot;CW Live Chat&quot; during the weeknight prime time show. At the time, it was one of the nation's first interactive live broadcasts with an anchor hosting the chat live while simultaneously anchoring on-air. In addition to the main studios in Spartanburg, there is an Anderson Bureau on South Main Street/[[List of numbered highways in South Carolina|SC 28]]. Media General maintains a Columbia Bureau on Assembly Street/SC 48 covering the [[South Carolina State House|Capitol]] for its stations in and around South Carolina.
