&lt;/center&gt;
The clubs have large support bases around Baku, but also have supporters clubs in most towns throughout Azerbaijan. The relationship between the two clubs has always been known for its great animosity, as the classic opposes two geographic regions - with Neftchi and Khazar Lankaran representing the north and south of Azerbaijan, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extratime.az/article.php?aid=5522 Ð Ð°Ð¸Ð»Ñ ÐÐÐÐÐÐÐ: Â«Ð­ÑÐ¾ Ð³Ð»Ð°Ð²Ð½Ð¾Ðµ Ð´ÐµÑÐ±Ð¸ ÐÐ·ÐµÑÐ±Ð°Ð¹Ð´Ð¶Ð°Ð½Ð° Ð¸ ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð½ÐµÐ²Ð¾Ð·Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð²Ð½Ð¸ÑÑ Ñ Ð´ÑÑÐ³Ð¸Ð¼ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÐµÐ¼Â»] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pfl.az/content.php?lang=az&amp;page=14&amp;nid=110 50 saat qalmÄ±Å] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://deyerler.org/texts/news/idman/26641-adasjjlim-mircavadov-vneftgiv-vxjjzjjr.html AÄasÉlim Mircavadov :âNeftÃ§iâ - âXÉzÉr-LÉnkÉranâ matÃ§Ä± azarkeÅlÉrÉ xoÅ tÉsir baÄÄ±ÅladÄ±.&quot;] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Great Game Marathon ====
In 2011, the derby reached its ultimate peak as both clubs had to play each other 4 times during 33 days, after [[2010â11 Azerbaijan Cup|Azerbaijan Cup]] draws and Azerbaijan Premier League format changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ÐÐ°ÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð½ ÐÐ¾Ð»ÑÑÐ¾Ð¹ ÐÐ³ÑÑ: ÑÐµÑÑÑÐµ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÐ° Ð·Ð° 33 Ð´Ð½Ñ|url=http://www.azerisport.com/football/20110206122808801.html|publisher=Azerisport.com|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramin Musayev: &quot;Milli komandanÄ± nÉzÉrÉ almalÄ±yÄ±q&quot;|url=http://qol.az/new/?name=xeber&amp;news_id=18878|publisher=Qol.az|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khazar became triumphant over Neftchi, even though all other remaining games ended in draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ð¥Ð°Ð·Ð°Ñ ÑÐ¿Ð°ÑÑÑ Ð¾Ñ Ð¿Ð¾Ð·Ð¾ÑÐ° Ð½Ð° ÑÐ¾Ð´Ð½Ð¾Ð¼ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»Ðµ|url=http://azerifootball.com/ru/9/news/5163.html|publisher=Azerifootball.com|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unbeaten series of Khazar Lankaran ====

=== Supporters rivalry ===
[[File:Firtina face.jpg|thumb|right|Khazar Lankaran fans]]
The rivalry turned bitter after Neftchi won [[Azerbaijan Premier League]] title by beating Khazar Lankaran in play off match. Over time, the rivalry became more heated and club fans began attaining collective identities. Neftchi was seen as a capital club, while Khazar was viewed as regional club and supported by the south regions of Azerbaijani society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.football-plus.az/view_post.php?id=1116 Paytaxt tÉmsilÃ§ilÉrinin manevr ÅansÄ± qalÄ±bmÄ±?] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerisport.com/articles.php?item_id=20100217120539488&amp;sec_id=2 Ð¢ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð°Ð´ÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ðµ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð¾ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð¸Ðµ] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowd attendances for first 21 games, has exceeded 229,000 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Â«BÃ¶yÃ¼k oyunÂ»: DerbidÉ azarkeÅ sayÄ±|url=http://fanat.az/?mod=view&amp;id=32626|work=fanat.az|accessdate=8 September 2011|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the sensitive nature of the matches, [[Football hooliganism|fan violence]] has occurred several times. In minor cases fans break chairs or throw garbage at the field, but more notable cases of violence have involved physical fights between opposing teams and fans, storming of the field by fans, as well as significant destruction of public property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musavat.com/site/shownews.php?news_id=41611&amp;arxiv=yes Bu oyun zamanÄ± stadiona cÉmi 174 polis ÉmÉkdaÅÄ± nÉzarÉt edÉcÉk ] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both team supporters also keep on their rivalry in creativeness. Almost at the each game Khazar Lankaran and Neftchi fans demonstrate each other different banners with astute phrases. &lt;ref&gt;[http://fanat.az/index.php?mod=view&amp;id=26523 Â«BÃ¶yÃ¼k oyunÂ»: Â«Bu oyunu bÃ¶yÃ¼k edÉn bizikÂ» - FOTOLAR ] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
