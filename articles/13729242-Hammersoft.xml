The '''Thandikulam-Omanthai offensive''' was a battle for the control of the towns of [[Thandikulam]] and [[Omanthai]] in [[Sri Lanka]] in June 1997.

==Battle==

The battle began on June 10, 1997 when LTTE fighters attacked the garrison at Thandikulam. They destroyed the bridge on the edge of town so no reinforcements could arrive. While the fighting was raging an arms dump was hit by a rocket, causing a huge explosion that resulted in many casualties. Another dump was also hit shortly after and caused the same result. Helicopter gunships were sent to try and assist the besiedged soldiers, but one of them was badly damaged&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_336.shtml Indian-Subcontinent Database,Sri Lanka, since 1971,Sri Lanka, since 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;. Finally the city fell and the Tigers held it for two days taking anything they could.

13 days later the LTTE attacked the town of Omanthai. To get to Omanthai, they had to go through Periyamadu where 250 Sri Lankan soldiers were stationed. As the Tigers attacked, all of the soldiers were so surprised that they deserted their bunkers and left a gap over 1 km long in the camps perimeter. The Tigers took full advantage of the gap by swarming into Periyamadu and pushing their way deeper and deeper into SLA territory. Within minutes the Tigers had reached the main military base of Omanthai. They headed straight for the artillery cannons. In heavy hand-to-hand combat, the Tigers took the city, capturing six artillery pieces as well as several armoured vehicles.
