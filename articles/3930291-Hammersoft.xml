'''''Stargate Worlds''''' (abbreviated as '''''SGW''''')&lt;ref name=&quot;SGW&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/4/1167/ |title=Check out the SGW page at Gamespot |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) [[video game]] in-development by [[Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment]] (CME) in association with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) and published by FireSky for [[Microsoft Windows]]. The game's setting was mainly borrowed from [[military science fiction]] series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. The game was to focus on a premise set around an ancient device called the &quot;[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]&quot;. The estimated release date was never revealed before cancellation. In October of 2008, the game entered [[closed beta]] testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;beta_patch_notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=|authorlink=|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/4/1252/ |title=Closed Beta Sneak Peek |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=October 20, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, both CME and MGM announced the release of video game set in the Stargate universe. In 2008, FireSky announced its participation in the process of releasing ''Stargate Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_April_17/ai_n25333277/ |title=New Interactive Publishing House, FireSky, Building a Distinct Breed of Online Games |publisher=''Business Wire'' |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 25, 2010, FireSky announced on their website that CME/CMG had entered [[receivership]]. As a result production on the game has ceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Receivership Announcment&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=|authorlink=|url=http://www.firesky.com/pressrelease-2010-03-25.php |title=Press Release 25-March-2010 |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the License Agreement between Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment, Inc. and MGM Interactive, Inc. expired on November 16, 2010, and with ''[[Stargate: Resistance]]'' servers shutting down on January 15, 2011, it is being presumed that ''Stargate Worlds'' has been canceled.

The ''Stargate'' franchise has spawned other media including [[List of Stargate literature|books]], [[television series]], [[feature film|films]], and [[List of Stargate comics|comic books]]. These supplements to the film and series trilogies comprise another universe than the series and the film, and have resulted in significant development of the series' [[fictional universe]]. These media kept the franchise going in the interim between the film and series trilogies.

==Development==
[[Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment]] and [[MetroâGoldwynâMayer]] (MGM) announced in February 2006 that work had begun on a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sumner, Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/02/mgm_announces_stargate_mmorpg.shtml |title=MGM announces ''Stargate'' MMORPG |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=February 1, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; CME released several [[concept art]] images from ''Stargate Worlds'' in late 2006 along with announcing the use of [[Unreal engine#Unreal Engine 3.0|Unreal Engine 3.0]]. This was also the first public release on the ''Stargate Worlds'' computer-generated art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sumner, Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/09/first_look_at_istargate_worldsi_.shtml |title=First look at ''Stargate Worlds'' in-game art |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=September 13, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 2006 CME announced that ''Stargate Worlds'' had moved from [[pre-production]] to enter the [[video game producer|production]] phase of the games development. To celebrate this, they released new images for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/11/istargate_worldsi_enters_product.shtml |title=''Stargate Worlds'' enters production phase |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=November 11, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[showrunner]]s of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' have been closely connected to the ''Stargate Worlds'' project, co-creator [[Brad Wright]] serves as the games Creative Consultant.&lt;ref name=&quot;creacons&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Read, David |url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/4/1281/ |title=''Stargate Worlds'' Development Continues |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=April 7, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Chris Klug]]  in an interview said that creating a game out of the [[Stargate|''Stargate'' universe]] was easy because of the &quot;breadth of content.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dolgin, Livi |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/07/istargate_worldsi_mmorpg_wins_aw.shtml |title=''Stargate Worlds'' MMORPG wins award at E3 |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=July 5, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development progress for the game has slowed down drastically because of the [[Financial crisis of 2007â2010|financial crisis]] (2007â2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;creacons&quot;/&gt; FireSky has struck a deal with [[Convergys Corporation]] (CVG), which is a corporation leading in global relationship management. The company will provide the state-of-the-art customer support services for ''Stargate Worlds'', to give the gamers their &quot;best&quot; gaming experience &quot;ever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_Nov_6/ai_n30974287/ |title=FireSky Chooses Convergys to Drive Relationship Management and Improve Gaming Experience |publisher=''Business Wire'' |date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the moment, there seems to be much confusion about the release of ''Stargate Worlds''. In an interview with ''[[GateWorld]]'', Wright said he had &quot;doubts&quot; if the game would be released at all. Marketing manager from FireSky announced that the game is still in development, even if people say otherwise. He further stated that they were arranging deals to cover their &quot;financial responsibilities and fund the remainder of development,&quot; of the video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Onyett, Charles |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/971/971123p1.html |title=''Stargate Worlds'' Still in Development |publisher=''IGN'' |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registrations were accepted for a [[closed beta]] version, with participants to be drawn randomly from the pool of registrants.  Registration was limited to those aged 18 and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Read, David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2008/04/istargate_worldsi_commences_clos.shtml |title=''Stargate Worlds'' commences closed beta |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 12, 2010. The game has since been cancelled..&lt;ref name=&quot;stargateworlds forum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://forums.stargateworlds.com/showthread.php?t=35925 |title=Stargate Worlds Development Information. |publisher=''stargateworlds forum'' |date= |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
''Stargate Worlds'' was based on the popular science fiction show ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. Original plans were to run it in sync with the show, but the show was cancelled in 2006, though at least three direct-to-DVD films are being made (one being based on ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''), continuing the storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gateworld_Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Sumner, Darren |authorlink=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/istargate_sg-1i_cancelled_iatlan.shtml |title=Stargate SG-1 cancelled, Atlantis renewed |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=August 21, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was to take place in the earlier seasons of the show, before the Atlantis expedition and before the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] story arc.&lt;ref name=&quot;StargateWorlds_NewsArchive&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Balentine, Kevin |authorlink=|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/3/638/ |title=Balentine: 'Worlds is pre-Ori' |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At release, the game would have revolved around the Milky Way Galaxy during in the storyline of the ongoing conflict between the [[Tau'ri]] and the [[Goa'uld]]. Playable races were shown to include [[Mythology of Stargate|Tau'ri]], [[Goa'uld]], [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]], and the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]]. The combat was designed to incorporate some elements that are familiar to players of [[first person shooter]]s, with players using an array of ranged weaponry of both earth and alien origin. Combat emphasized tactics to defeat opponents both AI and human controlled. The AI was being designed to provide players with a significant challenge, to the praise of many critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;combatsys&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |authorlink=|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/stargateworlds/news.html?sid=6184182 |title=Stargate Worlds Q&amp;A - First Look Behind the Stargate |publisher=''GameSpot'' |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archetypes===
The [[Character class|archetypes]] in the game are designed to fit with the modern ranged-weapon combat system of the game. According to the developers there will be no specific healer class in the game, and all archetypes will have the ability to be a medic, although some archetypes will be better than others at healing and reviving.&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= |authorlink=|url=http://www.virginworlds.com/pg.php?n=5991 |title=VirginWorlds Podcast #60 - GDC Day Five (Part 2) |publisher=''Virgin Worlds'' |date=March 22, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialization within the different archetypes will lead to more flexibility within a group.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Ethec |authorlink=|url=http://www.tentonhammer.com/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=438 |title=The Archetype System in Stargate Worlds |publisher=''Ten Ton Hammer'' |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A robust tech tree will make each archetype that much more customizable and replayable.&lt;ref name=&quot;warcryfing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Miller, Jay &quot;AiuaX&quot; |authorlink=|url=http://www.warcry.com/news/view/63538 |title=Stargate Worlds Questions &amp; Answers #1 |publisher=''War Cry'' |date=May 22, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archetypes of ''Stargate Worlds'', will according to the developers be very &quot;flexible&quot; in their abilities and usage. Each archetype will have three specialization trees which will define a particular play style over time, although players will be able to mix and match skills from these.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Marce, Xaviar |authorlink=|url=http://www.mmoginfo.com/pc/Stargate_Worlds/QnA_51_1.html |title=Stargate Worlds Questions &amp; Answers #1 |publisher=''MMOG Info'' |date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; No end game [[Instance dungeon|instance]] will need a particular class to be successful, although the developers have yet to rule out a particular play style being necessary for certain instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/download/10/568/ |title=Developer Q&amp;A Podcast - Episode 2 |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=August 22, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the game un-released major development is still on work on the different archetypes, they will be a subject to change.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt; Both the scientist and the archaeologist will excel in non-combat gameplay with various types of puzzles to solve and gain access to new advances.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gamersinfonet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Ophelea | authorlink=|url=http://www.gamersinfo.net/articles/1295-preview---stargate-worlds |title=Interview â Preview - Stargate Worlds |publisher=''Gamers Info'' |date=October 18, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are likely to be quests specifically for those and other archetypes.&lt;ref name =&quot;TTH2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeff &quot;Ethec&quot;|authorlink=|url=http://www.tentonhammer.com/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=297 |title=A Stargate Worlds Interview with Joe Ybarra |publisher=''Ten Ton Hammer'' |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each archetype will have its own starting area. In addition to learning how to play the archetype, this starting zone will also give the player a backstory that comes from the [[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|first six seasons]] of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Genender, Laura|authorlink=|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm?LOADFEATURE=1560&amp;PAGE=1&amp;SETVIEW=features&amp;GAMEID=242&amp;bhcp=1 |title=Stargate Worlds - Dev Chat Log |publisher=''MMORPG'' |date=November 9, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Archaeologists''' ([[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] archetype) will specialize in ancient cultures and languages. They will be able to 'blend in with the locals' to gather intelligence or ambush the enemy. This 'blending in' uses Asgard holographic technology to assume the appearance of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt;  It is likely that the archaeologist will also be able to engage in diplomacy, something discussed by the developers previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;stargate_game&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Balentine, Kevin |url=http://www.stargate-game.com/mmo-news/cme-press-junket-transcript-feb-2006.html |title=Press Conference Call |publisher=''Stargate-Game'' |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists can also be quite adept in aggro management, perhaps by being superb negotiators or good at hiding, making them good solo characters, in addition to their ability to solve puzzles&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt; that are currently slated to be in the form of minigames. In addition to using their diplomatic abilities in PvE situations, they may also be able to use them to their advantage in PvP interactions, although how this will work is unknown.
*'''Asgard''' will be physically frail, but will be masters of technology and will have a strong science ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast interview&quot;/&gt; They depend on clone technology to survive and thrive. By calling upon different types of drones to attack, defend, heal, or analyze, the Asgard becomes a true jack-of-all-trades. When faced with dire circumstances, the Asgard can also bring in their mighty starships to devastate the enemy with orbital bombardments&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt; in the form of a special attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast interview&quot;/&gt;  By being able to fit into a number of different roles, it is likely the Asgard will choose their 'class' by specializing in a different type of drone technology. The Asgard will be a faction-specific class, thus there will not be any &quot;evil&quot; Asgard until the Atlantis Expansion is released.
*'''Goa'uld''' will gain much of their power from their servants. With the ability to command several different types of minions, the Goa'uld can become almost as versatile as the Asgard. These minions will include Jaffa and possibly human servants.&lt;ref&gt;An Audio Podcast: [http://www.stargateworlds.com/download/10/560/ Developer Q&amp;A Part 1] â June 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their minions, Goa'ulds also have access to poisons that can be used to cripple enemies. They can also specialize in Ashrak technologies, such as phase cloaking, becoming masters of stealthy attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt; As the evil counterparts to the Asgard, the Goa'uld may be able to call in their Ha'tak bombers to bombard the enemy as a special attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast interview&quot;/&gt; The Goa'uld character will be the symbiote, and players will, at times and at a &quot;cost&quot;, be able to choose to enter a new host. However player Goa'uld will not be able to take over other players' hosts.
*'''Jaffa''' ([[Teal'c]] archetype) in the game are much like the Jaffa in the [[Stargate SG-1|show]]. In addition to its devastating ranged attack, the Jaffa staff weapon can also be used in melee combat. Displaying  solidarity and teamwork, Jaffa can use their oaths to strengthen their allies, especially other Jaffa. With their physical strength, Jaffa are highly resistant to special attacks and can continue fighting even when injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] can be either of the SGU or Praxis factions as :
** Loyal Jaffa (Praxis)
** Free Jaffa (SGU)
*'''Scientist''' ([[Samantha Carter|Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Carter]] archetype) will be a combination of pure scientist and engineer.&lt;ref name =&quot;TTH2&quot; /&gt; Scientists can specialize in analyzing, repairing, and using technologies. They can also use new technologies to craft personal upgrades. Their battlefield utility comes from the ability to construct devices such as gun turrets, shields, and target inhibitors. They can also specialize in healing and resurrection technology. Like the archaeologist, the scientist can also solve puzzles, but of a technological nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt; These puzzles will be in the form of minigames.
*'''Soldiers''' ([[Jack O'Neill|Jonathan &quot;Jack&quot; O'Neill]] archetype) is valuable for protection when stepping through the stargate. With the ability to specialize in a variety of weapons, including grenades, automatic weapons, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers, their job is to unleash firepower on enemies. With additional training, they can also learn basic healing, how to use alien weaponry, and lead teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTH1&quot; /&gt;
*'''Commando''' class will be giving up access to the variety of weapons a soldier class uses, a commando class gains access to stealth, demolitions, and the sniper rifle. The commando can disrupt, confuse, and neutralize enemies. In addition to being able to stealth, commandos also have technology to detect stealthed enemies. The commando will be at least one of the archetypes able to deploy and detect traps.

==Release==
In February, 2006 the production team behind ''Stargate Worlds'' and [[Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment]] (CME) launched the official [[web forum]] for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sumner, Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/02/cheyenne_launches_istargate_worl.shtml |title=Cheyenne launches ''Stargate Worlds'' forum |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=February 10, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in March the same year they launched the official site for the [[video game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sumner, Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/03/istargate_worldsi_launches_offic.shtml |title=''Stargate Worlds'' launches official Web site |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007, ''Stargate Worlds'' along with [[MetroâGoldwynâMayer]] (MGM) created a [[Stargate|''Stargate'' franchise]] survey, the winners would win a signed ''Stargate Worlds'' poster by the entire production team behind the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Read, Dave |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/08/take_the_istargate_worldsi_surve.shtml |title=Take the ''Stargate Worlds'' survey! |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=August 10, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2008 the ''Stargate Worlds'' development team announced the creation of their own [[Youtube|Youtube channel]], entitled ''Inside Stargate Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/1/1201/ |title=Inside''StargateWorlds'' revealed|publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=September 20, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CME has posted on the ''Stargate Worlds'' website that the game was expected to be released at the last quarter of 2008, but latter changed its website to reflect a 2009 release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stargate_Worlds&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=|authorlink=|url=http://community.stargateworlds.com/news/4/700/ |title=News |publisher=''Stargate Worlds'' |date=January 2, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 4, 2008, a trailer for ''Stargate Worlds'' was released.  On the same day, a sweepstakes was announced, of which the winner will have his or her likeness included in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.gateworld.net/video/newsandfeatures/1199763655.shtml |title=Stargate Worlds trailer |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date= |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to regular content updates, the possibility of expansion packs has been discussed. Currently there is no information on how much the expansions will cost. The first expansion is planned as a ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' expansion pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm?setview=features&amp;loadFeature=1155&amp;gameID=242&amp;bhcp=1 |title=GDC Preview: Stargate Worlds |date=March 9, 2007 |work=MMORPG |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] and the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]] present much additional content, with all five seasons' worth aired by the time of the game's release. It is ideal for an expansion, and this is what the developers intend for this facet of Stargate at this stage. It is unknown if the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] will be playable characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ophelea |url=http://www.gamersinfo.net/index.php?art/id:1326 |title=Interview â Preview - Stargate Worlds |date=October 18, 2006 |work=GamersInfo |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pitts | first=Russ |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/69288-Joe-Ybarra-on-Stargate-Worlds-Part-One |title=Joe Ybarra on Stargate Worlds: Part One |date=March 5, 2007 |work=The Escapist Magazine |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Player-controlled ships will not be in the initial release. However, missions will almost certainly take players on board all manner of spacecraft, even during the massive space battles seen in the television series.&lt;ref name=&quot;firingsquad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Callaham, John |url=http://www.firingsquad.com/news/newsarticle.asp?searchid=12218 |title=Stargate Worlds Interview |publisher=''Firing Squad'' |date=September 13, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players will even be able to explore the entire interior of a Ha'tak class mothership.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Gameplay was shown during the movie [[WarGames: The Dead Code]]&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast interview&quot;/&gt;

Due to events beyond the control of the developers, the project has been put on Hold until funding can be found to complete the project.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
