'''R-Drive Image''' is a [[disk cloning]] utility providing disk image files creation for backup or duplication purposes developed by [http://www.r-tt.com/ R-Tools Technology Inc.].

==Backup process==
A disk image file contains the exact, byte-by-byte copy of a [[hard drive]], [[Disk partitioning|partition]] or logical disk and can be created with various compression levels on the fly without stopping the Windows operating system and therefore without interrupting the user's business. These drive image files can then be stored in a variety of places, including various removable media such as CD-R(W)/DVD, Iomega Zip or Jazz disks, etc.

R-Drive Image restores the images on the original disks, on any other partitions or even on a hard drive's free space on the fly. To restore system and other locked partitions R-Drive Image is switched to the pseudo-graphic mode directly from Windows or bootable version created by the utility is launched from CD disc or diskettes.

Using R-Drive Image, a user can completely and rapidly restore a system after heavy data loss caused by an [[operating system]] crash, virus attack or [[hardware]] failure. R-Drive Image can also be used for mass system deployment when a user needs to setup many identical computers. In other words, a user can manually setup one system only, create an image of the system, and then deploy it on all other computers, saving time and costs. If a user needs to restore only certain files from a disk image, he/she can connect that image as a virtual disk and copy those files directly from the disk image using [[Windows Explorer]] or any other file utility.

==File format==
R-Drive Image uses its own [[closed format|closed/undocumented file format]], with the .arc extension (unrelated to the [[ARC (file format)|data compression format also with the .arc extension]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.r-tt.com/downloads/Drive_Image_Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
