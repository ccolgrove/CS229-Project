'''Eddie Clarence Murray''' (born February 24, 1956), nicknamed '''&quot;Steady Eddie&quot;''', is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[first baseman]] and [[designated hitter]]. He was known as one of the most reliable and productive hitters of his era. Murray is regarded as one of the best [[switch hitter]]s ever to play the game. He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in {{mlby|2003}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eddie Murray Statistics|work=baseball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/murraed02.shtml|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Murray was the eighth child of twelve and still has 5 sisters and 4 brothers, and has often quipped that as a child, he did not have to go far for a pick-up baseball game. The games were quite fierce and his older brothers never let him win.&lt;ref name=HOF&gt;{{Cite web|title=2003 Hall of Fame Inductions|publisher=MLB.com|year=2003|url=
http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/events/hof/y2003/index.jsp|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried that competitive edge to each of his next levels of baseball. At his Hall of Fame induction, Murray thanked his little league coach, Clifford Prelow, for teaching him not just the game of baseball but also love for the game as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Excerpts from Eddie Murray's speech|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=July 27, 2003|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/baseball/bal-speech28,0,6674351.story|accessdate=2009-03-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prelow, an ex-Dodger minor leaguer, also worked his boys hard; making them run out every ground ball and threatening them with 100 yard wind sprints if they did not work. Prelow remembers that young Murray never earned that punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klingaman|first=Mike|title=From start, kid had clout|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=July 27, 2003|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/baseball/bal-sp.roots27jul27,0,7877195.story?page=2 |accessdate=2009-03-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Murray attended [[Locke High School]] in Los Angeles, California, where he batted .500 as a senior and was a teammate of [[Ozzie Smith]].

==Major League Baseball career==
===Baltimore Orioles===
Murray was selected by the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in the 3rd round of the 1973 amateur draft and had several successful seasons in the minor leagues. He debuted at the major league level on April 7, 1977 and played in 160 games for the Orioles in his first season. He won the [[American League]] [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]] award by batting .283, hitting 27 [[home run]]s and contributing 88 [[runs batted in|RBI]].

Murray did not suffer the [[sophomore jinx]], instead building on his successes. With the Orioles from 1977 until 1988, Murray averaged 28 home runs and 99 RBI and was a perennial candidate for the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP award]], twice finishing second in the voting.  His best season was 1983 with the Orioles when he hit .306/.393/.538 with 110 RBI and a career-high 33 home runs; though a spectacular season, he finished second in the MVP voting. The Orioles also appeared in the post-season twice, in 1979 and 1983, and won the [[World Series]] in 1983. Murray's close-knit friendship with fellow [[Oriole]] [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] was highly publicized in [[Baltimore]] at the time.

The first baseman electrified home-team fans with his remarkable clutch hitting. Chants of &quot;EDDIE-EDDIE&quot; often reached a deafening [[crescendo]] during climactic points in a game. As is true with other extraordinary batters, Murray's likelihood of getting a hit increased when runners were on second or third base and when he had fouled off several pitches during an at-bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eddie Murray stats|work=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=murraed02|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Murray was traded on December 4, 1988 to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for [[Juan Bell]], [[Brian Holton]] and [[Ken Howell]] and had three successful seasons with the Dodgers, knocking in 88, 95 and 96 runs.  In 1990, Murray led the Major Leagues in hitting, but failed to win the National League batting crown; that went to [[Willie McGee]], who already had enough plate appearances to qualify for it when he was traded from the [[National League]] [[Saint Louis Cardinals]] to the [[American League]] [[Oakland A's]].  McGee won the NL batting crown with a .335 average, but hit only .274 the rest of the season in Oakland, for a season average of .324, .006 lower than Murray's Major League leading .330 average.

===New York Mets===
Prior to the 1992 season, Murray signed a two-year deal with the [[New York Mets]]. Murray was one of several acquisitions the Mets made (including [[Bobby Bonilla]], [[Willie Randolph]], and [[Bret Saberhagen]]) to try to regain their winning ways. However, in Murray's two years with the team they finished with 90 and 103 losses, respectively.

Murray hit his 400th career home run with the Mets early in the 1992 season and finished with 16 for the season, while driving in 93 runs and hitting .265. Despite the team's struggles in 1993 Murray had another solid season, hitting 27 home runs to finish behind Bonilla for the team lead. Murray was one of three Mets to hit twenty or more home runs that year, with Bonilla hitting 34 and [[Jeff Kent]] hitting 20. Murray also led the team in RBIs with 100, having done so in 1992. This was the last time in his career that Murray hit the 100 RBI mark.

===Cleveland Indians===
Murray reached the 3,000-hit plateau as an Indian on June 30, 1995 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome with a single to right field off Minnesota Twins pitcher Mike Trombley. In the [[1995 World Series]] between the Cleveland Indians and the [[Atlanta Braves]], Murray won Game 3 with a single in the bottom of the eleventh inning off of [[Alejandro Pena]] to score [[Alvaro Espinoza]].  The hit made the series 2â1, in favor of Atlanta.

===1996â1997===
From 1996 to 1997, Murray played for several teams, including the [[Cleveland Indians]] (1994â96), the [[Baltimore Orioles]] (1996), the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] (1997) and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1997). Although he no longer possessed the presence at the plate he had had in the 1980s, he was a valued and still consistent contributor for these teams.  On September 6, 1996, he hit his 500th career home runâfittingly, the home run came as a member of the Orioles, and also came exactly one year to the day that Ripken had broken [[Lou Gehrig]]'s streak of 2,130 consecutive [[games played]]. He retired after the 1997 season with 504 home runs; as of 2011, [[Mickey Mantle]] is the only switch-hitter who has hit more home runs (536).

==Coaching career==
Murray served as the hitting coach for the Cleveland Indians from 2002 to 2005. He was with the Indians when inducted into the Hall of Fame.

On June 14, 2007, Murray was fired as hitting coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Ironically, the Dodgers had just come off a 3-game sweep of the New York Mets and had produced 31 hits and 18 runs. Former Dodger player [[Bill Mueller]] was named as interim replacement.

==Philanthropy==
In the late 1980s, Murray made a generous donation to the Baltimore City Parks and Recreation Department. This donation led to the establishment of the Carrie Murray Nature Center, named after Murray's late mother. 
In 2008, Murray released a charity wine called Eddie Murray 504 Cabernet, a nod to his 504 career home runs, with all of his proceeds donated to the Baltimore Community Foundation.

==Hall of Fame induction==
[[Image:4Eddies 1.jpg|left|thumb|4 of the 300 inner city kids who came for #33's induction]]
On Sunday, July 27, 2003, Murray, along with [[Gary Carter]], was inducted into major league baseball's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=HOF /&gt; More than 30,000 people heard Murray talk about how hard it was to get to the Hall of Fame.  He said that he was never about one person, but about the team.  He thanked the &quot;sea of black and orange&quot; in the crowd and then pointed to the kids furthest in the back; (more than 300 inner-city little leaguers had come from Baltimore's Northwood Baseball League) and told them that one day &quot;they would be here too&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Singer|first=Tom|title=Murray lets down the wall at Hall|work=MLB.com|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030727&amp;content_id=448357&amp;vkey=news_mlb_nd&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His speech closed with the crowd chanting &quot;Eddie, Eddie.&quot; In the parking lot out side the pavilion as the buses were leaving, Murray gave those Northwood kids 12 autographed bats, 24 autographed baseballs and 100 autographed Hall of Fame programs. He told the kids never to forget where they came from.
