'''Artesia''' is a [[city]] in southeast [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]].  Artesia was incorporated on May 29, 1959 and is one of Los Angeles County's [[Gateway Cities]]. The city has a 2010 census population of 16,522. Artesia is surrounded on the west, south, and east sides by [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]], with [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]] to the north. 

Artesia is the home of the East West Ice Palace, an ice rink which is co-owned by [[Michelle Kwan]]. It was also the childhood home (1914 until 1931) of former [[First Lady]] [[Pat Nixon]], though the house in which she grew up is now part of neighboring Cerritos. 

== History ==

The village of Artesia was established upon the completion of the [[ABC Unified School District|Artesia School District]] on May 3, 1875. It was named for the many flowing [[Artesian aquifer|Artesian wells]] in the area, which made the village ideal for farming and agriculture.

In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] farmers developed Artesia into one of the most important dairy districts in [[Southern California]]. After [[World War II]], as with many other cities in the region, Artesia was pressured by developers to build residential tracts. The city of Dairy Valley was incorporated in 1956, and later became the city of Cerritos. As the demand for housing continued, dairymen moved their operations further east into [[Chino, California|Chino]] and north into the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]]. Artesia finally incorporated on May 29, 1959.

In 1993, the Artesia Historical Society was formed, with the mission of preserving and protecting the archives and historic sites of the city. In 2002, the Historical Society salvaged and restored one of the last remaining Spanish styled homes in the city into a historical civic museum open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofartesia.us/history.html http://www.cityofartesia.us/history.html] ''cityofartesia.us''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Artesia Water Tower ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Artesiawatertower.jpg|left|thumb|Artesia's historic water tower]] --&gt;
One of the more familiar landmarks in the city is the Artesia Water Tower. Not much is known about its active past or when it was constructed. The City of Artesia is currently trying to have the tower declared as a Historical Landmark and is asking its citizens for historical information and photos of the tower.

The water tower can hold 50,000 gallons of water and was once owned by the Southern California Water Company before being sold to the City of Artesia in 1988. The tower was intended to be used only as a point of historical interest, and to provide a special identity to the community. Shortly after its purchase, the then green tower was quickly painted to its current color with the addition of the name Artesia painted on two sides.

It sits on top of an artesian well in 1911, however, no record of its construction can be found. Although it may have once been a smaller wooden tower, to qualify for historic designation in California, factual documentation must be presented.

The Artesia Water Tower was also featured in the motion picture, ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' in 1991 and was known in the film as the Springwood Water Tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofartesia.us/newsArticles/water_tower/water_tower.html http://www.cityofartesia.us/newsArticles/water_tower/water_tower.html] ''cityofartesia.us''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also featured in an episode of ''My Name is Earl'', in 2006.

=== Cultural Shopping District ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Pioneer boulevard.jpg|right|thumb| Artesia's unofficial ''Little India'', an area with a large number of the Indian-owned businesses.]] --&gt;

There are a large number of Indian-owned stores and restaurants along Pioneer Blvd. in Artesia. Despite this concentration of Indian-owned businesses, Asian Indians made up only 4.6% of the population of Artesia in the 2000 Census.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder.census.gov&quot;&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US0602896&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_DP1&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US0602896&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_DP1&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on] ''factfinder.census.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals have often been made to designate a portion of the city as &quot;[[Little India (location)|Little India]]&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3427/is_2_35/ai_n31914797/ | work=Social Justice | first=Michael | last=Liu | title=Changing neighborhood: ethnic enclaves and the struggle for social justice | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (along the lines of [[Little Saigon]] in nearby [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] and [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]]). Another proposal has been for a &quot;Little India&quot; sign at the Pioneer Blvd. exit off of the [[Artesia Freeway]]. Opposition, primarily from other ethnicities in the city, has so far stymied such plans.

According to the LA Times article, &quot;Artesia Thinks the World of Itself,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/26/local/me-littleindia26 http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/26/local/me-littleindia26] ''articles.latimes.com''&lt;/ref&gt; four of five City Council members were outraged at Assemblyman Rudy Bermudez' attempt to make the designation without consulting the local council. The council members won a bill requiring local approval of proposed freeway sign designations.  Then Mayor Larry Nelson said Indian Americans constituted less than 1% of the city's population and that East Asian markets outnumber Indian ones 3 to 1. Thus, the name is &quot;International and Cultural Shopping District.&quot;
