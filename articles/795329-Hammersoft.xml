'''Yushan''' ({{zh|c=çå±±|p=YÃ¹shÄn}}; literally â'''Jade Mountain'''â; it can also be referred to as '''Mount Yu''') in [[Taiwan]] is the highest [[mountain]] in [[East Asia]] and the [[List of islands by highest point|fourth highest mountain on an island]]. In the past, Yushan was known among English-speaking expats and missionaries as Mt. Morrison, thought to have been named in honor of the 19th century missionary [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]]. (More about this in the [[Yushan (mountain)#History|History]] section.) Today, the mountain is referred to as '''Yushan''' or  '''Jade Mountain'''.

In the winter, Yushan is often capped with thick [[snow]] which makes the entire peak shine like [[stainless]] [[jade]], hence its name.  On July 21, 2009. Yushan was elected one of 28 finalists in the [[New7Wonders of Nature]] voting campaign. It even had held the top position in the âMountains and Volcanosâ category on the list of first round voting of the 77 nominees ended on July 7, 2009.

Yushan and surrounding mountains belong to [[Yushan Range]], which is part of [[Yushan National Park]] in [[Taiwan]]. [[Yushan National Park]] is Taiwan's largest, highest and least accessible national park. It contains the largest tract of wilderness remaining in [[Taiwan]] and is also valued for its pristine forests and faunal diversity, including many endemic species.

The highest point of Yushan range, Yushan, is {{convert|3952|m|ft|0}} [[above sea level]].  Yushan was once in the ocean and raised to the current height because the [[Eurasian Plate]] slid under the neighboring [[Philippine Sea Plate]].

The ocean waters off Taiwan's east coast are deep; in fact, submarine slopes plunge down to the [[Pacific Ocean]] at a [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 1:10 and the ocean reaches a depth of more than {{convert|4000|m|ft|-2}} about {{convert|50|km|mi|-1}} from the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;central_geo_survey&quot;&gt;[http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_setting.jsp Central Geological Survey, MOEA.]&lt;/ref&gt;  From this perspective, Yushan is even more magnificent if you consider it rises {{convert|8000|m|ft|-2}} steeply from the nearby [[ocean floor]] in such a short distance â est {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}}.

==Geography and geology==
The [[island]] of [[Taiwan]] is situated at the intersection of two [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] â the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. Even as ârecentlyâ as the late [[Paleozoic]] (some 250 million years ago), the land here was still but a sedimentary seabed layered with silt and sand. As the two plates began pressing against each other, the land buckled, bent, and created the landscape â [[List of mountains in Taiwan|165 mountains]] higher than {{convert|3000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above sea level on a small island ([[List of islands by area|38th in the world]]).

Yushan is also notable in containing the highest point on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the ''only'' point on that circle of latitude where there is any evidence of [[Quaternary]] [[glaciation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2011/EGU2011-13852.pdf Late Pleistocene to Early Holocen Glacial Landforms of Yushan Area, Taiwan]&lt;/ref&gt;. As recently as seventeen thousand years ago, permanent [[glacier|ice caps]] existed throughout Taiwanâs highest mountains and extended owing to the wet climate down to {{convert|2800|m|ft|-1}}; whereas currently the nearest glaciers to the Tropic of Cancer are in [[Mexico]] on the [[IztaccÃ­huatl]] volcano.

==Hiking==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

With panoramic views, overlapping mountains, and deep, plunging valleys, [[Yushan National Park]] is well known for its scenery, sunrises, sunsets, geological features, and views of the clouds from above. '''Sea of clouds''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: é²æµ·, [[Pinyin]]: yÃºnhÇi) often fill the valleys.  Indisputably, Yushan itself is the focal point of the Park.

Yushan is one of the favorites among [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[mountain climbing|mountain climbers]]. International [[Peak bagging|peak baggers]] often combine a trip to Yushan along with trips to [[Gunung Kinabalu]] and [[Mount Fuji|Fuji]] to form an &quot;Asian Trilogy&quot; hiking experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian_trilogy&quot;&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150453/yushan.html Yushan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yushan has five main peaks with the Main Peak being the most popular:
* Yuhshan Main Peak (çå±±ä¸»å³°), {{convert|3952|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}
* Yuhshan Eastern Peak (çå±±æ±å³°), {{convert|3869|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} â {{convert|4.5|km|mi|1}} from ''Main Peak''
* Yuhshan Northern Peak (çå±±åå³°), {{convert|3858|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} â {{convert|3.5|km|mi|1}} from ''Wind Tunnel'' (é¢¨å£)
* Yuhshan Southern Peak (çå±±åå³°), {{convert|3844|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} â {{convert|3.1|km|mi|1}} from ''Paiyun Lodge'' (æé²å±±è)
* Yuhshan Western Peak (çå±±è¥¿å³°), {{convert|3467|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} â {{convert|4|km|mi|1}} from ''Paiyun Lodge'' (æé²å±±è)

East, west, north, and south peaks surround the main summit. The east peak rises to a height of {{convert|3869|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and is considered one of [[Taiwan's Ten Major Summits|Taiwan's ''Ten Major Summits'']] (åå³»). The south peak is a sharp pinnacle of black [[shale]]. The relatively accessible west side of Yushan is covered with thick forests. The north peak is part of a long, gently-rising ridge; this peak consists of two high points that resemble a camel's humps.  The North Peak is also home to Taiwan's highest permanently occupied building, the ''Yushan Weather Station'', where the occasional visitors are given a warm welcome.

==Flora&lt;ref name=foc&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=2 Flora of China]&lt;/ref&gt; and fauna==
[[Image:YushanCoupleTree1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|&quot;Husband and Wife Trees&quot;, or &quot;Fuci Trees&quot; (å¤«å¦»æ¨¹). These are two surviving [[Chamaecyparis formosensis]] trees from a 1963 [[forest fire]]]]
[[Taiwan]], with the [[tropic of Cancer]] across the center of the island, has a climate between [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]].  The average temperature is {{convert|22|C|F|0}}. Here low elevation areas support [[evergreen]] [[broadleaved]] [[forests]].  As elevation increases, evergreen broadleaved forests are gradually replaced by [[deciduous forests]] and [[coniferous forests]].  At mountain peaks with alpine conditions, only [[mosses]], [[liverworts]] and occasionally grasses can be found on the ground.

All of the above vegetation variations can be seen in the Yushan area from low foothills to high summits with an elevation difference of {{convert|3.6|km|mi|1}}.  Because this wide climatic and [[vegetation]] variations, this environment nurtures the richest and most diversified [[wildlife]] in Taiwan.   Preliminary investigations reveal that there are 130 species of [[birds]], 28 species of [[mammals]], 17 species of [[reptiles]], 12 species of [[amphibians]] and 186 species of [[butterflies]] in [[Yushan National Park]].  In fact, Yushan is nicknamed &quot;the ark&quot; by academics who see it as a repository of Taiwan's rare species. It is almost an encyclopedia of Taiwan's [[ecological systems]], a geological museum and an important [[habitat]] of one-third of Taiwan's [[endemism|endemic]] species, such as:
* [[Formosan Serow]] (å°ç£é·é¬å±±ç¾)
* [[Reeves's Muntjac]] (å°ç£å±±ç¾)
* [[Formosan Black Bear]] (å°ç£é»ç)
* [[Formosan Blue Magpie]] (å°ç£èéµ²)
* [[Formosan Rock Macaque]] (å°ç£ç¼ç´)
* [[Hemimyzon taitungensis]] (å°æ±éç¬å²©é°) and Varicorhinus tamusuiensis (Oshima) â Two unique fish species living in the [[Lekuleku River]] area.

==History==
Jade Mountain was first observed by westerners in 1857.  '''W. Morrison''', captain of the American freighter SS ''Alexander'', sighted this mountain while departing from Anping Harbor, in what is now [[Anping, Tainan|Anping]], [[Tainan City|Tainan]].  He recorded this sighting in his naval log, and the mountain gained the name '''Mount Morrison''' in western literature.

In 1900, after the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|annexation of Taiwan by the Japanese]], two Japanese anthropologists, [[Torii RyÅ«zÅ]] and [[Mori Ushinosuke]], became the first people to have been recorded ascending the mountain.  They gave the mountain the name ''Niitakayama'' ([[wikt:æ°|æ°]][[wikt:é«|é«]][[wikt:å±±|å±±]]) or ''Mount Niitaka'', literally the &quot;New High Mountain&quot;, because it was even higher than [[Mount Fuji]] in [[Japan]] (was [[Empire of Japan]]) by {{convert|176|m|ft|0}}.  In 1937, '''Niitakayama''' was designated part of the Niitaka (New Highest) [[Alishan|Arisan]] National Park ([[:ja:æ°é«é¿éå±±å½ç«å¬å|æ°é«é¿éå±±å½ç«å¬å]]).

Under its Japanese name, the mountain was used as the secret code to signal the carrier fleet of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] to begin its attack against [[Pearl Harbor Attack|Pearl Harbor]].  The code was ''Niitakayama Nobore'' (literally &quot;Climb the New High Mountain&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1966 a large bronze statue of [[Yu Youren]] was placed at the summit. The statue remained there until 1996 when it was cut down and thrown into a ravine by [[Taiwan independence]] activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yaojuichung.com/pdf/en/recovering_the_mainland_and_liberating_taiwan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Yushan has played an important role in a new focus on Taiwan's identity.  Because its iconic status, Yushan has been chosen to be the background of the newly issued NT $1,000 dollar bills on 20 July 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;new_taiwan_dollar_bill&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=27446&amp;ctNode=752&amp;mp=2 Bulletin Board of Central Bank of the Republic of China.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a newly found asteroid by [[Lulin Observatory]] of [[National Central University]] was named after Yushan on December 28, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;yushan_asteroid&quot;&gt;[http://english.ysnp.gov.tw/Publication.aspx?CurrentNodeID=44&amp;Level=1&amp;PublicID=654 Yushan Asteroid.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Based on the data shown on Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan,&lt;ref name=&quot;central_weather_bureau&quot;&gt;[http://www.cwb.gov.tw/eng/index.htm Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan]&lt;/ref&gt; the figure on the right shows the monthly mean precipitation (unit: mm) of Yushan from 1971 to 2000.

Average annual rainfall in the Yushan area is about 3,600&amp;nbsp;mm. It rains an average of 140 days per year, mostly between May and August. From May until the first part of June is [[East Asian rainy season|plum rain season]] or [[monsoon]] season.  Taiwan's [[typhoon]] season roughly falls between July and September.  The peak month is in August. Overall speaking, summers are wet and winters relatively dry in Yushan.

Yushan has an [[alpine climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification|KÃ¶ppen]] ''ET''). From September to April, the Yushan area is often covered with frost. However, due to strong wind, the frost level is not high, except in the valleys. At elevations above 2,000 meters, there is snow. At elevations of 3,000 meters or more, there are four consecutive months of snow accumulation. The first snow may appear in October and completely melts by May. Snow falls 24.3 days per year on average on Yushan, which is less than in the previous ten years. At lower elevations, snow may fall only 0.6 days per year. Snow mostly falls in January and February.
