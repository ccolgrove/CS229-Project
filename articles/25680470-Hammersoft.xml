'''Chris Ballingall''' (born May 17, 1932) is a former female [[catcher]] who played from {{by|1953}} through {{by|1954}} in the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]]. Listed at 5'6&quot;, 145&amp;nbsp;lb., she batted [[left-handed]] and threw [[right-handed]].

A native of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], Ballingall learned to play baseball while catching for her twin brother. She had originally been offered a contract at the age of 15 to play in the AAGPBL, but her father did not want her to play then. She had to wait six years before being signed in 1953. She entered the league with the [[Muskegon Belles]], and was traded to the [[Kalamazoo Lassies]] during the midseason. She also appeared in a few games at [[first base]] and [[outfield]].
 
In 1954, Ballingall posted a .242 [[batting average]] with 17 [[home run]]s and 40 [[runs batted in]] in 90 games. In the playoffs, she hit .444 with eight RBI and two home runs, including one [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], to help the Lassies clinch the AAGPBL last-ever championship title. She and her teammate [[Carol Habben]], who hit a total of 16 homers (one in postseason), were dubbed the ''Home Run Twins'' by terrorizing opponents with their bats all the way through the lineup. 

Ballingall is currently living in [[Mattawan, Michigan]].

==Facts==
*The AAGPBL, which drew as many as one million people during one season, was founded in 1943 by the [[Chicago Cubs]]' owner, [[Philip K. Wrigley]], to keep fan interest alive during [[World War II]]. The league folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] at  [[Cooperstown, New York]] since November 5, {{by|1988}} that honors those who were part of this unforgettable experience.

*In [[1992 in film|1992]], [[filmmaker]] [[Penny Marshall]] premiered her film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'', which was a [[fiction]]alized account of activities in the AAGPBL. Starring [[Geena Davis]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Lori Petty]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]], this film brought a rejuvenated interest to the women's baseball.
