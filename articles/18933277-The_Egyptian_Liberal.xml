'''{{audio|En-us-Bahrain.ogg|Bahrain|help=no}}''' ({{lang-ar|{{linktext|âØ§ÙØ¨Ø­Ø±ÙÙ}}}}, ''al-Baá¸¥rayn''), officially the '''Kingdom of Bahrain''' ({{lang-ar|{{linktext|ÙÙÙÙØ© Ø§ÙØ¨Ø­Ø±ÙÙ}}}}, ''{{audio|Ar-Mamlakat Al Bahrain.ogg|Mamlakat al-Baá¸¥rayn|help=no}}''), is a small island state near the western shores of the [[Persian Gulf]]. It is ruled by the [[Al Khalifa]] royal family.

Bahrain is an archipelago of 33 islands, the largest being [[Bahrain Island]], at {{convert|55|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|18|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide. [[Saudi Arabia]] lies to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the [[King Fahd Causeway]]. [[Qatar]] is to the southeast across the [[Gulf of Bahrain]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
In Arabic, ''bahrayn'' is the [[dual form]] of ''bahr'' (&quot;sea&quot;), so ''al-Bahrayn'' means &quot;the Two Seas&quot;. However, which two seas were originally intended remains in dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;/&gt; The term appears five times in the [[Qu'ran]], but does not refer to the modern island{{mdash}}originally known to the Arabs as &quot;Awal&quot;{{mdash}}but rather to the oases of [[al-Katif]] and [[Hadjar]] (modern [[al-Hasa]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam,'' Vol. I. &quot;Bahrayn&quot;, p. 941. E.J. Brill (Leiden), 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear when the term began to refer exclusively to the Awal islands, but it was probably after the 15th century.

Today, al-Hasa belongs to [[Saudi Arabia]] and Bahrain's &quot;two seas&quot; are instead generally taken to be the bay east and west of the island,&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian. ''[http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&amp;pg=PA45 Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features and Historic Sites]''. 2006. ISBN:978-0-7864-2248-7.&lt;/ref&gt; the seas north and south of the island,{{fact|date=September 2011}} or the salt and fresh water present above and below the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faroughy&quot;&gt;Faroughy, Abbas. ''The Bahrein Islands (750â1951): A Contribution to the Study of Power Politics in the Persian Gulf.'' Verry, Fisher &amp; Co. (New York), 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to wells, there are places in the sea north of Bahrain where fresh water bubbles up in the middle of the salt water, noted by visitors since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Michael. ''[http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=kWRfe7AdVaYC The Archaeology of the Arabian Gulf, c. 5000-323 BC]''. Routledge, 1994. ISBN: 0415032687.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate theory offered by al-Ahsa was that the two seas were the [[Great Green Ocean]] and a peaceful lake on the mainland;{{which|date=September 2011}} still another provided by [[Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari|al-Jawahari]] is that the more formal name ''Bahri'' (lit. &quot;belonging to the sea&quot;) would have been misunderstood and so was opted against.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faroughy&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Bahrain}}

===Pre-Islamic period===
[[File:Persia 600ad.jpg|thumb|Asia in 600 AD, showing the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire in Sassanid era]] before the [[Arab]] conquest.]]

Inhabited since ancient times, Bahrain occupies a strategic location in the Persian Gulf. It is the best natural port between the mouth of the [[Tigris River|Tigris]] and [[Euphrates River]]s and [[Oman]], a source of [[copper]] in ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchArab&quot;/&gt; Bahrain may have been associated with '''[[Dilmun]]''', an important [[Bronze age]] trade centre linking [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HOB&quot;&gt;[http://www.historyofnations.net/asia/bahrain.html History of Bahrain] History of Nations website&lt;/ref&gt; It has been ruled by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]],{{fact|date=September 2011}} [[Babylonia]]ns,{{fact|date=September 2011}} [[Persian people|Persians]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojtahed-Zadeh&quot;&gt;''Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography'' by Pirouz Mojtahed-Zadeh, page 119&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Arabs]], under whom the island became first [[Nestorianism|Christian]] and then [[Islam]]ic.

From the 6th to 3rd century BC, Bahrain was added to the [[Persian Empire]] by the [[Achaemenian]] dynasty. By about 250 BC, the [[Parthia]]ns brought the Persian Gulf under its control and extended its influence as far as [[Oman]]. During the classical era, the island was known as '''[[Tylos]]''' in Europe. In order to control trade routes, the Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogen6&quot;&gt;Bahrain By Federal Research Division, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century, [[Ardashir I]], the first ruler of the [[Sassanid dynasty]], marched on Oman and Bahrain, where he defeated [[Sanatruq II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_&quot;&gt;Robert G. Hoyland, ''Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam'', Routledge 2001, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Bahrain comprised the southern Sassanid province along with the Persian Gulf's [[Bahrain_(historical_region)|southern shore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamsheed&quot;&gt;''Conflict and Cooperation: Zoroastrian Subalterns and Muslim Elites in ...'' by Jamsheed K. Choksy, 1997, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sassanid Empire divided their southern province into the three districts of [[Haggar]] (now [[al-Hafuf province]] in Saudi Arabia), [[Batan Ardashir]] (now [[al-Qatif province]] in Saudi Arabia) and [[Mishmahig]] (which in [[Pahlavi language|Middle-Persian/Pahlavi]] means &quot;ewe-fish&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_&quot;&gt;Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a&lt;/ref&gt; Early Islamic sources describe the country as inhabited by members of the [[Abdul Qais]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasoulallah.net/v2/document.aspx?lang=en&amp;doc=2589]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamim]], and [[Banu Bakr|Bakr]] tribes who worshipped the idol [[Awal]], from which the Arabs named the island of Bahrain '''Awal''' for many centuries. However, Bahrayn was also a center of [[Nestorian Christianity]], including two of its bishoprics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_&quot;&gt;Curtis E. Larsen. ''Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society'' University of Chicago Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic conversion and Portuguese control===
Traditional Islamic accounts state that [[Al-Ê¿AlÄÊ¾ Al-Haá¸rami]] was sent as an envoy to the [[Bahrain (historical region)|Bahrain region]] by the prophet [[Muhammad]] in AD 628 and that [[Munzir ibn-Sawa al-Tamimi]], the local ruler, responded to his mission and converted the entire area.&lt;ref&gt;A letter purported to be from Muhammad to al-Tamimi is preserved at the [[Beit al-Qur'an Museum]] in [[Hoora]], Bahrain.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 899 AD, the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] Muslim sect seized Bahrain, seeking to create a utopian society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded [[tribute]] from the caliph in [[Baghdad]], and in 930 AD sacked [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], bringing the sacred [[Black Stone]] back to their base in [[Bahrain (historical region)|Ahsa]], in medieval Bahrain, for ransom. According to historian [[Al-Juwayni]], the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]] in Iraq, accompanied by a note saying &quot;By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back.&quot; The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html | title=Qarmatiyyah|publisher=St. Martin's College|work=Overview of World Religions|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glasse&quot;&gt;Cyril Glasse, ''New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 245.

Following a 976 AD defeat by the [[Abbasids]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Juan Cole, ''Sacred Space and Holy War'', IB Tauris, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the Quarmations were overthrown by the Arab [[Uyunids|Uyunid]] dynasty of [[al-Hasa]], who took over the entire Bahrain region in 1076.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G.R. &quot;UyÅ«nids&quot;.

Brill Online. 16 March 2008 [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-7786]&lt;/ref&gt; The Uyunids controlled Bahrain until 1235, when the archipelago was briefly occupied by the Iranian ruler of [[Fars Province|Fars]]. In 1253, the [[Bedouin]] [[Usfurids]] brought down the Uyunid dynasty, thereby gaining control over eastern [[Arabia]], including the islands of Bahrain.  In 1330, the archipelago became a tributary state of the rulers of [[Ormus|Hormuz]],&lt;ref&gt;Rentz, G. &quot;al- Baá¸¥rayn&quot;. ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th.

I. Cole, &quot;Rival Empires of Trade and Imami Shiism in Eastern Arabia, 1300â1800&quot;, ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 19, No. 2.

Until the late [[Middle Ages]], &quot;Bahrain&quot; referred to the larger [[Bahrain (historical region)|historical region of Bahrain]] that included Al-Ahsa, Al-Qatif (both now within the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia]]) and the Awal Islands (now the Bahrain Islands). The region stretched from [[Basra]] in Iraq to the [[Strait of Hormuz]] in Oman. This was IqlÄ«m al-Bahrayn's &quot;Bahrayn Province&quot;. The exact date at which the term &quot;Bahrain&quot; began to refer solely to the Awal archipelago is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Rentz, G. &quot;al- Baá¸¥rayn&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-15th century, the archipelago came under the rule of the [[Jabrids]], a Bedouin dynasty also based in Al-Ahsa that ruled most of eastern Arabia.

In 1521, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] allied with Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler [[Migrin ibn Zamil]], who was killed during the takeover. Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they depended mainly on [[Sunni]] Persian governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Rentz, &quot;al- Baá¸¥rayn&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] of the [[Safavid]] dynasty of [[Iran]], who declared [[Shia Islam]] the official religion of Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;Juan R.

===Rise of the Bani Utbah===
In 1783, [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]], ruler of Bahrain and Bushire, lost the islands of Bahrain following his defeat by the [[Bani Utbah]] tribe at the 1782 Battle of [[Zubarah]]. Bahrain was not new territory to the Bani Utbah; they had been a presence there since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of Kuwait'', B.J. Slot, p110&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, they started purchasing date palm gardens in Bahrain. A document belonging to Shaikh Salama Bin Saif Al Utbi, one of the shaikhs of the [[Al Bin Ali]] tribe (an offshoot of the Bani Utbah), states that Mariam Bint Ahmed Al Sindi, a Shia woman, sold a palm garden on the island of [[Sitra]] to Shaikh Salama Bin Saif Al Utbi in the year 1699â1111 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]], preceding the arrival of the Al-Khalifa to Bahrain by more than 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albdoo.info/imgcache2008/3af882fe7cb2511eb935435895e1a566.gif Ownership deeds] to a palm garden on the island of Sitra, Bahrain, belonging to Shaikh Salama Bin Saif Al Utbi, dated 1699â1111 Hijri,&lt;/ref&gt;

The Al Bin Ali were the dominant group controlling the town of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arabia's Frontiers p44&quot;&gt;''Arabia's Frontiers: The Story of Britain's Boundary Drawing in the Desert'', John C.

After the Bani Utbah gained control of Bahrain, the Al Bin Ali had a practically independent status there as a self-governing tribe.  They used a flag with four red and three white stripes, called the [[Al-Sulami flag]]&lt;ref&gt;''Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia'', Geographical, Volume 1, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; in Bahrain, Qatar, [[Kuwait]], and the Eastern province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was raised on their ships during wartime, in the pearl season and on special occasions such as weddings and during [[Eid ul-Fitr]] as well as in the &quot;Ardha of war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Picture of the Al Sulami Flag in the &quot;Ardha of War&quot; which was celebrated in  Eid Al Fitr in Muharraq 1956 which was attended by Shaikh Salman Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, ex Ruler of Bahrain, http://www.albdoo.info/imgcache2008/4ab9efef269d2d54873df27f7495a456.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; The Al Bin Ali were known for their courage, persistence, and abundant wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;R.B. Serjeant, R.L. Bidwell p67&quot;&gt;''Arabian Studies'' by R.B. Serjeant, R.L. Bidwell, p67&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, different Arab family clans and tribes, mostly from Qatar, moved to Bahrain to settle after the fall of the [[Zand Dynasty]] of [[Persia]].{{citation}} These families and tribes included the [[Al Khalifa]], Al-Ma'awdah, Al-Fadhil, Al-Mannai, Al-Noaimi, Al-Sulaiti, Al-Sadah, Al-Thawadi, and other families and tribes.

Most of these tribes settled in [[Muharraq]], the capital of Bahrain and center of power at that time since the Al Bin Ali lived there. The oldest and largest neighborhood in Muharraq city is called Al Bin Ali. Members of this tribe lived in this area for more than three centuries. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Al Khalifa ascendancy to Bahrain and their treaties with the British===
In 1797, fourteen years later after gaining the power of the Bani Utbah, the Al Khalifa family moved to Bahrain and settled in [[Jaww]], later moving to [[Riffa]]. They were originally from Kuwait having left in 1766. Al-Sabah family traditions relates that the ancestors of their tribe and those of the Al-Khalifa tribe came to Kuwait after their expulsion from [[Umm Qasr]] upon Khor Zubair by the Turks, an earlier base from which they preyed on the caravans of Basra and pirated ships in the [[Shatt Al Arab]] waterway.&lt;ref&gt;''Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia'', John Gordon Lorimer, Volume 1 Historical, Part 1, p1000, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, Bahrain was invaded by both the Omanis and the [[Saudis|Al Sauds]]. In 1802 it was governed by a twelve year old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan installed his son, Salim, as Governor in the [[Arad Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;James Onley, ''The Politics of Protection in the Persian Gulf: The Arab Rulers and the British Resident in the Nineteenth Century'', Exeter University, 2004 p44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, the Al Khalifa tribe regained power in Bahrain and entered a treaty relationship with [[Great Britain]], by then the dominant military power in the Persian Gulf. This treaty granted the Al Khalifa the title of Rulers (&quot;Al-Hakim&quot; in Arabic) of Bahrain.

After Egyptian ruler Mohammad Ali Pasha took the Arabian Peninsula from the [[Wahhabi]]s on behalf of the Ottoman Empire in 1830, Sheikh Abdul Al Khalifa declared allegiance to the Iranian Government to avoid the Egyptians taking control of Bahrain.

In 1860, the Government of Al Khalifa used the same tactic when the British tried to overpower Bahrain. Sheikh Mohammad bin Khalifa Al Khalifa wrote a letter to [[Nasseredin Shah]] of Iran declaring himself, his brother and all of members of Al Khalifa and the people of Bahrain Iranian subjects. In another letter to the Iranian Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammad demanded that the Government of Iran provide direct guidance and protection from British pressure.

Later on, under pressure from Colonel Sir [[Lewis Pelly]], Sheikh Mohammad requested military assistance from Iran, but the Government of Iran at that time had no ability to protect Bahrain from British aggression. As a result the Government of British India eventually overpowered Bahrain. Colonel Pelly signed an agreement with Sheikh Mohammad in May 1861 and later with his brother Sheikh Ali that placed Bahrain under British rule and protection.&lt;!---anecdotal - By the time British forces arrived in Bahrain, Sheikh Mohammad bin Khalifa had hoisted Iranian Flags all over Bahrainâs towers and forts.---&gt; In 1868, British representatives signed another agreement with the rulers of Al Khalifa{{clarification needed The Ruler of Bahrain?}} making Bahrain part of the British protectorate territories in the Persian Gulf. This treaty was similar to those entered into by the British Government with the other Persian Gulf principalities. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent. In return the British promised to protect Bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly the British promised to support the rule of the Al Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. Other agreements in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of Bahrain to the British. &lt;!---anecdotal - So Bahrain, which was practically separated from Iran in 1783 but would namely confirm her allegiance to Iran, was practically, namely and officially separated from Iran between the years of 1868 and 1892 for the last time.---&gt;

According to School of Oriental and African Studies ([[SOAS]]) academic, Nelida Fuccaro:

{{quote|From this perspective state building under the Al Khalifa shayks should not be considered exclusively as the result of Britain's informal empire in the Persian Gulf. In fact, it was a long process of strategic negotiation with different sections of the local population in order to establish a pre-eminence of their particularly artistic Sunni/Bedouin tradition of family rule.|Nelida Fuccaro, ''Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869â1937''&lt;ref&gt;Nelida Fuccaro, &quot;Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869â1937&quot;, in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Persian Gulf'' by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unrest amongst the people of Bahrain began when Britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then Ruler of Bahrain. Sheikh Issa was the first of the Al Khalifa to rule without Iranian relations. Sir [[Arnold Wilson]], Britain's representaive in the Persian Gulf and author of ''The Persian Gulf'', arrived in Bahrain from Mascat at this time. The uprising developed further with some protesters killed by British forces.

Peace and trade brought a new prosperity to Bahrain. With the country no longer dependent upon pearling, by the mid-19th century it became the pre-eminent trading centre in the Persian Gulf, overtaking rivals Basra, Kuwait, and finally, in the 1870s, Muscat.&lt;ref&gt;James Onley, ''The Politics of Protection in the Persian Gulf: The Arab Rulers and the British Resident in the Nineteenth Century'', Exeter University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Bahrain's socio-economic development began to diverge from the rest of the Persian Gulf undergoing transformation from a tribal trading centre to a modern state.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p72&lt;/ref&gt; This process was spurred by the arrival of large numbers of Persian, Huwala, and Indian merchant families who set up businesses on the island, making it the hub of a web of trade routes across the Persian Gulf, Persia and the Indian sub-continent. A contemporary account of [[Manama]] in 1862 found:

{{quote|Mixed with the indigenous population [of Manamah] are numerous strangers and settlers, some of whom have been established here for many generations back, attracted from other lands by the profits of either commerce or the pearl fishery, and still retaining more or less the physiognomy and garb of their native countries. Thus the gay-coloured dress of the southern Persian, the saffron-stained vest of Oman, the white robe of Nejed, and the striped gown of Bagdad, are often to be seen mingling with the light garments of Bahreyn, its blue and red turban, its white silk-fringed cloth worn Banian fashion round the waist, and its frock-like overall; while a small but unmistakable colony of [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indians]], merchants by profession, and mainly from Guzerat, Cutch, and their vicinity, keep up here all their peculiarities of costume and manner, and live among the motley crowd, âamong them, but not of themâ.|[[William Gifford Palgrave|WG Palgrave]], ''Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia (1862â3)''&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;James Olney, Chapter &quot;Transnational merchants in the nineteenth-century Gulf: the case of the Safar family&quot; in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' Ed Madawi Al-Rasheed, Routledge, p59&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Palgrave's description of Manama's coffee houses in the mid-19th century portrays them as cosmopolitan venues in contrast to what he describes as the âclosely knit and bigoted universe of central Arabiaâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;Nelida Fuccaro, &quot;Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869â1937&quot;, in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p39&lt;/ref&gt; Palgrave describes a people with an open â even urbane â outlook: &quot;Of religious controversy I have never heard one word. In short, instead of Zelators and fanatics, camel-drivers and Bedouins, we have at Bahrain [Manama] something like 'men of the world, who know the world like men' a great relief to the mind; certainly it was so to mine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;[[William Gifford Palgrave|WG Palgrave]], ''Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia (1862â3)'' quoted in Nelida Fuccaro, &quot;Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869â1937&quot;, in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p39&lt;/ref&gt;

The great trading families that emerged during this period have been compared to the [[Borgias]] and [[Medicis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;[[Jonathan Raban]], ''[[Arabia through the Looking Glass]]'', William Collins &amp; Sons, 1979, p56&lt;/ref&gt; and their great wealth â long before the oil wealth the region would later be renowned for â gave them extensive power, and among the most prominent were the Persian Al Safar family, who held the position of Native Agents of Britain in 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;Nelida Fuccaro, Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869â1937, in Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p47&lt;/ref&gt; The Al Safar enjoyed an 'exceptionally close'&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;James Olney, &quot;Transnational merchants in the nineteenth-century Gulf: the case of the Safar family&quot; in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' Ed Madawi Al-Rasheed, Routledge, p71-2&lt;/ref&gt; relationship with the Al Khalifa clan from 1869, although the Al-Khalifa never intermarried with them â it has been speculated that this was to limit the Al-Safars' influence on the ruling family or because the Al-Safars were Shia Muslims.

Bahrain's trade with India saw the cultural influence of the subcontinent grow dramatically, with styles of dress, cuisine, and education all showing a marked Indian influence. According to Exeter University's James Onley &quot;In these and countless other ways, eastern Arabia's ports and people were as much a part of the Indian Ocean world as they were a part of the Arab world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;James Olney, Chapter &quot;Transnational merchants in the nineteenth-century Gulf: the case of the Safar family&quot; in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' ed. Madawi Al-Rasheed, Routledge, p78&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, a group of Bahraini merchants demanded restrictions on the British influence in the country. The group's leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to India. In 1923, the British deposed Sheikh Issa bin Ali whom they accused of opposing Britain and set up a permanent representative in Bahrain. This coincided with renewal of Iran's claim over the ownership of Bahrain, a development that Sheikh Issa had been accused of welcoming. The preference shown by the people of Bahrain towards the renewal of Iran ownership's claim also caused concern for Britain. To remedy these problems, in 1926, Britain dispatched Sir [[Charles Belgrave]], one of her most experienced colonial officers, as an advisor to the Ruler of Bahrain. His harsh measures intensified the increasing aversion of people towards him and led to his eventual expulsion from Bahrain in 1957. Belgrave's colonial undertakings were not limited to violent deeds against Bahrainis but also included a series of initiatives that included removal of Iranian influence on Bahrain and the Persian Gulf. In 1937, Belgrave proposed changing the name of the Persian Gulf to the &quot;Gulf of Arabia&quot;, a move that did not take place.

In 1927, [[RezÄ ShÄh]] demanded the return of Bahrain in a letter to the Allied Nations Community.{{clarify|post-text=&quot;League of Nations?&quot;|date=March 2011}} Britain believed that weakened domination over Bahrain would cause her to lose control all over the Persian Gulf, and decided to bring uprisings amongst the people of Bahrain under control at any cost. To achieve this they encouraged conflicts between Shiite and Sunni Muslims in Bahrain{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}.

Bahrain underwent a period of major social reform between 1926 and 1957, under the ''de facto'' rule of Charles Belgrave, the British advisor to Shaikh [[Hamad ibn Isa Al-Khalifa (1872-1942)]]. The country's first modern school, the Al-Hiddaya Boys School, was established in 1919, whilst the Arab Persian Gulf's first girls' school opened in 1928. The American Mission Hospital, established by the [[Dutch Reform Church]], began work in 1903. Other reforms included the abolition of slavery. At the same time, the pearl diving industry developed at a rapid pace.

These reforms were often vigorously opposed by powerful groups within Bahrain including sections within the ruling family, tribal forces, the religious authorities and merchants. In order to counter conservatives, the British removed the Ruler, [[Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa]] in 1923 and replaced him with his son. Some Sunni tribes such as the [[Dawasir|al Dossari]] left Bahrain to mainland Arabia, whilst clerical opponents of social reforms were exiled to Saudi Arabia and Iran. The heads of some merchant and notable families were likewise exiled{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Britain's interest in Bahrain's development was motivated by concerns over the ambitions of the Saudi-Wahabi and the Iranians.

===Discovery of petroleum===

Relations with the United Kingdom became closer, as evidenced by the British [[Royal Navy]] moving its entire Middle Eastern command from [[Bushehr]] in Iran to Bahrain in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/bahrain.htm|title=Bahrain|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British influence continued to grow as the country developed, culminating with the appointment of [[Charles Belgrave]] as advisor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;[http://www.enhg.org/alain/resources/articles/belgrave.htm Belgrave of Bahrain: The Life of Charles Dalrymple Belgrave]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}, Emirates Natural History Group, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to establish a modern education system in Bahrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,864101,00.html The Uncontrollable Genie] ''Time'' magazine, 27 August 1956&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, increasing anti-British sentiment spread throughout the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain. The riots focused on the Jewish community, which included distinguished writers, singers, accountants, engineers and middle managers working for the oil company{{clarify|post-text=&quot;What oil company&quot;|date=March 2011}}, textile merchants with business all over the peninsula, and free professionals.

In 1948, following rising hostilities and looting,&lt;ref name=&quot;israelnationalnews.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/127201 The King of Bahrain Wants the Jews Back], Israel National News, 8/14/08&lt;/ref&gt; most members of Bahrain's Jewish community abandoned their properties and evacuated to [[Bombay]], later settling in [[Israel]] ([[Pardes Hanna-Karkur]]) and the United Kingdom. As of 2008, 37 Jews remained in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;israelnationalnews.com&quot;/&gt; The issue of compensation was never settled. In 1960, the United Kingdom put forward Bahrain's future for international arbitration and requested that the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] take on this responsibility.

===Drop of Iranian claim===

Iran's parliament passed a bill in November 1957 declaring Bahrain to be the 14th province of Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meed.com/countries/bahrain/bahrains-journey-from-kingdom-to-province/3090822.article|title=Bahrainâs journey from kingdom to province|publisher=[[MEED]]|date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two empty seats allocated for its representatives. This action caused numerous problems for Iran in its international relations, especially with some United Nations bodies, Britain, Saudi Arabia, and a number of Arab countries. It also provided a major opportunity for Iraqi extremists{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} to extend their anti-Iran campaign in the region.

At this time, Britain set out to change the demographics of Bahrain. The policy of âdeiranisationâ consisted of importing a large number of different Arabs and others from British colonies as labourers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blopm&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mojtahedzadeh|first=Piruz|title=Bahrain: the land of political movements|journal=Rahavard, a Persian Journal of Iranian Studies|volume=XI|issue=39|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Demonstrations in 1956 forced the Al Khalifa rulers to leave Manama (the capital) for the village of Refae Al Gharbi where only Sunni Arabs serving as their bodyguards were allowed to live.

&lt;!--- This is way out of date with the recent (2011) uprisings and arguably counter to [[WP:NPOV]] It is also not relevant to the country's history
Bahrain under Al Khalifa is considered to have a flexible and liberal Government compared to other Arab Governments in the Persian Gulf, especially in comparison to the Governments of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and to the dictatorship of Iraq{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The reason for this flexibility should be looked into the following two notions: Firstly, the Arabs of Al Khalifa (Bani Utub) found themselves from the beginning of their arrival among Iranians and could never do away with this notion of âUnwanted guestsâ, secondly the synthesis of population of Bahrain has been and is different the region Emirates{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}.
Whilst other emirates are historically tribal communities that have grown up around a dominating tribe, Bahrain has been an urban society since ancient times like the societies of Iran and Mesopotamia{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. For this reason the rulers of Bahrain have not been able to deprive all members of society of the right to take part in the affairs of the country{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}.
---&gt;
In 1965 Britain began dialogue with Iran to determine their borders in the Persian Gulf. Before long extensive differences over borders and territory came to light, including the dispute over the dominion of Bahrain. The two were not able to determine the maritime borders between the northern and southern countries of the Persian Gulf. At the same time King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] arrived in Iran on a visit which included the creation of [[Islamic Conference]] and the decision to determine the maritime borders of the two countries. In return, the Shah of Iran agreed to visit Saudi Arabia in 1967. A week before this visit, the Saudis received Sheikh [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa]], the that time Ruler of Bahrain as a head of state in the Saudi capital Riyadh. As a result the Shah's visit was cancelled, seriously damaging relations between the two countries. Following mediation by King [[Hassan II of Morocco]] the relationship was repaired.

Eventually Iran and Britain agreed to put the matter of Dominion of Bahrain to international judgment and requested the United Nations General Secretary take on this responsibility.

Iran pressed hard for a referendum in Bahrain in the face of strong opposition from both the British and the Bahraini leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blopm&quot; /&gt; Their opposition was based on Al Khalifa's view that such a move would negate 150 years of their clan's rule in the country. In the end, as an alternative to the referendum, Iran and Britain agreed to request the United Nations conduct an opinion poll in Bahrain that would determine the political future of the territory. In reply to letters from the British and Iranians, [[U Thant]], then Secretary General of the United Nations, declared that an opinion poll would take place on March 30, 1970. Vittorio Winspeare-Giucciardi, Manager of the United Nations office in Geneva was put in charge of the project. 
&lt;!--- irrelevant Guicciardi and his colleagues entered Bahrain and began the task of conducting the Plebiscite on 30 March 1970. This mission continued more than two weeks and during this period Guicciardi conducted meetings with the leaders of different groups and classes of people of Bahrain and finally surrounded---&gt; 
Report no. 9772 was submitted to the UN General Secretary and on May 11, 1970, the United Nations Security Council endorsed Winspeare's conclusion that an overwhelming majority of the people wished recognition of Bahrain's identity as a fully independent and sovereign state free to decide its own relations with other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cascon/cases/case_bah.html|title=Cascon Case BAH: Bahrain 1970|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Britain and Iran accepted the report and brought their dispute to a close.

&lt;!---
The report of was submitted to the Security Council of the United Nations and in the meeting of 11 May 1970 was discussed. Following the ratification of this report, the mentioned resolution of Security Council was conveyed to the Governments of Iran and Britain. The Government of Iran reported the result of the mission and the resolution of the United Nations to the two assemblies (The lower and upper houses of Parliaments). The report of The Government was ratified by Iranian National Assembly (Mjles-e Shoray-e Melli) in 14 May, and by Iranian Senate (Majles-e Sena) on 18 May.

The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the 1970s [[Lebanese Civil War]], when Bahrain replaced [[Beirut]] as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven out of the country by the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=9be313d4-b349-40e2-a5f0-05fe3ee3a17a Bahrain Profile] ''[[National Post]]'' 7 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] in [[Iran]], in 1981 Bahraini ShÄ«'a fundamentalists orchestrated a [[1981 failed coup in Bahrain|failed coup]] attempt under the auspices of a front organization, the [[Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain]].

Bahrain is a [[Constitutional monarchy]] headed by the King, [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah|Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]; the head of government is the Prime Minister, [[Shaikh]] [[Khalifah bin Salman Al Khalifa|KhalÄ«fa bin Salman al Khalifa]]. Bahrain has a bicameral National Assembly (''al-Jamiyh al-Watani'') consisting of the Shura Council (''Majlis Al-Shura'') with 40 seats and the Council of Representatives (''Majlis Al-Nuwab'') with 40 seats. The 40 members of the Shura are appointed by the king. In the Council of Representatives, 40 members are elected by absolute majority vote in single-member constituencies to serve 4-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electionguide.org/country.php?ID=18|title=Bahrain|date=July 26, 2010|publisher=[[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]]|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts of democratization in the Middle East cite the Islamists' references to respect for human rights in their justification for these programmes as evidence that these groups can serve as a progressive force in the region{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Islamist parties have been particularly critical of the government's readiness to sign international treaties such as the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cpr.html The International Convention on Civil and Political Rights] Human Rights Web&lt;/ref&gt; At a parliamentary session in June 2006 to discuss ratification of the Convention, Sheikh [[Adel Mouwda]], the former leader of [[salafist]] party, [[Asalah]], explained the party's objections: &quot;''The convention has been tailored by our enemies, God kill them all, to serve their needs and protect their interests rather than ours.

===Women's rights===
{{main|Women's political rights in Bahrain}}
Women's political rights in Bahrain saw an important step forward when women were granted the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in the 2002 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahraintourism.com/default.asp?action=article&amp;id=277]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no women were elected to office in that year's polls. Instead, ShÄ«'a and SunnÄ« Islamists dominated the election, collectively winning a majority of seats{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. In response to the failure of women candidates, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes representatives of the Kingdom's indigenous Jewish and Christian communities{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Dr. [[Nada Haffadh]] became the country's first female cabinet minister on her appointment as Minister of Health in 2004. The quasi-governmental women's group, the [[Supreme Council for Women]], trained female candidates to take part in the 2006 general election.

According to one academic paper, &quot;In fact, it seems that few decisions can be arrived at in [[Al Wefaq]] â and in the whole country, for that matter â without prior consultation with [[Isa Qassim]], ranging from questions with regard to the planned codification of the personal status law to participation in elections&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iue.it/RSCAS/WP-Texts/06_27.pdf Voices in Parliament, Debates in Majalis, Banners on the Street: Avenues of Political Participation in Bahrain], Katja Niethammar, Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, [[European University Institute]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Al Wefaq-backed parliamentary investigations were credited with forcing the government to remove ministers who had frequently clashed with MPs: the Minister of Health, Dr. Nada Haffadh and the Minister of Information, Dr Mohammed Abdul Gaffar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10156074.html Bahrain ministries' probe to continue] ''Gulf News'', 25 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;1990s Uprising in Bahrain&quot; or &quot;1990s Intifada&quot; was a rebellion in Bahrain between 1994 and 2000 in which leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces.

During the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2011, protestors began pouring into the Pearl Roundabout area. The protesters selected 14 February as a day of protest to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the National Action Charter.&lt;ref name=&quot;bchr_gov_panic&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =Bahrain Center for Human Rights| coauthors =| title=In Fear of Transmitting the Tunisian and Egyptian Demonstrations to Bahrain: Blocking a Facebook Group that Calls People to go Down the Streets and Demonstrate against the Authority's Policy| work =| publisher =[[Bahrain Center for Human Rights]] | date =2011-02-06| url =http://bahrainrights.org/en/node/3721 |format =| doi =| accessdate =2011-02-09 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wNUbTPmx |archivedate=2011-02-09  |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 February five people were killed when police raided the [[Pearl Roundabout]] protests early in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/feb/17/bahrain-crisis-middle-east-protests-live-blog|title=The Day the Earth Stood Still|publisher=Guardian | location=London|first1=Haroon|last1=Siddique|first2=Paul|last2=Owen|first3=Adam|last3=Gabbatt|date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahrain troops retreated within a week's time. They allowed the protestors to continue a festival type event at the Pearl Roundabout where different groups came and shared their views. The [[Crown Prince|Salman Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa]] promised a dialogue during this period.  Within this time, [[Robert Gates]], Defense Secretary of the United States, visited Bahrain to discuss the situation along with a visit to the [[UAE]] on an arms deal. Historically, the 2nd line of defense against a Shia uprising has been to call the Saudi National Guard ever since the British army left in 1971.  Due to the media attention on the protests, the idea to use the [[Saudi Arabian]] troops along with other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] member states under the operating name of the [[Peninsula Shield]] was a plan. It was decided that if the protests could be moved to a financial district, based on the guidelines of the formation of this military body, it would be able to move legally into the country, even though it was the first time it was used internally against GCC citizens.  Kuwait declined taking part on this ground operation based on this &quot;misuse&quot; of the organization, though it sent naval help later on.

Within a few days, the protestors were lured into the Financial Harbour, an area filled with exchanges and banks. On March 15, the government began a retaliatory &quot;crackdown&quot;, a term used mainly by the Bahraini government.  
On March 14, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates entered Bahrain with the stated purpose of protecting essential facilities including oil and gas installations and financial institutions. The maneuver was carried out under the aegis of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawley, Caroline. &quot;Gulf states send forces to Bahrain following protests.&quot; BBC News. 3/14/2011.

The Saudi forces began using &quot;night raids&quot; as has been done in the Eastern Provinces for generations.  Most of the protestors are from the Shia Islamic sect who make up the majority of Bahrainis but are disproportionately represented by the Sunni royal led government.

On June 23, 2011, Hasan Mushaima, Abdulhadi Khawaja, and several other opposition activists were sentenced to life in prison by a military court.

Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990â91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to a number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Bahrain}}
[[File:Bahrain14.JPG|right|thumb|Desert landscape in Bahrain]]
Bahrain is a generally flat and arid [[archipelago]] in the Persian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia. It consists of a low desert plain rising gently to a low central escarpment with the highest point the {{convert|134|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Mountain of Smoke]] ''(Jabal ad Dukhan)''. Bahrain has a total area of {{convert|665|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which is slightly larger than the [[Isle of Man]], though it is smaller than the nearby [[King Fahd International Airport]] near Dammam, Saudi Arabia ({{convert|780|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}).

As an archipelago of thirty-three islands, Bahrain does not share a land boundary with another country but does have a {{convert|161|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} coastline. The country also claims a further {{convert|22|km|nmi|0|abbr=on}} of [[territorial sea]] and a {{convert|44|km|nmi|0|abbr=on}} [[contiguous zone]]. Bahrain's largest islands are [[Bahrain Island]], [[Muharraq Island]], [[Umm an Nasan]], and [[Sitrah]]. Bahrain has mild winters and very hot, humid summers. The country's natural resources include large quantities of oil and natural gas as well as fish in the offshore waters. Arable land constitutes only 2.82%&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ba.html |title=CIA World Factbook, &quot;Bahrain&quot; |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the total area.

92% of Bahrain is desert with periodic droughts and dust storms the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification resulting from the degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, [[coral reef]]s, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal [[land reclamation]] at places such as [[Tubli Bay]]. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilization of the [[Dammam Aquifer]], the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its [[salinization]] by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Climate ==
{{Main|Geography of Bahrain|Climate of Bahrain}}
&lt;!---this is already stated in the geography section above
Bahrain is an island located east of the mainland of Saudi Arabia. [[Jabal ad Dukhan]] is the highest point in Bahrain with hills up to {{convert|134|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. 
---&gt;
The [[Zagros Mountains]] across the Persian Gulf in Iraq cause low level winds to be directed toward Bahrain. Dust storms from Iraq and Saudi Arabia transported by northwesterly winds cause reduced visibility in the months of June and July.

Due to the Persian Gulf area's low moisture, summers are very hot and dry. The seas around Bahrain are very shallow, heating up quickly in the summer to produce high [[humidity]], especially at night. Summer temperatures may reach more than {{convert|40|C|F|0|abbr=on}} under the right conditions. Rainfall in Bahrain is minimal and irregular. Rainfalls mostly occur in winter, with a recorded maximum of {{convert|71.8|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_b&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahrainweather.com/BahClimatelog.aspx |title=Bahrain Weather |publisher=Bahrain Weather |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Bahrain|Music of Bahrain}}
Bahrain is sometimes described as &quot;Middle East lite&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gz2010.cn/photoset/19EG0078/1132.html|title=Bahrain: Middle East Lite|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its combination of modern infrastructure with a Persian Gulf identity. While Islam is the main religion, Bahrainis are known for their tolerance towards the practice of other faiths.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} 

It is too early to say whether political liberalization under [[King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] has augmented or undermined Bahrain's traditional [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. The new political space for Shia and Sunni Islamists has meant that they are now more able to pursue programs that often seek to directly confront this pluralism. At the same time, political reforms have encouraged an opposite trend whereby society becomes more self-critical and shows a greater willingness to examine previous [[social taboos]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In common with the rest of the Muslim world, though Bahrain has take strong strides for women's rights, it does not recognize [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender]] rights.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Another facet of the new openness is Bahrain's status as the most prolific book publisher in the Arab world, with 132 books published in 2005 for a population of 700,000. In comparison, the 2005 average for the entire Arab world was seven books published per one million people, according to the [[United Nations Development Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/01/04/10009260.html Bahrain tops publishing sector among Arab states] ''Gulf News'', 4 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ali Bahar]] is the most famous singer in Bahrain. He performs his music with his Band [[Al-Ekhwa]] (''The Brothers'').

===Language  and religion===
{{See also|Freedom of religion in Bahrain}}
Arabic is the official language of Bahrain though English is widely used. [[Bahrani Arabic]] is the most widely spoken language. Bahrain's primary religion is Islam. Muslims belong to the Shi'a and Sunni branches of Islam. The Shi'a constitute over 70 percent of the Muslim population.

===Formula One and other motorsports events===
Bahrain has a [[Formula One]] race-track, which hosted the inaugural [[Gulf Air]] [[list of Formula One Grands Prix|Grand Prix]] on 4 April 2004, the first in an Arab country. This was followed by the [[Bahrain Grand Prix]] in 2005. Bahrain hosted the opening Grand Prix of the 2006 season on 12 March of that year. Both the above races were won by [[Fernando Alonso]] of [[Renault]]. The 2007 event took place on April 13, 14th and 15th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_c&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahraingp.com.bh/ |title=Bahrain International Circuit |publisher=Bahraingp.com.bh |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Bahrain also hosted its inaugural Australian [[V8 Supercar]] event dubbed the &quot;''Desert 400''&quot;. The V8s will return every November to the [[Sakhir]] circuit. The [[Bahrain International Circuit]] also features a full length [[Drag Racing|drag strip]] where the [[Bahrain Drag Racing Club]] has organised invitational events featuring some of Europe's top drag racing teams{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to try and raise the profile of the sport in the Middle East.

===Holidays===
On 1 September 2006, Bahrain changed its weekend from being Thursdays and Fridays to Fridays and Saturdays, in order to have a day of the weekend shared with the rest of the world. Other non-regular holidays are listed below:

[[File:RBNS Sabha (FFG 90) Bahrain.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Royal Bahraini Navy]] RBNS ''Sabha'']]
The kingdom has a small but well equipped military called the [[Bahrain Defence Force|Bahrain Defence Force (BDF)]]. The BDF is primarily equipped with United States equipment, such as the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F16 Fighting Falcon]], [[F-5 Freedom Fighter|F5 Freedom Fighter]], [[UH-60 Blackhawk|UH60 Blackhawk]], [[M60 Patton|M60A3 tanks]], and the ex-{{USS|Jack Williams|FFG-24|6}}, an [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate]] renamed the [[Bahrainian frigate Sabha (90)|RBNS ''Sabha'']]. The Government of Bahrain has a cooperative agreement with the United States Military and has provided the United States a base in [[Juffair]] since the early 1990s. This is the home of the headquarters for Commander, ''United States Naval Forces Central Command'' ([[COMUSNAVCENT]]) / ''United States Fifth Fleet'' (COMFIFTHFLT), and about 1500 United States and coalition military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.bahrain.navy.mil/ United States Navy Central Command web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Bahrain}}
{{See also| List of universities in Bahrain}}
[[File:University students Bahrain.jpg|right|thumb|Students at the [[University of Bahrain]], wearing the traditional garb]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (''Kuttab'') were the only form of education in Bahrain. They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the [[Qur'an]]. After World War I, Bahrain became open to western influences, and a demand for modern educational institutions appeared. 1919 marked the beginning of modern public school system in Bahrain when the [[Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia School]] for boys opened in [[Muharraq]]. In 1926, the Education Committee opened the second public school for boys in [[Manama]], and in 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq.

In 2004 King [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa]] introduced the &quot;King Hamad Schools of Future'' project that uses Information Communication Technology to support [[Kâ12 education]] in Bahrain. The project's objective is to connect all schools within the kingdom with the Internet. In addition to British intermediate schools, the island is served by the [[Bahrain School]] (BS). The BS is a [[United States Department of Defense]] school that provides a K-12 curriculum including [[International Baccalaureate]] offerings. There are also private schools that offer either the [[IB Diploma Programme]] or United Kingdom [[A-Levels]].

In 2007, St. Christopher's School Bahrain became the first school in Bahrain to offer a choice of International Baccalaureate or A-Levels for students. Numerous international educational institutions and schools have established links to Bahrain. A few prominent institutions are [[DePaul University]], [[Bentley College]], the Ernst &amp; Young Training Institute, [[NYIT]] and the [[Birla Institute of Technology International Centre]] Schooling is paid for by the government. Primary and secondary school attendance is high{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} even though it is not compulsory.

Bahrain also encourages institutions of higher learning, drawing on expatriate talent and the increasing pool of Bahrain Nationals returning from abroad with advanced degrees. The [[University of Bahrain]] was established for standard undergraduate and graduate study, and the [[King Abdulaziz University College of Health Sciences]], operating under the direction of the Ministry of Health, trains physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and paramedics. The 2001 National Action Charter paved the way for the formation of private universities such as the [[Ahlia University]] in Manama  and [[University College of Bahrain]] in [[Saar, Bahrain|Saar]]. The Royal University for Women (RUW), established in 2005, was the first private, purpose-built, international University in Bahrain dedicated solely to educating women. The [[University of London]] External has appointed MCG{{clarify|post-text=&quot;What is MCG&quot;|date=March 2011}} as the regional representative office in Bahrain for distance learning programs. MCG is one of the oldest private institutes in the country. Institutes have also opened which educate Asian students, such as the [[Pakistan Urdu School, Bahrain]] and the [[Indian School, Bahrain]].

As a tourist destination, Bahrain receives over eight million visitors per annum{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Most of these are from the surrounding Arab states although an increasing number hail from outside the region due to growing awareness of the kingdom's heritage and its higher profile as a result of the [[Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain International F1 Circuit]]. The [[Lonely Planet]] Guide describes Bahrain as &quot;''an excellent introduction to the Persian Gulf''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/middle-east/bahrain Bahrain, Destination Guide] Lonely Planet&lt;/ref&gt; because of its authentic Arab heritage and reputation as a liberal and modern country. The kingdom is also home to the popular tourist attraction, the [[Bahrain City Center]].

The kingdom combines modern Arab culture and the archaeological legacy of five thousand years of civilization. The island is home to castles including [[Qalat Al Bahrain]] which has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. The [[Bahrain National Museum]] has artifacts from the country's history dating back to the island's first human inhabitants some 9000 years ago.
