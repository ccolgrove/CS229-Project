'''''Stargate: The Ark of Truth''''' is a 2008 [[Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] [[military science fiction]] [[film]] written and directed by [[Robert C. Cooper]]. The film is the conclusion of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'s}} [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] arc, and picks up after the SG-1 series finale, but takes place before the fourth season of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. ''The Ark of Truth'' was released as a [[Region 1]] [[DVD]] on March 11, 2008. [[Sky One]] has broadcast the film on March 24, 2008, to be followed by the [[Region 2]] DVD release on April 28, 2008 with the [[Region 4]] DVD release on April 9, 2008.  [[Space (TV channel)|SPACE]] has broadcast the film on September 13, 2008. The [[SyFy|SciFi Channel]] premiered the movie on March 27, 2009.

== Plot ==
The movie covers SG-1's attempt to recover the &quot;Ark of Truth&quot;, an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Alteran]] device designed to brainwash whoever looks into it. Even though the Ori's promise of [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascension]] is a lie, the Ancients believe that people should be free to believe it if they wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/06/cooper_opens_the_ark.shtml |title=Cooper opens the Ark |date=June 11, 2007|publisher=GateWorld.net |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SG-1]] discovers a box that they believe contains the Ark while digging on [[Dakara]], but before they can open it, [[Ori (Stargate)#Ori warriors|Ori soldiers]] arrive, led by Tomin. Daniel tricks them into opening the box, but it is revealed to be a fake. When Tomin is ordered by a [[Prior (Stargate)|Prior]] to kill them, he refuses, and [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Mitchell]] kills the Prior, whose powers were being blocked by the [[Tau'ri technology in Stargate#Anti-Prior Device|Anti-Prior device]]. Shocked at the death of their Prior, the Ori soldiers surrender.

Back on Earth, General [[Hank Landry (Stargate SG-1)|Landry]] and Mitchell meet James Marrick, an [[Tau'ri organizations in Stargate#International Oversight Advisory (IOA)|IOA]] representative sent to interrogate Tomin. When Daniel Jackson realizes that the Ark is still in the Ori galaxy, Marrick is assigned to accompany them on board the ''[[List of Earth starships in Stargate#Odyssey|Odyssey]]'' through the [[Supergate (Stargate)|Supergate]]. In the Ori galaxy, a member of the [[Ori (Stargate)#Anti-Ori underground|anti-Ori resistance]] tells the team that according to legend, the Ark is on Celestis, the Ori capital. When SG-1 beams down to the planet, Marrick activates the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] computer core which alerts the Ori to the ship's location.

Mitchell and [[Samantha Carter|Carter]] beam back to the ''Odyssey'' and discover that Marrick has used the core to build a [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]], intending to plant it on an Ori ship and let it spread to their entire fleet. When Mitchell attempts to destroy it with an [[Tau'ri technology in Stargate#Anti-Replicator Gun (ARG)|anti-Replicator Gun]], the replicator escapes, and Marrick reveals that the IOA removed that weakness from the design, although conventional weapons are sufficient to destroy individual replicators. Marrick implies that a shutdown code has been included as a failsafe, but claims he does not know what it is. He is placed in the ship's brig. With several Ori ships approaching, Mitchell attempts to beam Daniel, [[Teal'c]], [[Vala Mal Doran|Vala]], and Tomin up from the planet, but the replicator takes over the system and keeps Mitchell from doing so. With no other option, the ''Odyssey'' jumps to hyperspace to escape, leaving the others on the planet.

Daniel finds the Ark in a set of catacombs, and after several ground tremors, brings it to the surface. When the team emerges, they are ambushed by Ori warriors, and Teal'c is shot in the back while the others are captured. When they are brought to the city, Vala discovers that the Ori were indeed killed by the [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Sangraal|Sangraal]] during the events of ''[[List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes#ep208|The Shroud]].'' [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]] has ascended and taken over all of their power. Teal'c, who has been walking toward the city of Celestis since he was shot, collapses due to his wound within sight of the city. He is subsequently revived by [[Ancient characters in Stargate#Ganos Lal/Morgan le Fay|Morgan le Fay]] and continues on to free Daniel. Morgan then arrives in Daniel's cell (initially in the guise of Merlin) and tells him if he can expose one Prior to the Ark, the others will be turned by a link in their staffs. This will weaken Adria enough for Morgan to stalemate her.

In the meantime, a Prior arrives on Earth, offering a last chance to convert to Origin. When General Landry refuses to even listen to him, the ''[[List of Earth starships in Stargate#Apollo|Apollo]]'' detects a fleet of Ori motherships waiting on the edge of the [[solar system]]. On the ''Odyssey'', Marrick is attacked by Replicators who infest his body.  In the ensuing battle, Mitchell is able to briefly disable the Replicator connection to Marrick's brain who then informs Mitchell the shut down code for the Replicators is located on the other side of the crystal used to create them.  Mitchell activates an explosive charge which kills Marrick.  Mitchell informs Carter who activates the self-destruct, destroying the Replicators.

When the Ark is activated and opened, the [[Ori (Stargate)#Doci|Doci]] is caught by the beam and made to see that the Ori are not gods and spreads this belief to all of the Priors in the Ori galaxy and through them their followers. With Adria now in a weakened state, Morgan is able to engage her in an eternal battle.  SG-1 exposes the Prior on Earth to the Ark, transmitting the knowledge about the Ori to all of the Priors in the Milky Way, and thus turning all known Priors in the Universe.

In the aftermath, Tomin departs for the Ori galaxy as the new leader of his people, he and Vala agreeing that, while the Ori themselves were liars, Origin itself has a worthwhile message. Tomin asks Vala to come with him, but Vala apologizes and says that she feels her place is with the SGC. Over Daniel's objections the Ark is taken to Area 51 for study.

== Production ==
This movie is the conclusion of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'s}} [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] arc,&lt;ref name=coming_to_dvd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/06/iark_of_truthi_will_be_released_.shtml |title=''Ark of Truth'' will be released in 2008 |date=June 24, 2007 |publisher=GateWorld.net |accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in the season nine episode {{sgcite|Avalon}}. ''Stargate: The Ark of Truth'' is the story that Cooper originally planned as a five- or six-episode arc to begin at the end of Season Ten and beginning of Season Eleven, but the series was canceled by the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in August 2006.&lt;ref name=newdirections&gt;[http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/new_directions_part_1.shtml GateWorld - Interviews: New Directions (Part 1) (Robert C. Cooper - June 2007)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The intended ending for the Tenth Season was to introduce the concept of the Ark of Truth, an artifact for which SG-1 is searching. As the story progresses, SG-1 would learn that this device is in the Ori galaxy and could be helpful in diverting the Ori warriors from their crusade. The ''Odyssey'' would have brought them through the Supergate to the Ori galaxy. However, the Sci Fi Channel wanted the series to be concluded, and the producers neither had the time nor the will to do that and went with the idea of what would become {{sgcite|Unending}}, the ''SG-1'' series finale.&lt;ref name=newdirections&gt;[http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/new_directions_part_1.shtml GateWorld - Interviews: New Directions (Part 1) (Robert C. Cooper - June 2007)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The movie's storyline picks up after &quot;Unending&quot;, but takes place before the fourth season of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/amanda_tapping_01.htm Amanda Tapping interview]. The SciFi World (July 3, 2007). Retrieved on July 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert C. Cooper, the film has higher production values than episodes of the television series.&lt;ref name=newdirections /&gt; The production budget was $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/08/tapping_discusses_isg-1i_movies.shtml |title=Tapping discusses SG-1 movies |date=August 9, 2007 |publisher=gateworld.net |accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot in a [[Aspect ratio (image)|16:9 aspect ratio]] on [[35 mm film]]. [[Joel Goldsmith]] produced an [[orchestra]]l score for the film, rather than a synthetic score as he did for episodes of the series.&lt;ref name=newdirections&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/new_directions_part_2.shtml |title=GateWorld - Interviews: New Directions (Part 2) |date=July, 2007 |publisher=Gateworld.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to wrapping up the Ori storyline, this film is also intended as a transition into an ongoing series of films centered around the ''SG-1'' characters.  Certain scenes were shot concurrently with that of the second film, ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]''.  According to the DVD commentary, a tease leading into that film was planned to be included at the end of ''Stargate: The Ark of Truth'', but was ultimately dropped as it was felt that this film had &quot;too many endings.&quot;

The movie went into production in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/isg-1i_movies_start_filming_apri.shtml|title=''SG-1'' movies started filming April 15|date=December 20, 2006|publisher=GateWorld.net|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
