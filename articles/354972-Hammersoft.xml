His career in [[Major League Baseball]] spanned three decades, from {{By|1956}} through {{By|1973}}. Aparicio played for the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1956â62, 1968â70), [[Baltimore Orioles]] (1963â67) and [[Boston Red Sox]] (1971â73).&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/aparilu01.shtml |title=Luis Aparicio |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He batted and threw right-handed. A thirteen-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Aparicio was inducted to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1984|1984]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at The Baseball Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/aparicio-luis |title=Luis Aparicio |publisher=Baseball Hall of Fame |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
Born in [[Maracaibo|Maracaibo, Zulia State]], [[Venezuela]], Aparicio came from a baseball family. His father, Luis Aparicio Sr., was a notable shortstop in Venezuela and owned a Winter League team with Aparicio's uncle, Ernesto Aparicio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Happy Little Luis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1071273/3/index.htm |title=Happy Little Luis |author=Rogin, Gilbert |publisher=Sports-Illustrated.com |date=May 9, 1960 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aparicio spent six years (top for his career in Venezuela) with [[Tiburones de La Guaira]] in the [[Venezuelan Winter League]].

===Chicago White Sox===
Aparicio was heavily scouted by the [[Cleveland Indians]], but Chicago White Sox [[general manager (baseball)|General Manager]] [[Frank Lane]], on the recommendation of fellow [[Venezuela]]n shortstop [[Chico Carrasquel]], signed Aparicio for $5,000 down and $5,000 in first year salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James, Bill |title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |year=2001 |page= 599 |isbn=0-684-80697-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After only two years in the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]], he made his major league debut in [[1956 Chicago White Sox season|1956]], replacing Carrasquel as the White Sox shortstop. Aparicio would lead the [[American League]] in [[stolen bases]], [[Assist (baseball)|assists]], and [[putout]]s, and won both the [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]] and [[The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award|''The Sporting News'' Rookie of the Year]] awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1956.shtml#ALroy |title=1959 Rookie of the Year Award voting results |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_snrp3.shtml |title=Rookie of the Year Award by The Sporting News |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparicio quickly became an integral member of the [[Chicago White Sox#1950â67: &quot;Go-Go Sox&quot; and the Bridesmaid Years|Go-Go White Sox]] teams of the mid-1950s, who were known for their speed and strong defense. Over the next decade, Aparicio set the standard for the spray-hitting, slick-fielding, speedy shortstop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Happy Little Luis&quot;/&gt; He combined with [[second baseman]] [[Nellie Fox]] to become one of the best [[double play]] combinations in major league baseball.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Go-sox Go Again&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1132285/index.htm |title=The Go-sox Go Again |author=Terrell, Roy |publisher=Sports-Illustrated.com |date=May 13, 1957 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070879/index.htm |title=Two For The Pennant |author=Woodcock, Les |publisher=Sports-Illustrated.com |date=August 10, 1959 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aparicio once again led the American League in stolen bases and assists in {{By|1957}} as the White Sox would hold first place until late June before finishing the season in second place behind the [[1957 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Go-sox Go Again&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1957-schedule-scores.shtml |title=1957 Chicago White Sox Season |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1958 Chicago White Sox season|1958]], Aparicio earned recognition as one of the top shortstops in major league baseball when he was elected to be the starting shortstop for the American League in the {{By|1958}} [[1958 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS195807080.shtml |title=1958 All-Star Game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Sox would once again finish the season in second place behind the [[1958 New York Yankees season|Yankees]], after being in last place on June 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1958-schedule-scores.shtml |title=1958 Chicago White Sox Season |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aparicio again led the league in stolen bases, assists and putouts, and would win his first [[Gold Glove Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_al.shtml#1958 |title=1958 Gold Glove Award Winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Sox would finally win the American League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] in [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|1959]], finishing the regular season five games ahead of the [[1959 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1959.shtml |title=1959 American League Final Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aparicio finished second to team-mate Nellie Fox in the American League [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] balloting, and won his second Gold Glove Award as well as another All-Star selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1959.shtml#ALmvp |title=1959 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_al.shtml#1959 |title=1959 Gold Glove Award Winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS195907070.shtml |title=1959 All-Star Game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted a .308 [[batting average]] in the [[1959 World Series]] as the White Sox were defeated by the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in a six-game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1959_WS.shtml |title=1959 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparicio continued to be one of the top shortstops in the league, finishing at or near the top in [[fielding percentage]] and assists but, when he showed up overweight and had an off year in [[1962 Chicago White Sox season|1962]], the White Sox offered him a reduction in his salary for the 1963 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;If Luis Aparicio Clubhouse Lawyer, Baltimore Would Like Bench Full&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=If Luis Aparicio Clubhouse Lawyer, Baltimore Would Like Bench Full |agency=NEA |work=Times Daily |page=2 |date=21 April 1963 |accessdate=4 January 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ehAsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=osYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3274,5872026&amp;dq=luis+aparicio+triandos&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enraged Aparicio said that he would quit rather than accept a decrease in pay and demanded to be traded.&lt;ref name=&quot;If Luis Aparicio Clubhouse Lawyer, Baltimore Would Like Bench Full&quot;/&gt; The White Sox eventually traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with [[Al Smith (outfielder)|Al Smith]] for [[Hoyt Wilhelm]], [[Ron Hansen (baseball)|Ron Hansen]], [[Dave Nicholson]] and [[Pete Ward]].[the following season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio Trades and Transactions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=aparilu01 |title=Luis Aparicio Trades and Transactions |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore Orioles===
Aparicio regained his form in Baltimore and continued to lead the league in stolen bases and in fielding percentage, producing a career-high .983 fielding percentage in [[1963 Baltimore Orioles season|1963]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Together with [[Brooks Robinson]] and [[Jerry Adair]], he was part of one of the best defensive [[infield]]s in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GS4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=luis+aparicio+baseball+digest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4FXw_rXjx9&amp;sig=AcW2BRLWOpeDuTNfFnhBXII-Htk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MYR7TOv6F4O0lQfCk9jsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Shortstop and Third Base Team Mates Who Led League in Fielding |author=Kuenster, John |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=June 2004 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vybawTLKGmwC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=luis+aparicio+baseball+digest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RUQm-1x0mh&amp;sig=Ren-4ynetUT8yTAxlLFgFemaQ3c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MYR7TOv6F4O0lQfCk9jsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=luis%20aparicio%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false |title=Middle Infield Tandems That Won Fielding Titles, Same Season |author=Kuenster, John |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=June 2009 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1964 Baltimore Orioles season|1964]], he would lead the league in stolen bases for a ninth consecutive year and win his sixth Gold Glove Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_al.shtml#1964 |title=1964 Gold Glove Award Winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aparicio posted a .278 batting average with 178 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|1966]], second-most hits in the league behind [[Tony Oliva]] and, won a seventh Gold Glove Award as the Orioles clinched their first American League pennant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1966-batting-leaders.shtml |title=1966 American League Batting Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_al.shtml#1966 |title=1966 Gold Glove Award Winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1966.shtml |title=1966 American League Final Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished ninth in the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting and helped the Orioles sweep the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1966 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1966_WS.shtml |title=1966 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1966.shtml#ALmvp |title=1966 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparicio returned to the White Sox for the [[1968 Chicago White Sox season|1968]] season after being traded for [[Don Buford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio Trades and Transactions&quot;/&gt; He continued to play well defensively, leading the league in [[range factor]] in {{By|1968}} and {{By|1969}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Aparicio had his best overall offensive season in [[1970 Chicago White Sox season|1970]], finishing fourth in the American League [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|Batting Championship]] with a career-high .312 batting average and scoring 86 [[run (baseball)|runs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He also earned his eighth All-Star berth and won his ninth Gold Glove Award in {{By|1970}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_al.shtml#1970 |title=1970 Gold Glove Award Winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS197007140.shtml |title=1970 All-Star Game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the White Sox finishing in last place, Aparicio finished 12th in the 1970 American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1970.shtml |title=1970 American League Final Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1970.shtml#ALmvp |title=1970 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1970, after three seasons with the White Sox, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for [[Luis Alvarado]] and [[Mike Andrews]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio Trades and Transactions&quot;/&gt;

===Boston Red Sox===
In [[1971 Boston Red Sox season|1971]], Aparicio tied the longest Major League hitless streak for non-pitchers in the last 50 years by going without a [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] in 44 [[at bats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084969/index.htm |title=Even The President Worried |author=Fimrite, Ron |publisher=Sports-Illustrated.com |date=June 14, 1971 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aparicio then hit a [[Grand Slam (baseball)|grand slam]] [[home run]] against the Indians in Cleveland and then led off a night game at Fenway with another home run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=13LPw4LCj_gC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=luis+aparicio#v=onepage&amp;q=luis%20aparicio&amp;f=false |title=Tales From The Red Sox Dugout |author=Prime, Jim |coauthors=Nowlin, Bill |publisher=Books.Google.com |isbn= 1-58261-348-6 |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit for a career-low .232 batting average that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; 

In [[1972 Boston Red Sox season|1972]], Aparicio made a late-season [[baserunning]] blunder that contributed to the Red Sox losing the {{By|1972}} [[American League East|American League Eastern Division]] title by half a game to the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET197210020.shtml |title=October 2, 1972 Red Sox-Tigers box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last year as an active player in [[1973 Boston Red Sox season|1973]], Aparicio would hit for a .271 average and steal his 500th base, against the [[1973 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], on July 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA197307050.shtml |title=July 5, 1973 Red Sox-Yankees box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired at the end of the season at the age of 39.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;

==Baseball records==
At his retirement, Aparicio was the all-time leader for most [[games played]], [[assist (baseball statistics)|assist]]s and [[double play]]s by a shortstop and the all-time leader for [[putout]]s and [[total chances]] by an American League shortstop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luis Aparicio at The Baseball Hall of Fame&quot;/&gt; His nine Gold Glove Awards set an American League record for shortstops, that was tied by [[Omar Vizquel]] in {{By|2001}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Multiple Winners of the Gold Glove Awards&quot;/&gt; He tied the record of most seasons leading the league in fielding average by shortstops with 8, previously set by [[Everett Scott]] and [[Lou Boudreau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shortstops By The Numbers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2zADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=luis+aparicio&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=luis%20aparicio&amp;f=false |title=Shortstops By The Numbers |author=Kuenster, John |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=June 2005 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 2,583 games played at shortstop stood as the Major League record for that position from his retirement in {{By|1973}} until May {{By|2008}} when it was surpassed by Omar Vizquel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shortstops By The Numbers&quot;/&gt; His 2,677 hits was also the major league record for players from Venezuela, until it was surpassed by [[Omar Vizquel]] on June 25, {{By|2009}}. He had 13 consecutive seasons with enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting title and an [[on-base percentage]] less than .325, a major league record (His career OBP was slightly better than the shortstops' one during those years; .311 vs .309). A more impressive streak was his 16 straight seasons with more than 500 plate appearances, tied for fifth best in major league history. Aparicio never played any defensive position other than shortstop.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.baseball-almanac.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/luis_aparicio_biography.shtml |title=Luis Aparicio Biography |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
