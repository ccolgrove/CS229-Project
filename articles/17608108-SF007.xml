'''Pedro Fernandes de QueirÃ³s''' ({{lang-es|'''Pedro FernÃ¡ndez de QuirÃ³s'''}}), (1565â1614) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator best known for his involvement with Spanish voyages of discovery in the [[Pacific Ocean]], in particular the 1595-1596 voyage of [[Alvaro de MendaÃ±a de Neira]], and for leading a 1605-1606 expedition which crossed the Pacific in search of [[Terra Australis]].

==Early life==
QueirÃ³s was born in [[Ãvora]], [[Portugal]] in 1565. As a young man he entered [[Spain|Spanish]] service and became an experienced seaman and navigator. In April 1595 he joined [[Ãlvaro de MendaÃ±a de Neira]] on his voyage to colonise the [[Solomon Islands]], serving as pilot. After MendaÃ±aâs death in October 1595 he is credited with taking command and saving the only remaining ship of the expedition, arriving in the [[Philippines]] in February 1596.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020311b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Search for Terra Australis==
In 1598 QueirÃ³s returned to Spain and petitioned King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] to support another voyage into the [[Pacific]]. A devout Catholic, QueirÃ³s also visited [[Rome]] in 1600, where he obtained the support of the Pope, [[Clement VIII]], for further explorations. He greatly impressed the Spanish Ambassador in [[Rome]], the Duke of Sesa, who described him as a âman of good judgement, experienced in his profession, hard working, quiet and disinterested.â &lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot; /&gt; While in Rome QueirÃ³s also first wrote his ''Treatise on Navigation'' as a letter to the king, further reinforcing his reputation as a navigator.  In March 1603 QueirÃ³s was finally authorized to return to [[Peru]] to establish another expedition, with the intention of finding [[Terra Australis]], the mythical &quot;great south land,&quot; and claiming it for [[Spain]] and the Church. QueirÃ³s's party of 160 men on three ships, ''San Pedro y San Pablo'' (150 tons),  ''San Pedro''  (120 tons) and the tender (or launch) ''Los Tres Reyes'' left [[Callao]] on 21 December 1605.&lt;ref&gt;Estensen, M. (2006) ''Terra Australia Incognita; The Spanish Quest for the Great South Land'' p.111-113. Allen &amp; Unwin, Australia ISBN 978 1741750546&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 1606 the expedition discovered [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]] and [[Ducie Island]].
In May 1606 the expedition reached the islands later called the [[New Hebrides]] and now the independent nation of [[Vanuatu]]. QueirÃ³s landed on a large island which he took to be part of the southern continent, and named it ''La Austrialia &lt;ref&gt;No, not a typo! See accounts of the voyage cited, eg Estensen, M (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; del Espiritu Santo'' (The Austrian Land of the Holy Spirit), for King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], who was of Austrian descent. The island is still called [[Espiritu Santo]]. Here he stated his intention to establish a colony, to be called Nova Jerusalem.

QueirÃ³s's religious fervour found expression with the founding of a new Order of Chivalry, the Knights of the Holy Ghost. The Orderâs purpose was to protect the new colony.  However, within weeks the idea of a colony was abandoned due to the hostility of the Ni-Vanuatu and to disagreements among the crew. 

After six weeks QueirÃ³s's ships put to sea to explore the coastline. On the night of June 11, 1606 QueirÃ³s in the ''San Pedro y San Pablo'' became separated from the other ships in bad weather and was unable (or so he later said) to return to safe anchorage at [[Espiritu Santo]]. He then sailed to [[Acapulco]] in [[Mexico]], where he arrived in November 1606. In the account of Diego de Prado y Tovar,  which is highly critical of QueirÃ³s, mutiny and poor leadership is given as the reason for QueirÃ³s's disappearance.&lt;ref name=prado&gt;[http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/voyages/voya_spanishQuest.html  Prado's Account can be read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Two weeks later, his second-in-command, [[Luis VÃ¡ez de Torres]], after searching in vain for QueirÃ³s and assuming his ship was wrecked, left [[Espiritu Santo]]. Torres successfully reached [[Manila]], the center of the [[Spanish East Indies]] in May 1607, charting the southern coastline of [[New Guinea]] on the way and in doing so sailing through the strait that now bears his name.

==QueirÃ³s in later life==
Pedro de QueirÃ³s returned to Madrid in 1607. Regarded as a crank, he spent the next seven years writing numerous accounts of his voyage and begging King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] for money for a new voyage. He was finally despatched to [[Peru]] with letters of support, but the king had no real intention of funding another expedition. QueirÃ³s died on the way, in [[Panama]], in 1614. He had married Dona Ana Chacon of [[Madrid]] in 1589, who bore him one son and one daughter.

==Accounts of QueirÃ³s's Voyage==
There are a number of documents describing the QueirÃ³s â Torres voyages still in existence. Most significant are
* Queiros's many subsequent Memorials to the King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] regarding the voyage,&lt;ref name=loc&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/service/rbc/rbdk/d0404/02951422.jpg  A copy at the Library of Congress can be read online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Torres brief account to the king (1607),&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter XII of Collingridge,G.(1895) ''The First Discovery of Australia'', for part of Torres account at [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17022/17022-h/17022-h.htm#maps-col-05] A longer translation is included in his 1895 book ''The Discovery of Australia'', Golden Press reprint, 1983. ISBN 085558 9566&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Pradoâs narrative ''Relacion Sumaria''&lt;ref name=&quot;prado&quot; /&gt; (first written in 1608) and 4 charts of New Guinea &lt;ref&gt;For colour photos of the charts, see Hilder, B.(1980) ''The Voyage of Torres'' University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, ISBN 07022 1275x. Also see Collingridgeâs  The ''First Discovery of Australia'', 1895, which includes Collingridgeâs own copies of three of the charts [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17022/17022-h/17022-h.htm#ch-12] The charts are the coloured maps 5,6 and 9.(Map 9 is incorrectly titled âMoresby's Map of the Islands at the South-east end of New Guineaâ . It is in fact based on Pradoâs Mappa III  - showing Orangerie Bay, New Guinea.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Juan Luis Arias de Loyolaâs memorial to King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]  (written about 1630 and based on discussions between QueirÃ³s and Loyola ) &lt;ref&gt;Hilder, B (1980) p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt;

Most documents of [[Luis VÃ¡ez de Torres]]'s discoveries were not published but filed away in Spanish archives, including Pradoâs lengthy account and accompanying charts.  

1617 may be the date of the first English translation of one of QueirÃ³s's memorials, as ''Terra Australis Incognita'', or ''A New Southerne Discoverie''.&lt;ref&gt;The [[State Library of Victoria|La Trobe Library of Victoria]] lists a copy of this as one of its rare books [http://calisto.slv.vic.gov.au/latrobejournal/issue/latrobe-47-48/t1-g-t7.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
A short account of QueirÃ³s's voyage and discoveries was published in English by Samuel Purchas in 1625 in ''Haklvytvs posthumus'', or, ''Pvrchas his Pilg''rimes, vol. iv, p.&amp;nbsp;1422-1432. This account also appears to be based on a letter by QueirÃ³s to the King in 1610, the eighth on the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc&quot; /&gt;

Some time between 1762 and 1765, written accounts of the Torres expedition were seen by British Admiralty Hydrographer [[Alexander Dalrymple]]. Dalrymple provided a sketch map which included the QueirÃ³s -Torres voyages to [[Joseph Banks]] who undoubtedly passed this information to [[James Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilder, B (1980) p.31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estensen, M.(2006)p.222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory that QueirÃ³s discovered Australia==
In the 19th century some Australian Catholics, living under a Protestant ascendancy, claimed that QueirÃ³s had in fact discovered Australia, in advance of the Protestants [[Willem Janszoon]], [[Abel Tasman]] and [[James Cook]]. The Archbishop of [[Sydney]] from 1884 to 1911, [[Patrick Francis Moran]], asserted this to be a fact, and it was taught in Catholic schools for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, cited in Richardson, W.A.R. (2006) ''Was Australia charted before 1606?'' p. 20. National Library of Australia ISBN 0642 276420&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the real site of QueirÃ³s's New Jerusalem was near [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]] in [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Moran's ''Discovery of Australia by de QueirÃ³s in the Year 1606'' [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0600641h.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==QueirÃ³s in modern literature==
Building on this tradition, the Australian  poet [[James McAuley]] (1917â76) wrote an epic called ''Captain Quiros'' (1964), in which he depicted QueirÃ³s as a martyr for the cause of Catholic Christian civilisation (although he did not repeat the claim that QueirÃ³s had discovered Australia). The heavily political overtones of the poem caused it to be coldly received at a time when much politics in Australia was still coloured by Catholic-Protestant sectarianism. 

&quot;Bitter indeed the chalice that he drank&lt;br&gt;
For no man's pride accepts to cheap a rate&lt;br&gt;
As not to call on Heaven to vindicate&lt;br&gt;
His worth together with the cause he served.&quot;

(James McAuley, ''Captain Quiros'')

The Australian writer John Toohey published a novel, ''Quiros'', in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;''Quiros'', Toohey, J. (2002) Duffy &amp; Snellgrove; Potts Point, N.S.W, ISBN 1876631244&lt;/ref&gt;
