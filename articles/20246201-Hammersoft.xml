The '''2012 Republican presidential primaries''' are the selection processes in which voters of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] will choose their nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]]. The [[United States presidential primary|primary contest]] began with a fairly wide field, and is the first presidential primary influenced by the [[Tea Party movement]]. [[Ron Paul]], who [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008|had run in 2008]] on a libertarian platform, experienced considerable support in his presidential campaign, and was welcomed by Republican voters as a mainstream candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/07/ron-paul-military-campaign-donations-/1 |title=Ron Paul raises most campaign cash from military workers |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65482.html |title=Ron Paul wins Values Voter straw poll; Herman Cain second - Alexander Burns |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]], who [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|also ran for president in 2008]], took an early lead in polls with the support of much of the Republican establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2011/06/romney-leads-way-in-florida.html |title=Romney leads the way in Florida |date=2011-06-23 |publisher=Public Policy Polling |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his lead over the Republican field has been precarious, due to the entry of new candidates that drew considerable media attention between April and August 2011. Support amongst Republicans for [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] of [[Texas]] propelled him to join the race in August 2011; he performed strongly in polls, instantly becoming a serious contender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/gop_primary_perry_29_romney_18_bachmann_13|title=GOP Primary: Perry 29%, Romney 18%, Bachmann 13%|publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]]|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/perry_44_obama_41_president_leads_other_gop_hopefuls|title=Perry 44% Obama 41%; President Leads Other GOP Hopefuls|publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]]|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a series of poor performances in debates, Perry quickly lost his momentum to [[Herman Cain]]. Cain's viability as a candidate was seriously jeopardized after a history of sexual harassment allegations surfaced in the media, with his campaign being suspended on December 3. [[Newt Gingrich]], who stressed the need to beat incumbent President [[Barack Obama]] and avoid intra-party disputes, began making a comeback in November 2011, both in polls and fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan |first=Naureen |url=http://nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/gingrich-making-the-right-moves-in-primary-states-20111103 |title=Gingrich Making the Right Moves in Primary States - Naureen Khan |publisher=NationalJournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Republican Party has grown increasingly confident of a presidential victory in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen |first=Jon |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/behind-the-numbers/post/republicans-expect-to-win-in-2012/2011/10/03/gIQAfG1PIL_blog.html |title=Republicans expect to win in 2012 - Behind the Numbers |publisher=The Washington Post |date= October 3, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged by a rise in the number of self-identified Republicans from 2008 and a steady decline in President [[Barack Obama]]'s approval ratings. Since 2008, the Republican Party has experienced big gains in White voters, including younger and poorer Whites who trended Democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=July 22, 2011 |url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2067/2012-electorate-partisan-affiliations-gop-gains-white-voters |title=GOP Makes Big Gains Among White Voters - Pew Research Center |publisher=Pewresearch.org |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zengerle |first=Patricia |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/22/us-usa-campaign-parties-idUSTRE76L5RE20110722 |title=Republican Party makes big gains among whites |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] also reduced the influence of traditionally [[blue states]] in the electoral college. The nascent &quot;[[tea party movement]]&quot; demonstrated itself as a potent force in the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], which displayed a strong rightward trend in American voters. Political analyst [[Larry Sabato]] suggested that the 2010 midterm elections were affected most by &quot;a drastically lower Democratic turnout&quot; than in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenextelection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/next-election-surprising-reality/?pagination=false#fnr-4 |title=The Next Election: The Surprising Reality by Andrew Hacker &amp;#124; The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Hacker]] of the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' pointed to voting figuresâ131 million voted in 2008, while 87 million voted in 2010âsaying the results could easily be reversed in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenextelection&quot;/&gt; The United States economy had suffered from a recession from 2008 to 2011, median incomes had fallen for Americans, and unemployment remained above 9% throughout Obama's term in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2011/1107_obama_galston.aspx |title=One Year to Go: President Barack Obamaâs Uphill Battle for Reelection in 2012 - Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling showed voters who approved of his &quot;handling of the economy&quot; fell from 60% from the start of his term to the mid-30s by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/obama_ad.htm |title=Obama Administration |publisher=Pollingreport.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling found that Americans were increasingly frustrated with the United States government as a whole, and the Republican Party shared in those high disapproval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Albany Tribune |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/26082011-obama-leadership-takes-a-hit-but-gop-approval-ratings-decline-to-34/ |title=Obama Leadership Takes A Hit, But GOP Approval Ratings Decline To 34% |publisher=Eurasiareview.com |date=2011-08-26 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, although the majority of Americans felt Obama did not have a successful plan to bring jobs, they trusted Congress even less to create them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/11/boehner-obama-132-economists/1 |title=Economists: GOP jobs plan better than Obama's |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Younglai |first=Rachelle |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/03/us-usa-congress-jobs-idUSTRE7A27QY20111103 |title=Republicans block another part of Obama jobs plan |publisher=Reuters |date= November 3, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives, now with a substantial Republican majority from January 2011, refused to raise taxes and was engaged in a lengthy dispute over the debt ceiling. House Speaker [[John Boehner]] led negotiations with President Obama over raising the [[debt ceiling]]. The tea party movement, which was active in political town hall meetings, was opposed to raising the ceiling.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/22/us-usa-campaign-candidates-idUSTRE77K0UR20110822 | publisher=Reuters | title=Republicans may never get 2012 dream candidate | date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic policy of the Republican Party included some tax increases, while the Tea Party movement advocated both lower taxes and lower spending across the board.

Concerns about the security and support of [[Israel]] have also been apparent in the lead-up to the 2012 elections, affecting Jewish support for both Obama and the Republican Party. Beginning in 2010, Obama's rhetoric towards Israel became more distant, and relations with Israel were strained by his insistence on Israel to stop construction in the [[West Bank]] and in [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/03/29/never_again_will_we_be_silent_104961.html |title=Obama's Treatment of Israel is Shocking |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations held a vote condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank in 2011, and a vote to be held September 23, 2011, on the statehood of the Palestinian Authority made Israel a critical issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liel |first=Alon |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=236657 |title={{-'}}At least 140 nations expected to vote for statehood bid{{'-}}|work=The Jerusalem Post|date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2011|09|23}} The Obama administration made statements agreeing to a two-state solution based on Israel's 1967 borders, weakening his support in the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/01/koch-outraged-obamas-treatment-israel-housing-construction/ | publisher=Fox News | title=Koch Outraged By Obama's Treatment of Israel Over Housing Construction | date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Eric |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43122454/ns/politics |title=Top Jewish Americans ponder support for Obama|publisher=msnbc.com|date=2011-05-21 |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that Obama remained a clear favorite among Jewish fund-raisers and held a majority of Jewish voters in swing states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/us/politics/26policy.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Jackie | last1=Calmes | first2=Helene | last2=Cooper | title=Parties See Obama's Israel Policy as Wedge for 2012 | date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Ari Fleischer]] predicted that even a small shift in the Jewish community could cost Obama the states of Ohio and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/138130/ |title=Republicans Use Israel To Attract Jewish Voters â And Jewish Money|work=The Forward|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama administration attempted to postpone the UN vote on Palestine, albeit to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/90059030?Palestinians%20won%26%23146%3Bt%20give%20up%20on%20UN%20as%20U.S.%20stalls%20statehood%20bid |title=Palestinians won't give up on UN as U.S. stalls statehood bid |date=September 5, 2011|work=All Headline News |accessdate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/world/middleeast/04mideast.html | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Is Appealing to Palestinians to Stall U.N.

Sarah Palin stayed on Fox News as a political analyst through the Republican race.  Her high-profile appearances and media coverage prompted news stories speculating about her, which she disliked. [[Karl Rove]] defended the speculation, saying, &quot;Look, [Palin] is all upset about this, saying I'm somehow trying to sabotage her campaign, sabotage her in some way and that how dare I speculate on her future.

==Campaign==
===Initial race===
The race for the Republican primaries began slowly in 2011. Gallup polls found that historically the Republican Party had a clear front-runner by March. In surveys, Republicans said they wanted to see Huckabee, Mitt Romney, Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drake |first=Bruce |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2011/03/07/lack-of-a-gop-front-runner-for-2012-at-odds-with-republican-hist/ |title=Lack of a GOP Front-Runner for 2012 at Odds With Republican History |publisher=Politicsdaily.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February and March 2011, the Republican candidates, and the party as a whole, was involved in a discussion on radical and political Islam. The Republican Party courted Muslim voters during Bush's 2000 campaign but lost nearly the entire demographic in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49410.html |title=Right fractures over Islam - Byron Tau |work=Politico|date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2012 cycle, the threat of [[Sharia]] law in the United States became a political issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Ben |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0411/2012_candidates_stake_out_positions_on_sharia.html |title=2012 candidates stake out positions on sharia|work=Politico|date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculated candidate Mike Huckabee made statements criticizing Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Articles by Bob Allen |url=http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2011-02/huckabee-draws-heat-anti-islam-remarks |title=Huckabee draws heat for anti-Islam remarks |work=The Christian Century |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Santorum was noted as saying Sharia law was &quot;evil&quot;.

This is what happened to Europe. And little by little, to try to be politically correct, they made this little change. They made this little change. And now they've got a social problem that they don't know what to do with hardly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/30/herman-cain-2012-republican-primary-sneak_n_842537.html |title=Herman Cain May Sneak Up On 2012 GOP Primary Field If He Doesn't Trip Himself Up First |work=The Huffington Post|date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase &quot;creeping Sharia&quot; became a political catchphrase.

Over the summer of 2011, several Republican groups began a nationwide campaign to [[Political draft|draft]] Texas governor [[Rick Perry]] to compete for the nomination. Perry began an aggressive networking and fundraising strategy to launch a viable campaign. He depended largely on evangelical Christians as his base, and held a prayer meeting with supporters one week before announcing his campaign. The prayer was held to save &quot;a nation in crisis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/07/rick-perrys-call-to-prayer | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ewen | last=MacAskill | title=Rick Perry's call to prayer draws crowd of 30,000 | date=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His entry on August 14, 2011, garnered tremendous publicity and made him an instant top-tier candidate.

Perry's campaign focused on themes of economic recovery. Touting his record as governor of Texas, he pointed to the 1 million jobs that were created during his 10-year tenure. The Associated Press found Perry to be a confident, personable campaigner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Philip|last=Elliott|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2015946030_apusperryroadshow.html|title=Perry exudes confidence, swagger on campaign trail|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|agency=Associated Press|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Perry's first day of campaigning, he stated, &quot;I respect all the other candidates in the field but there is no one that can stand toe-to-toe with us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/08/15/ap-interview-perry-calls-jobs-record-big-plus/|title=AP Interview: Perry calls jobs record a big plus|publisher=Fox News|agency=Associated Press|date=August 15, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even his critics consistently complimented his good-spirited personality and tireless campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2011/07/16/texas-perry-starting-to-feel-called-to-run-for-president/|title=Texas' Rick Perry starting to feel 'called' to run for president|first=Jason|last=Clayworth|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of Perry began almost the moment he entered the race. His connection to Texan cowboy culture and his Southern drawl sounded similar to George W.

{{main|United States presidential election, 2012 timeline}}

===Guidelines for primary and caucus dates===
Based on a temporary committee's proposal, the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC) adopted new rules for the timing of elections on August 6, 2010 with 103 votes in favor out of 144.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/06/gop-approves-changes-to-2_n_673771.html |title=GOP Approves Changes To 2012 Primary Calendar |work=The Huffington Post |agency=Associated Press |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this plan, elections for delegates to the national convention were to be divided into three periods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gop.com/images/legal/2008_RULES_Adopted.pdf |title=The Rules of the Republican Party |date=August 6, 2010 |publisher=Republican National Committee |accessdate=October 3, 2011 |pages=18â19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*February 1 â March 5, 2012: Contests of traditional early states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina
*March 6 â March 31, 2012: Contests that proportionally allocate delegates
*April 1, 2012 and onward: All other contests including winner-take-all elections

By the fall of 2011, several states scheduled contests contravening this plan, pushing the primary calendar into January. These contests are in violation of RNC rules, with New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida, Arizona, and Michigan set to be penalized with a loss of half of their delegates. As they are holding non-binding caucuses, Iowa, Colorado, Maine and Minnesota will not be automatically penalized, as their contests to bind national delegates are made later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63722.html |title=GOP presidential calendar threatened by rogue states |first=Alexander |last=Burns |work=Politico |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
