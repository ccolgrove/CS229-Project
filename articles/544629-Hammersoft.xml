'''Vale Canada Limited''' (formerly '''Vale Inco''', '''CVRD Inco''' and '''Inco Limited'''; for corporate branding purposes simply known as &quot;Vale&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2007-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a  wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Brazil]]ian mining company [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]]. It is Vale's nickel mining and metals division and is headquartered in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  It produces nickel, copper, [[cobalt]], [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], [[ruthenium]], [[iridium]], gold, and silver. Prior to being purchased by CVRD (now Vale) in 2006, '''Inco''' was the world's second largest producer of nickel, and the third largest mining company outside South Africa and Russia of [[platinum group]] metals.  It was also a charter member of the 30-stock [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] formed on October 1, 1928.

==Pre-Vale history==
[[Image:Logo Inco.png|thumb|200px|The logo of Inco Limited and CVRD Inco, prior to CVRD's rebranding as Vale on 29 November 2007]]
The '''Canadian Copper Company''' was founded following the discovery of copper deposits in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Initially, ore was shipped for smelting to a plant in [[Constable Hook, New Jersey|Constable Hook]], New Jersey, owned by the Orford Copper Company.  Processing soon revealed that the ore was also rich in nickel and exploration tests revealed an enormous potential. In 1902 the '''International Nickel Company, Ltd.''' was created in New York, NY (as per Vale website and advertisements) as a joint venture between Canadian Copper, Orford Copper, and [[Joseph Wharton#Nickel manufacture|American Nickel Works]].  In 1916, the International Nickel Company of Canada, Ltd. was incorporated as the operating company in [[Copper Cliff, Ontario|Copper Cliff]] near Sudbury, and in 1918 the company built a new refinery in [[Port Colborne, Ontario|Port Colborne]]. The International Nickel Company of Canada, Ltd., first began using the trade name Inco in 1919.

In 1929, the corporation underwent a major expansion by absorbing the British-owned [[Mond Nickel Company]].  A head office was established in Toronto.  During World War II, Inco's [[Frood Mine]] produced 40% of the nickel used in [[artillery]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  Inco also maintained a machining plant located in Sterling Forest, NY.  The Sterling Forest Site was sold and is now owned and occupied by [[International Business Machines]].  In 1972 the [[Inco Superstack]] was built in Sudbury. In 1976, the companyâs name was officially changed to Inco Limited.

In order to generate cash Inco sold its manufacturing sites of nickel alloys to [[Special Metals Corporation]] in 1998. Special Metals Corporation however filed [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] in March 2002.

==Takeovers (2005â2006)==
On October 11, 2005, Inco announced a friendly takeover bid to buy out the operations of longtime rival [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge]] for $12 billion.  If approved, the deal would have made Inco the world's largest producer of nickel.  [[Xstrata]] (which already owned ~20% of Falconbridge shares) subsequently submitted a [[hostile takeover]] bid for Falconbridge, resulting in a bidding war between Inco and Xstrata.  The Xstrata bid was successful, but not before Falconbridge employed a [[poison pill]] to delay the acquisition, raising its share price from $28 to $62.50 in the meantime.

[[Teck Cominco]] submitted a hostile takeover bid to purchase Inco on May 8, 2006 for $16 billion if it agreed to abandon its takeover of Falconbridge. On June 26 of the same year, [[Phelps Dodge]] submitted a friendly takeover bid to purchase a combined Inco and Falconbridge for around $40 billion; that offer was also withdrawn because of the failure of the Inco-Falconbridge merger.

[[Image:Hdr inner cvrd inco logo.png|thumb|Transitional &quot;Vale Inco&quot; logo]]On August 14, 2006 Brazilian mining company CVRD extended an all-cash offer to buy Inco for $17 billion. That offer received approval from the Canadian government's investment review agency on October 19, and was accepted by Inco shareholders on October 23. Part of the takeover deal was that CVRD would operate Inco as a separate nickel mining division; all of CVRD's nickel operations, including mines at [[Onca Puma]] and [[Vermelho]] in Brazil, were transferred to Inco's management. Inco was delisted from the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] on November 16, 2006 and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange|TSX]] on January 5, 2007. According to its current web site, Inco is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Vale (formerly CVRD). Vale has since changed the name of Vale-Inco to simply Vale, stating the change is &quot;a milestone that aligns it more fully with other Vale operations worldwide and reflects its position as part of the worldâs second largest mining company&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://valeinconegotiations.com/2010/05/vale-inco-announces-name-change-to-vale&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2006 Inco was removed from the [[FTSE4Good Index]] for failing to meet their human rights criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Labour relations==
Employees for Inco in Canada are represented by the [[United Steelworkers]] throughout all the mergers.  Because of the mergers the [[United Steelworkers]] signed an agreement with all the unions that represent mining workers in countries where Vale/Inco operate to â...work together cooperatively and strategically as global partners, to build the bargaining power of workersâ&lt;ref&gt;United Steelworkers. Steelworkers and Global Union Partners Announce Unity Accord. March 20, 2007. Available at http://www.usw.ca/program/content/3964.php?lan=en&lt;/ref&gt;  The unions include [[ConfederaÃ§Ã£o Nacional dos Trabalhadores no Setor Minera]], [[SINTICIM]], [[Union syndicale des ouvriers et employÃ©s de Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie]], [[Union des Syndicats des Travailleurs Kanak et ExploitÃ©s]], [[Fagforbundet for Industri og Energi]], [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]], and the [[United Steelworkers]].
