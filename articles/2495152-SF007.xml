'''Secure Web SmartFilter EDU''', formerly known as '''Bess''', is a brand of [[content-control software]] made by [[Secure Computing Corporation]], which acquired maker [[N2H2]] in 2003; it is usually used in libraries and schools.  The main purpose of the system is as an Internet filter, blocking minors using the public computers from accessing web content deemed inappropriate by the Secure Web SmartFilter EDU manufacturers or local administration.  The system is not installed locally (on each individual [[computer workstation]]), but installs on the [[Server (computing)|server]] between the users and the open [[Internet]].  This feature makes it harder to bypass, though it is not uncommon for students with more extensive computer knowledge to attempt to bypass the system.

The system is compliant with the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]].  Like other similar filters, Secure Web SmartFilter EDU has come under attack for unnecessarily impeding school research ([[false positive]]s), being too aggressive in its filtering procedures or not being aggressive enough in its filtering procedures. Other critics believe that the imposition of Internet filtering software without the consent of the user constitutes a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].
