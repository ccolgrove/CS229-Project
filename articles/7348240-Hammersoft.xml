The '''Tehran derby''' ({{lang-fa|Ø´ÙØ±Ø¢ÙØ±Ø¯ ØªÙØ±Ø§Ù}}) known locally as the '''derby Tehran''' is a [[Association football|football]] [[local derby]] match that takes place twice a year between the two most popular clubs in [[Iran]]: [[Esteghlal F.C.]] and [[Persepolis F.C.]]
This match was declared as the most important derby in Asia and 22nd most important derby in the world in June 2008 by [[World Soccer (magazine)|''World Soccer'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[File:AliParvin.jpg|thumb|[[Ali Parvin]]]]
The first derby match between the teams took place on April 5, 1968, at [[Shiroudi Stadium|Amjadieh Stadium]], where the game finished as a scoreless draw. At the time, Esteghlal was known as Taj FC. Both clubs were relatively young but Persepolis had a solid fan base, because of its close association to the once popular [[Shahin FC|Shahin]] club. The rivalry between Shahin and Taj was transferred to its current stage when the Shahin club had to cease operations due to poor relations with the [[IRIFF|IFF]].

[[File:NasserHejaziWC1978.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nasser Hejazi]]]]
Over time, the rivalry became more heated and club fans began attaining collective identities. By the mid-1970s Persepolis was seen as a working class club, while Taj was viewed as a club close to the ruling establishment and supported by the upper class of Iranian society. Persepolis fans outnumbered Esteghlal fans by large numbers at the time and still do.

Because of the sensitive nature of the matches, fan violence has occurred several times. In minor cases fans break chairs or throw garbage at the field, but more notable cases of violence have involved physical fights between opposing teams and fans, storming of the field by fans, as well as significant destruction of public property.

Ever since 1995, federation officials have invited foreign [[Referee (association football)|referees]] to officiate the game to ease fan and player suspicions of referee bias. This occurred after the events of the 38th derby (see below).

[[Azadi Stadium]] has been the stadium where most of the matches took place, but Amjadieh Stadium(now Shiroudi) in Tehran, Azadi Stadium in [[Bandar Abbas]] and [[Yadegare Imam Stadium]] in [[Tabriz]] have all hosted the game at least once.

==Notable derby matches==
* '''Persepolis 0 - Taj 3''' (February 6, 1970) - The game score was 1-0 in favor of Taj until the 82nd minute when the Persepolis players left the field to protest against the match officials. The football federation later declared Taj the winner by a score of 3-0.

* '''Persepolis 0 - Taj 3''' (January 17, 1971) - The game  was tied 1-1 until the 75th minute when the Persepolis players left the field to protest against the match officials after several decisions went Esteghlal's way. The football federation later declared Taj the winner by a score of 3-0. This was the second time this occurred in two years.

* '''Persepolis 4 - Taj 1''' (November 15, 1972) - This was the first time Persepolis won the derby match. [[Mahmoud Khordbin]] and [[Safar Iranpak]] both scored one goal each and [[Hossein Kalani]] bagged the other two goals for a decisive 4-1 win.

* '''Persepolis 6 - Taj 0''' (September 7, 1973) - In a game that is still remembered to this day, Persepolis scored 6 goals to win the match with a hat-trick from [[Homayoun Behzadi]](50,86,92) and three more goals from Soleymani(45,56) and H.Kalani(32). the game to this date, is still the highest scoring affair between the two teams.

* '''Esteghlal 1 - Persepolis 0''' (October 7, 1983) - Iranian television broadcaster [[IRIB]] did not air the match so a large number of fans flocked to Azadi Stadium. An estimated 128,000 entered the 100,000-capacity stadium. So many fans were in attendance that some were forced to climb the metal base of the stadium floodlights. None of the derby matches to this date have had a higher attendance and mostly likely never will as the 2002 renovations of the stadium reduced its capacity.

* '''Esteghlal 0 (2) - Persepolis 0 (4)''' (February 1989) - This is one of few times the two clubs have met each other in the [[Hazfi Cup]]. The match finished scoreless in regulation time, and extra-time was eventless. Persepolis beat Esteghlal 4-2 in penalty shootouts to advance to the next stage in the Hazfi Cup.

* '''Esteghlal 3 - Persepolis  0''' (January 11, 1995) - In the 38th derby Persepolis was leading in the match by a score of 2-0 until the last 10 minutes of the match. Esteghlal scored 2 goals in quick succession, including one which was a penalty. This angered the Persepolis fans and players who felt the referee was biased towards Esteghlal. Persepolis fans stormed the field, and many fights broke out on the pitch between fans and players. After this match it was decided that Iranian referees will no longer be used for the derby.
[[File:ÙØ±Ø²Ø´Ú¯Ø§Ù Ø¢Ø²Ø§Ø¯Û Ø¯Ø± Ø³Ø§ÛÙ.JPG|thumb|left]]

* '''Persepolis 2 - Esteghlal 2''' (December 29, 2000) - One of the most exciting and heated matches in derby history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The game was extremely sensitive as [[Mehdi Hasheminasab]] had left Persepolis in the off-season for Esteghlal. [[Behrouz Rahbarifar]] opened up the scoring in minute 56, while [[Mohammad Navazi]] tied the game up at the 67th minute. Many thought the game would be over when Hasheminasab scored a late goal at minute 86, but [[Ali Karimi]] saved Persepolis scoring a goal at minute 89 to please the red fans. During the game Esteghlal's goalkeeper [[Parviz Broumand]] and Persepolis striker [[Payan Rafat]] were constantly insulting each other. This eventually led to Broumand punching Rafat in the face and giving him a black eye. A massive fight broke out between the players. After the match hooligans went on a rampage. They completely destroyed 250 city buses and damaged many shops.  Three players from each side were arrested along with 60 fans for their behavior.

*'''Esteghlal 3 â Persepolis 2''' (February 25, 2005) â Another one of the most thrilling matches in derby history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} After a scoreless draw at halftime Esteghlal opened the scoreline 53 minutes with a goal from [[Reza Enayati]]. Persepolis responded by two goals [[Sheys Rezaei]] in the 67th minute and another by [[Sohrab Entezari]] in the 84th minute. Persepolis players and fans believed they have earned the win and Esteghlal fans begin to leave the stadium. Shortly after the goal by Entezari [[Mahmoud Fekri]] scored an equalizer just 3 minutes later. Esteghlal soon put everything they have into the attack and in the 93rd minute it paid off with a header by [[Pirouz Ghorbani]] hitting the back of the Persepolis net.

* '''Persepolis 2 - Esteghlal 1''' (November 3, 2006) - One of the most important derby matches for the two teams. Both teams' chances of winning the league were very unlikely so the two desperately wanted to win so one would finish above the other. [[Amir Hossein Sadeghi]] broke the deadlock with a header in the 16th minute to make it 1-0 to Esteghlal. Six minutes later, Esteghlal goalkeeper [[Mehdi Rahmati]] charged out of his goal to clear the ball for a corner to Persepolis. However, he lost his concentration and took a long time to return back to his net resulting into [[Mehrzad Madanchi]] curling one in for Persepolis from the corner of the pitch and making the score 1-1 at half-time. The match was very open in the second half and finally in the 71st minute, [[Mehrdad Oladi]] broke through and chipped [[Mehdi Rahmati]] to win the game for Persepolis 2-1. Later on that season, Persepolis finished 3rd in the league, one place above Esteghlal who finished 4th.

* '''Esteghlal 1 - Persepolis 1''' (February 13, 2009) - Going into this derby the four previous meetings between the rivals had ended in 1-1 draws. However all the speculations regarding possible match-fixing started after this game. Esteghlal was winning the game when substitute [[Ali Alizadeh]] late into stoppage time and what did look deliberately played a handball and gifted away a penalty-kick. [[Maziar Zare]] scored the equalizer and the game finished in yet another 1-1 draw.

* '''Persepolis 2 - Esteghlal 1''' (February 3, 2010) - Before this derby six straight derby games between the two had finished 1-1. Many fans{{Who|date=November 2010}} were claiming that the matches had been fixed to avoid having a losing team. Both teams have been having the same owner, a fact that obviously adds fuel to the fire. Prior to this game the two teams had had a several-year-long tradition of eating dinner together on the day before the games, a tradition which did not take place ahead of this very tense game. Much to many fans' expectations this game was also about to end in a 1-1 draw before [[Karim Bagheri]] late in the game scored a 2-1 winner from long range.

* '''Esteghlal 1 - Persepolis 0''' (October 15, 2010) - The match was tied late in the game when Esteghlal got a counter attack and captain [[Farhad Majidi]] scored the winning goal in the 91st minute.

[[File:Tehran Derby, 16 September 2011.jpg|thumb|71st Tehran derby, 16 September 2011]]
* ''' Esteghlal 2 - Persepolis 0''' (September 16, 2011) - Esteghlal defeated their rivals for the third time in a row with goals from Majidi(15) and Jabbari(87). This was also the first derby with more than a one goal margin in over 10 years

==Playing for both teams==
Over the years, a number of players have played for both of the heavily supported clubs. Switching sides often angers fans, and players who have done so are heavily booed and mocked in and out of the stadium. When Mehdi Hasheminasab joined Esteghlal, Persepolis fans booed and swore at him so loudly that he covered his face with his hands to hide his tears.
