==Aboriginal==

The University of Manitoba provides services to urban Aboriginal people. The University of Manitoba Native Studies summer course brings first-year Aboriginal students to campus before the start of the school year for some campus orientation. Aboriginal Elders are present on campus at University of Manitoba to provide social supports. Dedicated tutoring services are available within the University of Manitobaâs Medicine, Engineering and Social Work ACCESS Programs. The University of Manitoba reaches into Aboriginal communities to talk to potential students at a much younger age through Curry Biz Camp, which fosters entrepreneurship among young [[First Nations]] and [[MÃ©tis people (Canada)|MÃ©tis]] students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mendelson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/cms-filesystem-action?file=pdfs/conferences/2007/aboriginal-rt-spring-report.pdf|format=PDF|title = The Aboriginal University Education Roundtable May 24, 2007 The University of Winnipeg |accessdate = 2008-05-31|last = Mendelson|first = Michael &amp; Alex Usher|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Early history ===

The University of Manitoba is a non-denominational university, founded by Alexander Morris, that received a charter on February 28, 1877. It officially opened on June 20, 1877 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to confer degrees on students graduating from its three founding colleges -  [[CollÃ¨ge universitaire de Saint-Boniface|St. Boniface College]] ([[Roman Catholic]]/[[Francophone]]), [[St. John's College, University of Manitoba|St John's College]] ([[Anglican]]) and [[Manitoba College]] ([[Presbyterian]]). The University of Manitoba granted its first degrees in 1880.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm |title = The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate = 2008-06-15}}
PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003528&lt;/ref&gt; The University was the first to be established in western Canada. [[Alan Beddoe]] designed the university coats of arms.&lt;ref&gt;http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2010-03-07T21%3A52%3A20Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=104827&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Apam Alan Beddoe collection at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

The University has since added a number of colleges to its corporate and associative body. In 1882 the Manitoba Medical College, which had originally been founded by practising physicians and surgeons, became a part of the University. Charles Henry Wheeler (architect) designed the 
Bacteriological Research Building (1897), part of the Manitoba Medical College.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/352 Charles Henry Wheeler (architect)&lt;/ref&gt; George Creeford Browne (architect) designed the Science Building, 1899-1900.&lt;ref&gt; http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1223 George Creeford Browne (architect) &lt;/ref&gt; 

Other colleges followed:

* Methodist Church's [[Wesley College, Winnipeg|Wesley College]] in 1888 &lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm |title = The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate = 2008-06-15}}PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008242&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manitoba College of Pharmacy]] in 1902
* [[Manitoba Agriculture College]] in 1906
* [[St. Paul's College (Manitoba)|St. Paul's College]] in 1931
* [[Brandon College]] in 1938
* [[St. Andrew's College (Winnipeg)|St. Andrew's College]] in  1946

In 1901 the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] changed the University Act so that the university could do its own teaching, and in 1905 a building in downtown Winnipeg became its first teaching facility with a staff of six science professors. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a [[bicameral]] system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia2&quot;/&gt;

In the early part of the 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of [[theology]], law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a [[research thesis]] was introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia2&quot;/&gt;

The first school of [[architecture]] in western Canada was founded in 1919 at the University of Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm |title = The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate = 2008-06-15}}PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009565&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, the University of Manitoba was the largest university in the [[Canadian Prairies]] and the fifth largest in Canada. It had eight faculties: Arts, Science, Law, Medicine, Engineering, Architecture, Pharmacy, and Agriculture. It awarded the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc), [[Bachelor of Civil Engineering]] (BCE), [[Bachelor of Electrical Engineering]] (BEE), [[Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering]] (BME), [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (BArch), [[Bachelor of Pharmacy]] (PhmB), [[Bachelor of Science in Agriculture]] (BSA), [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] (MA), [[Master of Civil Engineering]] (MCE), [[Master of Electrical Engineering]] (MEE), [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD), and [[Doctor of Laws]] (LLD). It had 1,654 male students and 359 female students, and 184 academic staff, including 6 women.&lt;ref name=&quot;yearbook&quot;&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Manitoba Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was an affiliated college, the Manitoba Law School, which was founded jointly by the university and the [[Law Society of Manitoba]] in 1914. In 1920 it had 123 students, including 5 women, and 21 academic staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;yearbook&quot;/&gt; It became a full part of the university in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umanitoba.ca/Law/Introduction/ University of Manitoba Faculty of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University was originally located on Broadway. In 1929, following the addition of more programs, schools, and faculties, the University moved to its permanent site in [[Fort Garry, Manitoba]]. The University maintained the Broadway facilities for many years.
&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia1&quot;/&gt;

The University established an Evening institute in 1936.

St. Andrew's College, which originally trained the ministry for the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]], became an affiliated College in 1981. St. Andrew's College was the first [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]-language college opened by the [[Orthodox Church]] in North America. It is home to a large Ukrainian cultural and religious library.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia2&quot;/&gt; In 1967, two of the colleges that had been part of the University of Manitoba were given university status by the provincial government. United College, which had been formed by the merging of Wesley College and Manitoba College, became the [[University of Winnipeg]], and Brandon College became [[Brandon University]].

St. Boniface College and St. John's College, two of the founding colleges of the University, are still part of the University of Manitoba. St. Boniface College is the University's only [[French language]] college; it offers instruction in French and facilities for the training of teachers who expect to teach in the French language. St. John's College, which dates back to 1820, offers instruction in Arts and Science and, among other special programs, prepares men and women for the ordained ministry of the Anglican Church.

Thirty-three of the many buildings on the Fort Garry campus of the University of Manitoba are used directly for teaching. Four of these are colleges: St. John's College, St. Paul's College, St. Andrew's College, and University College. The remaining buildings contain laboratories, administrative and service offices, residences, or are the property of research agencies.

In a typical year, the university has an enrolment of approximately 27,000 students - 24,000 undergraduate and 3,000 graduate. The university offers more than 90 degrees, more than 60 at the undergraduate level. Most academic units offer graduate studies programs leading to masterâs or doctoral degrees.

In 2007-08, the university acquired more than $150 million in research income. The university currently holds 48 Canada Research Chairs and is either home to or a partner in 37 research centres, institutes and shared facilities. These centres foster collaborative research and scholarship.

The University of Manitoba is the network leader of ISIS Canada (Intelligent Sensing for Innovative Structures), headquartered in the Faculty of Engineering. ISIS Canada is a National Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE) developing better ways to build, repair and monitor civil structures. The University is also an active member in 13 other NCEs.
