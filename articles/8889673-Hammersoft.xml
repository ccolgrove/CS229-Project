'''Operation ''Pawan''''' was the codename assigned to the operation by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) to take control of [[Jaffna]] from the [[LTTE]] (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, better known as the Tamil Tigers), in late 1987 to enforce the disarmament of the LTTE as a part of the [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]]. In brutal fighting lasting about three weeks, the IPKF took control of the [[Jaffna]] Peninsula from the LTTE, something that the Sri Lankan army had tried and failed to achieve for several years. Supported by Indian Army tanks, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, the IPKF routed the LTTE, at the cost of 214 soldiers.&lt;ref name= BS&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter03.html '''Operation Pawan. The Battle for Jaffna'''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 4 October 1987, the [[Sri Lankan Navy]] captured an LTTE boat off [[Point Pedro]] with seventeen Tigers, including some high-profile leaders of the movement, onboard.&lt;ref name= UTHR&gt;[http://www.uthr.org/BP/volume2/Chapter1.htm '''Background to the Breakdown of the Accord.''' University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna), Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt; The Colombo government alleged the boat was involved in smuggling arms across the [[Palk Strait]] and on these grounds denied immunity to the captured Tiger rebels.&lt;ref name= UTHR/&gt; The LTTE denied this, claiming the rebels' movements were in accordance with the truce, being in the process of transferring documents for shifting the Tigers Headquarters from [[Madras]] to Jaffna. The Sri Lankan government intended to bring a number of the rebels captured, including [[Pulendran]], [[Kumarappa]] and others, to trial in Colombo for allegedly masterminding the massacre of a hundred and fifty civilians.&lt;ref name= UTHR/&gt;

The Tigers, who were at the time still in negotiations with the Indian authorities, appealed for enforcement of protection by the IPKF. The rebels were at this time in IPKF custody at [[Palay]] Airbase pending transfer to the Sri Lankan authorities. Although the Indian authorities insist that they had explained the possible repercussions&lt;ref name= GenHK&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/31lanka.htm '''Shoot Prabhakaran, shoot Mahathiah!'''. Gen Harikat Singh speaking to Josy Joseph on the IPKF role. rediff.com]&lt;/ref&gt; of such an action on the fragile truce and exerted considerable pressure on the Sri Lankan authorities to desist from proceeding,&lt;ref name=UTHR/&gt; the IPKF ultimately withdrew, allowing the Sri Lankan forces to proceed with transferring the captured rebels to Colombo. However, the detainees attempted [[mass suicide]] by [[1987 Mass Suicide of Tamil Tigers|swallowing cyanide]]âa common LTTE practice when faced with imminent capture. This singular event marked a total break-down of the truce. The night of 5 October saw the large scale slaughter of Sinhalese people who had returned to Jaffna,&lt;ref name=UTHR/&gt; including eight soldiers of the Sri Lankan Army who were at the time being held hostage by the LTTE. This coincided with armed confrontations between the Tiger Cadres and the Indian troops in and around Jaffna.&lt;ref name= UTHR/&gt;

On 8 October, the LTTE carried out a number of mortar attacks and ambushes on the IPKF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamil Armed Resistance &amp; the Law&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Tamil Armed Resistance &amp; the Law |url=http://www.tamilnation.org/tamileelam/armedstruggle/ipkf.htm |publisher=Tamil Nation |date=Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of this detoriating situation, President Jayawardene threatened the visiting [[Defence Minister of India|Indian Defence Minister]] and the [[Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army|Chief of the Army Staff]] with re-deploying the Sri Lankan Army to protect Sinhala interests if the IPKF did not take action against the LTTE. The Indian government, already accused of inaction in the face of a failing accord, was compelled to imposing peace in Jaffna by force.&lt;ref name=UTHR/&gt;&lt;ref name=JC8&gt;[http://www.tamilnation.org/intframe/india/jaincommission/indo_sri_lanka_agreement/ch2sec8.html '''Jain Commission Interim Report. Indo-Sri Lankan Agreement: Evolution and its Aftermath. Chapter II - Indian Peace Keeping Force.''' Sourced from Tamil Nation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation ''Pawan''==
By 7 October, the Chief of Army Staff (CoAS), had issued directives to the IPKF, laying down its operational parameters.&lt;ref name=JC8/&gt; It was to: 

*Seize/destroy LTTE radio and TV transmission equipment in the Jaffna Peninsula
*Seize or jam the LTTE communications network
*Carry out raids on LTTE camps, caches and strongpoints
*Detaine and interrogate personnel manning LTTE offices in the East to gain information. In case of resistance, force to be used
*Actions to further consolidate the hold of the IPKF in the region

It was declared on 9 October that the IPKF was to launch a final campaign against the LTTE.&lt;ref name=JC8/&gt; This was the point of no return.

The first IPKF operation was launched on 9 October 1987. Codenamed Operation ''Pawan'' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]] for Wind), it was expected to neutralise the LTTE operational capability in and around Jaffna. This included the capture or neutralisation of the LTTE's chain of command&lt;ref name=rediffintHK&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/news/2000/apr/01lanka.htm '''Nobody sounded even a Last Post for our dead in Colombo.''' Gen Harikat Singh to Josy Joseph. rediff.com]&lt;/ref&gt; which was expected to leave the rebel movement directionless in the face of the impending assault on the LTTE strongholds by the IPKF.

On the nights of 9 and 10 October, the IPKF raided and captured the LTTE radio station at Tavadi and TV station at [[Kokkuvil]], while the printing presses of two LTTE sponsored newspapers were destroyed.&lt;ref name=JC8/&gt; These operations also led to the capture of nearly two hundred Tiger rebels.&lt;ref name=BSAAD&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1987IPKF/Chapter2.html Accord, Airlift, and Discord. Bharat-rakshak.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, the LTTE ambushed a [[CRPF]] (Central Reserve Police Force) convoy near Tellipallai, killing four Jawans, as well as an IPKF post at Tellipallai with automatic weapons and mortar fire on an IPKF post. Later that day, the Tigers hijacked a 10 Para Commando jeep on patrol, killing all five occupants.&lt;ref name=JC8/&gt;

On 10 October, the Indian 91st Brigade, consisting of three battalions and led by Brigadier J. Ralli, also began its push into Jaffna.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter03.html '''Operation Pawan- The Battle for Jaffna.'''

(Winter, 1988-1989), pp. 603-619.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Jaffna University Helidrop===
{{Main|Jaffna University Helidrop}}
The first battle signalling the real beginning of Operation ''Pawan'' was the [[Jaffna University Helidrop|Heliborne assault]] on the Jaffna University headquarters of the LTTE by a detachment of Indian  [[Para Commandos]] and [[Sikh LI]] (Light Infantry) on the night of 12 October. This was planned as a quick commando raid to capture the top LTTE leadership and local commanders who, according to Indian Intelligence, were supposed to be in the building at the time;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamil Armed Resistance &amp; the Law&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=BSJUHD&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1987IPKF/Chapter3.html '''Descent Into Danger. The Jaffna University Helidrop'''. Bharat-rakshak.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and was thus expected to cut short the Battle for Jaffna. The plan was to land a company of 70 men from 10 Para Cdo. to secure the football field. A second wave was to follow with a company of the 13th Sikh LI. The heliborne troops were to link up with 4/[[5 Gorkhas]] of 72 Brigade and the Sikh LI troops advancing on the ground.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt;

The operation ended in disaster as the LTTE, having intercepted IPKF radio transmissions, set up an ambush. The helidropped troops came under intense fire from LTTE positions, forcing the [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] helicopters to abandon the insertion midway through the operation. During the ensuing battle, which lasted throughout the night, twenty nine of the entire Sikh LI contingent of thirty troops, and six of the one hundred and twenty commandos, were killed before detachments of the 65th Armoured Regiment were able to extract the Paras from their defensive positions.&lt;ref name= BS/&gt; The Sikh LI's [[radioman]] was shot by LTTE snipers early on, the unit lost contact with the Indian High Command at [[Palay]] [[Air base]]. The sole survivor of the Sikh LI detachment, [[Sepoy Gora Singh]], was taken prisoner by the Tigers under the command of Pawan Kashyap. It was not until his subsequent release during the conflict that the fate of the unit was known.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamil Armed Resistance &amp; the Law&quot;/&gt;

===Battle for Jaffna===
As the battle for Jaffna progressed, the IPKF advance came under intense and vicious opposition from the Tigers. Fighting in built-up and an as-yet unevacuated Jaffna, the Indian High command insists that the slow advance was, in addition to Tiger resistance, more a result of reluctance on the part of the IPKF to use heavy weaponry to clear LTTE defences.&lt;ref name=Dagmar/&gt; Furthermore, all the approach roads had been laced with Claymore mines or explosives by the Tigers in its years of fighting with the Sri Lankan army.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt; The Tigers also made extensive use of [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s (improvised explosive devices)&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt; which could be remotely detonated from over a kilometre away. During this time, Eastern Command of the [[Indian Navy]], supported by the [[Indian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] was key in establishing a {{convert|300|mi|km}} long blockade around northern Sri Lanka from October 1987 to disrupt the Tigers' supply and communication routes.&lt;ref name= Navy&gt;[http://indiannavy.nic.in/pawan.htm '''Operation Pawan'''. Indian Navy.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was at about this time that the [[MARCOS (India)|MARCOS]] forces (Marine commandos) of the Indian Navy first went into action. Detachments of the IMSF (Indian Marine Special Forces, as the MARCOS was then known), along with a battalion of the 340th Independent Brigade of the [[Indian Army]], provided beach [[reconnaissance]] around Jaffna and [[Batticaloa]].&lt;ref name=SpecOps&gt;[http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/India/MCF.htm India.'''Marine Commando Force.'''Special Operations.Com.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The 340th Brigade was one of the first IPKF units to be deployed, and served until operations in the [[Trincomalee]] area were complete. The IMSF, at this time, also provided security patrols along the coast road west of Jaffna until the 41st Brigade took charge in November.&lt;ref name=SpecOps/&gt;

On October 15/16, the IPKF advance stopped its advance to stabilize the front. Palay, the major operations headquarters for the 54th Infantry Division, was also secured from Tiger attacks. At this time the [[Indian Air Force]] undertook a massive airlift to reinforce the 91st with three brigades and heavy equipment, including [[T-72]] tanks and [[BMP-1|BMP-1 fighting vehicles]]. Air traffic controllers worked round the clock to fly-in troops and equipment. In addition, [[Indian Airlines]] is said to have contributed, with its [[Boeing 737]]s transporting troops.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt; This short interval also saw the introduction of [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] medium helicopters and the first use of the [[Mi-25]] gunships of [[No. 125 Sqn]], along with [[HAL Cheetah]] light helicopters. By end of October the IAF had flown 2200 tactical transport and 800 helicopter sorties.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt;

Now reinforced, the IPKF resumed the battle for Jaffna. The tanks and armoured fighting vehicles are said to have been effective protection against [[anti-personnel mine]]s.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt; However, even with this defence, the IPKF advance was torturous in the face of the Tigers' sniper fire. They would take-up positions on rooftops, in trees and even in [[coconut]] [[Arecaceae|palm]]s. Equipped with powerful [[Telescopic sight|telescopic infra-red sight]]s, they were able to selectively take out officers and radiomen, taking a heavy toll and bringing the advance to a grinding halt. Helicopters flying below 2000 feet were also vulnerable, with at least five being shot at and damaged before the Mi-25s took up their offensive role. The IPKF adapted quickly, with its officers taking off the [[pip]]s  of their  ranks, wearing [[slouch hat]]s and carrying oversize back packs. However, as the advance got bogged down, the battalions, instead of maneuvering around the defenders, were forced to commit more troops under orders from [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt;  In addition, the LTTE increasingly began to deploy [[anti-tank mine]]s, taking a further heavy toll on IPKF forces. A frustrated IPKF cut off the power to Jaffna in an attempt to counter this.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt; IPKF communication lines were extensively mined by the LTTE, which further compounded the sometimes perilous situations that the Indian troops faced. It was not before the IMSF commandos broke out of the besieged Jaffna port and cleared the heavily mined Navanturai Coastal Road, that a crucial link-up between 1 [[Maratha Light Infantry]] in Jaffna fort and the advancing troops of 41st Brigade could be established that secured the Nallur area.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt; On 21 October, the commandos conducted a successful amphibious raid against a LTTE base at [[Guru Nagar]].&lt;ref name=SpecOps/&gt; It was also toward the end of the Jaffna campaign that the IPKF started the use of Mi-25s for close air support&lt;ref name=BS125&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1987IPKF/Chapter5.html '''Crocodiles into the Attack.'''No. 125 Helicopter Squadron. Bharat-rakshak.com]&lt;/ref&gt; when they flew against LTTE positions in Chavakacheri village on 23 October 1987.

===Culmination===
Ultimately however, after two weeks of bitter fighting, the IPKF had wrested control of Jaffna and other major cities from the LTTE, but operations were to continue well into November, with major operations coming to an end with the fall of Jaffna Fort on 28 November.&lt;ref name=Dagmar/&gt; Throughout the duration of Operation ''Pawan'', the casualties suffered by the IPKF had been put at varying numbers between 600 &lt;ref name= dixitrediff&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/24lanka.htm '''J N Dixit''' (ex-Indian Ambassador to Colombo) speaking to Rediff.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,200.{{ref|1}}{{ref|2}} In addition to the LTTE's defensive operations alluded to above, the IPKF's problems were compounded by the fact that the Tigers, using classic [[guerrilla]] tactics, blended in with the local population. The IPKF also came face-to- face with [[child soldier]]s of the LTTE, something it had not expected.&lt;ref name=BSOPPAW/&gt;

This was only the beginning of the IPKF's three year campaign to neutralise the LTTE. By the time Jaffna fell, the LTTE had merely exfiltrated out of the town, moving south to the jungles of [[Vavuniya]]. Its hard core fighters moved to the safety of the jungle by skirting the Jaffna coast from Point Pedro to Elephant Pass, sheltered by the criss-cross of waterways in the impenetrable Nittkaikulam jungle. In the Jaffna sector, although the LTTE had shifted out of the town itself, it nevertheless harassed the 54th Division's efforts to consolidate its positions using IEDs and anti-personnel mines. In turn, the IPKF was able to disrupt the LTTE's activities with regular raids that led to the capture of large caches of rebel weaponry.&lt;ref name=BSJUNG/&gt; Brigadier Manjit Singh was later replaced by Brigadier JS Dhillon, under whom the 54th underwent considerable modifications of its operations routine. Small highly mobile units became the staple of the 54th's operations.&lt;ref name=BSJUNG/&gt;

The IPKF at this point still consisted mostly of an overstretched 54th Division. Following the Jaffna operation, the 36th Infantry Division, along with two additional brigades, took over the [[Vavuniya]] sector and the [[Trincomalee]]-[[Batticaloa]] axis. This relieved the 54th Division which, led by Brigadier Manjit Singh, could now focus on consolidating the Jaffna sector.&lt;ref name=BSJUNG&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter04.html '''Shifting to the Jungles.''' Bharat-rakshak.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th Mountain Division and the 57th Infantry Division were deployed still later in February 1988 to take charge of [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] and [[Batticaloa]] from the 36th.
