[[PokÃ©mon]] has 646 (as of [[PokÃ©mon Black and White|''PokÃ©mon Black'' and ''White'']]) distinctive fictional species classified as the titular PokÃ©mon. These creatures and entities reside throughout various locations of the fictional PokÃ©mon universe and can be caught by humans designated as [[PokÃ©mon Trainer]]s often using devices called [[PokÃ© Ball]]s. These trainers use PokÃ©mon for a variety of purposes, such as being pets and loyal companions and/or being pitted against other trained PokÃ©mon in competitive PokÃ©mon battles. PokÃ©mon are potentially super-powered creatures that can employ a variety of talents such as [[Pyrokinesis|generating fire or heat]], [[martial arts]], [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]], and so on. Through age and experience many of these species undergo a metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species in a process referred to as [[PokÃ©mon evolution]].

This is a selected listing of fifty-two of the PokÃ©mon species, arranged as they are in the main game series' [[PokÃ©dex|National PokÃ©dex]].
