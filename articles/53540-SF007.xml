A '''terminal emulator''', '''terminal application''', '''term''', or '''tty''' for short, is a program that emulates a video [[Computer terminal#Dumb_terminal|terminal]] within some other display architecture. 
Though typically synonymous with a command line [[shell (computing)|shell]] or [[text terminal]], the term ''terminal'' covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A terminal emulator inside a [[graphical user interface]] is often called a '''terminal window'''. 

A terminal window allows the user access to a text terminal and all its applications such as [[command line interface]]s (CLI) and [[text user interface]] applications. These may be running either on the same machine or on a different one via [[telnet]], [[Secure Shell|ssh]], or [[dial-up]]. On [[Unix-like]] operating systems it is common to have one or more terminal windows connected to the local machine.

Terminals usually support a set of [[escape sequences]] for controlling color, [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] position, etc. Examples include the family of terminal control sequence standards known as [[ECMA-48]], [[ANSI X3.64]] or [[ISO/IEC 6429]].

Early adopters of [[computer]] technology, such as banks, insurance companies, and governments, still make frequent use of terminal emulators. They typically have decades old applications running on [[mainframe computer]]s. The old [[Computer terminal#Dumb terminal|&quot;dumb&quot; video terminals]] used to access the mainframe are long since obsolete; however, applications on the mainframe are still in use. Quite often, terminal emulators are the only way a user can access applications running on these older machines.

== Local echo ==
{{main|echo (computing)#Terminal emulators}}
Terminal emulators may implement a [[echo (computing)|local echo]] function, which they may erroneously name &quot;half-duplex&quot; ([[duplex (telecommunications)|Half-duplex]] is different altogether), or slightly more correctly (albeit strictly still slightly incorrectly) &quot;echoplex&quot; (which is formally an error detection mechanism rather than an input display option).{{sfn|Daintith|2004|p=171}}{{sfn|Weik|2000|loc=&quot;echo&quot; p. 478}}{{sfn|Weik|2000|loc=&quot;echoplex&quot; p.479}}{{sfn|Weik|2000|loc=&quot;echoplex mode&quot; p. 479}}  For details of the local echo control mechanisms of terminal emulators, see the main article.

== Line-at-a-time mode/Local editing ==
{{main|terminal (telecommunication)#Modes}}
Terminal emulators may implement local editing, also known as &quot;line-at-a-time mode&quot;. This is also mistakenly referred to as &quot;half-duplex&quot;. In this mode, the terminal emulator only sends complete lines of input to the host system. The user enters and edits a line, but it is held locally within the terminal emulator as it is being edited and not transmitted until the user signals (usually with the {{keypress|return}} key on the keyboard or a &quot;send&quot; button of some sort on the user interface) the completion of the line. At that point the entire line is transmitted. Of course, line-at-a-time mode implies local echo, since otherwise the user will not be able to see the line as it is being edited and constructed.{{sfn|Daintith|2004|p=171}}{{sfn|Bangia|2010|p=324}}  However, line-at-a-time mode is independent of echo mode and does not ''require'' local echo.  When entering a password, for example, line-at-a-time entry with local editing is possible, but local echo should be turned off (otherwise the password would be displayed).{{sfn|Stevens|Wright|1994|p=413}}

The complexities of line-at-a-time mode are exemplified by the line-at-a-time mode option in the [[TELNET]] protocol. To implement it correctly for the user, the ''Network Virtual Terminal'' implementation, provided by the terminal emulator program, must be capable of recognizing and properly dealing with &quot;interrupt&quot; and &quot;abort&quot; events that arrive in the middle of locally editing a line.{{sfn|Miller|2009|p=590, 591}}

==Synchronous terminals==
{{original research|section|date=January 2011}}
In asychronous terminals data can flow in any direction at any time.  In '''synchronous terminals''' a protocol controls who may send data when. The [[IBM 3270]]-based terminals used with [[IBM]] [[mainframe computer]]s are an example of '''synchronous terminals'''. They operate in an essentially &quot;screen-at-a-time&quot; mode (also known as [[Block-oriented terminal|block mode]]). Users can make numerous changes to a page, before submitting the updated screen to the remote machine as a single action. This paradigm can be surprising to those used to the more common asynchronous terminal behaviour, though in fact it is conceptually quite similar to the submission of [[HTTP]] [[form (web)|form]]s on the [[World Wide Web|Web]].  &lt;!-- This is way off from the actual meaning of sync vs. async and borders on folklore --&gt;

Terminal emulators that simulate the original 3270 hardware terminal are available for most operating systems, for use both by those administering systems such as the [[System z9|z9]], as well as those using the corresponding applications such as [[CICS]].

Other examples of synchronous terminals include the [[IBM 5250]], and the [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] 7561.  The [[Honeywell Bull]] VIP7800 and [[Hewlett-Packard]] 700/92 terminals also had a block mode.

== Examples of terminals emulated ==
Many terminal emulators have been developed for terminals such as [[VT100]], [[VT220]], [[VT320]], [[IBM 3270|IBM 3270/8/9/E]], [[IBM 5250]], [[IBM 3179G]], [[Data General]] [[D211]], [[Hewlett Packard]] [[HP700/92]], [[Sperry/Unisys]] 2000-series [[Uniscope|UTS60]], [[Burroughs/Unisys]] A-series  T27/TD830/ET1100, [[Applied Digital Data Systems|ADDS]] ViewPoint, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] console, [[QNX]], AT386, SCO-ANSI, SNI 97801, [[Televideo]], and [[Wyse]] 50/60.  Additionally, programs have been developed to emulate terminals which are themselves programs, such as [[xterm]] and assorted console terminals (e.g., for [[Linux]]).  Finally, some emulations simply refer to a standard, such as [[ANSI escape code|ANSI]].  These programs are available on many platforms ranging from [[DOS]] and [[Unix]] to [[GUI]] operating systems such as Windows and Macs, to embedded operating systems found in cellphones and industrial hardware.
