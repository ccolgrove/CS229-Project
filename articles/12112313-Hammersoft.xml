'''TNQ''' is an [[Australian]] [[television station]], licensed to, and serving the regional areas of [[Queensland]]. The station is [[Owned-and-operated station|owned and operated]] by [[Southern Cross Ten]].

==History==
Southern Cross Ten in Queensland began in 1982 as ''North Queensland Television'', a partnership between two regional stations:
*'''TNQ-7 [[Townsville]]''' (launched on November 1, 1962)
*'''FNQ-10 [[Cairns]]''' (launched on September 7, 1966)

Their slogan was ''The Place to Be'', a slogan used by the station for over a decade up until 1993.

When [[Regional television in Australia#Aggregation|aggregation]] was announced, NQTV was planning to be the [[Nine Network]] affiliate when regional [[Queensland]] was aggregated in the late 1990s. NQTV had a write-in competition for their name and logo. The name '''QTV''' was chosen and because of the affiliation with the Nine Network, the Nine dots were placed on the logo (similar to [[WIN Television|WIN]] and [[NBN Television|NBN]]'s logos). Viewer response to the logo was unfavourable, so they changed the logo to one sent in from the competition{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. The station ran with a Nine Network-based identification package in the year leading up to aggregation.

However, the station faced a crisis in the days leading up to aggregation when [[WIN Television]] bought the [[Toowoomba]] and [[Rockhampton]]-based [[Star Television]], and switched the affiliation from Ten to Nine, in line with WIN's NSW station. This meant that QTV had to change its logo and affiliation in a hurry. QTV picked up the vacant Ten affiliation, and used the logo chosen from the competition{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. The station originally broadcast a licence-wide one hour bulletin when Queensland was aggregated, but this was soon axed outside the North Queensland television market.

The station's owners, [[Telecasters North Queensland]] (later [[Telecasters Australia]]), joined the [[Ten Group Consortium]] in 1992â1993. This led to a change from QTV to ''Ten Queensland'', and they began to use generic Ten branding.

In 2001, Telecasters was purchased by Southern Cross. In that same year, ''Ten Local News'' in North Queensland was axed (along with ''Ten Capital News'' in Canberra) and replaced with ''[[Ten News#News at Five#Brisbane|Ten News Queensland]]'' from Brisbane - one of the many decisions which led to the local news inquiry by the ABA. In 2002, like the other Southern Cross-owned Ten affiliates, the station was rebranded to ''Southern Cross Ten''.

==News &amp; Current Affairs==
[[Image:StateFocus.jpg|thumb|250px|Judi Hogan hosting ''State Focus'', a [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] program broadcast in Queensland by TNQ.]]
From the 1970s to late 1990s, the station maintained regional news coverage through its 5-30pm 30 minute local news and later its 6pm one-hour news bulletins. In the lead up to aggregation, with NQTV (which soon after became QTV) gearing up to become the Nine Network affiliate, the look and feel of the news was changed to match that of [[National Nine News]] and became known as ''QTV News'' in 1990.

This was however short lived, as the station was instead left with [[Network Ten]] affiliation due to [[WIN Television]] purchasing a rival station, which in turn took the Nine Network affiliation for the region. The news changed its look and feel to that of ''[[Ten News|Ten Eyewitness News]]'' and changed its name to ''QTV Eyewitness News''. Initially, it broadcast a licence-wide one hour bulletin when Queensland was aggregated, but due to low ratings, this was scaled back to north Queensland. In 1993, the news service became ''Ten North Queensland News'' after the station was rebranded as Ten Queensland.

In January 2000, Ten Queensland revamped its news format in response to viewer demand for more local news. The 6pm news bulletin was reduced to 30 minutes and became a solely regional news bulletin with the introduction of ''[[Ten News#Brisbane|Ten News Brisbane]]'' into North Queensland, and changed its name to ''Ten Local News'' to reflect the new format.

At the end of 2001, ''Ten Local News'' in North Queensland was finally axed by new owners [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] due to cost-cutting measures.

In 2004, news resurfaced on the station as three minute news updates throughout the day as ''Southern Cross Ten News''. Jana Black presents the news for Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Rockhampton with Stefanie Waclawik presenting the updates for the Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba and Bundaberg.

A local current affairs program, ''State Focus'', is shown at 8.30am on Sundays, presented by Peta Burton from the network's Canberra-based studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;focus&quot;&gt;{{cite web
