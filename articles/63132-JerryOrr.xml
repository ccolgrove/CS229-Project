Throughout his career, he has released two solo albums and eleven studio albums with his band, which to date have sold over 120 million albums worldwide.

In 2010, President Barack Obama named Jon Bon Jovi to the White House Council for Community Solutions.

As a solo artist, Bon Jovi has received numerous awards for his work, including a [[Golden Globe]] and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for his solo hit, &quot;[[Blaze of Glory (song)|Blaze of Glory]]&quot;. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities from [[Monmouth University]] in 2001. He campaigned for [[Al Gore]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]], [[John Kerry]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]], and [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 Presidential election]].

==Early life==
Jon Bon Jovi was born '''John Francis Bongiovi Jr.''' in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]], [[New Jersey]], the son of two former [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], barber John Francis Bongiovi, Sr. and florist [[Carol Sharkey]]. He has two brothers, Anthony and Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/18/Jon-Bon-Jovi.html Jon Bon Jovi biography (1962-)]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] and [[Slovaks|Slovak]] ancestry and his mother was of [[German American|German]] and [[Russian American|Russian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/jon-bon-jovi-how-i-became-a-poster-boy-for-marriage-68850.html Jon Bon Jovi: How I became a poster boy for marriage - Features, Unsorted - Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3670222/Jon-Bon-Jovi-New-hair-old-roots.html | location=London | title=Jon Bon Jovi: New hair, old roots | first=Roya | last=Nikkhah | date=December 30, 2007 | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that he is a blood relative of Frank Sinatra.&lt;ref&gt;''SPIN Magazine'', May 1998, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He spent summers in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], with his grandparents as a newspaper salesman.&lt;ref&gt;As he said when he came to a sold-out (over 15,000) Veterans Stadium in 1988&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, John attended [[St. Joseph High School (Metuchen, New Jersey)|St. Joseph High School]], in [[Metuchen, New Jersey]], during his freshman and sophomore years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www7.islandrecords.com/bonjovi/theband_jbj_speeches_ama.las Jon Bon Jovi remarks] [[American Music Awards]], November 14, 2004. &quot;In the fall of 1977, I was just another sophomore at St. Joseph's High School in New Jersey.&quot; {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to [[Sayreville War Memorial High School]] in [[Sayreville, New Jersey|Parlin]], [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebs.gmnews.com/news/2006/0323/Schools/054.html Bon Jovi pays surprise visit to his old school] Sentinel, March 23, 2006. &quot;Students chat with Sayreville class of '80 grad-turned-rock-star.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

John spent most of his adolescence skipping school to opt for music activities instead, and ended up playing in local bands with friends and his cousin [[Tony Bongiovi]], who owned the then famous New York recording studio, [[Avatar Studios|The Power Station]]. As a result, his academic records displayed poor grades. By the time he was 16, John Bongiovi was playing clubs. It was not long before he joined up with keyboardist [[David Bryan]] (real name: David Bryan Rashbaum), who played with him in a ten-piece rhythm and blues band called ''Atlantic City Expressway''. John also performed with bands called ''The Rest'', ''The Lechers'' and ''John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones''.

==Music career==
===Early career===
When he was seventeen, John was working sweeping floors at his cousin Tony Bongiovi's recording studio. In 1980, when [[Meco]] was there recording ''[[Christmas in the Stars|Christmas in the Stars: The Star Wars Christmas Album]]'', Bongiovi recommended Bon Jovi for the song &quot;[[R2-D2]] We Wish You A Merry [[Christmas]].&quot; This became his first professional recording (credited as John Bongiovi).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/meco2005-2.asp TheForce.Net - Jedi Council - Interviews | Meco]&lt;/ref&gt; He left in 1983 when he got a record deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q interview 08&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Ben | title=The Q Interview - Jon Bon Jovi  | newspaper =[[Q (magazine)|Q]] | pages =78â88  | date =2008-07-01 | url =  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bon Jovi recorded a song, ''Runaway'', one of a few songs John wrote during his bus travels from Sayreville to The Power Station. He went to several record companies, including [[Atlantic Records]] and [[PolyGram|Mercury (PolyGram)]], but they all turned him down.

He visited major rock station WAPP 103.5FM &quot;The Apple&quot; in New York City. He spoke directly to the promotion director John Lassman, who accepted the song &quot;Runaway&quot; for inclusion on the station's compilation album of local homegrown talent. Bon Jovi was initially reluctant to have it included but eventually gave them the song on which Bon Jovi had used studio musicians to play on the track. The studio musicians who helped record &quot;Runaway&quot; â known as The All Star Review â were guitarist Tim Pierce, keyboardist Roy Bittan, drummer Frankie LaRocka, and bassist Hugh McDonald.

''Runaway'' became a local hit on the charts. Along the way, Mercury gave Bon Jovi a recording contract in 1983, and to promote ''Runaway'', Bon Jovi called up [[Richie Sambora]], David Bryan, [[Tico Torres]] and [[Alec John Such]] and formed a band. After Bon Jovi claimed he wanted a group name (and rejecting &quot;Johnny Lightning&quot;), one of the group suggested &quot;[[Bon Jovi]]&quot;, slightly changing the spelling of Jon's last name.

===Bon Jovi===
{{Main|Bon Jovi}}

With the help of their new manager [[Doc McGhee]], the band's debut album, ''[[Bon Jovi (album)|Bon Jovi]]'', was released on January 21, 1984. The album went [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the US (sales of over 500,000). In 1985, Bon Jovi's second album ''[[7800Â°Fahrenheit]]'' was released, and though the response weaker, it proved to be a fan favorite. The turning point came when they brought in songwriter [[Desmond Child]] for their third album, ''[[Slippery When Wet]]''. With Child co-writing many of their hits on this and future albums the band shot to super-stardom around the world with songs such as &quot;[[You Give Love a Bad Name (song)|You Give Love a Bad Name]]&quot;, &quot;[[Livin' On A Prayer]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]&quot;. The album has sold in excess of 28 million copies worldwide since its release in late 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Telegraph bonjovi&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23122302-5001026,00.html|title=On a steel horse Bon Jovi rides to top of the charts|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2008-06-04|date=2008-01-29 | first=Bronwyn | last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their 1986-1987 tour, Jon's attempt to give it his all during live shows (plus the tour's exhausting schedule) greatly strained his vocal cords. In the band's Behind The Music special, he notes that his vocal cords were given steroids to help him sing. With the help of a vocal coach, he was able to continue doing the tour. Contrary to popular belief, Bon Jovi did not have voice damage during the [[New Jersey Syndicate Tour]]. However by the time of the recording of Slippery When Wet, Bon Jovi could no longer reach the extreme high notes heard across some of the songs in his first two albums.
[[File:Jonbonjovi.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Jon Bon Jovi in the Netherlands on May 26, 2006]]

The next album from Bon Jovi was ''[[New Jersey (album)|New Jersey]]'' released in 1988. The album was recorded very shortly after the tour for ''Slippery'', because the band wanted to prove that they were not just a one hit wonder. The resulting album is a fan favorite and a mammoth commercial success, with hit songs such as &quot;[[Bad Medicine (song)|Bad Medicine]]&quot;, &quot;[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]&quot; and &quot;[[I'll Be There for You (Bon Jovi song)|I'll Be There for You]]&quot;, which are still nightly stalwarts in their live repertoire.

Despite the band achieving massive success, ''New Jersey'' almost led to the end of the band as they went straight back out on the road so soon after the heavy touring for their previous album. This constant living on the road almost destroyed the strong bond between the band members. Sambora is noted on the albums as co-writer for many songs, yet he resented the lack of attention that was heaped on Jon alone. As mentioned in ''VH1's Behind the Music'', the band members note that at the end of the tour, each band member went their separate way, even departing in separate jets after the tour ended in Guadalajara, Mexico in early 1990.

Between 1990 and 1992, members of Bon Jovi went their separate ways after the very rigorous two year [[New Jersey]] Tour, which exceeded 200 shows on 5 continents. This time off also helped them determine where Bon Jovi would fit within the rapidly changing music scene upon their return.

In 1992, the band returned with the album ''[[Keep the Faith]]''. The album was released in November 1992. Produced by [[Bob Rock]], the album signified an ending to their early metal roots in previous albums and introduced a more &quot;rock n roll&quot;-driven groove to the album. Much more complex, lyrically and musically, the album proved that Bon Jovi could still be a viable band in the 90's, despite the industry's and audience's growing affinity for [[Grunge]].

In 1994, Bon Jovi released a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album titled ''[[Cross Road]]'', which also contained two new tracks: the hit singles &quot;[[Always (Bon Jovi song)|Always]]&quot; and &quot;[[Someday I'll Be Saturday Night]]&quot;. &quot;Always&quot; spent six months on the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of Bon Jovi's all-time biggest hits. The song peaked at #4 on the U.S. charts and at #1 in countries across Europe, Asia and in [[Australia]]. The single sold very well, going platinum in the U.S. That same year, bassist Alec John Such left the band, the first and only lineup change since Bon Jovi began. Hugh McDonald, who was the bassist on &quot;Runaway&quot;, unofficially replaced Such as bassist.

Their sixth studio album ''[[These Days (Bon Jovi album)|These Days]]'' was released in June 1995 to the most critical acclaim that the band had ever received. With the album ''[[These Days (Bon Jovi album)|These Days]]'', Bon Jovi took the mature rock sound they had developed on ''Keep the Faith'' further. The record as a whole was darker and more downbeat than the usual Bon Jovi flare. By 1996, Bon Jovi had established themselves as a &quot;force&quot; in the music industry, proving much more durable than most of their 80's glam peers.

After another lengthy hiatus of nearly three years, during which several band members worked on independent projects, Bon Jovi regrouped in 1999 to begin work on their next studio album. Their 2000 release, ''[[Crush (Bon Jovi album)|Crush]]'', enjoyed overwhelming success all around the world, thanks in part to the smash-hit single &quot;[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]&quot;, co-written by famous Swedish producer [[Max Martin]]. ''Crush'', which also produced such hits as &quot;Say It Isn't So&quot;, helped introduce Bon Jovi to a new, younger fan base.

In late 2002, ''[[Bounce (Bon Jovi album)|Bounce]]'', the band's follow-up to ''Crush'', hit stores. Though ''Bounce'' did not enjoy the level of success of its predecessor, the album did produce hit singles such as &quot;[[Everyday (Bon Jovi song)|Everyday]]&quot; and the title track.

Bon Jovi's ninth studio album, ''[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi album)|Have a Nice Day]]'', was released in September 2005. &quot;[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi song)|Have A Nice Day]]&quot; was the first single off the new album and the second single from the album &quot;[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]]&quot;, was released in the U.S. in the spring of 2006. In the U.S. a duet version of &quot;Who Says You Can't Go Home&quot; with country singer [[Jennifer Nettles]] of the band [[Sugarland (band)|Sugarland]] was released, and in May 2006, Bon Jovi made history by becoming the first Rock &amp; Roll Band to have a #1 hit on Billboard's Hot Country Chart. On February 11, 2007, Bon Jovi also won a [[Grammy Award]], for &quot;Best Country Collaboration with Vocals&quot; for &quot;Who Says You Can't Go Home&quot;.

In June 2007, Bon Jovi released their studio album, ''[[Lost Highway (Bon Jovi album)|Lost Highway]]''. The album debuted at number #1 on the Billboard charts, the first time that Bon Jovi have had a number one album on the US charts since the release of ''[[New Jersey (album)|New Jersey]]'' in 1988. Thanks to the band's new country music fanbase, the album sold 292,000 copies in its first week on sale in the U.S., and became Bon Jovi's third US number one album.

On April 6, 2009, it was announced that the Tribeca Film Festival will screen a Bon Jovi documentary called ''When We Were Beautiful''. The film follows the band on the Lost Highway Tour during 2008. The film is directed by Phil Griffin and will be the centerpiece of the festival and is considered a work-in-progress.In November 2009, Bon Jovi released their latest studio album ''[[The Circle (Bon Jovi album)|The Circle]]''.

===Solo career===
Jon Bon Jovi recorded a solo album, a soundtrack to the movie ''[[Young Guns II]]'' (in which he also appeared for less than a second), more commonly known as ''[[Blaze of Glory]]''. Released in 1990, the album featured high profile guests such as: [[Elton John]], [[Aldo Nova]], [[Little Richard]], and [[Jeff Beck]], among others.  The album fared well commercially and received very positive reviews and quickly achieved double platinum status.  The title track, &quot;[[Blaze of Glory (song)|Blaze of Glory]]&quot;, hit number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and earned Jon an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Song, but he did not win the award.  That same year, however, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; was awarded a [[Golden Globe]].

Jon wrote what would become his second solo album, 1997's ''[[Destination Anywhere]]''. The album received very positive reviews and was a success across Europe.  It was rumored that the record company was pursuing Jon to name the record &quot;These Days, Part 2&quot;, since the album was somewhat of a moody progression from ''These Days''.  A short movie of the same name was recorded right around the record's release, based entirely on the songs from the record and starring Jon Bon Jovi, [[Demi Moore]], [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] of [[Eurythmics]] played guitar on the record, as well as producing some of the tracks. That year Jon Bon Jovi earned a [[BRIT Award]] for Best International Male and also won a [[MTV Europe Music Award]] for Best Male.

In 1998, Jon Bon Jovi joined [[Luciano Pavarotti]] in his then annual charity concert &quot;''Pavarotti and Friends''&quot; in Italy.

* &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Please Come Home for Christmas&quot; was originally credited as a solo recording by Jon Bon Jovi when included on the Christmas compilation ''[[A Very Special Christmas 2]]'' in 1992, but when released as a single in UK, Ireland and Europe in 1994 it was released as a [[Bon Jovi]] single under the band name. The cover artwork of the single was a still from the musicvideo of Jon Bon Jovi and [[Cindy Crawford]] and the same Bon Jovi logo as was used on the albums ''Keep the Faith'' and ''Cross Road'' and the singles taken from them.
