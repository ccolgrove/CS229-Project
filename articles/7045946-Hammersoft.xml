'''Gwen McCrae''' (born Gwen Mosley, December 21, 1943, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4867|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Steve Huey |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] [[singer]], best known for her March, 1975 [[hit record|hit]] &quot;[[Rockin' Chair (Gwen McCrae song)|Rockin' Chair]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
Gwen was the youngest of five children (three sisters: one called Delores and one brother Herman),&lt;ref&gt;http://hem.bredband.net/funkyflyy/gwen/gwen.html&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up singing in her Pentecostal [[Church (building)|church]] and later discovered secular singers like [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; She began performing in local [[nightclub|clubs]] as a teenager, and singing with local groups like the Lafayettes and the Independents.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; In 1963, she met a young sailor named George McCrae, whom she [[marriage|married]] within a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;

From 1963 she [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] as a [[duet (music)|duo]] with her [[husband]] [[George McCrae|George]], and was first to receive a [[solo (music)|solo]] [[recording contract]], with [[Henry Stone]]'s [[TK Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;  George and Gwen were discovered in 1967 by singer [[Betty Wright]], who helped get them signed to Stone's Alston [[record label]]. Their debut [[single (music)|single]], &quot;Three Hearts in a Tangle,&quot; was released in 1969; the follow-up, &quot;Like Yesterday Our Love Is Gone,&quot; marked the first time they worked with the writing team of Clarence Reid (who would later morph into the bawdy comic [[Blowfly (artist)|Blowfly]]) and Willie Clarke.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; Both were regional hits, as was third single, &quot;No One Left to Come Home,&quot; although none of those [[gramophone record|records]] broke nationally; meanwhile, the McCraes and Wright were collectively earning a reputation as stellar [[session musician|session vocalists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;

She found success on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&amp;B]] [[record chart|charts]] with her [[cover version]] of [[Bobby Bland]]'s &quot;Lead Me On&quot; in 1970, followed by &quot;For Your Love&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; 

Following husband Georgeâs unexpected [[solo (music)|solo]] success with &quot;[[Rock Your Baby]]&quot;, Gwen went on to have a major hit of her own in March, 1975 with &quot;Rockin' Chair&quot;, a [[chart-topper|#1]] R&amp;B hit which also reached the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100]] [[Top 40|Top 10]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;  The follow-up &quot;Love Insurance&quot; also made the R&amp;B chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; By this time, the separate successes were taking their toll on the McCrae's marriage (Gwen has since alleged that her husband beat her frequently).&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; A 1976 duet single, &quot;Winners Together, Losers Apart,&quot; fell short of the R&amp;B Top 40, and a full album of duets failed to assuage matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; The couple split later that year, and Gwen scored what turned out to be her last chart hit for Cat, &quot;Damn Right It's Good.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; 

After TK Records collapsed, McCrae moved to [[New Jersey]], and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], having another hit with &quot;[[Funky Sensation]]&quot; in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;  She continued to record, and the success of some of her earlier recordings on the [[United Kingdom|UK's]] [[Northern Soul]] scene maintained her popularity as a live act in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;
McCrae moved back to Florida, recorded a one-off single for the small Black Jack label in 1984 called &quot;Do You Know What I Mean,&quot; and temporarily retired from the [[music industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt;

She travelled to the UK to record a couple of singles for [[Rhythm King]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; Pleased with her enduring popularity in the UK, McCrae eventually recorded an entire album for the British Homegrown Records label in 1996, entitled ''Girlfriend's Boyfriend''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; Upon returning to the U.S., she signed with the revived Goldwax label, distributed by [[Ichiban Records]], and recorded another album later that year, ''Psychic Hot Line''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; In 1998, Ichiban reissued ''Girlfriend's Boyfriend'' in the U.S. and McCrae returned in 1999 with ''Still Rockin''', which received favorable reviews in blues and classic soul circles.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot;/&gt; 

In 1999, the [[French people|French]] [[house music]] duo [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]] released the single &quot;Feeling for You&quot;, which [[sampling (music)|sampled]] the [[human voice|vocals]] of McCrae's &quot;All This Love That I'm Giving&quot;.  It was a [[Top 40|Top 20]] hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In 2004 McCrae released her first [[gospel (music)|gospel]] [[album]]. In 2008, [[rapping|rap]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]]/[[record producer|producer]] [[Madlib]] released his album, ''WLIB AM: King of the Wigflip'' which includes the song &quot;Gamble on Ya Boy&quot;, based on a &quot;I Found Love&quot; sample, from McCrae's album, ''Melody of Life''.

In the summer of 2005, McCrae teamed up with the Soulpower organization, which is also responsible for the comebacks of [[Marva Whitney]], [[Lyn Collins]], [[Martha High]], [[Bobby Byrd]] and [[RAMP]]. McCrae's two-year collaboration with Soulpower resulted in more than five dozen live performances with The Soulpower Allstars all over Europe, and the 2005 release of her album ''Live in Paris'' (Hi&amp;Fly Records.) 

Gwen McCrae released her latest single &quot;Now I Found Love&quot; in December 2010, released through Plain Truth Entertainment. &quot;Now I Found Love&quot; was mixed and produced by [[Steve Sola]] and composed by David Seagal. Also in 2010, her single &quot;Funky Sensation&quot; was heavily sampled in the [[German Language]] single &quot;Get Up,&quot; by DJ Thomilla featuring [[Afrob]].
