The idea of [[secularism]] in [[Islam]] means favoring a modern [[secular]] democracy with [[separation of church and state|separation of mosque and state]], as opposed to [[Islam as a political movement]]. [[Secularism]] in the [[Muslim countries]] refers to the ideology of promoting the secular as opposed to the religion. It is  often used to describe the separation of civil/government matters from religious theocracy. Secularism is often condemned by [[Muslim]]s who do not feel that religious values should be removed from the public sphere, though &quot;Muslim theologians have long distinguished between matters of ''din'' [religion] and ''dawlah'' [state].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2130?_hi=2&amp;_pos=1 From the article on secularism in Oxford Islamic Studies Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Secular states had existed in the [[Muslim world]] since [[Islamic Golden Age|the Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). &quot;The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society&quot;, ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363-385&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for [[Secularism]] has inspired some Muslim scholars who argue that secular government is the best way to observe sharia and enforcing sharia through coercive power of the state negates its religious nature, because Muslims would be observing the law of the state and not freely performing their religious obligation as Muslims,&quot; says Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, a professor of law at Emory University and author of a book on the future of sharia. Majority of Muslim countries have a dual system in which the government is secular but Muslims can choose to bring familial and financial disputes to sharia courts. The exact jurisdiction of these courts varies from country to country, but usually includes marriage, divorce, inheritance, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034/ &quot;Islam: Governing Under Sharia&quot;], Author:Tony Johnson, November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has acquired negative connotations in some Middle Eastern countries and is often criticized by conflating it with anti-religion and colonial intervention.

== Definition ==
{{Main|Secularism}}

The etymology of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for secularism can be controversial in itself. While some refer to'' âalmaniyya'' which is derived from the word ''alam'', suggesting that secularism is ''wordly'',  others prefer to think of ''ilmanniyya'' relating the word for secularism to the Arab word ''ilm'' (science, or knowledge). Some writers suggest another Arabic term ''âalamaniyya'' to avoid the confusion while others prefer ''dunyawiyya'', meaning temporal, in contrast to ''dini'' (religious).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_confrence-shakman-Hurd_paper.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Many Muslims argue that, unlike Christianity, Islam does not separate religion from state and majority of Muslims around the world welcome a significant role for Islam in their countries' political life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/12/hamas-hezbollah-islam-sharia-public-opinion-muslim-countries.html/ &quot;MUSLIM WORLD: Poll shows majority want Islam in politics; feelings mixed on Hamas, Hezbollah&quot;]&quot; LA Times&quot;,Dec 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is apolitical Islam, not political Islam, that requires explanation and that is an historical fluke of the &quot;shortlived heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGUnderstandingIslam&quot;&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=3301 Understanding Islamism] Middle East/North Africa Report NÂ°37 2 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, scholar [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] argues that &quot;a defacto separation between political power&quot; of sultans and emirs and religious power of the caliph was &quot;created and institutionalized ... as early as the end of the first century of the hegira,&quot; what has been lacking in the Muslim world is &quot;political thought regarding the autonomy of this space.&quot; No positive law was developed outside of sharia. The sovereign's religious function was to defend the Islamic community against its enemies, institute the [[sharia]], ensure the public good (''maslaha''). The state was an instrument to enable Muslims to live as good Muslims and Muslims were to obey the [[sultan]] if he did so. The legitimacy of the ruler was &quot;symbolized by the right to coin money and to have the Friday prayer (''[[Jumu'ah]] [[khutba]]'') said in his name.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Olivier, ''The Failure of Political Islam'' by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Secularism in Islam has been claimed to have religious sanction too. The Sahih of Imam Muslim, the second most authentic book on Hadith, dating from the 2nd century Hijrah, contains a chapter headed as follows: âWhatever the Prophet has said in matters of religion must be followed, but this does not apply to worldly affairs.â

The Hadith is as follows: ''Once Prophet Muhammad came across some people doing artificial pollination of palm trees. Due to some reason he disliked the idea and commented that it would be better not to do any pollination at all. However for the following year the harvest was poor. When he came to know about this Prophet Muhammad admitted his limitation of knowledge regarding secular affairs and said: âIf a question relates to your worldly matters you would know better about it, but if it relates to your religion then to me it belongs.â''  

Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, the prominent Indian Muslim scholar, comments on this Hadith&lt;ref&gt;Wahiduddin Khan, ''Islam: Creator of the modern age''&lt;/ref&gt;: âIslam separated religious knowledge from physical knowledge. The source of religious knowledge which came into general acceptance was divine revelation (the authentic version of which is preserved in the form of the Quran), while full freedom was given to enquiry into physical phenomena, so that individuals could arrive at their own conclusions independentlyâ.

He further says: âAccording to this hadith, Islam separates religious matters from scientific research. In religious affairs, there has to be strict adherence to divine guidance. But in scientific research, the work must proceed according to human experience.â For this reason definition of secularism in the Islamic perspective has been suggested as a separation of Religion and Science rather than Religion and State and the political view of Islam is even claimed to be secular, rather than Islamism&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificmuslim.in&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Secular governments had existed in the [[Muslim world]] since the 10th century. According to the scholar Ira M. Lapidus:

{{quote|In fact, religious and political life developed distinct spheres of experience, with independent values, leaders, and organizations. From the middle of the tenth century effective control of the Arab-Muslim empire had passed into the hands of generals, administrators, governors, and local provincial lords; the Caliphs had lost all effective political power. Governments in Islamic lands were henceforth secular regimes - Sultanates - in theory authorized by the Caliphs, but actually legitimized by the need for public order. Henceforth, Muslim states were fully differentiated political bodies without any intrinsic religious character, though they were officially loyal to Islam and committed to its defense.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). &quot;The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society&quot;, ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363-385 [364]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In the same period, religious communities developed independently of the states or empires that ruled them. The ''ulama'' regulated local communal and religious life by serving as judges, administrators, teachers, and religious advisers to Muslims. The religious elites were organized according to religious affiliation into Sunni schools of law, Shi'ite sects, or Sufi ''tariqas''. [...] In the wide range of matters arising from the Shari'a - the Muslim law - the 'ulama' of the schools formed a local administrative and social elite whose authority was based upon religion. Thus though the Muslim ''madhahib'' were not organized in the same way as Christian churches, they had many of the religious and social functions we associate with churches. But whether or not we wish to speak of churches, religious organizations, institutions, personnel and activities were clearly separate from the ruling regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). &quot;The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society&quot;, ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363-385 [364-5]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|As long as two decades ago, Sir Hamilton Gibb, in his essay 'Constitutional Organization', showed that Muslim political thinkers themselves had become aware of the separation of state and religion and recognized the emergence of an autonomous sphere of religious activity and organization. For example, Ibn Taymiyya held that apart from the Caliphate, the ''ulama'' constituted the true ''umma'' of Islam, and that ruling regimes were 'Muslim' regimes not by any intrinsic quality but by virtue of the support they lent the Muslim religion and religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). &quot;The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society&quot;, ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363-385 [365]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Averroes]] presented an argument in ''The Decisive Treatise'' providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official [[Ash'ari]] theology, thus [[Averroism]] has been considered a precursor to modern [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Wahab El Messeri. [http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/tvtk/ch21.htm Episode 21: Ibn Rushd], ''Everything you wanted to know about Islam but was afraid to Ask'', ''Philosophia Islamica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fauzi M. Najjar (Spring, 1996). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_n2_v18/ai_18627295/pg_13 The debate on Islam and secularism in Egypt], ''Arab Studies Quarterly (ASQ)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===

Many of the early supporters of Secularist principles in [[Middle Eastern]] countries were [[Baath Party|Baathist]] and non-Muslim [[Arabs]], seeking a solution to a multi-confessional population and an ongoing drive to modernism.&lt;ref&gt;such as Faris Nimr and Yaâqub Sarruf, intellectuals and journalists from Lebanon who relocated to Egypt in the 1880s and Salama Musa, who is a Coptic Christian Egyptian and founder of the Egyptian socialist Party in 1920 - Fauzi Najjar: ''the debate on islam and secularism'', Arab Studies Quarterly; 1996, Vol.18 Issue2&lt;/ref&gt;

The most controversial work is that of [[Ali abd al-Raziq]], an Islamic Scholar and [[Shariâa]] judge who caused a sensation with his work &quot;Islam and the Foundations of Governance&quot; (Al-Islam Wa Usul Al-Hukm) in 1925. For the first time in Muslim history, he argued there was nothing in the texts that made it obligatory that Muslims had to have the [[Caliphate]] form of religious government and that they can choose a system that suits them. This publication caused a fierce debate especially as he recommended that religion can be separated from government and politics. He was later removed from his position. Rosenthall commented on him saying: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;we meet for the first time a consistent, unequivocal theoretical assertion of the purely and exclusively religious character of Islam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Black, A, &quot;The history of Islamic Political Thought&quot;, Edinburgh University Press, 2001, pp. 316-319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''âalmaniyya'' acquired a bad connotation and was associated with irreligion in the Muslim world after the establishment of an anti-religious political system, but portrayed as secular, in [[Turkey]] in 1924 by [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]].&lt;ref&gt;Fauzi Najjar: ''The debate on Islam and secularism in Egypt'', Arab Studies Quarterly; 1996, pp.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Secular women ====

It was suggested that secular oriented women do not support [[sharia]] as the main source of legislation, rather they refer to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and the resolution of [[human rights]] conventions, as adopted by the [[United Nations]], as frames for reference for their struggle. Azza Karam (1998:13), for example, describes secular feminists as follows: &quot;Secular feminists firmly believe in grounding their discourse outside the realm of any religion, whether Muslim or Christian, and placing it, instead within the international human rights discourse. They do not âwaste their timeâ attempting to harmonize religious discourses with the concept and declarations pertinent to human rights. To them religion is respected as a private matter for each individual, but it is totally rejected as a basis from which to formulate any agenda on womenâs emancipation. By so doing, they avoid being caught up in interminable debates on the position of women with religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nadje Al-Ali, ''Secularism Gender and the State'',p140&lt;/ref&gt;

However variations exist concerning the interpretation and manifestation of secularism in womenâs politics and lifestyles many of them are united in their opposition to the establishment of an Islamic state (for example that is compulsory to wear veiling) and they share the sense that religion should not be mixed with politics.â Siham K., a member of Rabat Al-Marâa Al`arabiyya (the Alliance for Arab Women) p141 said: &quot;I am one of the people who believe that Islam has to be separated from civil, political and economic rights and duties. It is an option that Egypt is a Muslim country. This should remain personal. The freedom of belief is integral. It should not interfere with womenâs rights. It cannot be part of the view of politics and the future. This is another story altogether. I want religion to be detached away from actual politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Generally, secular women activists call for total equality between the sexes, attempt to ground their ideas on womenâs rights outside religious frameworks, perceive Islamism as an obstacle to their equality and a linkage to patriarchal values. (Karam, 1998: 2345).And they argue that secularism was important for protecting civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Zainab Al-Sawaij, who serves as the executive director of the American Islamic Congress and is a human rights activist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/jb_religion.htm: March 2, 2006 Conflicting Ideas of Secularism Cloud âIdealâ of Secular Democracy in Middle East&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
=== Colonial influence ===

When colonial rule was established, the process of [[secularization]] began to expand into Muslim lands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Secularism thus came as the European colonialists dominated the region and supplanted rule with their own processes and procedures.  &lt;blockquote&gt;âModernisation was seen as a legacy of European colonialism perpetuated by western-oriented elites who imposed and fostered the twin processes of westernization and secularization.â&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L.Esposito, ''the Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality'', p13&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial powers in many cases replaced indigenous political, social, economic, legal, and educational institutions. For instance, in many former colonised Middle East countries, the ''Kuttab'' or the ''madrassas'' (the Quranic schools) were moved to the western format. The French colonial government in the protectorates of the [[Maghreb]] changed the education system into a secular model closely modeled on their own. The colonialists firmly believed that their secular system was more modern, efficient, and progressive than the incumbent practices. Naturally, these changes had far-reaching social consequences, especially for women, and laid the foundation of ''Arab Secularism'' by separating the [[clergy]] from government affairs, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

In consequence, &quot;perception of the public, political, and social domain through the prism of religion became marginal and was replaced by a new perception, a perception that was modern, temporal, ideological, ethical, evolutionary, and political.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aziz Al-Azmeh]], ''Islams and Modernities'', p48&lt;/ref&gt; This provided a challenge to some governments, which had no choice but to change in the face of overwhelming force. It is from this experience that secularism gained also its perceived foreign identity.

=== Communist influence ===

In 1918 the Soviet Union opened the [[Commissariat]] for Muslim Affairs, which actively opposed the colonial powers in the Middle East and their system of Mandates.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Pratt, ''Democracy and Authoritarianism in the Arab World'', p 163&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s the formation of the first communist parties in the Middle East started playing a key role in the anti-colonial struggle and promoting their ethos regarding workers rights. During the [[Second World War]] they also played a role fighting against [[fascism]] and participating in the international peace movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

A key element of the Communism movement was the well organized network of parties in different countries that provided support to each other and enabled communist organizations to become an effective outlet against oppression.

Communism went on to become one of the key components of [[Arab Nationalism]] and was particularly prominent during the rule of [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]] in [[Egypt]] in which Egyptian communists stood aside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/communism-in-the-middle-east Communism in the Middle East: Information and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; And even though communism was often a prominent supporter of Arab nationalism, the international relationships which allowed it to be such a potent force were also used by opposition regimes, and to some extent third parties during the [[Cold War]]. A good example of this is the [[Communist Party of Iraq]] which was oppressed by [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Islamists]] for their secular policies and by the US during the Cold War period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rationalrevolution.net/war/communism_in_iraq.htm Communism in Iraq&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secularist movements ===
==== Turkey ====
{{Main|Secularism in Turkey}}

Secularism in [[Turkey]] was both dramatic and far reaching as it filled the vacuum of the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] after [[World War I]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} With the country getting down [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]] led a political and cultural revolution.  
&quot;Official Turkish modernity took shape basically through a negation of the Islamic Ottoman system and the adoption of a west-oriented mode of modernization, but a la turca.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alev Cinar, ''Modernity, Islam and Secularism in Turkey'', p 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 AtatÃ¼rkâs Revolution brought Islamic authority under the full and absolute control of the secular state. The institutionalization of secularism involved bringing all religious activity under the direct control of the secular state.

* The abolition of the Caliphate.
* Religious lodges and Sufi orders were banned.
* A secular civil code was adopted to replace the previous codes based on Islamic law (shariâa) outlawing all forms of polygamy, annulled religious marriages, granted equal rights to men and women, in matters of inheritance, marriage and divorce.
* The religious court system and institutions of religious education were abolished.
* The use of religion for political purposes was banned.
* The article that defined the Turkish state as Islamic was removed from the constitution.
* The alphabet was changed from Arabic to Roman.
* A portion of religious activity was moved to the Turkish language, including the ''Adhan'' (call to prayer) which lasted till 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century the secular [[Turkish nationalism]] was continually challenged by [[Islamists]], [[Kurdish people]] and [[Marxist]] movements. And, although most Turkish citizens still are in favor of secularism,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} political Islamists and neo-fundamentalists are gaining ground since the mid eighties, such as the Refah Party and AK Party.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} These groups oppose laws that limit religious teachings and forbid the external display of religious symbols, including the headscarf in public spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.,p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite military coups in the last thirty years (1960, 1971, 1980), the existence of a Turkish secular democracy (Turkey is one of the rare Muslim-majority countries with free elections involving multiple parties and freedom of speech) is supported by discussion of Turkey joining the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/jb_religion.htm Conflicting Ideas of Secularism Cloud âIdealâ of Secular Democracy in Middle East, Panelists Say&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iran ====
{{Main|Secularism in Iran}}

Following the military coup of 21 February 1921, Reza Khan had established himself as the dominant political personality in the country. Fearing that their influence might be diminished, the clergy of Iran proposed their support and persuaded him to assume the role of the Shah.&lt;ref&gt;Homa Omid, ''Theocracy of democracy? The critics of `westoxification' and the politics of fundamentalism in Iran'': Third World Quarterly; Dec92, Vol. 13 Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''1925-1941''': The [[Reza Shah]] began to make some dramatic changes to Iranian society with the specific intention of modernization and removing power from the clergy. He changed religious schools to public education, built Iranâs first university and banned the hijab in public. Nevertheless, the regime was somewhat undemocratic with the removal of Majles power (the first parliament in 1906) and the clampdown on free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Halliday, ''Iran: Dictatorship and Development'',p23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1951-1953''': During the early 1950s the Prime Minister Dr [[Mossadeq]] was again forming a pro secularization government with a socialist agenda with the specific aim of reducing the power held by the clergy.  However his plans for nationalization the oil industry were a step too far for Britain. So with the help of the CIA they supported a coup which replaced the government with [[Mohammad Reza Shah]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1962-1963''': Using the mandate of modernization, the Shah introduced dramatic changes what was called the [[White Revolution]].  During this time a number of changes were made to put Iran on the path to become a successful secularist capitalist country:

*Workers rights
*Land reform based on international standards
*Womenâs suffrage
*Further actions to reduce the power of the clergy.

'''1963-1973''': the changes seemed to be paying off with Iran experiencing rapid economic growth however the sheer pace of change alienated many political opponents of the Shah and any dissent was crushed by the secret police.  Despite the new infrastructural and economic improvements the opposition rallied untied behind [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] and by the end of the 1970s the Shah was overthrown in an [[Islamic Revolution]] (1979).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==== Tunisia ====
{{Main|Secularism in Tunisia}}

Under the leadership of [[Habib Bourguiba]] (1956â1987), Tunisiaâs post independence government pursued a program of secularization and modernization.&lt;ref&gt;''Secularism and Democracy in the Middle East''; http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_Conference-shakman-Hurd_paper.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba, ''who has Been one of the most avowedly secularist political strategies in the Arab world'', modified laws regarding habous (religious endowments), reformed education, and unified the legal system so that all Tunisians, regardless of religion, were subject to the state courts. He restricted the influence of the religious [[University of Ez-Zitouna]] and replaced it with a faculty of theology integrated into the University of Tunis, banned the headscarf for women, made members of the religious hierarchy state employees and ordered that the expenses for the upkeep of mosques and the salaries of preachers to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Nazih N. Ayubi, ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, his best known legal innovations was the âCode du Statut Personelâ (CSP) the laws governs issues related to the family: marriage, guardianship of children, inheritance and most importantly the abolishing of polygamy and making divorce subject to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie A.Brand, ''Women, the State and Political Liberalization: Middle East and North Africa Experiences'',p178&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba clearly wanted to undercut the religious establishmentâs ability to prevent his developmental program, and although he was careful to locate these changes within the framework of a modernist reading of Islam and presented them as the product of ijtihad (independent interpretation) and not a break with Islam, he became well known for his secularism. [[John Esposito]] notes that â''For Bourguiba, Islam represented the past; the west was Tunisiaâs only hope for a modern future''â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_Conference-shakman-Hurd_paper.asp Paper: &quot;Secularism and Democracy in the Middle East&quot; by Elizabeth Shakman Hurd - May 16, 2003 - Center for the Study of Islam &amp; Democracy (CSID)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following increasing economic problems{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, Islamist movements came about in 1970 with the revival of religious teaching in Ez-Zitouna University and the influence which came from Arab religious leaders like Syrian and Egyptian brotherhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Nazih N.Ayubi, ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'',p114&lt;/ref&gt; There is also influence by [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], whose members issue a magazine in Tunis named Azeytouna. â&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azeytouna.net Azeytouna Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, the struggle between Bourguiba and Islamists became uncontrolled and in order to repress the opposition the Islamist leaderships were exiled, arrested and interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;John L.Esposito, ''The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?,'' p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Egypt ====
{{Main|Secularism in Egypt}}

Secularism in Egypt has had a very important role to play in both the history of Egypt and that of the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Egyptâs first experience of Secularism started with the British Occupation (1882â1952), the atmosphere which allowed the protection of debate.  In this environment pro-secularist intellectuals like Ya'qub Sarruf, Faris Nimr, Nicola Haddad whom sought political asylum from Ottoman Rule were able to publish their work.  This debate had then became a burning issue with the work of Egyptian Shaykh [[Ali abd al-Raziq]] (1888â1966), â''The most momentous document in the crucial intellectual and religious debate of modern Islamic history''â&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Fauzi Najjar, ''The debate on Islam and Secularism'', Arab Studies Quarterly; 1996, Vol. 18 Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1919 Egypt had its first political secular entity called the ''Hizb 'Almani'' (Secular Party) this name was later changed to the [[Wafd party]]. It combined secular policies with a nationalist agenda and had the majority support in the following years against both the rule of the king and the British influence.  The Wafd party supported the allies during [[World War II]] and then proceeded to win the 1952 parliamentary elections, following these elections the prime minister was overthrown by the King leading to riots.  These riots precipitated a military coup after which all political parties were banned including the [[Wafd]] and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The government of [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]] was secularist-nationalist in nature which at the time gathers a great deal of support both in Egypt and other Arab states{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

*Secularist/Nationalist dictatorship:  No religious or other political movements allowed to impact government.
*Modernization.
*Industrialization.
*Concentration on Arab values rather than Muslim values.

Following the death of Nasser, President [[Sadat]] (1970â1981) continued economic liberalization and maintained the governmentâs secularist policy{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, even going as far as signing peace agreements with Israel which was a first for any Middle Eastern country.   However, following further intensive clampdowns on political opposition, Sadat was assassinated and replaced by [[Hosni Mubarak]] who again faces the issue of keeping the Islamist support at bay whilst keeping his power base during increased pressure to be democratic.&lt;ref&gt;David Marquand and Ronald L. Nettler, ''Religion and democracy'', p 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, most proponents of secularism emphasize the link between secularism and ânational unityâ between [[Coptic Christians]] and [[Muslims]].

==== Syria ====
{{Main|Secularism in Syria}}

The process of secularization in [[Syria]] began under the [[French Mandate of Syria|French mandate]] in the 1920s and went on continuously under different governments since the independence. Syria has been governed by the Arab nationalist [[Baath Party]] since 1963. The Baath regime combined [[Arab Socialism]] with secular ideology and an authoritarian political system. The constitution guarantees religious freedom for every recognized religious communities, including many Christian denominations. All schools are government-run and non-sectarian, although there is mandatory religious instruction, provided in Islam and/or Christianity. Extremist forms of Islam are not tolerated by the government. The Syrian legal system is primarily based on [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and was heavily influenced by the period of French rule. It is also drawn in part from Egyptian law of Abdel Nasser, quite from the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]] system and very little from [[Sharia]]. Syria has separate secular and religious courts. Civil and criminal cases are heard in secular courts, while the Sharia courts handle personal, family, and religious matters in cases between Muslims or between Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=140&amp;edition=8&amp;ccrcountry=169&amp;section=89&amp;ccrpage=37 freedomhouse.org: View a Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslim communities have their own religious courts using their own religious law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/syria/31.htm Syria - Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

[[Lebanon]] is a [[parliamentary democracy]] within the overall framework of [[Confessionalism (politics)|Confessionalism]], a form of [[consociationalism]] in which the highest offices are proportionately reserved for representatives from certain religious communities.

A growing number of Lebanese, however, have organized against the confessionalist system, advocating for an installation of [[laÃ¯citÃ©]] in the national government. The most recent expression of this secularist advocacy was the [[LaÃ¯que Pride]] march held in Beirut on April 26, 2010, as a response to [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]'s growing appeal in Beirut and its call to re-establish the Islamic caliphate.

==Opposition and critique==
=== Secularism and religion ===
==== Secularism and Islam ====
Islamists believe Islam fuses religion and politics, with normative political values determined by the divine texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonney, R, âJihad: From Qurâan to Bin Ladenâ, Palgrave Macmillan, Hampshire, 2004, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that this has historically been the case and the secularist/modernist efforts at secularizing politics are little more than ''[[jahiliyyah]]'' (ignorance), ''[[kafir]]'' (unbelief), ''[[irtidad]]'' (apostasy) and [[atheism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nabhani, T, &quot;The Islamic State&quot;, al-Khilafah Publications&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Those who participated in secular politics were raising the flag of revolt against Allah and his messenger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1948, Mawlana Mawdudi founder of Jamaat e-Islami&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi scholars denounce secularism as strictly prohibited in Islamic tradition. The Saudi Arabian Directorate of Ifta', Preaching and Guidance, has issued a directive decreeing that whoever believes that there is a guidance (''huda'') more perfect than that of the Prophet, or that someone else's rule is better than his is a ''kafir''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim M. Abu-Rabi, ''Contemporary Islamic Thought'', p 338&lt;/ref&gt;

It lists a number of specific tenets which would be regarded as a serious departure from the precepts of Islam, punishable according to Islamic law. For example:

* The belief that human made laws and constitutions are superior to the Shari'a.
* The opinion that Islam is limited to one's relation with God, and has nothing to do with the daily affairs of life.
* To disapprove of the application of the ''[[hudud]]'' (legal punishments decreed by God) that they are incompatible in the modern age.
* And whoever allows what God has prohibited is a ''kafir''.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Ibrahim Mabruk, al-âalmaniyyun (Cairo, 1990),p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of [[Tariq al-Bishri]], &quot;secularism and Islam cannot agree except by means of talfiq [combining the doctrines of more than one school, i.e., falsification], or by each turning away from its true meaning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ahram, 12 December 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularists have been vilified, threatened, beaten and even murdered by militant Muslims. The case of [[Faraj Foda]], who was accused by Islamists of being an apostate from Islam, and agent of Western powers and culture which resulted in his assassination. &quot;The killing of Faraj Foda was in fact the implementation of the punishment against an apostate, which the State has failed to implement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh Al-Ghazali (1992) http://www.cavecybernation.com/jawad/liberalarabs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18627295.html The debate on Islam and secularism in Egypt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Islamic modernizers =====
{{See also|Islam and modernity|Islamic Modernism|Liberal movements within Islam}}

Modernists argue that secular rule is necessary with a role for faith in civil society. So, unlike authors such as [[Bernard Lewis]] who have argued that Arab-Muslim is incompatible with democracy because concepts associated with democracy like the separation of religion from state, representative government and freedom are unknown within Islam and the Arab political tradition.&lt;ref&gt;(kedourie 1994; Lewis 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Pratt, Democracy and Authoritarianism in the Arab world,p2.&lt;/ref&gt; others, like [[Dr. Muhammad Imara]], suggest that secularism may not be incompatible with Islam &quot;We do not reject secularism because it has been imported from the West. We need only examine our circumstances in light of our Islamic religion and its nature, to find out whether secularism would mean progress for us in the same way it did for Europe, or whether it would prove to be inappropriate and harmful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Imara, ''Almaniyya wa Nahdatuna al-Haditha'' (Cairo, 1986).p11&lt;/ref&gt;

Main points of discussion:

* There is nothing un-Islamic about separating religion from state affairs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;Shaykh Ali Abd al-Raziq&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Sharia was a flexible system which could adapt and use reason.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Only [[Muhammad]] could rule by divine right and even he consulted with others whilst making decisions thus providing a precedent for consultative process and change.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* The concept of a divinely empowered ''[[caliph]]'' or religious leader is as much of an innovation as [[secularism]] and a notion imported from [[Catholicism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Muhammad Imara&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the pinnacle or Middle Eastern and Islamic civilization was based on Islam being the religion of progress, intellect and scientific endeavor. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Secularism and authoritarianism ===

There is an opposite relationship between secularism and oppression in the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In the second half of the 20th century this has been distorted due to the feared repercussions of (amongst others) the anti-social and anti-progression elements of Islam. Spread of Islamist Fundamentalism makes secular leaders more repressive and authoritarian in order to protect secularism. At the same time the more repression from the government makes society opponent to secularism and this opposition makes Islamist Fundamentalism more popular in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakaria, F 2007&quot;&gt;Zakaria, F.	2007, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad. W Norton &amp; Co Inc, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that this can be attributed to a desire by such dictators to cement their power and the need to progress social reforms.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This has left in many countries the mosque as the only place to voice political opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Halliday, ''Two Hours That Shook the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like Vali Nasr however argue that the secular elites in the Muslim world were imposed by colonial powers to maintain hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, J, &quot;The Oxford History of Islam&quot;, Oxford University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reference necessary|Many people also associate secularism with military regimes, such as those in [[Turkey]] and [[Algeria]].|date=June 2010}} Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) succeeded in December 1991 elections in Algeria&lt;ref&gt;http://www.binghamton.edu/cdp/era/elections/alg91par.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Welfare Party succeeded in 1995 elections in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.konrad.org.tr/secim/ayrinti.php?yil_id=12&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these parties are example of Islamic parties. However, both of these parties were faced with military coups in order to protect secularism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton, A. R. 1996&quot;&gt;Norton, A. R. (ed), 1996. Civil Society in the Middle East, 2nd volume. Brill, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; While Welfare Party government in Turkey was forced to resign from the office by Turkish military in February 1997 with a military intervention which is called as &quot;post modern coup&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Yavuz, M. H. (2006) The Emergence of a New Turkey: Democracy and the Ak Parti. Utah: Utah University Pres&lt;/ref&gt; FIS in Algeria lived an austere military coup which carried the country in to a civil war in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton, A. R. 1996&quot;/&gt; Military forces in those countries could use their power in undemocratic ways in order to âprotect secularismâ. 

In some countries, the fear of [[Islamist]] takeover via democratic processes has led to [[authoritarian]] measures against Islamist political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Garon2003&lt;/ref&gt; 
&quot;The Syrian regime was able to capitalize on the fear of Islamist coming to power to justify the massive clampdown on the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Pratt, ''Democracy and Authoritarianism in the Arab World'',p137&lt;/ref&gt; When American diplomats asked Hosni Mubarak to give more rights to the press and stop arresting the intellectuals, Mubarak rejected it and said, &quot;If I do what you ask, the fundamentalists will take over the government in Egypt. Do you want that?&quot; Or when President Bill Clinton asked Yasser Arafat to establish democracy in Palestine in 2001, Yasser Arafat also replied similarly. &quot;He said that in a democratic system Hamas will take control the government in Palestine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakaria, F 2007&quot;/&gt; Most of the Middle Eastern autocrats drew upon the risk of Islamist fundamentalism in order to justify their autocratic rule of government in the international arena. In Freedom Houseâs 2008 Freedom in the World Report, the connection between authoritarianism and the risk of Islamist fundamentalism in the Middle East is reduplicated. &quot;The presence of movements committed to violent jihad poses a threat to the security of ordinary people and provides an excuse for the enactment of authoritarian emergency measures by rulers bent on suppressing all sources of political opposition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=130&amp;year=2008&lt;/ref&gt;
