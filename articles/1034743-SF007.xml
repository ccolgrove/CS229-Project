'''Planet [[CCRMA]]''' (pronounced ''karma'') is a collection of [[Red Hat]] [[Software package (installation)|packages]] ( [[RPM Package Manager|RPMs]] ) to help set up and ''optimize'' a [[Red Hat]]-based workstation for [[sound reproduction|audio]] work.

== Overview ==

The entire environment, called '''Planet [[CCRMA]]''', was developed and tested at [[Stanford University]] and made available to the public free-of-charge from a central [[software repository|repository]] â '''Planet CCRMA at Home''' [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/] The Planet CCRMA repositories are maintained at CCRMA by Fernando Lopez-Lezcano.

Installing the packages, transforms a Linux workstation or [[Server (computing)|server]] into a [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] system for sound and video production and distribution. The [[ALSA (Linux)|ALSA]] soundcard drivers and other [[application software|applications]] are provided without installation hassles and the low-latency is achieved by having applied the real-time preemption patch to the Linux [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]].

== Supported Linux distributions ==

* [[Red Hat Linux]] 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, 9
* [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 1, Core 2, Core 3, Core 4, Core 5, Core 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
