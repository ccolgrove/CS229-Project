The '''Israel Boy and Girl Scouts Federation''' ({{lang-he|××ª×××××ª ××¦××¤×× ×××¦××¤××ª ×××©×¨××}}, ''Hit'ahdut HaTzofim VeHaTzofot BeYisrael'')&lt;ref name=&quot;seascout.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.seascout.org/ships/international/Israel/ Sea Scouting: Sea Scouting in Israel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Israel]]'s national Scouting organization, known in [[Hebrew]] as '''Tzofim'''. Some 90,000 boys and girls belong to Tzofim in Israel.

==History==
The first Tzofim groups were founded in 1919. The Israeli Scouts movement became a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] in 1951&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/countries/national_scout_organisations/some_statistics&lt;/ref&gt;, after the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. The first Girl Guide units were also established in 1919; the respective federation became a member of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] in 1963.

In 2009, Tzofim celebrated its 90th birthday. To mark the occasion, Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] met members of Tzofim at his office, where he told stories of his youth in the Modi'in troop in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sredni |first=Yonatan |title=Scoutâs Honor? |month=June |year=2008 |work=Jewish Magazine |url=http://www.jewishmag.com/135mag/scouts_honor/scouts_honor.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Tzofim is a non-political organization but upholds [[Zionist]] and [[Jewish]] values. Scout troops in Israel have always been coeducational. The federation in Israel consists of Jewish, [[Muslim]] [[Arab]], [[Christian Arab]], and [[Druze]] troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;seascout.org&quot;/&gt; Tzofim is open to everyone regardless of race, color, creed, or socio-economic standing. Israeli scouts come from all sectors of Israeli society.

==Structure==
The Israel Scouts are divided into six regional hubs: Jerusalem, Central, Sharon, South, North, and Tzabar (North America and Western Europe). The scout troop is called a ''shevet'', or tribe. In the large cities, there may be several clubhouses in different neighborhoods. Most towns and kibbutzim also have scouts dens.

==Programs==
There are two advanced scouting programs: The [[Wood Badge]], held every 4 years for adult scouts, and the Aryeh Croch Israeli Scouting Badge, held annually for 11th and 12th grade scouts. Most of the federation's programs and activities are held in the Scouts Ranch in the north of Israel. Tzofim runs a special project for children with physical and mental disabilities called ''Broshim'' (''Evergreens''). Tzofim maintains an active partnership with the German [[Verband Christlicher Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder]], including exchange visits by leadership delegations and international events.
