== Biography ==
=== Early musical acts: 1992-1999 ===
In summer 1992, White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band [[Monsula]], who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's. After the performance, Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993. As a friend of punk rock trio [[Green Day]], he appeared in the &quot;[[When I Come Around]]&quot; video, where he is seen making out with a girl (his real-life girlfriend at the time). In 1994, White joined punk quartet [[Pinhead Gunpowder]] after the departure of singer/guitarist [[Mike Kirsch]] (with whom White had played the previous year in Sixteen Bullets). White joined [[The Big Cats]] in 1996, after the temporary departure of bassist Josh Bentley, and took over guitar duties in 2000 after the death of guitarist Shannon Yarbrough. The group is a side project of many musicians, playing live very rarely. Their newest record, ''On Tomorrow'', was released in 2007. When Green Day/Pinhead Gunpowder frontman [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] started [[Adeline Records]] in 1997, Jason helped him run it. He re-appeared with Armstrong for two Green Day shows in 1999, both of which raised money for the [[Bridge School Benefit]]. After making ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]],'' Green Day asked him to assist them on their tour as a second guitarist.

=== The Influents and The Network: 2000-2003 ===
Because of Pinhead Gunpowder's infamy for sporadic get-togethers, White and Gunpowder bassist [[Bill Schneider (musician)|Bill Schneider]] began looking to form another band that would be a group the two could focus on. After recruiting Schneider's brother Greg Schneider to join and finally convincing Willie Samuels to play drums, [[The Influents]] were formed. White and Greg would become the focus of the band, splitting songwriting duties, as well as singing time. Bill Schneider left the band on good terms after group's first album ''[[Check Please]]'' to focus on his drum shop and was soon replaced by Johnnie Wentz. The new line-up soon recorded a follow up, ''[[Some of the Young]]'', and went on tour. Due to personal and creative differences, as well as White's growing dedication to Green Day, The Influents dissolved in 2003. {{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 2003, allegedly under the name Balducci, White joined the members of Green Day for their side-project [[The Network]]. The band has released one album so far, called ''[[Money Money 2020]]''.

=== American Idiot: 2004-2005 ===
With the release of ''[[American Idiot (album)|American Idiot]]'', White was required again to play with the band during the supporting tour of the album. In February 2005, Jason got married.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDA | Jason White Profile&quot;&gt;[http://www.greendayauthority.com/TheBand/jwprofile.php GDA | Jason White Profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he played with Green Day in their video, &quot;[[Wake Me Up When September Ends]]&quot; &amp;ndash; the first time that any musician outside the trio appeared as a performer in a Green Day video. He also appears along the band in their 2005 live CD/DVD ''[[Bullet in a Bible]]''.

=== Covers and Habitat for Humanity: 2006-2007 ===
In 2006, Jason recorded a cover of [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] &quot;Torture&quot; for the Replacements Cover compilation, &quot;[[We'll Inherit the Earth: A Tribute to The Replacements|We'll Inherit the Earth]]&quot;. Hes also featured in the May 2007 release, ''Towncraft'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Towncraft the Movie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towncraftmovie.com|title=Towncraft the Movie|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a documentary covering twenty years of the punk music scene in Little Rock, AR, White's home. That same year, White played with Green Day in the video for the cover of &quot;[[Working Class Hero]].&quot;

In April 2007, White and his wife joined Armstrong and his family in their Spring Break working with [[Habitat For Humanity]] and writing a diary for GreenDay.net.

=== Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2008-present day ===
In 2008, White joined Green Day's side project [[Foxboro Hot Tubs]] as lead guitarist along with Kevin Preston of [[Prima Donna (American band)|Prima Donna]] on rhythm guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Punknews article on the Foxboro Hot Tubs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28471|title=Green Day confirm that they are Foxboro Hot Tubs. Everyone act surprised|date=April 10, 2008|publisher=Punknews.org|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he toured with Green Day in support for their latest record, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]''.

White made his fourth appearance on a Green Day video for &quot;[[21 Guns (song)|21 Guns]]&quot; and his fifth in &quot;[[Last of the American Girls]]&quot;; prior to this, and not including his live appearances on &quot;[[Jesus of Suburbia]]&quot; and &quot;[[East Jesus Nowhere]]&quot;, he had appeared in three Green Day videos: &quot;[[When I Come Around]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wake Me Up When September Ends]]&quot; and &quot;[[Working Class Hero#Notable covers|Working Class Hero]]&quot;.

On July 13, 2010, Max Recordings released White's debut 45 single - &quot;[[Hungover (Jason White song)|Hungover]]&quot; b/w &quot;I'm A Mess&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arktimes.com/RockCandy/archives/2010/07/09/max-releasing-jason-white-7|title=Max releasing Jason White 7|last=Tarpley|first=John|date=July 9, 2010|publisher=Arkansas times|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
