Librarian.net, which she founded in 1999 after finding the domain name unused, has become a &quot;widely read and cited&quot; resource.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evolving&quot;&gt;{{cite book

West characterizes librarian.net as generally &quot;anti-[[censorship]], pro-[[freedom of speech]], pro-[[pornography|porn]] (for lack of a better way to explain that we don't find the [[nudity|naked body]] shameful), anti[[globalization]], anti-[[outsourcing]], anti-[[Laura Schlessinger|Dr. Laura]], pro-[[freak scene|freak]], pro-[[social responsibility]], and just generally pro-information and in favor of the profession getting a better image.&quot;

[[Image:Antipat4.gif|thumb|left|150px|Library sign designed by Jessamyn West]]
[[Wired magazine|Wired]] described her as &quot;on the front lines in battling the [[USA PATRIOT Act]],&quot; particularly the provisions that allow warrantless searches of library records. The act not only prohibits libraries from notifying the subjects of such searches, it prohibits them from disclosing to the public whether any such searches have been made. In protest, West created a number of [[warrant canary|notices]] that libraries can post which she suggests are &quot;technically legal.&quot; One of them, for example, reads: &quot;The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has not been here. Watch very closely for the removal of this sign.&quot; The [[Vermont Library Association]] provided copies of this sign to every public library in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
