Chicksands was the site of [[Royal Air force|RAF]] Chicksands, an RAF [[Signals Intelligence|signals collection]] station during and after World War II; during the war it was one of the &quot;Y-Stations&quot; which sent intercepted signals to the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]], where ciphers and codes of several [[Axis Powers|Axis]] countries were decrypted, most importantly the ciphers generated by the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] machines.  The station was used by the [[United States Air Force]] from 1950 to 1995, also for signals collection, being the location for its first {{convert|1443|ft|m}} diameter [[FLR-9]] direction finding antenna, commonly known as the Elephant Cage, from 1963 to 1995.
