'''''Up the Dose''''' is the second and final album by the five-piece [[nu metal]]/[[alternative metal]] music group [[Skrape]]. The album was released on January 13, 2004, after it was initially scheduled for a September 2003 release. Unlike their debut album, ''Up the Dose'' steered away from the band's previous more nu metal sound focusing more on melodic vocals while still keeping the signature groove and rock hooks.
