This is a '''list of [[explorer]]s from the [[Russian Federation]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Tsardom of Russia]] and other Russian predecessor states''', including ethnic [[Russians]] and people of other ethnicities. This list also includes those who were born in Russia but later emigrated, and those who were born elsewhere but immigrated to the country and participated in its exploration activities.

At {{convert|17075400|km2|sqmi}}, Russia is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|largest country in the world]], covering more than a ninth of the [[Earth]]âs land mass. In the times of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russian Empire]] the country's share in the world's land mass reached 1/6. Most of these territories were first discovered by Russian explorers (if, of course, we don't count indigenous peoples of inhabited territories). Apart from their discoveries in [[Siberia]], [[Alaska]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far North (Russia)|Extreme North]], Russians have made significant contributions to the exploration of the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]], the [[Pacific]] islands, as well as [[deep-sea exploration|deep-sea]] and [[space exploration|space]] exploration.

For the full plain list of Russian explorers on Wikipedia, see [[:Category:Russian explorers]]. See also the [[list of Russian and Soviet cosmonauts]]; several [[cosmonaut]]s, who've set [[List of spaceflight records|important records]], are listed here.

|Returning from the [[East Indies]], Bering joined the [[Russian Navy]] in 1703. He became '''the main organiser of the [[Great Northern Expedition]]''' to explore the northern Asia. In 1725, Bering went overland to [[Okhotsk]], crossed to [[Kamchatka]], and aboard ''[[St. Gabriel|Sviatoi Gavriil]]'' '''mapped some 3500&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Bering Sea]] coast''' and passed [[Bering Strait]] in 1728-29. Later, [[Ivan Fyodorov (navigator)|Ivan Fyodorov]] and [[Mikhail Gvozdev]] aboard the same ''Sv. Gavriil'' sighted [[Alaska]] shore in 1732. Having organised a major [[Second Kamchatka expedition]], Bering and [[Aleksei Chirikov]] sailed from [[Okhotsk]] in 1740 aboard ''[[St. Peter|Sv. Piotr]]'' and ''[[Paul of Tarsus|Sv. Pavel]]'', '''founded [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]] in Kamchatka''', and headed together to [[North America]] in 1741, until separated by storm. Bering '''discovered the southern coast of [[Alaska]]''', landed near [[Kayak Island|Kayak]] and '''discovered the [[Aleutian Islands]]'''. [[Aleksei Chirikov|Chirikov]] discovered the shores of America near [[Aleksander Archipelago]] and safely returned to Asia. Bering, however, became very ill and his ship was driven to an uninhabited follow-up [[Bering Island]] of the [[Commander Islands|Commander]] group. Bering died there, along with part of his crew. The rest built a vessel out of the wreckage of ''Sv. Piotr'' and escaped to [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]].&lt;ref name=britannica11&gt;[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/edens/kamchatka/bering.html PBS story of Bering's expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://beringisland.ru/history/peoples/bering.shtm Bering, Vitus]{{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[Bering Strait]], the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Island]], [[Bering Glacier]] and the [[Bering Land Bridge]] bear the Bering's name.&lt;/small&gt;

Nagurski failed to find the expeditions, but he became '''the first polar aviator in history''', and his experience was of much value to the subsequent polar flights.

|In 1848 Nevelskoy led the expedition in the [[Russian Far East]], exploring the area of [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Amur Liman]] (which he found possible to sail through on the [[tall ship]]s). He '''proved that the [[Strait of Tartary]] was not a gulf, but indeed a strait''', connected to [[Amur River|Amur]]'s estuary by a narrow section later called [[Nevelskoy Strait]]. Not knowing about the efforts of [[Japan]]ese navigator [[Mamiya Rinzo]] who explored the same area forty years earlier, the Russians took Nevelskoy's report as the first proof that Sakhalin is indeed an island. In 1850 Nevelskoy '''founded [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur]]''', the first Russian settlement in the lower [[Amur River]] region. He also founded several military posts on [[Sakhalin]]. For that Nevelskoy is credited as one of the key figures in the Russian colonisation of [[Primorsky Krai]] and [[Sakhalin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/military/admiral/nevelskoy/index.html Nevelskoy's biography] at peoples.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Nevelskoy Strait]], a city of [[Nevelsk]] on [[Sakhalin]] and Nevelskoy Marine State University in [[Vladivostok]] have been named after Gennady Nevelskoy.&lt;/small&gt;

|In 1466, Nikitin left his hometown of [[Tver]] on a [[commerce|commercial]] trip to [[India]]. He traveled down the [[Volga River]], reached [[Derbent]], then [[Baku]] and later [[Persian Empire|Persia]] by crossing the [[Caspian Sea]], where he lived for a year. In 1469 Nikitin arrived to [[Ormus]] and then, crossing the [[Arabian Sea]], reached the sultanate of [[Bahmani]], where he lived for 3 years. On his way back, Nikitin visited the [[Africa]]n continent ([[Somalia]]), [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Trabzon]] and in 1472 arrived at [[Feodosiya]] by crossing the [[Black Sea]]. Thus Nikitin became '''one of the first [[Europe]]ans to travel to and to document his visit to [[India]]'''. He described his trip in a narrative known as''' ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]'' '''(''Khozheniye za tri morya''). Nikitin had studied the population of India, its [[social]] system, [[government]], military (he witnessed war-games featuring [[war elephant]]s), its [[Economic system|economy]], [[religion]], lifestyles, and natural resources. Nikitin's book provide a valuable source of information about India at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/itihas/nikitin.htm Nikitin - The first Russian traveler to India] by Dr. Jyotsna Kamat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are monuments to Nikitin in his hometown of [[Tver]] and in [[Revdanda]] near [[Mumbai]] in [[India]]. In 1958, [[Mosfilm]] produced a film ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''. In 2006-07, the Indian organization ''&quot;Adventures &amp; Explorers&quot;'' sponsored the &quot;Nikitin Expedition&quot;, in which 14 travellers set out from [[Tver]] to retrace Nikitin's [[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas|journey beyond the three seas]].&lt;/small&gt;

In [[Central Asia]] he '''explored the [[Kara Kum]] Desert, the shores of the [[Amu Darya]] River, and the old riverbeds of the [[Uzbois]]'''. In 1892-94 Obruchev took part in the [[Grigory Potanin]]'s expedition to [[Mongolia]] and [[North China]]. He '''explored the [[Transbaikal]] area, [[Dzhungaria]] and [[Altai Mountains]]'''. Having '''spent half a century in exploring Siberia and Inner Asia''', Obruchev summarized his findings in the extensive work ''The Geology of Siberia''. He studied the origins of [[loess]], the [[ice]] formation and [[permafrost]], and the [[tectonics]] of [[Siberia]]. All together, he authored over a thousand scientific works. Obruchev is also known as '''the author of two popular [[science fiction]] novels, ''[[Hollow Earth|Plutonia]]'' (1915) and ''[[Sannikov Land]]'' (1924)'''.

In 1910 he '''explored the Krestovaya Bay on [[Novaya Zemlya]]'''. He suggested a [[sleigh]] expedition to the [[North Pole]] and found the independent sponsors, as the government refused in the finance. In 1912 Sedov's ship ''&quot;Svyatoy Muchenik Foka&quot; (Saint Martyr Foka)'' sailed north but had to stay for the winter near [[Novaya Zemlya]] because of impassable ice. ''Sv.

In early 1914, Sedov, sick with [[scurvy]], with two companions set off for the [[North Pole]] with the draft dogs. Near [[Rudolf Island]] Sedov died and was buried there, at Cape Auk.

|Semyonov is known for his explorations of the then largely unknown mountains of the [[Tian Shan]]. In 1856-57 he passed through the [[Altay Mountains]], visited the [[Issyk Kul]] and came to the Tian Shan. Semyonov '''was the first European to see the peak of [[Khan Tengri]]'''. He disproved [[Alexander Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s earlier claims about Tian Shan's supposed volcanic origins. The next year, he '''published the first systematic description of the [[Tian Shan]]'''. The reputation of this monograph was such that half a century later [[Nicholas II of Russia]] authorized him to add the epithet &quot;Tian-Shansky&quot; (that is, &quot;of Tian Shan&quot;) to his last name. For many years Semyonov served as Chairman of the Russia's Central Committee for Statistics. It was largely due to his efforts that the first [[census]] of the [[Russian Empire]] was held in 1897. Semyonov amassed a large collection of old Dutch masters, which now belongs to the [[Hermitage Museum]] as well as insect collection of ca. 700,000 specimens.

|A count from the well-known [[Tolstoy]] family, Fyodor Tolstoy was famous for his unusual temper, gambling and passion for duels. In 1803 Tolstoy '''took part in the first Russian circumnavigation of the world''' on [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Nadezhda'' , captained by [[Ivan Krusenstern]]. However, multiple quarrels with other members of the team and very bad behaviour, including the successful teaching a pet [[orangutan]] of how to cover the captain's longbook in ink, caused Tolstoy to be abandoned on a stop in [[Kamchatka]] with aforementioned ape, whose later fate is unknown. On a different ship Tolstoy managed to get into [[Sitka, Alaska]], where he spent several months among Alaskan natives of the Tlinkit tribe and acquired multiple [[tattoo]]s. Finally he returned to [[St Petersburg]] via Kamchatka and [[Siberia]]. His voyage to [[North America]] earned him nickname ''the American'' and a legendary celebrity due to the tales and gossip of his adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/slovo/2004/43/vv4.html|publisher=Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¶ÑÑÐ½Ð°Ð»|title={{lang|ru|Ð¤.Ð.

Subsequently Wrangel led the Kolymskaya expedition in 1820-24 in search of northern lands. He established that north of the [[Kolyma River]] there was an open sea, not dry land, as previously thought. Together with [[Fyodor Matyushkin]] and P.

He '''was the governor of [[Russian America]]''' in 1829-35, the president of the [[Russian-American Company]] in 1840-49 and the [[Heads of military of Imperial Russia#Ministry of Sea Forces|Minister of the Navy]] in 1855-57. In 1845 he became one of the founders of the [[Russian Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vehi.net/brokgauz/index.html|publisher=Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary|title={{lang|ru|ÐÑÐ°Ð½Ð³ÐµÐ»Ñ, Ð¤ÐµÑÐ´Ð¸Ð½Ð°Ð½Ð´ ÐÐµÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ}}|trans_title=Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel|accessdate=2011-04-05|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]], [[Wrangell Island]] in [[Alexander Archipelago]] near [[Alaska]] and [[Wrangell, Alaska|a city]] there, [[Wrangell Narrows]] channel in the Alexander Archipelago, [[Cape Wrangell]] of [[Attu Island]] (the westernmost point of Alaska and the continental [[USA]]) and [[Mount Wrangell]] (a [[volcano]] in Alaska) were named after Wrangel.&lt;/small&gt;

|Under a contract with Russian Geographical Society, Yadrintsev twice traveled across [[Siberia]] and [[Altai Republic|Altai]], researching economy and geography, archeology and ethnography, anthropology and linguistics. In 1889 he '''located the remains of medieval city Hara-Balgas and the [[Genghis Khan]]'s capital [[Karakorum]] in [[Mongolia]]'''. In the valley of the [[Orkhon River]] Yadrintsev''' discovered the [[Orkhon script]] of ancient TÃ¼rks''' on two petroglyphic monuments with runiform writing, later decoded by the Danish scientist [[Vilhelm Thomsen]]. In 1891 Yadrintsev took part in the expedition led by [[turkologist]] academician [[Vasily Radlov]], finding more monuments of TÃ¼rkic runiform writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altaiinter.info/project/culture/Researchers/Personnels/Jadrincev/jadr01.htm|work=altaiinter.info|title=Yadrintsev's biography|language=Russian|accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of streets in Siberian cities and a settlement in [[Omsk Oblast]] were named after Yadrintsev.&lt;/small&gt;

|Around 1577, the merchants [[Stroganovs]], who were the main colonisers of the [[Urals]], hired the [[Cossack]] leader [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from attacks of the Siberian [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated Kuchum's main forces on [[Irtysh River]] after a 3-day battle [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppes]] and Yermak '''captured the [[Siberia Khanate]]''', including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. Russians had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having '''explored all the main river routes of central [[West Siberian Plain|West Siberia]]''', they successfully returned all Yermak's conquests just several years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;yermak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ring-siberia.ru/ermak|publisher={{lang|ru|ÐÐ¾Ð»ÑÑÐ¾ Ð¡Ð¸Ð±Ð¸ÑÐ¸}}|title=Yermak.

|In 1835â38 Zavoyko twice circumnavigated the globe. After 1840, during his service for the [[Russian-American Company]] in the [[Okhotsk Sea]], Zavoyko '''explored the [[estuary]] of the [[Amur River]]'''. His reports led to further expeditions and ultimately the incorporation of [[Primorsky Krai]] into Russia. In 1854, at the time of [[Crimean War]], as a governor of [[Kamchatka]] Zavoyko led the successful defence during the [[Siege of Petropavlovsk]]. He repelled the superior allied [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[France|French]] forces and even captured the [[Union Jack|British banner]]. In 1855, making the way through the frozen seas and successfully avoiding the large enemy fleet, he supervised the transfer of the [[Russian Pacific Fleet]] from Petropavlovsk to [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vehi.net/brokgauz/index.html|publisher=[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]|title={{lang|ru|ÐÐ°Ð²Ð¾Ð¹ÐºÐ¾}}|trans_title=Savoyko|language=Russian|accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A settlement near [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] (now a city district) is named after Zavoyko.&lt;/small&gt;
