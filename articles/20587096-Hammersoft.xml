The '''World Powerlifting Congress''' (WPC) is a [[powerlifting]] federation hosting meets around the world. The federation hosts competitions which allow multi-ply equipment, but hosted a Raw world championship for the first time in 2009. 

The WPC was established in 1986 and has affiliates in 30 countries.

Hosting both tested and untested (under the AWPC banner) competitions, the WPC is known better as a federation made by lifters for lifters. The competitive season comes to an end each year in November, as qualified lifters from different countries compete in the annual world championship.

The [[United States]] affiliate for the WPC is the American Powerlifting Federation (APF). The APF has several series of qualifying competitions that allow athletes to advance from the local/state level, to the national level, and then finally to the international level; the WPC/WPO. The WPO is the professional division of the WPC that provides meets with cash prizes for the higher ranking athletes of the WPC.  
The [[United Kingdom|British]] affiliate is known as the BPC (British Powerlifting Congress).
