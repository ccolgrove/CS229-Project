'''Siri''' ({{IPA-en|ËsÉªri|pron}}) is an [[intelligent software assistant]] and [[knowledge navigator]] functioning as a [[personal assistant]] application for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. The application uses a [[natural language user interface]] to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of [[web services]]. Siri claims that the software adapts to the user's individual preferences over time and personalizes results, as well as accomplishing tasks such as making dinner reservations and reserving a cab.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html |title=iPhone 4S - Ask Siri to help you get things done |publisher=Apple |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2011}}

Siri was originally introduced as an [[iOS]] application available in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. Siri was acquired by [[Apple Inc.]] on April 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=April 28, 2010 |url=http://scobleizer.com/2010/04/28/breaking-news-siri-bought-by-apple/ |title=BREAKING NEWS: Siri bought by Apple |publisher=Scobleizer.com |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siri had announced that their software would be available for BlackBerry and for Android-powered phones, but all development efforts for non-Apple platforms were cancelled after Apple's purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Timothy Hay |url=http://www.advfn.com/nasdaq/StockNews.asp?stocknews=NUAN&amp;article=41425250&amp;headline=siri-inc-launches-do-engine-application-for-iphone |title=Siri Inc. Launches 'Do Engine' Application For iPhone |publisher=Dow Jones Newswire |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri is now an integrated part of [[iOS 5]], and available only on the [[iPhone 4S]], launched on  October 4th 2011, the day before [[Steve Jobs]] died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Darren Murph |url= http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/04/iphone-4s-hands-on/ |title=&quot;iPhone 4S hands-on! |publisher=Engadget |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, hackers were able to adapt Siri in previous iPhones. On November 8, 2011, Apple publicly announced that it had no plans to support Siri on any of its older devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jake Smith |url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/11/08/apple-confirms-siri-isnt-coming-to-any-other-devices-as-of-now/ |title=Apple confirms Siri isnât coming to any other devices as of now &amp;#124; 9to5Mac &amp;#124; Apple Intelligence |publisher=9to5Mac |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Independent developers claim that they ported Siri to [[iPhone 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Gurman |url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/14/siri-voice-command-system-ported-from-iphone-4s-to-iphone-4-video/ |title=Siri voice command system ported from iPhone 4S to iPhone 4 (video) &amp;#124; 9to5Mac &amp;#124; Apple Intelligence |publisher=9to5Mac |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmed Omar |url=http://cydiahelp.com/siri-ported-successfully-to-the-iphone-4-video/ |title=Siri Ported Successfully To The iPhone 4 (VIDEO) |publisher=Cydiahelp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some news sites consider that the videos they posted for proof only show the [[user interface]] of the application, excluding any voice commands, to conclude that they did not prove anything.&lt;ref name=&quot;mondeinfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lemondeinformatique.fr/actualites/lire-un-hacker-irlandais-pretend-porter-siri-sur-iphone-4-42294.html |title=Un hacker irlandais prÃ©tend porter Siri sur iPhone 4 |publisher=http://www.lemondeinformatique.fr |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2011-10-23| quote=''Cependant, aucune des vidÃ©os, celle de Steve Troughton-Smith ou celle de 9-to-5 Mac, ne montre Siri en action ou ne prÃ©sente un utilisateur essayant d'interagir avec les commandes vocales de Siri (However, neither video shows Siri in action or does a user attempting to interact with voice commands Siri)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new sources suggests that the independent developers are able to port Siri to the [[iPhone 4]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Gurman |url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/29/siri-hacked-to-fully-run-on-the-iphone-4-and-ipod-touch-iphone-4s-vs-iphone-4-siri-showdown-video-interview/#more-103752 |title=Siri hacked to fully run on the iPhone 4 and iPod touch, iPhone 4S vs iPhone 4 Siri showdown video (interview) &amp;#124; 9to5Mac &amp;#124; Apple Intelligence |publisher=9to5Mac |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Founding==
Siri was founded in 2007 by [[Dag Kittlaus]] (CEO), [[Adam Cheyer]] (VP Engineering), and Tom Gruber (CTO/VP Design), together with Norman Winarsky from [[SRI International]]'s venture group.  On October 13, 2008, Siri announced it had raised an $8.5 million Series A financing round, led by [[Menlo Ventures]] and [[Morgenthaler Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lardinois |first=Frederic |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/semantic_stealth_startup_siric.php |title=Semantic Stealth Startup Siri Raises $8.5 Million |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, Siri raised a $15.5 million Series B financing round from the same investors as in their previous round, but led by Hong-Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-shing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/a-personal-assistant-on-your-iphone/ A Personal Assistant on Your iPhone].&lt;/ref&gt; Dag Kittlaus left his position as CEO of Siri at Apple after the launch of the iPhone 4S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/10/24/siri_co_founder_leaves_apple_following_iphone_4s_launch.html |title=Siri co-founder leaves Apple following iPhone 4S launch |publisher=AppleInsider |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DARPA involvement==
With Siri, Apple is using the results of over 40 years of research funded by [[DARPA]] via [[SRI International]]âs [[Artificial Intelligence Center]] through the Personalized Assistant that Learns Program and Cognitive Agent that Learns and Organizes Program [[CALO]].  

This includes the combined work from research teams from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of Massachusetts]], the [[University of Rochester]], the [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]], [[Oregon State University]], the [[University of Southern California]], and [[Stanford University]].  This technology has come a long way with dialog and [[natural language understanding]], [[machine learning]], evidential and probabilistic reasoning, [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] and knowledge representation, planning, reasoning and service delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Siri-product/Why-is-Siri-important?q=Why+sir|title=Why is Siri important|publisher=Brian Roemmele|date=2011-10-10|accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==iOS integration==
{{main|iPhone 4S#Siri}}
It was announced on October 4, 2011 that Siri is included with the [[iPhone 4S]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8804922/Apple-iPhone-event-live.html |title=Apple iPhone 4S event: as it happened |publisher=Telegraph |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version of Siri is integrated into iOS, and offers conversational interaction with many applications, including reminders, weather, stocks, messaging, email, calendar, contacts, notes, music, clocks, web browser, [[Wolfram Alpha]], and maps.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple1&quot;/&gt; Currently, Siri only supports English (US, UK, Australian), German and French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Viticci |first=Federico |url=http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-officially-unveils-siri-voice-assistant/ |title=Apple Officially Unveils Siri Voice Assistant â Supports English, French and German |publisher=Macstories.net |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has limited functionality outside the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Viticci |first=Federico |url=http://www.macstories.net/news/there-are-some-siri-limitations-outside-the-us/ |title=There Are Some Siri Limitations Outside The US |publisher=Macstories.net |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After announcing that Siri is included with the iPhone 4S, Apple removed the existing Siri app (which ran on all iPhone models) from the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/with-new-siri-promised-for-iphone-4s-apple-pulls-existing-siri-from-app-store-95634 |title=With New Siri Promised For iPhone 4S, Apple Pulls Existing Siri From App Store, and all existing Siri servers will be stopped on October 15th.|author=Danny Sullivan }} &lt;/ref&gt; Some users have been able to port Siri back to a [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken]] iPhone 4, bypassing a filter on Apple's servers intended to prevent earlier models from using Siri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Gurman |url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/29/siri-hacked-to-fully-run-on-the-iphone-4-and-ipod-touch-iphone-4s-vs-iphone-4-siri-showdown-video-interview/ |title=Siri hacked to fully run on the iPhone 4 and iPod touch, iPhone 4S vs iPhone 4 Siri showdown video (interview) &amp;#124; 9to5Mac &amp;#124; Apple Intelligence |publisher=9to5Mac |date=2011-10-29 |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
Siri is a spin-out from the [[SRI International]] Artificial Intelligence Center, and is an offshoot of the DARPA-funded [[CALO]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://tist.acm.org |title=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (ACM TIST)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Berry |first=Pauline M. |last2=Gervasio | first2=Melinda|last3=Peintner|first3=Bart | last4=Yorke-Smith | first4=Neil |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1989734.1989744 |title=PTIME: Personalized assistance for calendaring|journal=ACM TIST|volume=2 |issue=4 |date=July 2011 |doi=10.1145/1989734.1989744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri's primary technical areas focus on a Conversational Interface, Personal Context Awareness, and Service Delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/42420/what-is-siri-iphone-4s |title=What is Siri? Apple's iPhone 4S assistant explained |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri's [[speech recognition]] engine is thought to be provided by [[Nuance Communications]], a speech technology company, although this has not been officially acknowledged by either Apple or Nuance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techpinions.com/nuance-exec-on-iphone-4s-siri-and-the-future-of-speech/3307 |title=Nuance Exec on iPhone 4S, Siri, and the Future of Speech |publisher=Tech.pinions |date=10 October 2011 |accessdate
=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri personal assistant for the United Kingdom is called &quot;Daniel&quot; who is voiced by [[Jon Briggs]], a former technology journalist who recorded âDanielâ for Scansoft, who merged with [[Nuance Communications]], a company that works on Siri with Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8879705/The-voice-behind-Siri-breaks-his-silence.html |title=The voice behind Siri breaks his silence |publisher=The Telegraph |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri's actions and answers rely upon a growing ecosystem of partners, including:
* [[OpenTable]], [[Gayot]], [[CitySearch]], [[BooRah]], [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]], Yahoo Local, [[ReserveTravel]], [[Localeze]] for restaurant and business questions and actions;
* [[Eventful]], [[StubHub]], and [[LiveKick]] for events and concert information;
* [[MovieTickets]], [[RottenTomatoes]] and the [[New York Times]] for movie information and reviews;
* [[Bing Answers]], and [[Wolfram Alpha]] for factual [[question answering]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html |title=Apple Siri |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bing]], [[Yahoo]] and [[Google]] for web search.

==Reception==
Siri was met with a very positive reaction for its ease of use and practicality, as well as its sassy &quot;personality&quot;.  [[Google]]âs executive chairman and former chief, [[Eric Schmidt]], has conceded that Siri could pose a &quot;competitive threat&quot; to the companyâs core search business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Schmidt |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/eric-schmidt/8873664/Googles-Eric-Schmidt-Apples-Siri-could-pose-threat.html |title=Google's Eric Schmidt: Apple's Siri could pose 'threat' |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google generates a large portion of its revenue from clickable ad links returned in the context of searches.  The threat comes from the fact that Siri is a non-visual medium, therefore not affording users with the opportunity to be exposed to the clickable ad links. Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', journalist [[Charlie Brooker]] described Siri as &quot;a creep â a servile arselick with zero self-respect&quot; while also noting that &quot;he works annoyingly well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian gadget addiction&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/01/charlie-brooker-dark-side-gadget-addiction-black-mirror | title=Charlie Brooker: the dark side of our gadget addiction | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=December 01, 2011 | accessdate=December 02, 2011 | author=Brooker, Charlie | quote=Siri is a creep â a servile arselick with zero self-respect â but he works annoyingly well. | authorlink=Charlie Brooker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Siri was criticized by organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] after users found that it would not provide information about the location of birth control or abortion providers, sometimes directing users to anti-abortion [[crisis pregnancy center]]s instead. Apple responded that this was a glitch which would be fixed in the final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Slate |url=http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/11/30/apple_iphone_s_siri_doesn_t_locate_abortion_clinics.html |title=Apple Says Siri's Abortion-Clinic Blind Spot Wasn't Intentional |date=December 1, 2011 |first=Greg |last=Howard |first2=Josh |last2=Voorhees}}&lt;/ref&gt;
