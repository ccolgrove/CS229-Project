It was written by the band and was included as the seventh track on their album ''[[Whammy!]]'' (1983);&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1077/review|pure_url=yes}} ''Whammy!'': Allmusic Review]&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, it was later released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their [[single (music)|single]] &quot;[[Legal Tender (song)|Legal Tender]]&quot;. 

Originally, &quot;Don't Worry&quot;, a [[cover version]] of the [[Yoko Ono]] song &quot;Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking For Her Hand in the Snow)&quot; from her 1971 album ''[[Fly (Yoko Ono album)|Fly]]'', was included as the closing track of ''Whammy!''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christgau&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=204|title=Robert Christgau Review - B-52's: ''Whammy!''|year=1983|accessdate=2010-03-16|publisher=Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics|last=Christgau|first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to legal issues with Ono, the track with withdrawn and replaced with &quot;Moon 83&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; 

Essentially, &quot;Moon 83&quot; is a [[remixed]] version of the track &quot;There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)&quot;, originally included on their 1979 eponymous debut album ''[[The B-52's (album)|The B-52's]]''. The [[percussion]] in &quot;Moon 83&quot; is largely [[synthesized]]; certain parts of the song briefly feature [[bongo drum|bongos]]. The main [[vocals]] are shared by [[Fred Schneider]], [[Kate Pierson]], and [[Cindy Wilson]], who repeat the words &quot;This is the [[Space Age]]&quot; while Schneider's voice repeatedly echoes the words &quot;Others like you.&quot;
