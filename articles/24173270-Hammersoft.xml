'''Jetix''' was a television channel owned by The Walt Disney Company that was aimed at children ages six to 14. Jetix was available in many countries around the world in a localized form, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]]. It was previously known as '''[[Fox Kids]]'''.

Jetix was available as a timeshift hour-delay channel named Jetix+1. The channel was carried by [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital]], [[Virgin Media]], and [[Tiscali TV (UK)|Tiscali TV]] in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland on Sky Digital, and [[Magnet Networks]]. The channel was available in Iceland on [[Skjarinn]] and in Malta on [[Melita]] (It still airing as Disney XD).
On [[August 31]], [[2009]], Jetix in the UK was rebranded as Disney XD, following its US counterpart and in keeping with the European Jetix channels.

==History==
Fox Kids initially launched on [[October 19]], [[1996]]. Broadcast hours were between the hours of 6&amp;nbsp;am and 7&amp;nbsp;pm and timesharing with [[Sky 2]] and later [[National Geographic Channel (UK)|National Geographic Channel]]. Eventually, broadcasting hours were extended to 10&amp;nbsp;pm, and, on [[November 3]], 2003, the channel began broadcasting 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

In April 2004, the Jetix brand was gently introduced to the UK and Ireland in the form of a programming block on [[Fox Kids]]. The Jetix programming line-up aired every day between the hours of 3&amp;nbsp;pm and 7&amp;nbsp;pm. In September 2004, the block was also included in the morning line-up, airing between the hours of 7&amp;nbsp;am and 9&amp;nbsp;am.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The Jetix block featured the following programmes; ''[[Shaman King]]'', ''[[Sonic X]]'', ''[[Digimon]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]'', ''[[Totally Spies]]'', ''[[Black Hole High]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[MegaMan: NT Warrior]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|Donkey Kong Country]]'', ''[[Martin Mystery]]'', ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'''' and ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]'' plus 2-minute shorts of ''[[Shin Chan]]'' episodes.

Fox Kids rebranded as Jetix on [[January 1]], [[2005]]. The Jetix programming blocks were dropped, and the shows that it contained were integrated into the normal programming schedule. Shortly after the rebranding, a new early-evening block was introduced named &quot;Jetix Max&quot;. The Jetix Max slot included such shows as; ''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]'', ''[[Totally Spies]]'', ''[[Martin Mystery]]'', ''[[Funky Cops]]'', ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[PXG]]'' and ''[[Black Hole High]]''. The Jetix Max slot was dropped in June 2006, although it remainded on other Jetix channels around Europe.

==Censorship==
As Jetix was aimed at children aged 6 to 14, some shows were edited for content that is considered violent, scary or contains flashing images. Many of these edits have been brief and thus would not have been noticed had they not aired on other channels uncensored.  The most notable edits are present on the anime ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[MegaMan NT Warrior]]'', and ''[[Power Rangers]]''.

==Jetix VOD==
Since the launch of ''[[Pucca]]'' on Jetix (mid way though July 2006), Jetix has offered an online &quot;Video On Demand&quot; service,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jetix.co.uk/vod/layout.html?defaultTab=0&lt;/ref&gt;  allowing viewers to watch &quot;Exclusive to web&quot; ''Pucca'' Shorts (Titled &quot;Pucca: Funny â¥ Love&quot;). Adverts for the TV episodes of ''Pucca'' run before and after each short. Since the UK TV airing of [[Power Rangers Mystic Force]], all ''Pucca: Funny â¥ Love'' episodes have been replaced with clips of Power Rangers: Mystic Force (Interestingly enough, on AOL Browsers, debug information is also shown).

Similarly to [[Toonami|Toonami (US)'s]] Toonami Jetstream Service, Jetix VOD is exclusive to the United Kingdom and Internet Explorer (5.0 and later) users. Attempting to launch the service ether from outside the UK (Or rather, not using a UK [[IP address]]) or using a non Internet Explorer [[web browser]] will lead to an error message being displayed and the service not running.

==Magazine==
Future Publishing publishes the official Jetix Magazine. Released every four weeks, the magazine featured puzzles and features based on the channel's characters as well as a six page Power Rangers comic. New issues contained a Sonic X comic based on the current Sonic X comic series by Archie. The magazine frequently included a free DVD featuring shows from the channel. Since 3 September the magazine would become Nitro! due to Jetix rebranding as Disney XD. The magazine would still offer four free gifts per issue  however it will cover all major children's content rather than the content on Jetix.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandrepublic.com/Industry/Media/News/920596/Future-rebrands-Jetix-Magazine-Nitro/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disney XD rebrand==
Following the launch of [[Disney XD]] in the US, [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] confirmed that Disney XD would launch in the UK on [[August 31]], 2009, replacing Jetix. On [[August 12]], [[2009]] the Jetix on-screen logo was removed and replaced with the Disney XD logo counting down the days to the launch. &lt;ref&gt;http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=28575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney XD&quot;&gt;

The channel launched the original series [[Aaron Stone]], animated series [[Phineas and Ferb]], live-action series [[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]. The channel continued to air shows that previously aired on Jetix, such as PokÃ©mon Battle Dimension, [[Kid vs. Kat]], [[Phil of the Future]], [[American Dragon: Jake Long]] and [[Jimmy Two-Shoes]].
