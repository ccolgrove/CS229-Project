[[File:William F. Kirk of Milwaukee.jpg|thumb|William F. Kirk 1904]]
'''William Frederick Kirk''' (1877-1927) was a well-known poet, songwriter, humorist and baseball writer. &lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times March 26, 1927&quot;&gt;''New York Times'' March 26, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; A longtime newspaperman, he first worked at ''the Chippewa Falls Herald'' and the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|'' Milwaukee Sentinel'']]. 

In 1905 he signed a contract with the Hearst organization and moved to New York, where he was employed at two of [[William Randolph Hearst|William Randolph Hearst's]] papers: the [[New York Journal American|''New York American'']] and the [[New York Journal American|''New York Evening Journal'']]. &lt;ref&gt;''Johnny Kling: A Baseball Biography'' by Gil Bogen, (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  After returning to [[Chippewa Falls]] in 1918 he continued working as a nationally syndicated columnist. &lt;ref&gt;''Ironwood Daily Globe'' March 25, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk was born in [[Mankato, Minnesota]] in 1877 and came to [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin]] at the age of four. He graduated from high school there and began his career in journalism on a local paper.  His humor column, âFleeting Fanciesâ, was a popular feature at ''the Chippewa Falls Herald''  and later at the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|''Milwaukee Sentinel'']]. &lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times March 26, 1927&quot; /&gt; It brought him to the attention of metropolitan dailies and was the name of his first book, published in 1904.  Kirk's lyrics drew comparisons with those of other poets, whose work he sometimes parodied: [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Eugene Field]] and [[James Whitcomb Riley]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Syracuse Post-Standard'' June 17, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

For eighteen years Kirk was distributed by the International Features Syndicate and reached a national audience as he wrote on subjects as diverse as baseball, [[temperance movement|temperance]], [[women's suffrage]] and divorce. &lt;ref&gt;''Johnny Kling: A Baseball Biography'' by Gil Bogen, (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; His pieces were seen in everything from â[[The Smart Set]]â to trade union publications.

Recent works on baseball's [[deadball era]] have had numerous samples of Kirkâs sports writing. One can, for instance, read his account of [[Fred Merkle]]'s infamous blunder &lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Armchair Book of Baseball'' edited by John Thorn, (New York: Galahad Books, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; or his rhyming tribute to the Flying Dutchman, [[Honus Wagner]]. &lt;ref&gt;''Honus Wagner: The Life of Baseball's Flying Dutchman'' by Arthur D. Hittner, (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Unforgettable Season'' by [[Gordon H. Fleming]] recounts the 1908 National League pennant race through contemporary press coverage by Kirk and others. &lt;ref&gt;''The Unforgettable Season'' by Gordon H. Fleming, (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he published a collection of baseball ballads called ''Right Off The Bat''.

In 1918 Kirk moved back to [[Chippewa Falls]], desiring to live among old friends in his boyhood home.  He belonged to several fraternal organizations and was a prominent figure in the town. &lt;ref&gt;''Ironwood Daily Globe'' March 25, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Failing health caused his early retirement, and after an illness of many months he died of cancer in 1927. &lt;ref&gt;''Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune'' April 05, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Norsk Nightingale==
[[File:Norsk Nightingale 1905.jpg|thumb|The Norsk Nightingale 1905]]
William F. Kirk is especially remembered for his Scandinavian dialect poetry, written for a daily column and later published in book form. His byline, âThe Norsk Nightingaleâ, was a familiar sight in newspapers across the country.  His first collection of dialect verse,  ''The Norsk Nightingale'', &lt;ref&gt;''The Norsk Nightingale'' by William F. Kirk, (New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1905).&lt;/ref&gt; presented a Norwegian lumberjack from the [[Upper Midwest]]. It was his most popular book with sixteen editions printed over a period of thirty-five years. At the time of its publication one reviewer wrote: âNovelty and freshness, and no little ingenuity as a parodist, salute us in this volume of dialect verse hailing from the haunts of the lumberjack or, more locally, northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, where dwell so many neo-Americans of Scandinavian birth.â &lt;ref&gt;''The Critic and Literary World'' (New York: G.P. Putnamâs Sons, 1905) p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His second volume of dialect verse, ''Songs of Sergeant Swanson'', &lt;ref&gt;''Songs of Sergeant Swanson'' by William F. Kirk, (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company, 1918).&lt;/ref&gt; reflected the experiences of a Swedish-American [[doughboy]] in World War I. A book of more limited appeal, it only had one edition.           

Kirk's ethnic poetry put forth the notion that Scandinavian-Americans were good-natured but a little slow.  This humorous stereotype had been employed in the 1890s by the playwright Gus Heege in such theatrical works as âOle Olsonâ and âYon Yonsonâ.&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre History Studies'' edited by Rhona Justice-Malloy, (Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 2008). Volume 28, pp. 64 - 111 .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandinavian dialect humor==
[[File:Yon Yonson.jpg|thumb|Yon Yonson 1899]]
Scandinavian dialect humor took other forms: [[vaudeville]] sketches, joke books, movies, records and sheet music. In quick succession [[Tin Pan Alley]] published âHello Wisconsinâ, âHoly Yumpin Yiminyâ and âScandinavia&quot; (Sing Dose Song And Make Dose Music). The popular recording artists [[Eleonora and Ethel Olson]] were known for their warm depictions of immigrant life in such stories as âThe Old Sogning Womanâ and âA Norwegian Woman Using the Telephoneâ.

[[El Brendel]], [[Yogi Yorgesson]], Stan Boreson and countless others have followed in Kirkâs footsteps, and there is still a receptive audience â especially among Scandinavian-Americans â for tales of lumberjacks and sergeants with more heart than brain.
