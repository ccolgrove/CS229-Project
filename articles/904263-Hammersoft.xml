==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:Old Nine Network.svg|left|thumb|Logo used from 1978-2006]]
[[Image:Nine2006.svg|left|thumb|Logo used from 2006-2008]]
STW-9 commenced broadcasting on 12 June 1965 and was the second commercial television station in Perth. It became the first station in Perth to broadcast 24 hours a day on 17 April 1984. In the late 1980s, the station came under the ownership of Bond Media, owned by businessman [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]], and became a Nine Network [[owned and operated station]] when Bond purchased the network. In 1989 Bond Media sold the station to [[Sunraysia Television]] for [[Australian dollar|A$]]95 million. The deal also involved Bond Media purchasing the Sunraysia owned [[STV-8]] for [[Australian dollar|A$]]18 million. Bond Media was forced to sell due to the Federal cross-media ownership laws, which restricted the level of national reach for media owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Webb, Richard | title = Sunraysia settles STW-9 purchase | work = [[Australian Financial Review]] | date = 1989-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In January 2007, [[Sunraysia Television]] posted a profit warning, with an expected 12% drop in revenue over the past six months. The company cited a weak local advertising market and low ratings for the reduced revenue, despite a strong WA economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Canning, Simon | title = STW profits hit by ad drop | work = [[The Australian]] | date = 2007-10-01 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21016898-7582,00.html | accessdate = 2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The profit warning lead to speculation of a potential takeover of STW-9, with [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited|PBL]] and regional network [[WIN Television]] indicated as potential bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After PBL Media bid for the station, 45% shareholder [[WIN Television|WIN Corporation]] wanted to buy out the station itself, it lodged two bids and in June 2007 shareholders approved the sale of the station to WIN.

[[Dixie Marshall]] was previously a senior news presenter for Nine News Perth, she held the position from 2002 until 2011.

The current director of news is Stewart Richmond.

The Perth bulletin is currently the least successful ''Nine News'' bulletin in Australia, typically holding third or fourth place. This is commonly attributed to the long-standing popularity of rival station [[TVW-7]]'s ''[[TVW-7#News/Public Affairs|Seven News Perth]]'', which regularly attracts over 100,000 viewers more than ''Nine News Perth''. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Perth's A Current Affair====

In January 2008, WIN Corporation announced that a new local version of ''[[A Current Affair]]'' would be produced in Western Australia to replace the east coast version hosted by [[Tracy Grimshaw]]. Besides ''Extra'' in Brisbane, the first state based edition to the title since Adelaide in 2002, the program was initially going to be presented by former newsreader [[Sonia Vinci]], but she resigned prior to the show's commencement and was replaced by Louise Momber. The program was launched on 20 October 2008. It took the majority of its stories from the East Coast version of the show, but also has a team of journalists assembled to cover issues in Western Australia. Fill-in presenter for the show was Ebbeny Faranda. The Perth version ended in November 2009 due to poor ratings, with the east coast version returning to WA screens.

Perth's A Current Affair reporting staff included:
* Jolleh Abshar
* Simon Bailey
* John Mort
