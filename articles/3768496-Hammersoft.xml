'''Kynance Cove''' is a [[cove]] in southwest [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is situated on the [[The Lizard|Lizard peninsula]] approximately two miles (3km) north of [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]]&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey,Explorer Map 103, The Lizard, Falmouth and Helston. ISBN 9780319237045&lt;/ref&gt;. Kynance Cove and the surrounding coast are owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

The cove became popular in the early [[Victorian era]], with many distinguished visitors including [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Lord Tennyson]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objectiveone.com/client/media/media-343.htm Objective One webpage: Kynance visits by Alfred Tennyson.] &lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[BBC]] has described Kynance Cove as &quot;one of the most beautiful stretches of coastline in the South West.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/england/sevenwonders/southwest/south-west-cornwall/index.shtml BBC sevenwonders south-west-cornwall]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kynance CafÃ© (which first opened for business in 1929) relied until recently on spring water and a generator for power. When the cafÃ© became the property of the National Trust in 1999, the Trust renovated it and provided mains water and electricity.

==Serpentine rocks ==
Kynance and other nearby beaches and coves have [[Serpentine group#Lizardite|serpentine]] rock formations. The rocks of [[Serpentine group#Lizardite|green and red serpentine]], polished by the sea over thousands of years are distinctive to Kynance Cove and the Lizard Peninsula:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-thelizardandkynancecove/w-thelizardandkynancecove-seeanddo.htm  National Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; for more detail, see [[Lizard complex|Geology of The Lizard]].
