'''Kamal Abbas''' ({{lang-ar|ÙÙØ§Ù Ø¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³}}) is General Coordinator of the [[Center for Trade Unions and Workers Services]] (CTUWS), an activist group for independent unions in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dine |first=Philip |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/8/dine-egyptian-workers-key-element-in-uprising/ |title=DINE: Egyptian workers key element in uprising |work = [[The Washington Times]] |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Involved in activism for over 20 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;towardfreedom1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towardfreedom.com/home/labor/2439-roots-of-egypts-revolution-labor-unions-and-the-uprising-in-tahrir-square |title=Roots of Egyptâs Revolution: Labor Unions and the Uprising in Tahrir Square |publisher=Towardfreedom.com |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas has been active in mobilizing worker support during the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]] and its aftermath.  His approach emphasizes peaceful strikes and rallies accompanied by demands for better wages and working conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011216141815340645.html |title=Egyptians defy call to end strikes - Middle East |work = [[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more regular elections for union officials, and an independent union system.

He began his work by organizing a strike at a steel plant in [[Helwan]], Egypt in 1989 for which he was arrested, tortured, and fired.  That incident led to his starting the CTUWS and advocating for workers' rights throughout Egypt.  Abbas' relationship with [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak's regime]] was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests.&lt;ref name=&quot;towardfreedom1&quot;/&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Abbas &quot;a major annoyance to the troubled regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,&quot; and &quot;passionate, methodical and accustomed to police surveillance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/14/world/fg-activist14 |title=Problems In Egypt - Unions tap into public ire in Egypt |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Abbas was charged with [[defamation]] and sentenced to one year of prison.  There was an international condemnation of the ruling with major labor and human rights groups defending Abbas.

Abbas' work gained momentum and attention during the 2011 Egyptian revolution where he helped mobilize workers in the nationwide movement for civil rights and the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's regime.

==1989-1990: Early work and founding of CTUWS==
Abbas began working in a steel mill in 1975 at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;wac-maanil&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aflcio1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.aflcio.org/2007/06/26/labor-support-organization-banned-after-strike-actions/ |title=Egyptian Labor-Support Organization Banned After Strike Actions |publisher=Blog.aflcio.org |date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While under the [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak regime]], Abbas began organizing workers despite unions being dominated by the state-approved [[Egyptian Trade Union Federation]] (ETUF).  In 1989 he participated in strike at the Iron and Steel Company plant in [[Helwan]] where 19,000 workers sought wage increases and a meal during work.  They were met by 10,000 riot police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the striking workers,&lt;ref name=&quot;aflcio1&quot;/&gt; and ultimately the strike was broken up by security forces storming the plant, resulting on one death, one hundred injuries and hundreds of arrests.&lt;ref name=&quot;towardfreedom1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aflcio1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/must-read/statement-kamal-abbas |title='We Stand With You as You Stood With Us': Statement to Workers of Wisconsin by Kamal Abbas of Egypt's Centre for Trade Unions and Workers Services |publisher=MichaelMoore.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas was arrested four times in the following months&lt;ref name=&quot;aflcio1&quot;/&gt; including 45 days of detention in which he was tortured.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;  His termination followed, for participating in an âillegalâ strike not sanctioned by the official trade union.&lt;ref name=&quot;merip1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero050907 |title=Strikes in Egypt Spread from Center of Gravity | publisher = [[Middle East Research and Information Project]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months later in 1990 Abbas co-founded CTUWS in Helwan to support workers and address the lack of independent unions in the private sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;towardfreedom1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aflcio1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vnivX-lt1o4C&amp;dq=%22Kamal+Abbas%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Social Social Movements, Mobilization, and Contestation in the Middle East and North Africa | author=Joel Beinin, Frederic Vairel |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|what pages?|date=July 2011}}  He was guided by the advice of [[Yusuf Darwish]], a long-time communist and labor lawyer with whom Abbas had previously led the Peopleâs Socialist Party.  Abbas had studied the world labor movements, looking up to the power of unions in Europe, and the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;  Abbasâ changed ideological focus from his his early ties to Marxist politics, instead focusing CTUWS on practical reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;merip1&quot;/&gt;

CTUWS offered legal services, counseling for legal rights, education, and it reported on labour-rights violations. CTUWS also published the only magazine in the country about workers' rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/866/eg4.htm |work = [[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Inconvenient truths | date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990-2007: Work with CTUWS==
Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests.&lt;ref name=&quot;towardfreedom1&quot;/&gt;

In 1998 Abbas commented on the July strikes at the Egypt-Helwan Textiles Factory and the Nasr Pharmaceutical plant.  Abbas saw the incidents as a test of the future of privatisation.  He said, &quot;People can now see that there is a choice, that they can say no.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farag |first=Fatemah |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1998/390/eg2.htm |work = [[Al-Ahram Weekly]]  | title = Privatisation faces a hot summer |date=1998-08-19 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he spoke out on the need for education and training for workers.  He said, &quot;In Korea, development was based on a comprehensive educational policy. We still do not see this happening here. Even in the new factories, production lines are imported with a foreign expert to run them. They are assembly plants and the Egyptian worker does not have to be very skilled. The Egyptian worker does not gain the kind of knowledge that can make him an interactive part of the production process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/427/eg6.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = May Day dilemmas |date=1999-05-05 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 in the Parliamentary elections, Abbas nominated himself as an independent labor representative for Helwan. Abbas said that his General Union for Mineral, Electrical, and Engineering Industries at first refused to grant him status as a labor representative. &quot;Following a long and exhausting struggle with the general union council,&quot; according to Abbas, he received it.&lt;ref name=&quot;almasryalyoum2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/72833 |title=Labor representation in parliament: Between need and myth | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also criticized the candidacy of Minister Sayed Mash'al and supported Safir Nigm for minister of military production in the Helwan area.  Abbas argued, &quot;After Mash'al took over, there was a massive explosion at one of the factories. Five workers died and compensation was inadequate. When workers complained, [Mash'al] had dozens of them sent to jail.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/507/eg21.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Tribal labour |date=1995-11-15 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Abbas commented on increasing privatisation of employment and the role of professional committees. He said, &quot;Approximately 50 per cent of the number of trade union members who make up the current trade union structure belong and vote for 'professional committees.'&quot; Drivers in the Helwan district, Abbas said, are members of a professional committee as are the construction workers in Shubra. &quot;These are committees that have few functions. For example, a driver will only go to his union when getting his licence because he needs their signature. We cannot consider these committees or their members active components of the trade union structure or the working class.&quot; He noted the changing nature of political alliances regarding unions:  &quot;And this time around, the left has changed its election programme from calling for the protection of the public sector to focusing on the protection of workers' rights, irrespective of who the management is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fatemah Farag |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/552/eg2.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = What lies beneath |date=2001-09-26 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and &quot;pure&quot; agricultural work when done by women and minor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2002&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/ec4.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Dirge for a dog? |date=2002-01-23 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003 Abbas began seeking formal registration in line with Article 11 of Law 84/2002 which deals with NGO registration, security and public order.  Abbas was critical of the registration procedures:  &quot;The law is bad and it is designed to co-opt you under government control.  And there has been heavy government pressure.  But we decided to try and open negotiations with them.  After all, in Egypt you never know what is going to happen - things could get even worse tomorrow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;''Margins of Repression'' by Human Rights Watch&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas fought attempts to exclude the words &quot;worker&quot; and &quot;trade union&quot; from the organization name or scope.  &quot;They wanted us to change our name, but we won't, it's internationally recognized.  They said the name breaches Article 11.  We said no, Article 11 has to do with your goals...They said that our work could breach article 11 'Your problem is that you speak for workers in disputes, and this we can not allow.  There are government agencies and organizations that already do this, and you cannot have face to face meetings [on these issues].'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

In 2005 Abbas was critical of how workers rights were being addressed in the political dialogue.  He said, &quot;Unfortunately, the labour movement's democratic demands are absent from the agenda of change called for by the opposition. Even the political parties that are close to workers' circles -- such as the Tagammu and Nasserist parties -- are only interested now in the laws that regulate political participation and professional syndicates.&quot;  He told the Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram]]'', &quot;Political movements that once upheld the interests of the working class based themselves on public sector workers, most of whom have been liquidated through early retirement schemes...the current environment where workers see people taking on the state and putting up a fight has created a situation in which we can see renewed labour activism of the sort now taking place...I do not think that such a movement would have been possible if it were not for the current movement for political reform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/740/eg10.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = May Day and the absent actor |date=2005-05-04 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Abbas criticized the negotiations in the [[Esco]] workers' protest. He noted that clause 69 of the labor contract, which stipulated workers could be fired if they fail to perform &quot;essential duties&quot;, was broad enough to permit random firings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/743/eg42.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = A partial victory  |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abbas also criticized requirements that protests be approved by the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).  He said, &quot;Workers go on strike to improve their material conditions.  They are not staging a play. They are not rehearsing for some media circus. And they should not be forced to strike within the straight jacket of a preset timetable. This defeats the purpose of the strike because it limits the workers' bargaining power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/734/eg9.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title =Nobody's listening |date=2005-03-23 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005 Abbas commented on legal issues dealing with the Al-Amrya Weaving and Textile Company.  He said, &quot;The distinction between public and private sector workers will in any case become irrelevant, sooner or later, given that the entire public sector is on the block. What is important in this case is that the Unified Labour Law (12) of 2003 doesn't differentiate between private and public sector workers. Misr Al-Amrya cannot legally argue on the basis of state workers' rights to base salary increments versus private sector workers' non-rights. Which is why, in the end, the company did eventually comply.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/749/eg9.htm |work= [[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Political spin-off effects |date=2005-07-06 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005 Abbas was attacked by plain-clothes Egyptian security forces while demonstrating against human rights abuses by the Mubarak regime.  He was badly wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zunes |first=Stephen |url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/bombings_and_repression_in_egypt_underscore_failures_in_us_anti-terrorism_strategy |title=Bombings and Repression in Egypt Underscore Failures in U.S. Anti-Terrorism Strategy |publisher=FPIF |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Abbas also criticized the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] for being two-faced in their approach to civil rights. &quot;Egypt has never had democracy. For now the Brotherhood stands for civil rights, but its basic stance is against them. It has one language for the media and another for its followers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Steele |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/29/comment.islam |title= Open debate can tackle the dangers of fundamentalism |work =[[The Guardian]] |date=  2005-07-29 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006 Abbas dismissed the significance of General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) elections arguing that public sector industrial workers overseen by the GFTU were increasingly few.  He recommended switching focus to uninionized private sector workers:  &quot;The minister of investment has openly stated that except for four companies the little that remains of the industrial public sector is for sale...the real battle is to fight for trade union pluralism, to build a new and independent trade union structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/818/eg4.htm |work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title = Battling over a dead horse | date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007-2010: CTUWS closure, lawsuit, and prison sentence==
[[File:Kamal Abbas.jpg|thumb|Kamal Abbas during the 2010 National Minimum Wage protest]]
In 2007, after Mahala Al-Kobra textile workers threatened to impeach him for allegedly staging fraudulent union elections in October 2006, General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) President Hussein Megawer denounced Abbas as a &quot;foreign-funded agent&quot; on the satellite TV channel Dream 2.  Megawer argued that CTUWS  should be shut down; closure of the Naja Hamadi branch followed almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/843/eg4.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] | title=Workers remain undaunted |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 Abass criticized the government sale of companies to international investors, arguing the transactions led to workers losing their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kassem |first=Mahmoud |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ayJBbeRA0qLw&amp;refer=home |title=Egypt's Bow to Unions Stalls State Asset Sales, Investing Boom |publisher= [[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he criticized the state of politics, saying &quot;The regime is dead. It has no legitimacy.  But the problem is that no alternative force is willing to come forward to bring about change. It's a fear of the state, but not only that. The state has neutralized some opposition voices and simply gotten rid of others. We have become a suffering society with no way to express itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;  He speculated that poverty in Cairo could lead to a violent confrontation with the police.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;  Abbas envisioned a charismatic opposition leader could rise up amidst the tension, but he did not believe such an individual would be part of the labor movement.  He said, &quot;Those who think the labor movement will lead to political change in Egypt are foolish.  The movement is still too young. We have to be concerned with the economic conditions of the workers. We can't rush things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;

In April 2007 Abbas' CTUWS office was shut down and he was accused him of working with &quot;external forces&quot; to disrupt the country's economy.  The government's closed CTUWS' Helwan headquarters and two other branches in Nag' Hamadi and Mehala Al-Kobra for &quot;security reasons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt;

In September 2007 Abbas and another writer were convicted of defamation and public abuse after writer Mohamed Helmy published an article on corruption at the 15th of May Youth Center, where Abbas was a member of the board. The story was published in ''Kalam Sanay'iya'', a magazine published by the CTUWS.  The lawsuit for alleged &quot;slander and defamation of character&quot; against Abbasâand his co-defendant lawyer Mohamed Helmiâwas filed by Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim, chairman of the board of directors of the youth centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt;  Ibrahim filed filed three petitions against Abbas in his capacity as CTUWS coordinator, claiming that the Kalam Sinai'ia article &quot;publicly defamed him as a state-appointed civil servant&quot;. He based his case on Article 188 of the Egyptian code of law&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt; which penalizes false reporting (anyone who &quot;publishes false news, statements or rumours likely to disturb public order&quot; may face a prison sentence).&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt;  Abbas was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15218389 |title=Striking Textile Workers in Egypt Get Concessions |publisher=NPR |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the incident, Abbas commented to [[National Public Radio]], &quot;The government is also very sensitive about any links between political powers in Egypt and the labor movement because this would mean that workers might enter with their weight into the democratic movement. They're very scared of this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

&quot;It is clear the judge's decision to give me a one-year jail sentence is political...It is no coincidence that I was sentenced at about the same time as the journalists and editors,&quot; Abbas told Ahram Weekly. &quot;The court had regularly adjourned the case since May, deciding to issue a ruling only on 21 September. Prosecuting and sentencing journalists for publishing offences is all part of the government's general crack-down on civil liberties.  The government feels threatened by the strikes, especially actions taken by the militant Mehala Al-Kubra textile workers whose latest strike was settled last week. They need a scapegoat for their failed policies. This is why they closed down our offices, refuse to license us and continue to accuse the CTUWS of inciting the strikes. The allegations are flattering but untrue. How could we possibly have incited the tens of thousands of workers who have gone on strike since December?&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt;

CTUWS criticized the conviction. &quot;What does it mean when courts seek to imprison citizens, who publish the facts about corruption cases? The allegations against Ibrahim were found to be true and were the basis for the legal decision... Does it mean that the courts are offering immunity to corrupt officials, that they are offering protection against any criticism or disclosure?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt;

International labor and human rights groups came out in support of Abbas and condemning the court decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/international-labor-groups-condemn-conviction-of-labor-leader-kamal-abbas.html |title=International labor groups condemn conviction of labor leader Kamal Abbas |work =Thedailynewsegypt.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Confederation of Trade Unions (ITUC)]], accused the Mubarak regime of going after opposition groups and media.  &quot;We are very concerned about this latest attack on the CTUWS.  We are particularly concerned that these prison sentences follow a long tradition of repression of the CTUWS, an independent civil society organization committed to defending trade union and workers rights in Egypt,&quot; said Guy Ryder, ITUC general secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt1&quot;/&gt; A coalition of the Italian trade unions sent a letter to Mubarak asking him to &quot;ensure that CTUWS is not persecuted and demanding that &quot;this particular case could be reviewed.  The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network also issued a statement &quot;expressing its deep concern over the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt1&quot;/&gt;

Egyptian labour historian Joel Beinin said, &quot;The attack on CTUWS is part of the intensification of the assault of the Mubarak regime against its opponents&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt;  Faiza Rady considered the prison sentence an attack on the defence of workers' rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2007&quot;/&gt;

After Abbas and Helmy's September conviction, an investigation by the Governor of Cairo found the charges of corruption at the youth center to be true.  Cairo Governor Abdel Azim Wazir ordered the entire board of the center to be disbanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt1&quot;/&gt;

Abbas appealed his conviction at a Dec. 29 hearing.  He and Helmy remained free between the case and the appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt1&quot;/&gt;

In 2009 [[Human Rights Watch]] noted a significant increase &quot;in the harassment of human rights activists at Cairo airport&quot; which included the detainment of Abbas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director |url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/24/egypt-and-libya-year-serious-abuses |title=Egypt and Libya: A Year of Serious Abuses | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/2128 |title=No fly zone: The perils of Cairo Airport | work =  [[Almasry Alyoum]] | date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Egyptian Minister of Planning created a committee regarding [[minimum wage]], which Abbas criticized for not acting.  Abbas supported working with the new committee's goals, which included a minimum annual salary increase of seven per cent. He also criticized the labour complaints committee for not meeting convene regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/689/eg2.htm |work =[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]| title = Labour backlog | date=2004-05-12 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify | how can the article be dated when it discusses 2010?|date=July 2011}}

In 2010 Abbas criticized proposals to postpone trade union elections.  Abbas criticized the role of the ETUF as &quot;a governmental institution, not a federation of genuine trade unions. Nor does it represent Egypt's workers in any way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;almasryalyoum1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/227915 |title=ETUF makes bid to rally workers behind president, regime | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas also noted the practice of elected officials busing in members of their constituency to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;almasryalyoum1&quot;/&gt;

In May 2010 Abbas criticized the forced end of a protest in Cairo by workers from Amonsito, the Egyptian Telephone Company and el-Nubaria Agricultural Engineering, who had been protesting for several months.  Abbas had said he would submit a complaint to the International Labor Organization about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/44045 |title=Streets cleaned and protesters cleared out for Kenyan PM's visit | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010 Abbas criticized the constitutionality of military courts being used on civilians working in military production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/74146 |title=Military court acquits 3 workers, suspends sentences of others | work = [[Almasry Alyoum]] | date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in August Abbas criticized ETUF head Megawer as being an appointed labor representative in positions that are mandated to be elected.  Abbas also criticized Megawer's affiliation with the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party (NDP)]] suggesting that the ETUF should not be determining eligibility for parliamentary elections.  Abbas argued, &quot;The ETUF has actually granted a number of businessmen and retired officers, from the ruling party, the status of labor representatives when they are not laborers in any way shape or form.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;almasryalyoum2&quot;/&gt;

Abbas made an appeal for a new federation of trade unions from [[Tahrir Square]] during the revolution.  He said, âOn January 30th we met with representative of other independent trade union organizations and we discussed forming a new federation.  We then made an announcement in Tahrir square, calling for a new federation. But at the time we had no idea what would happen. Since then this call has been responded to by the workers. The challenge now that the revolution has succeeded is to be able to build a society of social justice.â&lt;ref name=&quot;towardfreedom1&quot;/&gt;

In February 2011 Abbas criticized the elections in federation syndicates for being corrupted with fraud.  He said, &quot;There are 116 verdicts of administrative court annulling the last union elections and we believe members of the federation were involved in acts of violence against the protesters in Tahrir.â  Abbas recommended creating independent syndicates, saying &quot;We will do as our grandfathers did before 1952 when the first unions were created in Egypt.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentPrint/3/0/6383/Business/0/Revolution-fuels-Egypt-labour-movement-.aspx |work = [[Al-Ahram]] | title = Revolution fuels Egypt labour movement |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in February, Abbas supported strikes motivated by &quot;how many billions the Mubarak family was worth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014178863_egypt10.html |title= Strikers in Egypt try to turn up heat on Mubarak | work = [[The Seattle Times]] |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Strikes+sweep+Egyptian+workplaces/4257204/story.html |title=Strikes sweep Egyptian workplaces |work = [[National Post]] |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 Abbas celebrated [[International Workers' Day]] (also known as &quot;May Day&quot;), the international socialist commemoration of workers' rights reform in the United States.  Abbas deemed that year's celebrations  âhistoricâ for marking a break from the ETUF.  Abbas also praised the then newly formed Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EITUF).  May Day celebrations focused on the free will of Egyptian workers to form independent trade unions, free from state control, and the dismantling of the ETUF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/11128/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptians-celebrate-first-May-Day-since-popular-up.aspx |title=Egyptians celebrate first May Day since popular uprising | work = [[Al-Ahram]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Abbas was co-filer of a lawsuit calling for the dissolution of the state-controlled ETUF.  The suit called for &quot;sequestration of the ETUF headquarters, buildings, its Workers' University, cultural institute, hospitals and clinics&quot; as well as &quot;barring the ETUF from representing Egypt's workers or unions at international conferences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/468158 |title=Legal battle against Mubarak's trade union federation begins | work =[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas interrupted Ismail Fahmy of the ETUF during his speech at the [[International Labor Organization|International Labor Organization (ILO)]] June 2011 conference.  Abbas criticized the ETUF saying, &quot;Enough ... all these years ... and crimes enough! ... Enough you killers! ... You participated in the passage of the privatization deals, and facilitated and justified the blatant attacks on the rights of workers ... You defended with impunity Mubarak's regime with its corruption, repression and tyranny, and then you plotted against the killing of the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2011/06/13/enough-you-killers-egypts-independent-unions-confront-state-labour-front |title=&quot;Enough you killers&quot; - Egypt's independent unions confront state labour front  | publisher=[[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]] |date= 2011-06-13 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2011 revolution Abbas made a video from [[Tahrir Square]] telling American workers who were on [[2011 Wisconsin protests|strike]] in [[Wisconsin]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;From this place, I want you to know that we stand with you as you stood with us.  I want you to know that no power can challenge the will of the people when they believe in their rights. When they raise their voices loud and clear and struggle against exploitation.  No one believed that our revolution could succeed against the strongest dictatorship in the region. But in 18 days the revolution achieved the victory of the peopleâ¦.We want you to know that we stand on your side. Stand firm and donât waiver. Donât give up on your rights. Victory always belongs to the people who stand firm and demand their just rights.  We and all the people of the world stand on your side and give you our full support.  As our just struggle for freedom, democracy and justice succeeded, your struggle will succeed. Victory belongs to you when you stand firm and remain steadfast in demanding your just rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Levine |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/02/201122518445333563.html |title=History's shifting sands |publisher= [[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Eating Egyptian pizza in Wisconsin |author= Kroll A |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MC04Ak01.html |work =[[Asia Times]] |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2011, Abbas participated in a labour panel discussing the future of trade unions following the fall of Mubarak's regime.  At the end of the panel Abbas declared, âthe regime has fallen...the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions has fallen! What more do you want? Go create your own unions!â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/7652/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-Labor-minister-declares-the-end-of-governmen.aspx |title=Egypt Labor minister declares the end of government domination of trade unions | work = [[Al-Ahram]] |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
