The '''2011 VFL season''' is the 134th season of the [[Victorian Football League]].

==Teams==
The league contracted from fourteen teams back to thirteen, after the [[Gold Coast Football Club]] left and entered the [[Australian Football League]]. The fledgling Gold Coast club had used the 2009 TAC Cup season and the [[2010 VFL season]] as preparation for joining the AFL. There was originally speculation that the [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club]], which had played TAC Cup in 2010 and was set to join the AFL in 2012, may have spent the 2011 season in the VFL, but instead the club opted to play in the [[North East Australian Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballnation.com.au/afl/afl-issues/gws-likely-to-join-northern-league/|date=22 Aug 2010|accessdate=9 Sep 2011|first=Brent|last=Diamond|publisher=Football Nation|title=GWS Likely to Join Northern League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VFL continued to serve as both the top state-level football league in Victoria, and as a reserves competition for Victorian-based clubs in the [[Australian Football League]], as had been the case since 2000. The [[Reserves affiliations of Australian Football League clubs|affiliation agreements between VFL and AFL clubs]] were unchanged from 2010.

The top three teams from 2010 &amp;ndash; North Ballarat, Northern Bullants and Williamstown &amp;ndash; competed in the inaugural [[Foxtel Cup]] competition, with Williamstown winning the event. The top three from this season will qualify for the 2012 event.

Port Melbourne dominated the 2011 season, winning twenty-one games in a row to win the premiership undefeated. In the home-and-away season, the Borough finished with a record of 18-0, finishing four games clear atop the ladder; it was the first time a club had finished the home-and-away season undefeated since [[Geelong West Football Club|Geelong West]] in Division 2 1972, and the first to do so in the top division since Williamstown in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marngrookfootyshow.com.au/node/1447|title=This weekend in the VFL|publisher=The Marngrook Footy Show|date=26 Aug 2011|accessdate=9 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borough maintained its undefeated record through the finals to claim the premiership, replicating the feat of Geelong West's 1972 team, but becoming the first team to achieve the feat in the top division since [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] in 1918.
