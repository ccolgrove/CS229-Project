'''APTonCD''' is a tool that can create one or more [[.iso|ISO]]s, CDs or DVDs with all of the packages the user downloaded via APT-GET or APTITUDE, creating a removable repository that the user can use on other computers.
APTonCD will also allow the user to automatically create media with all of the [[.deb]] packages located in one specific repository, so that the user can install them into other computers without the need for an internet connection.

==Limitations==
Since APTonCD just copies the deb files on the cache, it will not save files that are downloaded when the .deb packages are installed, this causes packages like &quot;[[ubuntu-restricted-extras]]&quot; or the flash plugin to fail when installing them on a computer with no internet access.
