'''GNU Parted''' (the name being the conjunction of the two words PARTition and EDitor) is a [[Free software|free]] [[partition editor]], used for creating, destroying, resizing, checking, and copying [[Partition (computing)|partition]]s, and the [[file system]]s on them. This is useful for creating space for new [[operating system]]s, reorganising [[hard disk]] usage, copying data between hard disks, and [[disk image|disk imaging]]. It was written by [[Andrew Clausen]] and Lennert Buytenhek.

It consists of a library, '''libparted''', and a [[Command-line interface|command-line]] [[Front-end and back-end|front-end]], '''parted''', that also serves as a reference implementation.

{{as of|2008 |alt=Currently}} GNU Parted runs only under [[Linux]] and [[GNU Hurd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html#Supported-Platforms GNU Parted supported platforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other front-ends ==
[[Image:GParted.png|thumb|300px|[[GParted]] uses GNU Parted in the backend]]
'''nparted''' is the [[Newt (programming library)|newt]]-based front end to GNU Parted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.qa.debian.org/n/nparted.html Overview of nparted source package&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects have started for an [[ncurses]] front-end,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} that also could be used in Windows (with [[GNUWin32]] Ncurses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/ncurses.htm Ncurses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- link has no files, page was last modified 22 Sep 2003.  Top-level page has a package for PDCurses, which is not the same thing --&gt;

'''fatresize''' offers a [[command-line interface]] for [[FAT16]]/[[FAT32]] non-destructive resize and uses the GNU Parted library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fatresize/ SourceForge.net: fatresize&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphical front-ends ===
[[GParted]] and [[KDE Partition Manager]] are graphical programs using the parted libraries. They are adapted for [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] respectively; two major [[desktop environment]]s for Unix-like installations. They are often included as utilities on many [[live CD]] distributions to make partitioning easier. [[QtParted]] was another graphical front-end based on [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] that is no longer being actively maintained.

'''Pyparted'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcantrel.fedorapeople.org/pyparted/ Fedora People&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (also called python-parted)&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/python-parted Ubuntu - Details of package python-parted in dapper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] front-end for GNU Parted.

[[Linux distribution]]s that come with this application by default include [[Slackware]], [[Knoppix]], [[sidux]], [[SystemRescueCD]] and [http://www.partedmagic.com/ Parted Magic].

== Limitations==

Parted has some limitations. For example, it cannot resize [[NTFS]] partitions without external tools, such as the [[ntfsprogs]] package. That means that one has to use a combination of a program to repair hard disk errors before parted if one wants to repartition a damaged hard disk. To overcome this limitation, many rescue discs include all the required utilities in one bootable CD, enabling resizing of most file systems.

Parted cannot handle the extended attributes of the [[ext2]] file system, for instance, those related to [[SElinux]]. These extended attributes have to be removed to resize partitions with Parted.
