'''PeaZip''' is a [[file manager]] and [[file archiver]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[GNU]]/[[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/feature/127889 |title=Archive files in both Windows and Linux using PeaZip |accessdate=2008-04-09 |author=Federico Kereki |date=2008-03-05 |publisher=[[Linux.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports its native [[#Native archive format|PEA archive format]] (featuring compression, multi volume split and flexible authenticated encryption and integrity check schemes) and other mainstream formats, with special focus on handling [[open format]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.download.com/8301-2007_4-9832605-12.html |title=Killer Download: Top file compression alternatives |accessdate=2008-04-09 |author=Jason Parker |date=2007-12-11 |publisher=[[Download.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.freedownloadscenter.com/2007/09/26/peazip-compression-software/ |title=PeaZip Compression Software |accessdate=2008-04-09 |author=O.

PeaZip is mainly written in [[Free Pascal]], using [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]].  PeaZip is released under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].

== Features ==
The program features an archive browser interface with search and history features for intuitive navigation in archive's content, and allows the application of fine-grained multiple exclusion and inclusion filter rules to the archive; a flat browsing mode is possible as alternative archive browsing method.

PeaZip allows users to run extracting and archiving operations automatically using command-line generated exporting the job defined in the GUI front-end. It can also create, edit and restore an archive's layout for speeding up archiving or backup operation's definition.

Other notable features of the program includes archive conversion, file splitting and joining, secure file deletion, byte-to-byte file comparison, archive encryption, checksum/hash files, find duplicate files, system benchmarking, random passwords/keyfiles generation, view image thumbnails ([[Thread_(computer_science)|multi threaded]] on the fly thumbnails generation without saving image cache to the host machine), and integration in the [[Windows Explorer]] [[context menu]]. In addition, the program's user interface (including icons and color scheme) can be customized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/PeaZip-Review-51601.shtml |title=Get Your Files Wrapped |accessdate=2008-04-09 |author=Ionut Ilascu |date=2007-04-10 |publisher=[[Softpedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/linux/PeaZip-Review-51545.shtml |title=PeaZip Review |accessdate=2008-04-09 |author=Mihai Marinof |date=2007-04-10 |publisher=Softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peazip.en.softonic.com/ |title=Compress files with the greatest of ease |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=Softonic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PeaZip is available for x86 and x86-64 as installable package for Windows and Linux (DEB, RPM and TGZ, compiled both for [[GTK2]] and [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] widgetset), and as natively standalone, portable application for both Windows and Linux. In the latter form it is available also as [[PortableApps]] package (.paf.exe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/peazip_portable |title=PeaZip Portable |accessdate=2008-04-09 |author=Zach Hudock |coauthors=Giorgio Tani |date=2008-03-25 |publisher=[[PortableApps.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with more popular and general-purpose archive formats like [[7z]], [[Tar (file format)|Tar]], [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] etc., PeaZip supports the [[PAQ]] and LPAQ formats.  Although usually not recommended for general purpose use (due to high memory usage and low speed), those formats are included for the value as cutting edge compression technology, providing compression ratio amongst the best for most data structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maximumcompression.com/data/summary_mf.php |title=Summary of the multiple file compression benchmark tests |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=Maximum Compression}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/text.html |title=Large Text Compression Benchmark |accessdate=2008-04-09 |author=Matt Mahoney |coauthors= |date=2008-04-06 |quote=The &quot;better&quot; option chooses best compression (equivalent to gzip -9).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PeaZip supports encryption with [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] 256-bit [[Block cipher|cipher]] in 7z, ZIP and PEA archive formats. In [[FreeArc]]'s ARC format, supported ciphers are [[AES (cipher)|AES]] 256-bit, [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]], [[Twofish]] 256 and [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]] 256.&lt;ref name=&quot;peazip_features&quot;&gt;[http://www.peazip.org/peazip-free-archiver.html Peazip introduction] Retrieved on 2009-07-06&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
The graphical frontend's progress bar is less reliable than the native console's progress indicator for the various backend utilities.
If it is critical to follow the real time progress of the work it is possible to set the program to use the native console interface, or both graphical and console interfaces, for the backend utilities.

=== Native archive format ===
'''PEA''', an abbreviation for '''Pack Encrypt Authenticate''', is an [[archive file format]].  It is a general purpose archiving format featuring compression and multiple volume output.  The developers' goal is to offer a flexible security model through Authenticated Encryption, that provides both privacy and authentication of the data, and redundant integrity checks ranging from [[checksums]] to cryptographically strong [[hash function|hashes]], defining three different levels of communication to control: [[Stream (computing)|streams]], [[Object (computer science)|objects]], and [[Volume (compression)|volumes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pea_help&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tani |first=Giorgio |title=PEA |url=http://www.peazip.org/pea_help.pdf |format=PDF |date=2008-03-20 }}{{Verify source|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2010}}

It was developed in conjunction with the PeaZip file archiver. PeaZip and Universal Extractor support the PEA archive format.

=== Third-party technologies ===
PeaZip acts as a graphical [[front-end]] for numerous third-party open source or royalty-free utilities, including:

* Igor Pavlov's [[7-zip|7z]] executable and Myspace's POSIX port of 7z under Linux
* Bulat Ziganshin's [[FreeArc]] archiver (to not be confused with SEA's ARC)
* [[PAQ]]8, ZPAQ and LPAQ executables, maintained by Matt Mahoney and various contributors
* Ilia Muraviev's [[QUAD (compressor)|QUAD]] and BALZ compressors
* GNU strip and [[UPX]]
* UNACEV2.DLL 2.6.0.0 (royalty-free UNACEV2.DLL license) and UNACE for Linux (royalty-free UNACE for Linux license) (maintained by Marcel Lemke, ACE Compression Software)

Most of these utilities can run both in console mode or through a graphical wrapper that allows more user-friendly handling of output information.
