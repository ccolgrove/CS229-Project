Carson is the site of [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]] (CSUDH). CSUDH is a major commuter school, particularly for African-American students from the surrounding cities of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], and [[Compton, California|Compton]]. It was established in the wake of the 1965 [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] riots, as a response to community outcry over the lack of higher education opportunities in the largely black south suburbs of Los Angeles. Today it is among the most racially diverse campuses in the United States. Prior to expansion in the mid 1960s, the university was located in nearby Palos Verdes. In 1965, Carson was chosen as the home for the relocating university over the communities of Friendship Park, Fort MacArthur and Torrance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Carson is also home to the Home Depot Center which is the home of the Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team and hosts the yearly JP Morgan/Chase tennis tournament.

Carson is also the location of the [[Home Depot Center]], a sports complex including a [[soccer-specific stadium]] used by the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], the Los Angeles Sol, and as of 2005, [[Chivas USA]], a tennis stadium and a track and field facility. It is also the default home ground for the [[United States men's national soccer team]]. It opened in 2003, adjacent to CSUDH. The ADT Event Center is the only permanent indoor [[velodrome]] in the U.S. In July 2007, the Galaxy signed international [[football (soccer)|soccer]] superstar [[David Beckham]] to the team.

The [[Goodyear Blimp]] also has a landing pad in Carson, a fitting tribute to the 1st and 2nd U.S. and International Aviation Meets held at the Dominguez Hill Rancho in 1910 and 1911, which featured many [[blimp]]s and [[zeppelin]]s.  The [[International Printing Museum]], which has one of the largest collections of antique printing presses in the United States, is located in Carson.

=== Oil history ===

1921 marked the first drilling for oil at Dominguez Hill, on the northwest side of the Dominguez Rancho, site of the famous battle during the [[Mexican-American War]] called the [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho]] in 1846. The mineral rights to this property were owned by Carson Estate Company, the Hellman Family, the Dominguez Estate Company, and the Burnham Exploration Company of [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]. On September 7, 1923, Burnham Exploration partnering with Union Oil brings in the first producer on the site: Callender No. 1-A well at a depth of {{convert|4068|ft|m}} and {{convert|1193|oilbbl/d}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;petrohistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.google.com/site/petroleumhistoryresources/Home/this-week-in-petroleum-history |title=This Week In Petroleum History |author=Bruce A. Wells |date=September 16, 2010 |publisher=The American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't long before a number of refineries were up and running, with over 350 oil derricks, tank farms, and sprawling industrial complexes becoming a familiar part of the scenery. The principal leases were with [[Shell Oil Company]] and [[Union Oil of California]] and the first two wells were located west of Central Avenue and north of Victoria Street.  Oil led to an increase in jobs in the community and a subsequent post-war population surge. An average of {{convert|300|oilbbl/d}} was produced from these wells through 1960.

In 2011, Shell was ordered by the [[Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board]] to clean up the Carousel neighborhood after [[benzene]] and [[methane]] gas contamination was discovered, as well as soil and groundwater contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/03/shell-oil-ordered-to-clean-up-contaminated-carson-neighborhood.html|title=Shell Oil ordered to clean up contaminated Carson neighborhood | L.A.
