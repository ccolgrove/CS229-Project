'''Thomas Jefferson High School''' is a former high school in the [[East New York]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York]].  The [[New York City Department of Education]] closed the school and broke it into [[small schools movement|several different schools]] in 2007, owing to low graduation rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;insideschools1&quot;&gt;{{cite web
