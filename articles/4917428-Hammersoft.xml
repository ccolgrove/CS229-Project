'''Global Impact''' was founded in 1956 as the Federal Service Joint Crusade to serve as the umbrella group for international health and welfare agencies participating in Federal government employee fund-raising campaigns. With the inception of the [[Combined Federal Campaign]] (CFC) in 1964, the organization became known as International Service Agencies (ISA). Until 1980, ISA was one of four approved federations participating in the CFC. After that time, the campaign was opened to include many more agencies and federations.  In 2003, ISA changed its name to Global Impact to align with the organizationâs evolving mission.

Global Impact represents more than 58&lt;ref name=&quot;charities&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charity.org/Member_Charities |title=Member Charities |author=Global Impact |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of America's most respected international development and relief charities, including [[Heifer International]], [[Lutheran World Relief]], [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], [[MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res]], [[Save the Children]], and [[Women for Women International]].
