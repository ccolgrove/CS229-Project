==History==
===Early years===

The band was formed in 1981 when Paul Buchanan (born 16 April 1956, Edinburgh) and his friend, Robert Bell, met Paul Joseph Moore after graduating from the [[University of Glasgow]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstfootBiog&quot;&gt;[http://www.firstfoot.com/good%20scottish%20pop/bluenile.htm Firstfoot biog] firstfoot.com - Retrieved 26 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although their individual degrees did not reflect their future career wishes (English Literature, Electronic Engineering and Mathematics, respectively), their mutual friendship grew out of their shared interest in music, and they began writing and recording together.  

Bell and Buchanan were previously the key members of the band Night by Night, who had a small but enthusiastic following in the Glasgow area; they had made demos of songs like &quot;Rio&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;, but were not commercial enough at the time to secure a [[recording contract]]. 

They formed their own label, Peppermint Records, and released their first single, &quot;I Love This Life&quot;, which was later picked up and issued by [[RSO Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Soon afterwards, RSO was absorbed into [[Polygram]], and The Blue Nile's first single disappeared from view. The trio kept writing and recording over the next couple of years, including a couple of tracks that would later surface on their debut album.

===''A Walk Across the Rooftops''===

When local hi-fi manufacturer [[Linn Products|Linn Electronics]] heard their music, through friend and [[recording engineer]] [[Calum Malcolm]], the company offered the band money to record a track that would showcase the sonic range of the company's high-end audio equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi-fiworld.co.uk/hfw/oldeworldehtml/aristonturntable.html HI-FI WORLD - OLDE WORLDE - ARISTON RD11 TURNTABLE] hi-fiworld.co.uk - Retrieved 22 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vinyldisc.co.uk/isitlinn.htm  Vinyldisc.co.uk: s it a Linn or an Ariston ?] vinyldisc.co.uk - Retrieved 22 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Linn was so pleased with the result, they formed their own record label in order to release The Blue Nile's debut, ''[[A Walk Across the Rooftops]]'', in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt;{{audio|Walk Across The Rooftops.ogg|sample}} Buchanan later commented that during that time Linn was not really a record company, and The Blue Nile was not really a band.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstfootBiog&quot;/&gt; Although it received positive reviews, it sold modestly. 

1984 saw a greater exposure for the band throughout Europe with the [[music video|videos]] for their two [[single (music)|singles]] &quot;Stay&quot;{{audio| Stay.ogg |sample}} and &quot;Tinseltown in the Rain&quot; often shown on the video channel [[Music Box (TV)|Music Box]].

===''Hats''===

After a prolonged delay in which an entire album's worth of work was scrapped, The Blue Nile released ''[[Hats (album)|Hats]]'' in 1989 to rave reviews, including a rare five-star rating from ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q4music.com  Official ''Q'' website] q4music.com - Retrieved 22 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The album was recorded in the same studio as much of their previous work, Castlesound in [[Pencaitland]], [[East Lothian]]. The album explores the highs and lows of romantic love.  At the time, ''Hats'' reached #12 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and slipped into the [[Billboard 200]] in the [[United States]]. [[Rickie Lee Jones]], a [[fan (person)|fan]] of the band, selected The Blue Nile as her opening act for her 1990 tour. She would later record a [[duet (music)|duet]] with them, a [[cover version]] of the band's own &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, which was featured as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the single &quot;Headlights on the Parade&quot;. She also sang live with the band on the Scottish television programme ''Halfway To Paradise'', performing her song &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstfootBiog&quot;/&gt;

In 1992, the band worked on [[Annie Lennox]]'s debut solo album, ''[[Diva (Annie Lennox album)|Diva]]'', and co-wrote the track &quot;The Gift&quot;. Lennox later covered &quot;The Downtown Lights&quot; (from the ''Hats'' album), for her album, ''[[Medusa (Annie Lennox album)|Medusa]]'', released in 1995.

===''Peace at Last''===

In 1996, seven years later, The Blue Nile released their follow-up to ''Hats'', entitled ''[[Peace at Last (The Blue Nile album)|Peace at Last]]''. In a radical departure from the band's prior two albums, the record is primarily driven by Buchanan's acoustic guitar. A gospel choir made a brief appearance on the lead-off single, &quot;Happiness&quot;.{{audio| Peace At Last.ogg|sample}} Despite the release of ''Peace at Last'' on a major label, the album sold poorly, and the critical reaction to the album was more mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt;

===''High''===

After the longest period between albums, eight years, The Blue Nile released ''[[High (Blue Nile album)|High]]'' in 2004. Although acoustic guitar is still present on some tracks, the overall musical sound is more reminiscent of ''Hats''.

The album was recorded in Glasgow, as the group had tired of travelling and living in other countries, such as the [[United States]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FemaleFirstInterview&quot;&gt;[http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity_interviews/The+Blue+Nile-413.html Female First interview]  femalefirst.co.uk - Retrieved 26 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They also decided to release it on [[Sanctuary Records]] instead of a corporate label, following Sanctuary's A&amp;R, John Williams, calling the band and suggesting releasing a record. According to Buchanan, the people at Sanctuary do not promise &quot;to call on a Tuesday and then nothing comes of it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FemaleFirstInterview &quot;/&gt;

==Activities since ''High''==

Buchanan and Bell toured England and Scotland in May and June 2006, followed by Scotland and Ireland in November 2006, billed as 'Paul Buchanan sings the songs of The Blue Nile'. The band consisted of Buchanan on vocals and guitar; Bell on bass guitar and keyboards; Alan Cuthbertson and Brendan Smith on keyboards; Stuart McCredie on guitar; and Liam Bradley on drums. It was later revealed that Paul Joseph Moore was no longer with the band,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.com/the_blue_nile/Bio/the_blue_nile_bio.pdf Blue Nile biography at WME Entertainment website], accessed September 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-blue-nile-a-band-that-likes-to-take-its-time-425328.html &quot;The Blue Nile - a band that likes to take its time&quot;] - article in ''The Independent'', November 22, 2006, accessed September 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and that Buchanan and Bell had refrained from simply billing themselves as The Blue Nile as a mark of respect for their former colleague.

On 14 July 2007, Buchanan and Bell played Manchester's Bridgewater Hall as part of the Manchester International Festival.{{audio| Saturday Night.ogg | Saturday Night.}}

In July 2008, the band played shows at the [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], London Somerset House and Galway Radisson Hotel.

In September 2010, a biography of The Blue Nile, by Allan Brown, ('Nileism - the strange course of The Blue Nile') was published. The writer claims that the band members have not spoken to each other for some years and that the band has for the time being for all intents purposes broken up, although Buchanan hopes they will find a way to make a fifth album.

Buchanan has collaborated with [[Shirley Manson]] (lead singer of [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]) on her, as yet, unreleased solo album.
