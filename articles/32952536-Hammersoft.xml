'''Robert L. &quot;Bob&quot; Turner''' (born May 2, 1941) is the [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] for [[New York's 9th congressional district]] which straddles parts of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]]. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], holding his first public office. He was elected in September 2011 to complete the term of Democrat [[Anthony Weiner]] who had resigned amid a [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal|sexting scandal]]. A conservative, Turner has been described as the polar opposite of his predecessor, Weiner.

Previously, Turner was a media executive noted for his success in the television talk show segment of the industry. Six years after retiring from his business career, he entered politics to run against Weiner in the November 2010 electionâlosing, but garnering a significant 39 percent of the vote in the largely Democratic district. Less than one year later, he defeated Democratic politician [[David Weprin]] 52-47 in the [[New York's 9th congressional district special election, 2011|special election]] battle for Weiner's seatâbecoming the first Republican to represent the district in nearly a century.&lt;ref name=&quot;behind win&quot;/&gt;

After winning the Republican and Conservative Party of New York's nominations, Turner ran for Congress in November 2010 against Anthony Weiner in New York's ninth congressional district, a Democratic leaning district with a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] (CPVI) of D+5,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomasky&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last=Tomasky| first=Michael| date=June 7, 2011 | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/06/07/anthony-weiner-the-scandal-s-congressional-consequences.html| title=How the GOP Can Take Anthony Weiner's Seat| work=[[The Daily Beast]] | accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was one of the few districts in the nation in which [[Barack Obama]] performed one point worse than [[John Kerry]] in 2004 and 12 points worse than [[Al Gore]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama lower than Kerry&quot;/&gt; Turner lost to Weiner in a 60-40 split.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomasky&quot;/&gt;

;September 2011
{{main|New York's 9th congressional district special election, 2011}}

Turner ran for Weiner's vacant seat in [[New York's 9th congressional district special election, 2011|the special election]] held on September 13, 2011 â beating his Democratic opponent, [[David Weprin]], by a margin of more than 3,500 votes.&lt;ref name =&quot;Officialresult&quot;/&gt; One of Turner's campaign themes was fiscal recovery via cuts in federal spending.&lt;ref name=&quot;gop hopeful&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;draws hecklers&quot;/&gt; He argued that the federal budget needed to be cut by as much as a third,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTMagician&quot;/&gt; and that capital gains taxes should be eliminated, and corporate and individual income taxes reduced, even for the wealthiest two percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dailycaller&quot;/&gt; However, he also opposed Republican plans to privatize Medicare and Social Security and turn Medicaid into a block-grant program, reportedly at the request of former New York mayor [[Ed Koch]], who supported him.&lt;ref name=&quot;koch endorses&quot;/&gt; In endorsing Turner's opponent, ''The New York Times'' remarked that Turner's economic plan to reduce taxes without reducing benefits for current Medicare and Social Security recipients was unrealistic. &quot;That would take a magician, not a businessman&quot;, said the Times.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTMagician&quot;/&gt; One month before the election, Turner admitted that an op-ed he written for the ''[[National Review]]'' calling for a one third reduction in federal spending and &quot;an end to government dependencies&quot; was &quot;blatant pandering&quot; to &quot;a particular audience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gop hopeful&quot;/&gt;

Turner ran ads showing images of the [[World Trade Center]] in flames and sent mailers attacking Weprin for supporting construction of [[Park51]], a planned Islamic community center located near the [[World Trade Center site]], claiming that Weprin wanted to commemorate the attack by building a mosque on Ground Zero.&lt;ref name=&quot;queenstribune&quot;/&gt; Turner also contended that Weprin would merely tow the Democratic party line if elected&lt;ref name=&quot;gop hopeful&quot;/&gt; and emphasized that Weprin had said the national debt was 4 trillion when the correct number was 14 trillion.&lt;ref name=&quot;juniper civic&quot;/&gt;

The district has a large Jewish constituency (up to one quarter of registered voters are Jewish)&lt;ref name=&quot;banks on&quot;/&gt; and Turner, who is a Roman Catholic, &quot;aggressively courted observant Jewish voters&quot;, according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fearing loss&quot;/&gt; Turner painted Weprin as a puppet of President Obama who would not stand up for Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;fearing loss&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;banks on&quot;/&gt; A number of local Jewish leaders including Orthodox rabbis endorsed Turner over Weprin, who is an Orthodox Jew.&lt;ref name=&quot;community mag&quot;/&gt; Other Turner endorsements came from ''The Jewish Voice'',&lt;ref name=&quot;dems worried&quot;/&gt; ''The New York Post'', the ''New York Daily News'',&lt;ref name=&quot;missing&quot;/&gt; former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani,&lt;ref name=&quot;Giuliani nods&quot;/&gt; and Republican U.S. Representative [[Michael Grimm (politician)|Michael Grimm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;campaign trail&quot;/&gt; Turner was also supported by New York Assemblyman [[Dov Hikind]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hikind endorses&quot;/&gt; and former New York Mayor [[Ed Koch]], both Democrats and Jews. Koch, a key Turner supporter, supported Turner in order to send a message to President Obama to change what Koch describes as &quot;hostile position on the State of Israel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2011/09/15&quot;/&gt; ''Crain's New York Business'' opined that if Turner should win, the New York Republican Party would be more likely to push for a &quot;super Jewish&quot; congressional district, extending the influence of Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community.&lt;ref name=&quot;crains&quot;/&gt; Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani said that if Turner was elected, it could change the President's agenda in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;giuliani calls&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bob Turner swearing-in ceremony.jpg|right|thumb|Turner being sworn in by Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]].]]

Turner began the campaign with a disadvantage in fundraising because the national and state Republican parties had been burnt out from previous special elections losses in New York state.&lt;ref name=&quot;weprin leads&quot;/&gt; Turner turned down [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] support and offers to help during his special election campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown in queens&quot;/&gt; Regardless, Turner rose in the polls from an underdog to an eight-point advantage just days before the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;fearing loss&quot;/&gt; The Democratic Party contributed heavily to Weprin in the last weeks of the race, as Turner's odds of winning increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;late help&quot;/&gt;

===Tenure===
During his 2011 campaign, Turner stated he came out of retirement to run for Congress &quot;to fix what's broken and go home. End subsidies. End government dependencies. Dramatically cut the budget by 30 or 35 percent. Slash capital-gains taxes down to zero. Cut taxes across the board. The rest of Americaâs economic healing will happen naturally as a consequence&quot;, he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalreview1&quot;/&gt; He signed the [[Grover Norquist]] / [[Americans for Tax Reform]]  pledge of &quot;no new taxes under any circumstances&quot; in 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;tax pledge&quot;/&gt;and ran on a platform favoring minimal regulation of business.  However, in 2011 he chose not to sign &quot;the pledge,&quot; citing the need to compromise in the critical area of reducing the debt. In his 2011 campaign he cited illegal immigration as a major cause of U.S. unemployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;loud and c.lear&quot;/&gt; To resolve the U.S. debt, he proposed eliminating the U.S Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency and reducing the size of the Department of Education.&lt;ref name=&quot;gop hopeful&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;draws hecklers&quot;/&gt;

In campaign appearances, Turner expressed his approval of certain aspects of Republican Congressman Ryan's [[Ryan Plan#Roadmap for America's Future|budget plan]] but was critical of provisions that would privatize Social Security.&lt;ref name=&quot;tax pledge&quot;/&gt; However, Turner did suggest that the minimum age for Social Security eligibility should be increased for those who are under 55.&lt;ref name=&quot;daily news endorses&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;juniper civic&quot;/&gt; He said he favored repeal of [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|the 2010 health care reform act]], but opposed Ryan's plan to [[Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration#Privatize Medicare with a voucher system|privatize Medicare with a voucher system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;opposed to Ryan Plan&quot;/&gt;

On social issues, Turner emphasized his [[pro-life]], anti same-sex marriage positions,&lt;ref name=&quot;behind win&quot;/&gt; and voiced his support for the teaching of [[intelligent design]] in the public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;faceoff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;turner rush&quot;/&gt;

During his campaign, Turner also declared strong support of Israel and the U.S.-Israeli relationship, criticized President Obama's reference to the use of the 1967 borders as a starting point for negotiations with the Palestinians, and stated that the U.S. should suspend its aid to the Palestinians until payments to convicted terrorists and rocket attacks on Israel ceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner offers&quot;/&gt; Turner also stated his opposition to the building of the [[Park51]] Islamic community center near the [[World Trade Center site]] and suggested federal intervention to stop its construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;daily news endorses&quot;/&gt;

Turner was sworn in to Congress on September 15, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;takes office&quot;/&gt; Upon being chosen to serve on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he stated, &quot;I intend to forward my beliefs that it is in our national interest to defend our Middle East ally, Israel, and I will oppose further attempts by the U.N. to recognize a Palestinian state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;foreign affairs&quot;/&gt;

Turner is being mentored by Homeland Security Chair, [[Peter T. King]] (R-NY) in his transition to his new job.&lt;ref name=&quot;taps Weiner&quot;/&gt; He has met with his former rival, Anthony Weiner, to discuss open constituent files and issues facing the district, including noise pollution and eroding beaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;taps Weiner&quot;/&gt; He had a cordial and businesslike meeting with Weiner, though the two men have been described as polar opposites.&lt;ref name=&quot;taps Weiner&quot;/&gt;

Within weeks of taking office, Turner was attacked by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) for his no new tax pledge, and painted by the DCC as representing wealthy individuals and corporations rather than the average district voter.&lt;ref name=&quot;democrats attack&quot;/&gt; Turner expressed support for [[hydrofracking]] in upstate New York, and would allow states to opt out of [[No Child Left Behind]].&lt;ref name=&quot;new congressman&quot;/&gt; Remarking on the tenth anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Turner said he would &quot;leave our military commitment in Afghanistan up to the generals in the field,&quot; adding that, &quot;If they believe the sacrifice of our solders continues to be necessary to prevent attacks on U.S. soil, then we have no choice but to let them finish the task.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;no closure&quot;/&gt;

In November 2011, an anti-free trade protestor affiliated with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement shouted during Turner's ceremonial swearing-in and was knocked to the floor and dragged out the door by a former Turner campaign worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;protester&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boots&quot;/&gt; Turner then criticized the OWS demonstrators as socialist and praised America's capitalist system as a &quot;beacon to the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boots&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2011/46/turnerinauguration_fh_2011_11_17_q.html|title=Ex-cop boots OWS heckler from congressman's swearing-in|author=Frank Rosario, Doug Auer and Bob Fredericks|date=November 14, 2011|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;protester&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/take_out_the_trasher_TuMpvuv7PYzeL0vKMOjS4H|title=Protester crashes Turner inauguration|author=Rebecca Henely|work=TimesLedger|location=Queens|date=accessdate=November 17, 2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
