'''Tiki Taane''' is a New Zealand musician and former member of leading New Zealand band [[Salmonella Dub]]. Taane left Salmonella Dub on 1 January 2007 to pursue a solo career.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.muzic.net.nz/artists/2216/readpost/33505.html Tiki Taane | Artists at muzic.net.nz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His debut album, &quot;[[Past, Present, Future (Tiki Taane album)|Past, Present, Future]]&quot;, was released on 22 October 2007 in New Zealand and has gone two times platinum, achieving a number one single, &quot;[[Always On My Mind (Tiki Taane song)|Always On My Mind]]&quot;, which is the most successful single of all time in New Zealand. Taane is also the live sound engineer for New Zealand [[drum and bass]] act [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]].

==History==
In 1996, Taane was asked to become live soundman to Christchurch band Salmonella Dub, who were becoming one of NZâs most popular acts. Through this role, Tiki began to earn himself a reputation for his ability to bring a staggeringly powerful live sound to whatever equipment, venue or environment he was faced with. His time with his metal band Braaspadeak had become minuscule and irregular, and while on tour with the Dub, Tiki had composed a dub-reggae track in his hotel room. Once he shared it with Salmonella, they recorded it straight away, and Tiki and his whanau and friends set to work making a music video featuring Tiki on tour at The Gathering that year. This track, &quot;For the Love Of It&quot;, shot to the NZ charts, and so he became faced with not only being soundman for the band, but also the public expectation that he perform his hit song at all their gigs.

In both 1998 and 1999, Tiki won the Best Live Audio Engineer award at the NZ B-Net awards and though in popular demand, it was clear that Tikiâs success lay with his friends Salmonella Dub. Also winning an award for Best Song for 'For the Love Of It', Tikiâs confidence grew in his song-writing abilities and so he went on to create more hits.  By 2000, Tiki was beginning to spend the majority of the Dub gigs mixing the first part of the set, then jumping on stage to perform.

Taane played his final gig with Salmonella Dub on New Year's Eve 2006.

Describing his decision to leave Salmonella Dub, Taane said, &quot;I felt like I'd gone as far as I could with Salmonella Dub.&quot; He described his time since leaving Salmonella Dub as &quot;very lonely&quot; and &quot;very intense&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/7704 |title=Dub king Tiki Taane goes solo |date=29 October 2007 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the band in an interview after the release of his album, Taane said, &quot;I have so much love and respect for (Salmonella Dub) because if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be where I am now. I wouldn't be here.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

On April 2011, Taane was arrested on charges of &quot;disorderly behaviour likely to cause violence to start or continue&quot; while chanting &quot;fuck the police&quot; at a gig in [[Tauranga]], claiming he was singing lyrics from [[N.W.A]]'s &quot;[[Fuck tha Police]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Tiki-Taane-arrested-after-chanting-F-the-police-at-gig/tabid/418/articleID/206422/Default.aspx |title=Tiki Taane arrested after chanting 'F*** the police' at gig  |work=3news.co.nz |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On his web site, Taane posted the message, &quot;Freedom of speech is a human right&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150153206912634&amp;set=a.10150153206877634.289924.103395132633&amp;theater |title=In The World Of ART...  |work=facebook.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiki later stated that he &quot;loves police&quot; and was &quot;not angry with them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://entertainment.msn.co.nz/article.aspx?id=8245818 |title=Tiki Taane: face for freedom of speech?  |work=entertainment.msn.co.nz |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April Tiki told [[Marcus Lush]] on [[Radio Live]] that the lyrics often feature in his performances and his arrest came as a complete surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Tiki-Taane---new-poster-boy-for-free-speech/tabid/506/articleID/19700/Default.aspx|title=Tiki Taane - new poster boy for freedom of speech|publisher=RadioLIVE, MediaWorks NZ|date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior police stated they supported the arresting officers actions, and are confident they acted appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/entertainment-news/police-defend-arrest-tiki-taane-4115672 |title=Anti-police lyrics land Tiki Taane in trouble  |work=tvnz.co.nz |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early September, the charges against Taane were dropped after mediation; charges remain against promoter Patricio Alvarez-Riveros from the same incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/crime/news/article.cfm?c_id=30&amp;objectid=10749466 |title=Thank tha police...

==Use of music by Sea Shepherd==
Before taking out his vessel ''[[Ady Gil]]'' on an anti-whaling cruise to the [[Southern Ocean]] with the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], [[Pete Bethune]] noted that he had installed a large set of speakers, and intended to play the songs like ''[[Tangaroa]]'' from Tiki Taane to the whalers, describing it as a &quot;growling big sort of a song about the God of the Sea who looks after us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wail for whales&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theage.com.au/national/wail-for-whales-stealth-boat-to-blast-japanese-20091130-k18l.html |title=Wail for whales: stealth boat to blast Japanese|date=29 June 2009|work=The Age|accessdate=30 November 2009 | location=Melbourne | first=Andrew | last=Darby}}&lt;/ref&gt;
