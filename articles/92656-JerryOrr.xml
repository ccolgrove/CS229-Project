'''Same-sex marriage''' (also known as '''gay marriage''')&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|gay marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[marriage]] between two persons of the same [[biological sex]] or [[gender identity|social gender]]. Supporters of legal recognition for same-sex marriage typically refer to such recognition as '''marriage equality'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/25/2011-06-25_gay_marriage_in_new_york_lady_gaga_ricky_martin_ellen_de_generes_and_more_celebr.html|title=Gay marriage in New York|work=[[New York Post]]|quote=Celebs who have long advocated for marriage equality flooded the Twittersphere to rejoice with their fans, friends and partners after Friday's decision in New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, ten countries have begun allowing same-sex couples to marry nationwide: [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]], [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]]. Same-sex marriages are also performed and recognized in [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]] and parts of the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]]. Some jurisdictions that do not perform same-sex marriages recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere: [[Same-sex marriage in Israel|Israel]], [[Same-sex marriage in Aruba, CuraÃ§ao and Sint Maarten|the Caribbean countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]], parts of the United States, and all states of [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico|Mexico]]. [[Australia]] recognises same-sex marriages only by one partner changing their sex after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5661.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The introduction of same-sex marriage has varied by jurisdiction, resulting from legislative changes to marriage laws, court challenges based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or a combination of the two. In some countries, allowing same-sex couples to marry replaced a previous system of [[civil union]]s or registered partnerships.

The recognition of such marriages is a civil rights, political, social, moral, and religious issue in many nations. The conflicts arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed to enter into marriage, be required to use a different status (such as a civil union, which either grant equal rights as marriage or limited rights in comparison to marriage), or not have any such rights. A related issue is whether the term ''marriage'' should be applied.&lt;ref name=MuslimWaPo&gt;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/pamela_k_taylor/2009/07/marriage_both_civil_and_religious.html Marriage: Both Civil and Religious], Pamela Taylor, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_k_smith/2009/07/marriage_a_civil_right_not_sacred_rite.html Marriage a Civil Right, not Sacred Rite], Susan Smith, ''The Washington Post'', July 30, 2009; Retrieved September 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Decision in Perry v.

One argument in support of same-sex marriage is that denying same-sex couples legal access to marriage and all of its attendant benefits represents discrimination based on sexual orientation; several American scientific bodies agree with this assertion.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychological&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf |title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Marriage |year=2004 |author=American Psychological Association | accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psychiatric&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2005 |title=Support of Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Civil Marriage |url=http://archive.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200502.pdf |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psychoanalytic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apsa.org/About_APsaA/Position_Statements/Gay_Marriage.aspx |author=American Psychoanalytic Association |title=Position Paper On Gay Marriage |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.asanet.org/public/marriage_res.html |author=American Sociological Association |title= American Sociological Association Member Resolution on Proposed U.S. Constitutional Amendment Regarding Marriage |accessdate=November 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument in support of same-sex marriage is the assertion that financial, psychological and physical well-being are enhanced by marriage, and that children of same-sex couples benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union supported by society's institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;amici&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf |title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as amici curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees â Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of California Civil Case No. 09-CV-2292 VRW (Honorable Vaughn R.

==Terminology==
===Definitions of marriage===
{{See also|Marriage#Definitions|l1=Marriage - Definitions}}
Anthropologists have struggled to come up with a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gJJ9Eu06JmEC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=anthropologists%20struggle%20define%20marriage&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q=anthropologists%20struggle%20define%20marriage&amp;f=false Anthropology Matters!], Shirley Fedorak, Broadview Press, 2007, Chapter 11, Page 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2844434 The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage], Kathleen Gough, The Journals of [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]], 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough/&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=WdlOOaKAAq&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false Boy-wives and female husbands: studies of African homosexualities], Stephen O.

[[NWSA Journal]] â Volume 12, Number 1, Spring 2000, pp. 1â23&lt;/ref&gt;

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word ''marriage'' to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r/ Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage], ''[[Washington Times]]'', May 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;[http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed/ Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed], Martha Neil, [[American Bar Association]], March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2215628/ Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriageâwho knew?], Daniel Redman, ''[[Slate.com|Slate]]'', April 7, 2009; Retrieved September 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] and others have suggested reserving the word ''marriage'' for religious contexts as part of [[privatizing marriage]], and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of [[civil union]]s, in part to strengthen the [[separation between church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Terms for same-sex marriage===
Some proponents of legal recognition of same-sex marriage, such as [[Freedom to Marry]] and [[Canadians for Equal Marriage]], use the terms ''marriage equality'' and ''equal marriage'' to indicate that they seek equal benefit of marriage laws as opposed to special rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriage.html|title=MARRIAGE EQUALITY|publisher=Garden State Equality|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|title=Marriage 101|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of same-sex marriage such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] use the term ''traditional marriage'' to mean marriages between one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage The Divine Institution of Marriage â LDS Newsroom].

Some publications that oppose same-sex marriage, such as ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' and [[Baptist Press]], have an editorial style policy of placing the word ''marriage'' in [[scare quotes]] (&quot;marriage&quot;) when it is used in reference to same-sex couples. In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/02/25/washington-times-scare-quotes-are-history/|title=Washington Times Scare Quotes Are History|publisher=Washington City Paper|author=Erik Wemple|date=February 25, 2008|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff Kincaid of [[Accuracy in Media]] argues for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage is a legal status denied same-sex couples by most state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

An example of egalitarian male [[domestic partnership]] from the early [[Zhou Dynasty]] period of China is recorded in the story of [[Pan Zhang &amp; Wang Zhongxian]]. While the relationship was clearly approved by the wider community, and was compared to heterosexual marriage, it did not involve a religious ceremony binding the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret. (1990). ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''. University of California Press. pp. 24â25&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historical mention of the performance of same-sex marriages occurred during the early [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, &quot;Same Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe.&quot; (New York: Random House, 1995). Pages 80â85.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] is reported to have engaged in a marriage ceremony with one of his male slaves. [[Elagabalus|Emperor Elagabalus]] &quot;married&quot; a [[Carian]] slave named Hierocles.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Scarre &quot;Chronicles of the Roman Emperors&quot; (London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1995). Page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a so-called marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24â28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43â49.; &quot;Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')&quot; [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'' 5.3â5: &quot;''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves&quot;; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55â56, 67, 76â80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, &quot;''matrimonium'' is an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man takes a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he may have children by her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the lack of legal validity notwithstanding, there is a consensus among modern historians that same-sex relationships existed in ancient Rome, but the exact frequency and nature of &quot;same-sex unions&quot; during that period is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Eskridge|first= William N.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1993|month= Oct|title= A History of Same-Sex Marriage |journal= Virginia Law Review |volume= 79|issue= 7|pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= The Romans may have accorded some same-sex unions the legal or cultural status of marriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 AD Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C.

{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Argentina}}
On July 15, 2010, the Argentine Senate approved a bill extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. It was supported by the Government of [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner]] and opposed by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/07/15/world/americas/AP-LT-Argentina-Gay-Marriage.html &quot;Argentina legalizes Gay Marriage&quot;].

==== Belgium ====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Belgium}}

Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages on June 1, 2003, with the coming into force of a bill passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]]. Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 law enabled legal [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex spouses]].

==== Canada ====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on January 14, 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], opposite-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the 2005 ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as &quot;the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.&quot;

====Iceland====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Iceland}}
Same-sex marriage was introduced in Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the coalition government of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] and [[Left-Green Movement]].

====Israel====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Israel}}
[[Israel]]'s High Court of Justice ruled to honor same-sex marriages granted in other countries even though Israel does not recognize such marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006.

====South Africa====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in South Africa}}
In a 2002 landmark decision that paved the way for later legal extensions of same-sex rights, South Africa became the first country in Africa to legally permit adoptions by same-sex couples. The Court (Judge Lewis Skweyiyi) held, &quot;Family life as contemplated in the constitution (of South Africa) can be lived in different ways. The stability, support and affection envisaged by the Child Care Act can be provided by people in permanent same-sex relationships.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Lerner, Brenda Wilmoth &amp; K.

====Sweden====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Sweden}}
Same-sex marriage in Sweden has been legal since 1 May 2009, following the adoption of a new, gender-neutral law on marriage by the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish parliament]] on 1 April 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;svmarriagerights&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/International/nyhetssidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2054&amp;Format=1&amp;artikel=2739765|title=Gays Win Marriage Rights|work=Sveriges Radio English|date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Sweden the seventh country in the world to open marriage to same sex couples nationwide. Marriage replaced Sweden's registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Existing registered partnerships between same-sex couples remained in force with an option to convert them into marriages.

====United States====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the United States}}
In the United States, although [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriages are not recognized federally]], same-sex couples can legally marry in six states ([[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iowa|Iowa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]], [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]]) and the [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] and receive state-level benefits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iGQ6LMSOvL9rjDHrAmyO9mHoVieAD9BOJN7G1{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The states of New Jersey, Maryland, and Rhode Island do not facilitate same-sex marriages, but do recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions, as does [[Same-sex marriage in California|California]] in some cases, in particular those established when the state briefly allowed same-sex marriage in 2008.

In 1996, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) defining marriage solely as a union between a couple of the opposite sex for all federal purposes and allowing for the non-recognition amongst the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html |title=US CODE: Title 1,7.

A 2005 federal district court decision, ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'', holding that prohibiting recognition of same-sex relationships violated the Constitution was overturned on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in 2006, which ruled that &quot;laws limiting the state-recognized institution of marriage to heterosexual couples ... do not violate the Constitution of the United States.&quot;

In 2006, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington concluded that encouraging procreation within the framework of marriage can be seen as a legitimate government interest furthered by limiting marriage between opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

In 2010, [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] stated the evidence did not show any historical purpose for excluding same-sex couples from marriage, as states have never required spouses to have an ability or willingness to procreate in order to marry. Proponents of excluding same-sex couples from marriage were unable to reply how permitting same-sex marriage impairs or adversely affects the assumption that the state's interest in marriage is procreative. When asked to identify the evidence at trial that supported the contention responsible procreation is really at the heart of society's interest in regulating marriage, proponents' counsel replied he did not have evidence of this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

==== New Zealand ====
New Zealand's Marriage Act 1955 recognizes marriage rights only for opposite-sex couples. New Zealand's Parliament rejected a bill that would have prohibited the recognition of [[same-sex marriage in New Zealand]] in December 2005. The marriage laws consider [[transsexuals]] who have undergone [[reassignment surgery]] as having changed sex for legal purposes, following Family Court and [[High Court of New Zealand]] decisions in 1995.

====Nigeria====
In 2006, [[Same-sex marriage in Nigeria|Nigerian]] President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who &quot;performs, witnesses, aids or abets&quot; such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;[http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html African gays and lesbians combat bias], Michael Fleshman, Africa Renewal, Vol.21 #1 (April 2007), page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]], there are circumstances where a marriage between two women is allowed, such as when a woman has no child and the husband dies.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;[http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland], Leo Igwe, Nigerian Tribune, June 19, 2009.

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if and only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf UN Secretary-General Bulletin ST/SGB/2004/13], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to opposite-sex married couples to ''de facto'' partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into an opposite-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Civil unions, [[civil partnership]]s, [[domestic partnership]]s, [[registered partnership]]s, or unregistered partnership/unregistered co-habitation legal status offer varying portions of the legal benefits of marriage and are available to same-sex couples in: [[Andorra]], Australia, [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Croatia]], the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, [[Israel]], Liechtenstein, [[Luxembourg]], New Zealand, [[Slovenia]], Switzerland, the United Kingdom and [[Uruguay]].

In some countries with legal recognition the actual benefits are minimal. Many people consider civil unions, even those that grant equal rights, inadequate, as they create a separate status, and think they should be replaced by gender-neutral marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Transgender and intersex persons==
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2008}}
{{See also|Transsexualism|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Gender identity}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification. Consequently, both [[transsexual]]s and [[intersex]]ed individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the &quot;opposite&quot; sex or permitted to marry partners of the &quot;same&quot; sex due to legal distinctions. This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features. Estimates&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling ''et al.'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; run as high as 1 percent of live [[childbirth|birth]]s exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity, and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary [[surgery]] to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Intersex Society of North America
|accessdate=March 8, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transsexual to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. &quot;Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality.&quot; Archives of Sexual Behavior 38.5 (Oct. 2009): 688â701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the UK marriages are for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her marriage or civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate. Such persons are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual persons to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm |title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage |publisher=365gay.com |date=2006-07-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm |archivedate=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried persons could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. 

In the United States, transsexual and intersexual marriages typically run into the complications detailed above. As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Schwartz | first = John | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html | title = U.S. Defends Marriage Law | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 18, 2009 | accessdate = September 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, to sympathetic toleration, to indifference, to prohibition. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms,&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp |title=Banned in Boston |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=September 19, 2008|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name=&quot;findlaw1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/ |title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw |publisher=Family.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name=&quot;indegayforum1&quot;&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view. For a better understanding of this view, see Carpenter's writings at http://www.indegayforum.org/staff/show/91.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Marriage (conflict)#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A &quot;[[direct democracy|majority rules]]&quot; position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;

Thursday, December 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a &quot;[[civil rights]]&quot; view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;

From the [[Islam]]ic perspective, a majority of [[Muslim]] legal scholars cite the rulings of the [[prophet Muhammad]] and the story of [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot in Sodom]] as condemnation of homosexuality. Given that Islam views marriage as an exchange between two parties where the man offers protection and security in return for exclusive sexual and reproductive rights to the woman, same-sex marriages cannot be considered legal within the constraints of a Muslim marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Homosexuality-and-Same-Sex-Marriage-in-Islam.html |title=Homosexuality and Same-Sex Marriage in Islam on Patheos |publisher=Patheos.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhist]] scripture and teachings do not take a consistent stance against homosexuality, and do not specifically proscribe nor endorse same-sex marriage; thus, there is no unified stance for or against the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1429,0,0,1,0|title=Will gay marriage be allowed by Buddhists in Thailand?|last=Bhikkhu|first=Mettanando|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=Buddhist Channel|agency=Bangkok Post|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of same-sex marriage==

The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004:&lt;ref name=&quot;psychological&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The institution of civil marriage confers a social status and important legal benefits, rights, and privileges. ... Same-sex couples are denied equal access to civil marriage. ... Same-sex couples who enter into a civil union are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to married couples ... The benefits, rights, and privileges associated with domestic partnerships are not universally available, are not equal to those associated with marriage, and are rarely portable ... Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, and socioeconomic status ... the APA believes that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same-sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant benefits, rights, and privileges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Sociological Association]] stated in 2004:&lt;ref name=&quot;asa&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman intentionally discriminates against lesbians and gay men as well as their children and other dependents by denying access to the protections, benefits, and responsibilities extended automatically to married couples ... we believe that the official justification for the proposed constitutional amendment is based on prejudice rather than empirical research ... the American Sociological Association strongly opposes the proposed constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Canadian Psychological Association]] stated in 2006:&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literature (including the literature on which opponents to marriage of same-sex couples appear to rely) indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union. As the CPA stated in 2003, the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent. The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values. CPA asserts that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Anthropological Association]] stated in 2005:&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United Kingdom's [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] has stated the following. The statement uses the term &quot;civil partnership&quot; and not gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/PS01_2010x.pdf |author=Royal College of Psychiatrists |title=Royal College of Psychiatrists' Position Statement on Sexual Orientation |accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... lesbian, gay and bisexual people are and should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar ''[sic]'' rights and responsibilities as all other citizens. This includes ... the rights and responsibilities involved in a civil partnership ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recently, several psychological studies&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite journal | author = Price, M | title = Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans | journal = Monitor on Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | page = 10 | month = January | year = 2009 | url = http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Potoczniak, DJ | coauthors = Aldea, MA; DeBlaere, C | title = Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self-concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | month =  October | year = 2007 | pages = 447â57 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.54.4.447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Balsam, KF | coauthors = Mohr, JJ | title = Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | month = July | year = 2007 | pages = 306â19 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.54.3.306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

In 2010, a Mailman School of Public Health study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health: [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psychtoday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author=Dr. Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay activist [[Jonathan Rauch]] has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch, Jonathan. &quot;[http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/gay_marriage_1_the_case_for_marriage/ For Better or Worse?]&quot; The case for gay (and straight) marriage. ''The New Republic'', May 6, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rauch, Jonathan (2004). ''Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America.'' New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to opposite-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and opposite-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex couples and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Herek, Gregory M. &quot;Legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the United States: A social science perspective.&quot; ''American Psychologist,'' Vol 61(6), September 2006, 607â621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact:&amp;#160; Elaine Justice: 404.727.0643 |url=http://www.emory.edu/home/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html |title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections |publisher=Emory.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Fictional same-sex marriage ===
&lt;!-- This section is devoted solely to fictional places that feature same-sex marriage, please try not to mention fictional characters that are married , as that list could go on and on. --&gt;

Same-sex marriages and relationships have been a theme in several fictional story arcs, mythology, cult classics, and video games. In the video games [[Fable II]]&lt;ref&gt;Masaki, Lyle. (2007-07-17) [http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/same-sex-marriage-in-fable2 Same-sex marriage in the Fable games was no big deal for Peter Molyneux]. AfterElton.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowgamer.com/news/1028931/skyrim_includes_samesex_marriage.html Skyrim Includes Same-Sex Marriage]. NowGamer (2011-08-25). Retrieved on 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; same-sex marriage is possible.

There has been some debate as to whether same-sex marriage is legal in the [[Star Trek]] universe, as there is very little mention of [[Sexuality in Star Trek|homosexuality in Star Trek]], but during [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060702000506/http://www.philosophysphere.com/humanist.html Internet Archive Wayback Machine].

Totallykate.com (2002-08-08). Retrieved on 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; series, rumors often circulated around the topic. The independent fan series [[Star Trek: Hidden Frontier]] actually had a same-sex marriage ceremony in the series finale, but this is completely non-canon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevehoffman.tv/forums/archive/index.php/t-119521.html DIY &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies [Archive&amp;#93; â SH Forums].

[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]], a spin-off series within the [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]] saga and primary setting of the series is fairly liberal in regards to homosexual relationships and polygamy. [[Sam Adama]], a prominent character in the series is married to another man.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.out.com/detail.asp?id=26653&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarice Willow]], another major character has several wives, as well as husbands, in her [[polygamous marriage]].
