{{History of Egypt}}

The '''Egyptian Revolution of 1919''' was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and [[Sudanese]] from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghlul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, refused to recognise full Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan, or to withdraw its forces from the [[Suez Canal Zone]], factors that would continue to sour Anglo-Egyptian relations in the decades leading up to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]].

==Background==
Although the [[Ottoman Empire]] retained nominal sovereignty over [[Egypt]], the political connection between the two countries was largely severed by the [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|seizure of power by Muhammad Ali]] in 1805, and re-enforced by the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. From 1883 to 1914, though the [[Khedive]] of Egypt and Sudan remained the official ruler of the country, ultimate power was exercised by the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]]. When the [[Caucasus Campaign]] of [[World War I]] broke out between the [[Russian Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire, Britain declared [[martial law]] in Egypt and announced that it would shoulder the entire burden of the war. On December 14, 1914, Egypt became a separate [[Sultanate of Egypt|sultanate]], and was declared a British [[protectorate]], thus terminating definitively the legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty over Egypt. The terms of the protectorate led [[Egyptian nationalist]]s to believe that it was a temporary arrangement that would be changed after the war through bilateral agreement with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikitotis 1992, p. 240-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Prior to the war, nationalist agitation was limited to the educated elite. Over the course of the war however, dissatisfaction with British rule spread amongst all classes of the population. This was the result of Egyptâs increasing involvement in the war, despite Britain's promise to shoulder the entire burden of the war. During the war, the British poured masses of foreign troops into Egypt, conscripted over one and a half million Egyptians into the [[Imperial Camel Corps|Labour Corps]], and requisitioned buildings, crops, and animals for the use of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikitotis 1992, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because of allied promises during the war (such as [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson's]] [[Fourteen Points]]), Egyptian political classes prepared for self government. By warâs end the Egyptian people demanded their independence.&lt;ref&gt;Daly 1998, p. 2407&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Shortly after the [[World War I|First World War]] [[armistice]] of November 11 was concluded in [[Europe]], a delegation of Egyptian nationalist activists led by [[Saad Zaghlul]] made a request to High Commissioner [[Reginald Wingate]] to end the British Protectorate in Egypt and Sudan, and gain Egyptian representation at the next peace conference in [[Paris]]. The delegation also included 'Ali Sha'rawi Pasha, Abd al-Aziz Fahmi Bay, Muhammad 'Ali Bay, 'Abd al-Latif al-Makabati Bay, Muhammad Mahmud Pasha, Sinut Hanna Bay, Hamd Pasha al-Basil, Gurg Khayyat Bay, Mahmud Abu al-Nasr Bay, Mustafa al-Nahhas Bay and Dr. Hafiz 'Afifi Bay.&lt;ref&gt;Quraishi 1967, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a mass movement for the full independence of Egypt and Sudan was being organized at a grassroots level, using the tactics of [[civil disobedience]]. By then, Zaghlul and the [[Wafd Party]] enjoyed massive support among the Egyptian people.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikitotis 1992, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Wafdist emissaries went into towns and villages to collect signatures authorizing the movement's leaders to petition for the complete independence of the country.

Seeing the popular support that the Wafd leaders enjoyed, and fearing social unrest, the British in March 1919 proceeded to arrest Zaghlul and two other movement leaders and exiled them to [[Malta]]. Between March 15 to 31, at least 3,000 Egyptians were killed, numerous villages were burnt down, large landed properties plundered and railways destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ODfRbCkr9TAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=hauran+rebellion+1909&amp;ots=UnED07aNAU&amp;sig=Lvms9i2BXXPzFwn7OhsN7i9WXp0#v=onepage&amp;q=killed&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The result was revolution,&quot; according to noted professor of Egyptian history James Jankowski.&lt;ref&gt;2000, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

For several weeks until April, demonstrations and strikes across Egypt by students, elite, civil servants, merchants, peasants, workers, and religious leaders became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt. This mass movement was characterised by the participation of both men and women, and by spanning the religious divide between Muslim and Christian Egyptians&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising in the Egyptian countryside was more violent, involving attacks on British military installations, civilian facilities and personnel. By July 25, 1919, 800 Egyptians were dead, and 1,600 others were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B17F83D5C147A93C7AB178CD85F4D8185F9 NY Times]. 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Government sent a [[Royal Commission|Commission of Inquiry]], known as the [[Milner Mission]], to Egypt in December 1919 to determine the causes of the disorder and to make a recommendation about the political future of the country. [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner's]] report, published in February 1921, recommended that the protectorate status of Egypt was not satisfactory and should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Daly 1998, p. 249-250&lt;/ref&gt; The revolts forced London to issue a unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence on February 22, 1922.

==Aftermath==
Although the British Government offered to recognize Egypt as an independent sovereign state, this was only upon certain conditions. The following matters were reserved to the discretion of the British Government. They were: The security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt; the defense of Egypt against foreign aggression; the protection of foreign interests in Egypt; and the Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikitotis 1992, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wafd Party drafted a new [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution in 1923]] based on a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. Moreover, Britain's recognition of Egyptian independence directly excluded Sudan, which continued to be administered as an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian condominium]]. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924.
