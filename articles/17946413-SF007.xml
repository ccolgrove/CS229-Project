==Overview==
Backup applications typically use network storage for storing backup archives, but this can be problematic when such resources are not available.  [[Acronis]] designed a solution to this problem by carving off part of the local disk as a proprietary partition, which they refer to as Acronis Secure Zone (ASZ).  Since this partition is accessibly only by True Image and Backup &amp; Recovery, it functions as a backup target safe from malware, user files, or other uses or corruption. It is important to note that ATI can manage only a single ASZ per computer.

==Technical Details==
Although the Acronis Secure Zone has its own partition type, it is actually just a rebadged  [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] partition labeled '''ACRONIS SZ''', and the [[Disk partitioning#PC BIOS partition types|&quot;partition type&quot;]] code set to &lt;tt&gt;0xBC&lt;/tt&gt;. Knowing these requirements, one can manually create and/or manage existing Acronis Secure Zone using any [[partition manager]].  Since the ASZ is actually just a modified FAT32 partition type, it is possible to gain direct access to this partition by changing the partition type code in the [[MBR]] to &lt;tt&gt;0x0B&lt;/tt&gt; (FAT32 LBA) using any MBR management application such as [[MBRWizard]].  

ATI is designed to self-manage the backup archives stored to the ASZ.  As such, all backup files will be stored with autogenerated names in the root folder. If there is not enough freespace for the next backup file, ATI will automatically delete the oldest image set (base+incremental/differential files) in order to create space for the new files.  

Acronis Secure Zone differs from other backup places in that:
* It is used exclusively by ATI (this provides a level of safety against corruption)
* As it is local to the system, it is always available
* When the free space is exhausted, old archives (the oldest full slice with all its incremental/differential slices) gets automatically overwritten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us1.download.acronis.com/pdf/TrueImage10.0_ug.en.pdf Acronis True Image 10 Home User's Guide], p.13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Of course if local hard drive fails, then Acronis Secure Zone backup archive is no longer available.

==OEM Secure Zone==
[http://www.acronis.com/oem/products/pc/ OEM versions of True Image] are designed to use a special &quot;[[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] secure zone&quot;, which is technically the same as a regular ASZ, but uses a partition type of &lt;tt&gt;0xBB&lt;/tt&gt;, and typically contains only a single image file with the &quot;factory default&quot; OS and application configuration set forth by the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.acronis.com/pdf/oem_datasheet.pdf Acronis True Image OEM] &lt;/ref&gt;
