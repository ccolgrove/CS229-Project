'''Dakota L. Meyer''' (born June 26, 1988) is a [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran and recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions during the [[Battle of Ganjgal]] on September 8, 2009, part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in [[Kunar province]], [[Afghanistan]]. He is the third living recipient of the Medal of Honor since the [[Vietnam War]], and the first living United States Marine in 41 years to be so honored.

==Biography==
Meyer was born June 26, 1988 in [[Columbia, Kentucky]] where he grew up and attended school.&lt;ref name=&quot;USMCprofile&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/community/Pages/MedalofHonorSgtDakotaMeyer-Profile.aspx|title=Sgt. Dakota L. Meyer, USMC: Profile|publisher=United States Marine Corps|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, after graduation from Green County High School, he enlisted in the Marine Corps at a recruiting station in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and was sent to Recruit training at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USMCprofile&quot;/&gt; After completing training to be a United States Marine he deployed to [[Fallujah]], [[Iraq]], in 2007 as a [[Scout Sniper]] with [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines]]. He gained national attention for his actions in Afghanistan during his second deployment in [[Kunar province]] with Embedded Training Team 2-8.&lt;ref name=MCT1123&gt;{{cite news|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|title=MoH nominee says he does not feel like a hero|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/11/marine-dakota-meyer-medal-of-honor-113010/|accessdate=15 August 2011|newspaper=Marine Corps Times|date=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estep, Bill, &quot;Adair Native To Receive Medal Of Honor For 'Worst Day' Of His Life&quot;, ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'', 13 September 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2009, near the village of Ganjgal, Meyer learned that three U.S. Marines and a [[United States Navy Hospital Corpsman|U.S. Navy corpsman]] were missing after being ambushed by a group of insurgents. He charged into an area known to be inhabited by insurgents and under enemy fire. Meyer eventually found all four dead and stripped of their weapons, body armor, and radios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Lamothe |first = Dan |title = Heroism in ambush may yield top valor awards |publisher = Marine Corps Times |date = November 8, 2010 |url = http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/08/marine_moh_080110w/ |accessdate = November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of some friendly Afghan soldiers, he moved the bodies to a safer area where they could be extracted.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, William, &quot;Reluctant Hero And The Weight Of A Medal&quot;, ''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]'', 28 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During his search, Meyer &quot;personally evacuated 12 friendly wounded, and provided cover for another 24 Marines and soldiers to escape likely death at the hands of a numerically superior and determined foe.&quot;

On November 6, 2010, the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] General [[James Amos]] told reporters during a visit to [[Camp Pendleton]], California, that a living Marine had been nominated for the Medal of Honor. Two days later, ''[[Marine Corps Times]]'', an independent newspaper covering U.S. Marine operations, reported that the unnamed individual was Meyer, citing anonymous sources. CNN confirmed the story independently two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Lamothe |first = Dan |title = Ambush survivor up for Medal of Honor |publisher = Marine Corps Times |date = November 10, 2010 |url = http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/11/marine-corporal-dakota-meyer-nominated-for-medal-of-honor-110810w/ |accessdate = November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Lamothe |first = Dan |title = Behind the Cover: An exclusive interview with Dakota Meyer, Medal of Honor nominee |publisher = Marine Corps Times |date = November 15, 2010 |url = http://militarytimes.com/blogs/battle-rattle/2010/11/15/behind-the-cover-an-exclusive-interview-with-dakota-meyer-medal-of-honor-nominee// |accessdate = November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2011, the Marine Corps announced that two other Marines on Meyer's team in Ganjgal would receive the [[Navy Cross]], the second-highest award for valor a Marine can receive. Capt. Ademola D. Fabayo and Staff Sgt. Juan J. Rodriguez-Chavez were recognized for their roles in retrieving the Marines and corpsman. Before Meyer went looking for the missing men on foot, Rodriguez-Chavez drove a gun truck into the kill zone, with Fabayo manning its machine gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Lamothe |first = Dan |title = Marines earn Navy Cross for Ganjgal heroism |publisher = Marine Corps Times |date = June 9, 2011 |url = http://marinecorpstimes.com/news/2011/06/marine-ganjgal-afghanistan-navy-cross-060911w/ |accessdate = June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When President Barack Obama's staff called Meyer to set up a time for the President to inform him that his case for the Medal of Honor had been approved, Meyer was working at his construction job and asked if they could please call him back when he was on his lunch break, which they later did. Dakota then returned to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Memoli |first = Michael A. |title = Obama awards Medal of Honor to Kentucky Marine |publisher = Los Angeles Times |date = September 15, 2011 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/15/news/la-pn-medal-of-honor-20110915 |accessdate = September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony on September 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Obama to Present Marine With Medal of Honor in September, White House Announces |publisher = Fox News|date = August 12, 2011 |url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/12/obama-to-present-marine-with-medal-honor-in-september-white-house-announces/ |accessdate = August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN12AUG&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title = Marine to receive Medal of Honor next month |publisher = CNN|date = August 12, 2011 |url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/08/12/obama.medal.of.honor/index.html |accessdate = August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a White House staffer contacted Meyer to arrange the ceremony, the former Marine asked if he could have a beer with the President.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/sgt-dakota-meyer-grabs-a-beer-with-president-obama/&lt;/ref&gt; He then received an invitation to the White House the afternoon before the ceremony. Meyer also requested that when he was honored, simultaneous commemorative services should be held at other associated locations to honor the memory of his colleagues who died or were mortally wounded during the ambush and his rescue attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-Marine honored for saving 36 in Afghanistan |author=Dylan Lovan |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 14, 2011 |url=http://www.pjstar.com/free/x371957547/Ex-Marine-honored-for-saving-36-in-Afghanistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Americans died in the ambush: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, a 25-year-old from Virginia Beach; Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Ga.; Hospital Corpsman Third Class James R. Layton, 22, of Riverbank, Calif.; and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., a 31-year-old Gunnery Sergeant from Columbus, Ga. A fifth man, Army Sgt. 1st Class  Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, N.M., later died from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=140485998|title=Defying Orders, Hero Marine Saved Other Troops|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=September 15, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dakota Meyer has filed a lawsuit against his former employer, defense contractor [[BAE Systems]], alleging the company and his supervisor there punished him for his opposition to a weapons sale to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medal of Honor hero sues contractor|url=http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/29/medal-of-honor-herosues-contractor/|work=CNN|author=Charley Keyes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer is suing defense contractor BAE Systems OASYS Inc. that he says ridiculed his Medal of Honor, called him mentally unstable and suggested he had a drinking problem, thereby costing him a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medal of Honor recipient sues defense contractor|url=http://news.yahoo.com/medal-honor-recipient-sues-defense-contractor-165936274.html|work=AP Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the repeated risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a member of Marine Embedded Training Team 2-8, Regional Corps Advisory Command 3-7, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on 8 September 2009. When the forward element of his combat team began to be hit by intense fire from roughly 50 Taliban insurgents dug-in and concealed on the slopes above Ganjgal village, Corporal Meyer mounted a gun-truck, enlisted a fellow Marine to drive, and raced to attack the ambushers and aid the trapped Marines and Afghan soldiers. During a six hour fire fight, Corporal Meyer single-handedly turned the tide of the battle, saved 36 Marines and soldiers and recovered the bodies of his fallen brothers. Four separate times he fought the kilometer up into the heart of a deadly U-shaped ambush. During the fight he killed at least eight Taliban, personally evacuated 12 friendly wounded, and provided cover for another 24 Marines and soldiers to escape likely death at the hands of a numerically superior and determined foe. On his first foray his lone vehicle drew machine gun, mortar, rocket grenade and small arms fire while he rescued five wounded soldiers. His second attack disrupted the enemyâs ambush and he evacuated four more wounded Marines. Switching to another gun-truck because his was too damaged they again sped in for a third time, and as turret gunner killed several Taliban attackers at point blank range and suppressed enemy fire so 24 Marines and soldiers could break-out. Despite being wounded, he made a fourth attack with three others to search for missing team members. Nearly surrounded and under heavy fire he dismounted the vehicle and searched house to house to recover the bodies of his fallen team members. By his extraordinary heroism, presence of mind amidst chaos and death, and unselfish devotion to his comrades in the face of great danger, Corporal Meyer reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/community/Pages/MedalofHonorSgtDakotaMeyer-Citation.aspx |title=Citation |author= |date= |work=Medal of Honor Sgt Dakota Meyer |publisher=United States Marine Corps |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
