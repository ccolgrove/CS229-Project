The '''2011 Chinese pro-democracy  protests'''&lt;ref name=&quot;time_22feb&quot; /&gt; refer to weekly street actions in over a dozen cities in mainland [[People's Republic of China|China]] starting on 20 February 2011, inspired by and named after the [[Tunisian Revolution#Naming|Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia]];&lt;ref name=&quot;FT_weeklydemosPRC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_27Febplans&quot;/&gt; the actions that took and take place at protest sites, and response by the Chinese government to the calls and action.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_27Febplans&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes_PRC_26Feb&quot; /&gt;

Initially, organisers recommended shouting slogans on 20 February. After participants and journalists having been beaten and arrested, organisers urged a change to &quot;strolling&quot; on 27 February in order to minimize police reactions while sustaining the cycle of actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_27Febplans&quot;/&gt; On this 2nd protest day, the number of protesters could not be determined. Protest and/or official actions were noted in only two out of the thirteen suggested cities, it was even less clear who were protestors and who were just regular strollers. Notwithstanding, police mounted a &quot;huge&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj_engle_beaten&quot; /&gt; security operation on both 20 and 27 February. Media sources reported that on 27 February, at least four foreign journalists, including Stephen Engle of Bloomberg News and a BBC cameraman, had been beaten by plain-clothes security officers in Beijing.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj_engle_beaten&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_grammaticas_bashed&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_grammaticas_bashed&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_JoKent&quot; /&gt; Police arrested protesters. In Shanghai, protestors successfully prevented police from making an arrest and were able to air their slogans with foreign journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP_unconventional&quot; /&gt; Since late February, about 35 human rights activists and lawyers were arrested&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_27Febplans&quot; /&gt; and five people were charged with [[inciting subversion of state power]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes_PRC_26Feb&quot; /&gt;

===Initial call===
The anonymous call for a 'Jasmine revolution' in China's major cities was made online, first on the [[Boxun.com]] website, run by overseas dissidents, and then on Twitter.&lt;ref name=&quot;time_22feb&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ramzy |first=Austin |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2052860,00.html |title=China Cracks Down After 'Jasmine Revolution' Protest Call |work=TIME |accessdate=22 February 2011 |date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AFP via Google. &quot;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gdb6d9fdbjbk3XXfkCIHj4X-OSLg?docId=CNG.7a0509e93accafbdfd4785aad6cc3018.441 China web users call for 'Jasmine Revolution'].&quot; ''China web users call for 'Jasmine Revolution'.''

On 2 March, organisers declared a three-stage strategy. The first stage would take &quot;a few weeks, a couple of months, a year or even longer&quot;; the second stage would include &quot;holding a jasmine flower and [using] mobile phones or music players to play [the folk song] ''[[Mo Li Hua|Such a Beautiful Jasmine]]''&quot;. Organisers declared the third stage as  &quot;when the street-walking revolution is irreversible&quot;; it would involve people criticising the government openly and without fear.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP_unconventional&quot;/&gt;

The media reported a vindication by protest organisers on 2 March saying, &quot;Now China's government clearly shows its horror and fear of the people, as if facing a deadly enemy. A modest amount of people, just by walking, have demonstrated the people's power, and the government's response has revealed its weaknesses to the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP_unconventional&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=Will | last=Clem | title=The flowering of an unconventional revolution | date=3 March 2011 |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong | url=http://topics.scmp.com/news/china-news-watch/article/The-flowering-of-an-unconventional-revolution |accessdate=3 March 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wuxVUdhV |archivedate=3 March 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Peter (3 Mar 2011) [http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/20110303/wl_csm/367034 &quot;Report on China's 'Jasmine Revolution'?

==February 2011==
===20 February===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:0001.png|thumb|alt=|US ambassador Jon Huntsman, Jr. seen at the Beijing protest site on 20 February]] --&gt;

The Associated Press, reported only &quot;a handful of people&quot; were known to have actively involved in organizing the staging rallies in 13 cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_27Febplans&quot;/&gt; The ''Globe and Mail'' reported that the 20 February appeal was answered by 200 people at the Beijing rendezvous. There was a similar protest in Shanghai with about 100 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canada |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/asia-pacific/china-halts-online-call-for-a-jasmine-revolution/article1914553/ |title=China halts online call for a âjasmine revolutionâ |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=22 February 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An elderly female demonstrator in Shanghai stated: &quot;Our country has no proper legal system, it's a one-party dictatorship, a tyranny, that suppresses the citizens. There is also land eviction. Many people are beaten to death in many land eviction cases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://itn.co.uk/1d1e962f11c62e23239e179b0dd7960b.html &quot;The Chinese authorities have cracked down on a small pro-democracy rally apparently modelled on the protests sweeping the Arab world&quot;, ITN News London 2/20/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Ambassador to China, [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]], was seen at the protest rendezvous point. Huntsman exchanged a few words with people in Chinese and then his entourage departed the site immediately. US Embassy spokeman Richard Buangan said that Huntsman and family were on their way to a museum and &quot;they immediately left&quot; once they realized what was going on. The [[Atlantic Wire]] reports: &quot;that hasn't stopped nationalist Chinese bloggers from using Huntsman's appearance to drum-up conspiracies of a U.S. plot to destabilize China&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlanticwire_huntsman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson |first=John |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Spotted-Jon-Hunstman-Goes-Revolutionary-Chic-3247/ |title=Spotted: Jon Hunstman Goes Revolutionary Chic |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_huntsman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/simp/china/2011/02/110223_us_ambassador_beijing.shtml |title=BBC ä¸­æç½ â ä¸¤å²¸ä¸å° â Âæ´ªåå¹å¨èèè±ç¤ºå¨å°ç¹å±å·§åÂ |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lizza |first=Ryan |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/02/the-huntsman-walk.html |title=The Huntsman Walk |work=The New Yorker |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burr |first=Thomas |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/51307448-76/huntsman-china-rally-ambassador.html.csp |title=Huntsman at China rally â by accident |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===27 February===
After the police response to the protests on 20 February, the organizers urged the participants not to shout slogans any more, but simply to stroll silently at the respective protest sites. The call to use &quot;strolling&quot; tactics for the 27 February gatherings was made on the Boxun.com website on 22 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_27Febplans&quot;/&gt; Prior to the planned 27 February gathering in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Beijing, authorities installed metal corrugated fencing outside the restaurant and outside the home of [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel laureate]] and dissident [[Liu Xiaobo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes_PRC_26Feb&quot; /&gt; Hundreds of uniformed and plain-clothed security staff and volunteers wearing red armbands were pre-emptively stationed at Wangfujing. Their presence disrupted normal shopping and attracted onlookers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj_engle_beaten&quot;/&gt; Police began to clear the rendezvous area half an hour after the designated assembly time.&lt;ref name=&quot;webjiabao_webchat&quot; /&gt;

On 27 February, activists in 2 cities â Beijing and Shanghai â out of the 23 originally suggested responded. Seven people were reportedly arrested in Shanghai and police kept reporters, participants and strollers moving. Since the organisers proposed for protesters to just walk by silently to protest, it was impossible to tell who were protesting and who were just regular strollers on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE71Q0TR20110227?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=China protest call smothered in police blanket |agency=Reuters |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' stated, &quot;while several Chinese people were seen having altercations with the police, there were no signs of actual protests.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj_engle_beaten&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14877405,00.html |title=Chinese police detain German journalists covering protests |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beijing====
Several foreign journalists were physically beaten by the police, with many others physically pushed by the police, their cameras confiscated and footage deleted.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_JoKent&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' gave an eyewitness account of an incident in Beijing in which [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]] reporter [[Stephen Engle]] was &quot;grabbed by several security officers, pushed to the ground, dragged along by his leg, punched in the head and beaten with a broom handle by a man dressed as street sweeper.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj_engle_beaten&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=Jeremy | last=Page |coauthors= James T.

[[BBC]] reporter [[Damian Grammaticas]] accused state security of roughing up his crew. He said that they tried to grab equipment from the cameraman and took him 50 yards away into a police van. Grammaticas alleged the police officers then set on him, pulled him by the hair and generally treated him roughly. He also alleged that the police officers then threw the crew into a van and threatened them during their transport to a government office.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_grammaticas_bashed&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=Damian | last=Grammaticas | title=Calls for protests in China met with brutality | date=28 February 2011 |publisher=BBC   | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12593328 |accessdate=28 February 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wqKpToUM |archivedate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN]] reporter [[Eunice Yoon]] reported that a policeman in Wangfujing knocked a camera out of her colleague Jo Ling Kent's hand and six police officers physically forced them into a bank, where they were detained for half an hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_JoKent&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=Eunice | last=Yoon | title=Getting harassed by the Chinese police | date=28 February 2011 |publisher=CNN | url=http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/28/getting-harassed-by-the-chinese-police/ |accessdate=28 February 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wqMVjba1 |archivedate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoon remarked after the incident that &quot;there had been no protests for us to cover&quot;, and that the incident &quot;show[ed] how incredibly terrified and paranoid the Chinese authorities are&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;business.blogs.cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Posted by: CNN Beijing correspondent, Eunice Yoon |url=http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/28/getting-harassed-by-the-chinese-police/ |title=Getting harassed by the Chinese police â Business 360 â CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Business.blogs.cnn.com |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asia Television Limited|ATV]] journalists and a [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]] cameraman were also reportedly briefly detained.

====Shanghai====
In Shanghai on 27 February, protestors prevented police from arresting an elderly man, when they &quot;reacted instantly and angrily, emitting a guttural roar and surging forward almost as one&quot;, according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Protestors included elderly people and youths documenting the protest with cameras and phones. Some of the core participants appeared to be &quot;deliberately obstructing police efforts to keep the crowd flowing&quot;. Other protestors spoke to foreign journalists and joked to each other about police difficulties in stopping &quot;demonstrations that were not actually happening&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP_unconventional&quot; /&gt;

====Hong Kong====

Since the word &quot;Jasmine&quot; was forbidden in the Chinese blogosphere, millions of netizens used the term &quot;two conferences&quot; instead, a widely used expression in the official news originally pointing to the two conferences &quot;Fourth Session of the Eleventh National People's Congress&quot; and &quot;Fourth Session of the Eleventh CPPCC&quot; happening in March in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogotariat.com/node/213917 |title=The 'Jasmine Revolution' |work=Blogotariat |date=10 April 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February, several foreign journalists were contacted by police and told that they could not conduct interviews without applying for permission.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes_PRC_26Feb&quot; /&gt; Regulations issued by the Chinese government forbid entry by foreign reporters into the Wangfujing shopping district in Beijing or the Peopleâs Park in central Shanghai without a special permit.

Following calls for a &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; on Twitter, Chinese users of Twitter began to notice a number of new accounts, sometimes using the names or images of Chinese democracy activists. Tweets by the new accounts took a hostile position to calls for demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2011/02/fifty-cent-tweets-a-collection-of-anti-jasmine-revolution-messages/ |title=Remarkable Quotes from the Fifty Cent Party: Anti-Jasmine Revolution Tweets |date=28 February 2011 |publisher=China Digital Times |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March, [[Google]] stated that intermittent problems with [[Gmail]] in the PRC constitute &quot;a government blockage carefully designed to look like the problem is with Gmail&quot;.

A high level Chinese government official Zhao Qizheng said, on 23 February, that the probability of China having a &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; is &quot;absurd and unrealistic&quot;. He also said that &quot;although there are many problems in China right now, the government is doing the best it can to try and combat these problems instead of ignoring them.

====Wu Bangguo's five &quot;No&quot;====
Addressing the meeting of the National People's Congress, its chairman [[Wu Bangguo]] dismissed any notion of political reform, saying that Western-style democracy would have dire consequences, and that any loosening of the Party's hold on power could undermine stability and risk domestic strife, and he also:&quot;advocated the five noes: no multi-party election; no diversified guiding principles, no separation of powers, no federal system and no privatization&quot;.&lt;ref name=scmp20110311&gt;Shi Jiangtao (11 Mar 2011). &quot;Beijing slams door on political reform&quot;, ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/china-prepares-for-war-without-gun-smoke/435812 The Jakarta Globe China Prepares for 'War Without Gun Smoke' Ching Cheong â Straits Times Indonesia |  16 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Wu, who belongs to the conservative faction of the leadership, said: &quot;We have made a solemn declaration that we will not employ a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; diversify our guiding thought; separate executive, legislative and judicial powers; use a bicameral or federal system; or carry out privatisation.&quot; Analysts said the warnings were aimed at consolidating the party's power, in reaction to calls for liberal democracy in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref name=scmp20110311/&gt; On the other hand, the more liberal Wen Jiabao said that economic and political reform, safeguarding social equity and justice were major factors behind China's success. He also rejected comparisons with Egypt and Tunisia, and reiterated his support for greater democracy and public supervision, saying economic development alone could not solve the problems of the mainland's development.

''Time'' suggested that though there are many similarities between the complaints [[2010â2011 Middle East and North Africa protests|voiced by the people in the Middle East and North Africa]] and those voiced by the Chinese people, the state's tighter grip on the country's media, Internet and other communication forums pose difficulties for anyone trying to organise mass demonstrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|agency=AP |author=ANITA CHANG |url=http://www.time.com/t ime/world/article/0,8599,2052847,00.html |title=China Suppresses 'Jasmine Revolution' |work=TIME |date= 20 Feb. 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Wall Street Journal'' said that the online protest appeal could compound apparent concern among [[Chinese Communist Party]] leaders that the recent uprisings against authoritarian governments in the Middle East and North Africa could inspire similar unrest in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Page |first=Jeremy |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703498804576156203874160350.html |title=Call for Protests Unnerves Beijing |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN]] journalist Eunice Yoon and her news crew headed out to Wangfujing to cover the &quot;response to anonymous calls on the Internet to stage protests and begin a Tunisia-style &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; in China&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;business.blogs.cnn.com&quot;/&gt; was physically handled by police in Beijing on 27 February at arrival near the protest site. She wrote: &quot;What makes China's treatment of the international press so bewildering is that there had been no protests for us to cover here..... My own experience and those of my colleagues show how incredibly terrified and paranoid the Chinese authorities are of any anti-government movement forming in China.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_JoKent&quot; /&gt;

Following the arrests of approximately 15 foreign journalists on 6 March, ''[[The Australian]]'' described the attempts at organising a &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; in China as &quot;the biggest showdown between Chinese authorities and foreign media in more than two decades.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;australian&quot; /&gt;

''[[The Atlantic]]'' reported that [[Hillary Clinton]] thinks the Chinese government is &quot;scared&quot; of the Arab rising. &quot;They're worried, and they are trying to stop history, which is a [[Snipe hunt|fool's errand]]. They cannot do it. But they're going to hold it off as long as possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jeffrey  (10 May 2011).

'''about Leadership dispute'''
It is said that this event was taken advantage of some oversea acitivists who want to say they are the leader of this event and get benefit from this leadership position, like funding from American anti-Chinese groups.Some people claimed that this event is not initiated by those oversea people who made a website about Jasmine revolution of China. They criticized them in trying to grasp the effort to their own. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=anonymous|first=anonymous|title=Back of Jasmine Revolution|url=http://bbs.wolfax.com/thread-14137-1-1.html|work=Back of Jasmine Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan protests===
On 24 February, whilst visiting [[Kaohsiung]] to discuss economic ties between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan (ROC), [[Chen Yun-lin]], Chairman of Mainland China's [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sinoda1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodaily.com/reports/Taiwan_protesters_throw_flowers_at_China_envoy_999.html |title=Taiwan protesters throw flowers at China envoy |publisher=Sinodaily.com |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was mobbed by about 200 protesters at Kaohsiung Harbor. Some protesters threw [[chrysanthemum]] flowers at him (as Jasmine flowers were not in season), while others tried to deliver plastic jasmine flowers and juice to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinoda1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ya0225&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/02/25/2003496737 |title=Protesters throw flowers at Chen Yunlin |work=Taipei Times |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, at [[Kaohsiung Station]], Chen had already encountered two groups of demonstrators, one supporting [[Taiwanese independence]] and another [[Chinese unification]]. Police claimed that the groups both numbered about 50 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinoda1&quot; /&gt; About 300 [[Falun Gong]] followers also staged a protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinoda1&quot; /&gt; On 8 March, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] released a strongly worded statement condemning the use of force against participants of the âJasmine Revolutionâ in China. The statement urged the government to incorporate values of democracy and human rights into agreements with Beijing when promoting cross-strait ties to encourage âChinaâs democratic transformation.â&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Y.
