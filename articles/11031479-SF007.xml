'''Windows Internet Explorer 8''' (abbreviated as '''IE8''') is a [[web browser]] developed by [[Microsoft]] in the [[Internet Explorer]] browser series. The browser was released on March 19, 2009 for [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows Server 2008]], and [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rtm&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx Internet Explorer 8 download]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] builds are available. It is the successor to [[Internet Explorer 7]], released in 2006, and is the default browser for [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Internet Explorer 8 is the first version of IE to pass the [[Acid2]] test, and the last of the major browsers to do so, although it scores only 20/100 on the [[Acid3]] Test. According to Microsoft, security, ease of use, and improvements in [[RSS]], [[Cascading Style Sheets]], and [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] support were its priorities for IE8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;additional languages, for a total of 63 by June 2009, were released, but not all languages are available on all Windows versions.

On January 5, 2009, a tool was provided by Microsoft to block the automatic install of Internet Explorer 8 via [[Windows Update]].

As of May 20, 2009, Windows XPe (Embedded) was not a supported platform for Internet Explorer 8. There have been no announcements of planned support.

On May 27, 2010, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 8 optimized for Bing and MSN. The file name is BOIE8_ENUS_XP.exe.

===Language support===
Language support (localization) was not complete on release. IE8 was released with 25 languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Explorer 8&quot;/&gt; This has grown up to 63 for Vista 32-bit in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/06/26/ie8-is-now-available-on-windows-xp-for-5-more-languages.aspx |title=IE8 is now available on Windows XP for 5 more languages |author=Vishwac Sena Kannan (Microsoft) |date=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for additional languages can come pre-installed based on the OS, or from downloaded &quot;MUI&quot; language packs.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.msdn.com&quot;/&gt; MUI stands for ''Multilingual User Interface''.

== Features ==
[[File:IE8 quick tabs.png|thumb|Quicktabs]]
Internet Explorer 8 contains many new features, including ''WebSlices'' and ''Accelerators''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mjfoley&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1241 | title = IE 8 to feature WebSlices, Activities | author = Mary Jo Foley | publisher = [[CNet]] Blogs | accessdate = 2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gallery&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ie.microsoft.com/activities/en-en/Default.aspx | title = Internet Explorer 8: Service Gallery | publisher = Microsoft | accessdate = 2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [[File:Internet Explorer 8 Overview.ogv|thumb|350px|Internet Explorer 8 Overview]] --&gt;

=== Added features ===
==== Accelerators ====
{{Main|Accelerator (Internet Explorer)}}
[[Image:Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 Activities.png|thumb|225px|right|A map Accelerator using the IE8 Accelerators [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]]]]
Accelerators are a form of '''[[selection-based search]]''' which allow a user to invoke an online service from any other page using only the mouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;newfeat&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/NewFeatures.htm | title = New and exciting features | accessdate = 2008-03-05 | publisher = [[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions such as selecting the text or other objects will give users access to the usable Accelerator services (such as blogging with the selected text, or viewing a map of a selected geographical location), which can then be invoked with the selected object. According to [[Microsoft]], Accelerators eliminate the need to copy and paste content between web pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;mjfoley&quot; /&gt; IE8 specifies an [[XML]]-based encoding which allows a [[web application]] or [[web service]] to be invoked as an Accelerator service. How the service will be invoked and for what categories of content it will show up are specified in the XML file.&lt;ref name=&quot;lightup&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/DevelopersNew.htm | title = How do I make my site 'light up' with Internet Explorer 8? | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities have been drawn between Accelerators and the controversial [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tags]] feature experimented with in the [[Internet Explorer 6|IE 6 Beta]] but withdrawn after criticism (though later included in MS Office).&lt;ref name=&quot;wsbetareview&quot;/&gt;

==== Autocomplete changes ====
The [[address bar]] features domain highlighting for added security so that the top-level domain is shown in black whereas the other parts of the URL are grayed out. Domain highlighting cannot be turned off by users or web sites. Other features of the address bar include support for pasting multi-line URLs and an improved model for inserting the selection caret, and selecting words, or entire URLs in the Address bar. The inline autocomplete feature has been dropped from Internet Explorer 8, leading to criticism by [[beta version|beta users]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AddBarIE8&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/11/address-bar-improvements-in-internet-explorer-8-beta-1.aspx Address Bar improvements in Internet Explorer 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Automatic Tab crash recovery ====
If a website or add-on causes a tab to crash in Internet Explorer 8, only that tab is affected. The browser itself remains stable and other tabs remain unaffected, thereby minimizing any disruption to the browsing experience. If a tab unexpectedly closes or crashes it is automatically reloaded with the same content as before the crash.

==== Developer tools ====
For developers, IE8 includes tools that allow [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] debugging directly from the browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/readiness/developers-new.aspx#tools
|title=Internet Explorer 8 Readiness Toolkit
|date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Favorites Bar ====
Another new feature in IE8 is a redesigned ''Favorites Bar'', which can now host content such as Web Slices, [[web feed]]s, and documents, in addition to website links.

==== Inline search within pages ====
Internet Explorer 8 now has replaced the ''Find...'' dialog box with an inline ''Find'' toolbar which can be activated by pressing CTRL+F or from search box drop-down menu but the F3 (or any other kind of a keyboard-driven) NextFind command has gone. Internet Explorer 8 highlights all instances of found words while allowing the user to continue the navigation normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate = 8 January 2010 |url = http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/features/faster.aspx |title = Internet Explorer 8: Features (Section: Better Find on Page) |work = Internet Explorer 8 web site |publisher = Microsoft Corporation |quote = Internet Explorer 8 includes a completely redesigned Find On Page toolbar, which is activated by pressing Ctrl-F or choosing Find On Page from the Edit menu or Search box drop-down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== InPrivate ====
{{Main|privacy mode}}
[[Image:Internet Explorer 8 InPrivate.png|thumb|225px|right|Internet Explorer 8 in InPrivate mode]] A new security mode called InPrivate debuted with IE8, and consists of two main features: InPrivate Browsing and InPrivate Filtering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mediati2008Aug27&quot; /&gt; InPrivate Browsing has been described as a &quot;[[porn mode]]&quot; in various news outlets.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDougall2008Aug26&quot;&gt;{{cite news

InPrivate Browsing in Internet Explorer 8 helps prevent one's browsing history, temporary Internet files, form data, cookies, and usernames and passwords from being retained by the browser, leaving no easily accessible evidence of browsing or search history.
InPrivate Filtering provides users an added level of control and choice about the information that third party websites can use to track browsing activity. InPrivate Subscriptions allow you to augment the capability of InPrivate Blocking by subscribing to lists of websites to block or allow.

As with other private browsing modes there are ways that information about a browsing session can be recovered.

==== Performance and stability ====
[[Image:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|225px|The architecture of IE8]]
Internet Explorer 8 includes performance improvements across the HTML parser, CSS engine, mark-up tree manipulation as well as the [[JScript]] runtime and the associated [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]]. [[Memory leak]]s due to inconsistent handling of circular references between JScript objects and DOM objects were corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd361842%28v=vs.85%29.aspx | title = Circular Memory Leak Mitigation | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For better security and stability, IE8 uses the ''Loosely Coupled Internet Explorer'' (''LCIE'') architecture and [[Process isolation|runs the browser frame and tabs in separate processes]]. LCIE prevents glitches and hangs from bringing down the entire browser and leads to higher performance and scalability. Permissions for [[ActiveX]] controls have been made more flexible - instead of enabling or disabling them globally, they can now be allowed on a per-site basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;addons&quot; /&gt;

====SmartScreen Filter====
SmartScreen Filter extended [[Internet Explorer 7]]'s [[phishing]] filter to include protection from socially engineered malware. Every website and download is checked against a local list of popular legitimate websites, if the site is not listed the entire address is sent to Microsoft for further checks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/privacy.aspx#services&lt;/ref&gt; If it has been labeled as an [[impostor]] or harmful, Internet Explorer 8 will show a screen prompting that the site is reported harmful and shouldn't be visited. From there the user can either visit his or her [[homepage]], visit the previous site, or continue to the unsafe page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-iii-smartscreen-filter.aspx |title=IE8 Security Part III: SmartScreen Filter |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |author=Eric Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; New with SmartScreen in IE8: if a user attempts to download a file from a location reported harmful then the download is cancelled. The effectiveness of SmartScreen filtering is superior to socially engineered malware protection in other browsers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.nsslabs.com/assets/noreg-reports/NSSLabs%20Browser%20Security%20Test%20-%20Socially%20Engineered%20Malware%202009Q1.pdf|title=the Q3 Socially Engineered Malware Test Report |date=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This feature can be disabled or enforced using [[Group Policy]].

==== Suggested Sites ====
This feature is described by Microsoft as a tool to suggest websites, which is done by the browser sending information to Microsoft over a secure connection, which keeps the information and a per-session, uniquely-generated identifier for a short time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieblog-suggestedsites&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/02/05/suggested-sites-privacy.aspx
|title=Suggested Sites &amp; Privacy
|date=February 5, 2009
|accessdate=2009-02-06
|work=IEBlog
|publisher=Microsoft
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Suggested Sites feature is turned off by default and is disabled when the user is browsing with InPrivate enabled or visiting [[transport layer security|SSL]]-secured, intranet, IP address, or [[Internationalized domain name|IDN]] address sites. Potentially personally-identifiable information such as the user's IP address and browser information is sent to Microsoft as an artifact of the [[HTTPS]] protocol. Microsoft has stated that they do not store this information.

The functionality was defended by Microsoft after itworld.com's Gregg Keizer described it as a &quot;[[Phoning home|phone home]]&quot; feature.&lt;ref name=&quot;itworld.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.itworld.com/internet/54997/microsoft-defends-internet-explorer-privacy Microsoft defends Internet Explorer 'phone home' feature | ITworld]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Web Slices and authenticated feeds ====
{{Main|Web Slice}}
[[Image:Internet Explorer 8 Web Slice.png|225px|thumb|right|IE8 Favorites menu displaying a WebSlice in a flyout Window]]
[[Web Slice]]s are snippets of the entire page to which a user can [[web feed|subscribe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newfeat&quot; /&gt; Web Slices will be kept updated by the browser automatically, and can be viewed directly from the Favorites bar, complete with graphics and visuals. Developers can mark parts of the pages as Web Slices, using the &lt;code&gt;hAtom&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hSlice&lt;/code&gt; [[microformat]]. Web Slices have been compared to [[Active Desktop]], introduced in [[Internet Explorer 4]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;welcometo1997&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.computerworld.com/ie8s_new_webslices_feature_welcome_to_1997 | title = IE8's new WebSlices feature: Welcome to 1997 |author = Preston Gralla | publisher = Computer World | accessdate = 2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft donated the specification to the [[public domain]] under the [[Creative Commons]] Public Domain Dedication. It is also covered by the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc304073(VS.85).aspx Web Slice Format Specification - Version 0.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows RSS Platform]] also supports authenticated feeds beginning with Internet Explorer 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/6/F26DF665-1FFF-42F1-A47E-F60D16BDF2E4/AuthenticatedRSSFeeds-IE8DeveloperSeriesInformationPage.pdf Authenticated Feeds]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zooming and image scaling ====
Full-page zoom now reflows the text to remove the appearance of horizontal scrollbars on zooming.&lt;ref name=&quot;addons&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/DevelopersExisting.htm | title = How do I keep my site and add-ons working with Internet Explorer 8? | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Image scaling is done using [[bicubic interpolation]] resulting in smoother looking images when scaled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc849094(VS.85).aspx#scale Image Scaling in Internet Explorer 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the compatibility mode will cause style issues with &amp;lt;select&amp;gt; form elements when changing zoom levels.

===Multilingual User Interface (MUI)===
''see [[Internet Explorer 8#Language support]]''

===Per-Site ActiveX Controls===
The Information bar lets users allow an ActiveX control to run on all Web sites or only the current one (Per-Site basis). Users can easily make changes to this behavior through the Manage Add-ons dialog box. For each ActiveX control there's a list of sites where it has been approved by the user.

=== Removed features ===
* In Internet Explorer 8, the previous session can no longer be automatically restored the next time. The user must remember to and manually open it the next time. &lt;ref&gt; [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/askie/archive/2009/03/16/open-these-the-next-time-i-use-internet-explorer-no-longer-an-option-in-ie-8.aspx âOpen these the next time I use Internet Explorerâ no longer an option in IE 8] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards support==
===Standards mode===
Internet Explorer 8's main rendering mode, known as standards mode, has improved support for various [[web standards]], especially [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], compared to Internet Explorer 7 and earlier versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;msdnie8&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx |title=Microsoft's Interoperability Principles and IE8 |last=Hachamovitch |first=Dean |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- A third-party reference would be good to have here... --&gt;

The web standards supported by IE8 include the following:
* [[Accessible Rich Internet Applications]] ([http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria ARIA]) specification for enhanced accessibility in [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]-based [[rich Internet application]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;addons&quot; /&gt;
* [[CSS]] level 1 is fully supported. CSS level 2 is mostly supported,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#browsers W3C - CSS browsers]&lt;/ref&gt; however several rendering bugs and regressions may affect conformance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idreamincode.co.uk/ie8-bugs James Hopkins &amp;raquo; IE8 Bugs]&lt;/ref&gt; CSS level 3 is partially supported.
* [[Data: URI]]s (limited to non-navigable content less than 32KiB)
* [[Document Object Model|DOM]], that brings it in line with implementations in other browsers. Attributes and properties in DOM objects are now handled differently, and the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;getAttribute&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setAttribute&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;removeAttribute&lt;/code&gt; modifiers have been changed to match the behavior of other browsers.&lt;ref name=&quot;lightup&quot; /&gt;
* [[DOM storage]]
* [[HTML]], including the HTML [[HTML element#Images and objects|object]] fallback and the &lt;code&gt;[[HTML element#General phrase elements|abbr]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;q&gt; elements&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc304133(VS.85).aspx#Quoting HTML Enhancements in Internet Explorer 8].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Partial [[HTML 5]] support, including [http://virtuelvis.com/archives/2005/12/cross-document-messaging cross-document messaging]
* [http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/ Selectors] APIs

However, IE8 does not support some other W3C standards:
* [[MathML]]
* Significant parts of [[Document_Object_Model#Standardization|DOM Level 2 and 3]], including the standard [[DOM Events|event model]] used by other browsers.
* [[SVG]]. The fact that IE8 does not support SVG was criticized by [[Tim Berners-Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/224043/bernerslee-unhappy-with-ie8.html |title=Berners-Lee unhappy with IE8 |date=2008-09-20 |accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[XHTML]] (except when used as a form of HTML)
[[File:Acid3ie8.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Internet Explorer's failure (20/100) of the Acid3 rendering test.]]
IE8 passes the [[Acid2]] test,&lt;ref name=&quot;IE 8: On the Path&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=367207 |title=IE 8: On the Path to Web Standards Compliance - ACID 2 Test Pass Complete |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2007-12-19 |accessdate=2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/19/internet-explorer-8-and-acid2-a-milestone.aspx |title=Internet Explorer 8 and Acid2: A Milestone |author=Dean Hachamovitch |date=2007-12-19 |accessdate = 2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but fails the [[Acid3]] test with a score of 20/100. During its development, Microsoft developed over 7,000 tests for CSS level 2 compliance, which were submitted to the W3C for inclusion in their test suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/03/20/more-web-standards-tests-submitted-to-the-w3c.aspx |title=More Web Standards Tests Submitted to the W3C |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-09-15 |author=Jason Upton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compatibility mode ===
{{See main|Compatibility mode (browser)}}

Internet Explorer 8 was promoted by Microsoft as having stricter adherence to W3C described web standards than Internet Explorer 7. As a result, as in every IE version before it, some percentage of web pages coded to the behavior of the older versions would break in IE8. This would have been a repetition of the situation with IE7 which, while having fixed bugs from IE6, broke pages that used the IE6-specific hacks to work around its non-compliance. This was especially a problem for offline HTML documents, which may not be updatable (e.g. stored on a read-only medium, such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM).

To avoid this situation, IE8 implements a form of [[Version Targeting]] whereby a page could be authored to a specific version of a browser using the &lt;code&gt;X-UA-Compatible&lt;/code&gt; declaration either as a [[meta element]] or in the [[HTTP]] headers.&lt;ref name=&quot;beyonddoctype&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.alistapart.com/articles/beyonddoctype |title = Beyond DOCTYPE: Web Standards, Forward Compatibility, and IE8 |author = Aaron Gustafson |date = January 21, 2008 |accessdate = 2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain backwards compatibility, sites can opt-into IE7-like handling of content by inserting a specially created [[meta element]] into the web page that triggers the &quot;Compatibility mode&quot; in the browser, using:&lt;ref name=&quot;msdnie8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=EmulateIE7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

== Adoption ==
{{msieshare1}}
Five weeks after the release of IE 8 Beta 2 in August 2008, Beta 1's market share had grown from 0.05% to 0.61%, according to Net Applications.&lt;ref name=marketshare-IE8-hits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?sample=34&amp;qprid=43&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=4&amp;qpcustom=Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer%208.0&amp;qptimeframe=H&amp;qpsp=89832&amp;qpnp=97 |title=Usage Share Trend for 'Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0' |year=2009 |publisher=NetApplications |accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2009, just under 4 months after the final release, the market share jumped to 13%.&lt;ref name=marketshare-IE8-hits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=126&amp;qpnp=1 |title=Usage Share Trend for 'Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0' |year=2009 |publisher=NetApplications |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
On March 19, 2009, review by Benny Har-Even of IT PRO said:

{{quote|Overall, Internet Explorer 8 is an impressive package, and while it lacks the raw speed of Chrome, the flashiness of Safari 4, and the extendibility of Firefox, it does offer reliability and some good features, which could be enough to win it some fans. It's certainly the best version of Internet Explorer in a long time, and Firefox fanboys are going to have to face up to the fact that IE is no longer a dog on which to pour unremitting scorn. That said, there's not yet anything here to make Firefox users want to jump ship, though once a bit of spick and polish has been added, particularly to the addons it's going to make it harder to persuade the unconverted to switch away from IE. In that sense, Mozilla and the others have done their job fantastically â forcing Microsoft to up its ante to produce a better featured, faster and more reliable browsing experience for the masses. Microsoft should get some praise at least, simply for paying attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/610250/internet-explorer-8-review IT PRO Reviews |title=Internet Explorer 8 review}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On April 2, 2009, a review by the editor and network engineer Mark Joseph Edwards in the newsletter ''Windows Secrets'' said:

{{quote|Microsoft touts Internet Explorer 8 as a big improvement over previous versions of the browser in terms of security, speed, and compatibility. [...] Even though IE 8 adds some useful security features, its continued reliance on ActiveX makes the browser vulnerable in its very foundation. This lack of security is a primary reason many people have stopped using IE. Security isn't the only factor causing Web denizens to flock to alternative browsers. For years, Internet Explorer's page rendering has caused major headaches for Web developers and users alike. Some pages that look and function as designers intended in Firefox, Opera, and other third-party browsers have their layouts broken when rendered by Internet Explorer. IE 8 makes an effort to improve compatibility but ultimately falls short. Performance is another area where IE has trailed the competition. Just as IE 7 runs faster than IE 6, the new version 8 is quicker than its predecessor. However, early tests indicate that IE 8 is still much slower than other browsers. [...] There's no doubt that IE 8 is a much better browser than IE 7. Nevertheless, it's still inferior to Firefox and other alternatives. As to whether you should upgrade to IE 8 now or later, my advice is to use Firefox instead of either version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windowssecrets.com/2009/04/02/01-No-reason-to-rush-your-upgrade-to-IE-8 Windows Secrets |title=No reason to rush your upgrade to IE 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
