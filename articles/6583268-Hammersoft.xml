According to a 2005 article in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of [[Stamford, Connecticut]] Schiff relocated the firm to [[Darien, Connecticut]] to find brokers &quot;who think like him&quot;.  The New York Metropolitan Area, Schiff says, has the biggest concentration of brokers in the country, making it easier to recruit employees.&lt;ref name=lapin&gt;&quot;Prophet of Doom?

Euro Pacific Capital also holds the exclusive rights to broker some [[Perth Mint]] gold products in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Crash Proof 2.0, pg. 300&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011 Peter Schiff was listed as one of the Who's Who of Wall Street. &lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Economists, [http://www.wallstreeteconomists.org/ Wall Street Economists]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years of 2006-2008 Schiff appeared on numerous TV new's networks including CNBC &amp; Fox. As he sat on panel's of experts, he was usually laughed at by other's, as he was more pessimistic about financial markets going into the future than others, Saying that in 2007 that &quot;Today's home prices are completely unsustainable. Sky high real-estate prices are going to come crashing back down to earth.&quot; Most experts were high on financial stocks &amp; recommended stocks such as Merrill-Lynch &amp; Goldman Sachs. They were also saying that &quot;the worst was over&quot;, while Schiff was saying that the fundamentals (of U.S financial markets) were bad &amp; the worst was yet to come. Schiff warned to &quot;stay away from the financials, they're toxic &amp; their earnings are going to disappear.&quot; [[Arthur Laffer]] said to Schiff that he would &quot;Bet [him] a penny on this one (on being wrong about a real-estate bubble burst), If you'll sign a letter saying that you were wrong to me on this.&quot;

===U.S. bear market===
In his 2007 book ''[[Crash Proof]]'', Schiff wrote that United States economic policies were fundamentally unsound, and predicted that the United States dollar would lose much of its value.&lt;ref name=crashproof/&gt; Schiff believed that the imbalance between the amount of goods the U.S. consumed and what it produced would eventually lead to problems for the [[United States economy|U.S. economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Crash Proof 2.0 Chapter 1: Consumers, Not Producers (pps. 1-32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people = Peter Schiff | title = Why the Meltdown Should Have Surprised No One  | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgMclXX5msc&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=233FD972BBC2927B&amp;index=0 | medium = Recorded live lecture | publisher = [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] | location = [[Auburn, Alabama]] | date = 2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a remedy Schiff favored increased personal savings and production which he said would stimulate economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Crash Proof 2.0, pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff cited the U.S.'s low personal savings rate as one of the causes of its transformation from the world's largest creditor nation in the 1970s to the largest debtor nation in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Crash Proof 2.0, pg. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff attributed the low savings rate to higher inflation and the artificially low interest rates set by the [[Federal Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Crash Proof 2.0, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 interview with ''Southland Today'', Schiff predicted that the economic downturn triggered by the bursting of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com stock market bubble]] would lead to a bear market likely to last &quot;another 5 to 10 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=critics&gt;{{cite video |people = Peter Schiff |date = September 7, 2009 |title = Debunking another critic |url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSAtsvSaX5I |format = Flash |publisher = Schiff Report

&lt;/ref&gt; After interviewing Schiff in 2009, journalist and finance author Eric Tyson referenced various Schiff predictions during the 2000s and stated that &quot;On all of these counts, Schiff wasn't just wrong but ended up being hugely wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=tyson&gt;Tyson, Eric. [http://www.erictyson.com/articles/20090213 &quot;I Don't Think I've Been Wrong on Anything&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an August 2006 interview he said: &quot;The United States economy is like the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] and I am here with the lifeboat trying to get people to leave the ship... I see a real financial crisis coming for the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitco&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.kitco.com/ind/Radomski/feb022010.html |title= Silver Is Poised to Rise in The Long Run, But The Short-term Situation Is Complicated |author= Przemyslaw Radomski |date= February 2, 2010 |publisher= Kitco |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 31, 2006 in debate on Fox News, Schiff forecast that &quot;what's going to happen in 2007&quot; is that &quot;real estate prices are going to come crashing back down to Earth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitco&quot;/&gt;

As part of these exchanges on Fox News and his repeated appearances on financial news network CNBC, Schiff had mentioned factors such as speculators and &quot;the absence of lending standards&quot; which are now seen by many&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wallison |first=Peter J. |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.29047/pub_detail.asp |title='&amp;#39;What Got Us Here?'&amp;#39;, December 2008 |publisher=Aei.org |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=This American Life |url=http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html |title=NPR-The Giant Pool of Money |publisher=Pri.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indeed be contributing factors to the [[United States housing bubble#Subprime mortgage industry collapse|housing crisis]] which began in 2007. On December 13, 2007 in a Bloomberg interview on the show ''Open Exchange'', Schiff further added that he felt that the crisis would extend to the credit card lending industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5786330387747098530 Peter Schiff's accurate forecast of credit card market trouble]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this observation, it was soon reported on December 23, 2007 by the Associated Press that &quot;The value of credit card accounts at least 30 days late jumped 26 percent to $17.3 billion in October from a year earlier at 17 large credit card trusts examined by the AP... At the same time, defaults -- when lenders essentially give up hope of ever being repaid and write off the debt -- rose 18 percent to almost $961 million in October, according to filings made by the trusts with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/12/23/news/economy/credit_card_crunch.ap/ December 2007 Associate Press Story on Credit Card Defaults validates Schiff's gloomy predictions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment advice===
Despite predictions regarding the housing bubble and automotive industry difficulties coming to fruition, as early as 2009 Schiff was receiving criticism due to the performance of some of his client's accounts in 2008, as well as controversies over the predictions themselves. In January 2009, economic [[blog]]ger and investment adviser Michael Shedlock reported, &quot;I have talked with many who claim they have invested with Schiff and are down anywhere from 40% to 70% in 2008.&quot;&lt;ref name=shedlock&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms followed, including the aforementioned Eric Tyson post&lt;ref name=tyson/&gt; as well as an article for the investment news site [[Seeking Alpha]], published on the site two days after Shedlock's blog post.&lt;ref name=alphacritic/&gt; Later that week an article appeared in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporting that Schiff's broker-dealer firm, Euro Pacific Capital Inc., &quot;advised its clients to bet that the dollar would weaken significantly and that foreign stocks would outpace their U.S. peers&quot; and that instead, the dollar advanced against most currencies, &quot;magnifying the losses from foreign stocks Mr. Schiff steered his investors into.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiff_wrong_plan&quot;&gt;

The Director of Communications at Schiff's investment firm responded to the original Shedlock piece by saying, &quot;While it is true, that our accounts have suffered badly in 2008, a fact that we have never disputed or ran from, [Shedlock's] estimates for the size of our typical client losses are exaggerated and unfair.&quot;&lt;ref name=alphacritic&gt;{{Cite news

Schiff responded similarly to criticisms made by Wade Slome of Sidoxia Capital Management, LLC. in a September 2009 blog entry entitled, &quot;The Emperor Schiff Has No Clothes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;emperor&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff stated not only were the losses suffered by his clients in 2008 highly exaggerated, but also that most of those losses have already been recouped, stating that many who where down then are now up, and most long-term clients were never down at all, but merely temporarily lost some of the profits they had earned over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;emperor&quot;/&gt;

The January 2009 ''Wall Street Journal'' article discussed the value of Schiff's predictions, and stated how deficiencies &quot;made mincemeat of investors who took his advice in 2008.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiff_wrong_plan&quot;/&gt; In an interview the following week Schiff likened himself to billionaire investor [[Warren Buffett]], saying they were both &quot;buy and hold&quot; long-term investors. Contrasting his negative press he compared claims about accounts managed under Schiff's firm to the stock market value of Buffett's company, saying: &quot;His approach is you buy stocks and you never sell themâyou hope to never sell themâand [[Berkshire Hathaway]] is down 40% in the last thirteen months; I don't see the Wall Street Journal saying 'Warren Buffett made mincemeat out of his clients.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiff_right&quot;&gt;

But all the ingredients were (and remain) present for those movements to occur. Over the past year, market reactions that I didn't foresee&amp;mdash;massive global deleveraging, a knee-jerk 'flight to quality' into U.S. Treasuries and a sharp counter trend rally in the U.S. dollar&amp;mdash;have kept the scenario from playing out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In a November 2009 videoblog, Schiff said that five stocks he picked for ''Fortune Magazine'' in January 2009 had gained a total of 360%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/20/magazines/fortune/okeefe_schiff_sidebar.fortune/index.htm | work=CNN | title=A 'fire sale' on small foreign stocks | date=2009-01-20 | accessdate=2010-05-22 | first=Brian | last=O'Keefe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQUSjOw2cYE YouTube - JOBS &amp; GOLD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2009 speech Schiff said that it would be impossible for the [[United States public debt|U.S. debt]] to China to be repaid unless the U.S. dollar's value is substantially diluted through [[inflation]]. In September 2009 Schiff said that &quot;I would not be surprised to see [gold] at $5,000 over the next several years&quot; and that the 2009 stock market rally was a &quot;bear market rally&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-peter-schiff-us-stock-rally-and-dollar-doomed-gold-going-to-5000-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Schiff was an economic adviser to [[Ron Paul]]'s [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].  In support of Paul's economic revitalization plan, he said: &quot;We need a plan that stimulates savings and production, not more of the reckless borrowing and consumption that got us into this mess in the first place.  Ron Paul's plan is the only one that amounts to a step in the right direction.  If you want meaningful change&amp;mdash;for the better that is&amp;mdash;Ron Paul is the only candidate capable of delivering it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Peter Schiff Named Economic Advisor to the Ron Paul 2008 Presidential Campaign |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS255917+25-Jan-2008+BW20080125 |work=Reuters.com Online News |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-01-25 |accessdate=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Schiff also endorsed [[Murray Sabrin]] for the U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paul stumps for Sabrin in Newark |url=http://www.politickernj.com/matt-friedman/19118/paul-stumps-sabrin-newark |work=PolitickerNJ.com |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in February 2009, Schiff's position was summarized as a nonpartisan critique of American policymakers, comparing former presidents [[George W. Bush]] to [[Herbert Hoover]] and President [[Barack Obama]] to former president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], with neither of the more recent incumbents comparing favorably to the earlier ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/tech-ticker/article/169781/Peter-Schiff-Stimulus-Bill-Will-Lead-to-%22Unmitigated-Disaster%22?tickers=^dji,^gspc,QQQQ,SPY,DIA,TLT,UDN &quot;Peter Schiff: Stimulus Bill Will Lead to 'Unmitigated Disaster'&quot;], by Aaron Task, ''Yahoo Tech Ticker'', Feb. 06, 2009 08:05am EST. Retrieved 2010-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiff supports the reduction of government economic regulation, and is concerned that President Obama's administration may increase such regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europac.net/externalframeset.asp?from=home&amp;id=14566] November 2008 The Reagan Counterrevolution&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff says that the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|economic crisis of the late-2000s]] provides an opportunity to transition from borrowing and spending, to saving and producing. He is critical of the U.S. government's efforts to &quot;ease the pain&quot; with economic stimulus packages and bailouts. According to Schiff, the U.S. government's approach of replacing &quot;legitimate savings with a printing press&quot; could result in [[hyperinflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Nov. 05, 2008 | episodelink =  | url = http://www.europac.net/media/PeterSchiff_11-05-2008.mp3 | series = Wall Street Unspun | serieslink =

At the May 2010 Republican convention, [[Linda McMahon]] received the most delegate votes but not enough to prevent an August [[primary election]].  U.S. Rep. [[Rob Simmons]] received more than the required 15 percent of the total votes necessary to force the primary. Schiff then collected the signatures necessary to earn a position on the August 2010 GOP primary ballot, submitting at least 400 signatures over the state requirement.

In July 2010, Schiff's campaign received endorsements from [[Steve Forbes]] and [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dawn |first=Liberty |url=http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2010/07/peter-schiff-snags-a-bigname-e.html |title=Peter Schiff snags a big-name endorsement - Capitol Watch |publisher=Blogs.courant.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ron Paul|title=Ron Paul Endorses Peter Schiff and Rick Torres  |date=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypaul.com/node/142075|title=Peter Schiff for US Senate Primary Electrion Results|author=cbourne|publisher=Daily Paul|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 49% Linda McMahon
* 28% Rob Simmons
* 23% Peter Schiff

Ultimately, the election was won by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] primary winner, [[Richard Blumenthal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2010/11/02/VI2010110208394.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Democrat Blumenthal wins Conn.
