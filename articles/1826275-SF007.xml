== Symantec vs. Comodo ==
In response to [[Symantec]]'s comment over the effectiveness of free Antivirus software, on September 18, 2010, the CEO of the Comodo group [[Melih AbdulhayoÄlu]] challenged Symantec to see which products can defend the consumer better against [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symantec, the producer of [[Norton AntiVirus]], has responded that such direct tests are unnecessary: &quot;Norton is included in a variety of independent, third-party tests from testing labs like AV-Test and AV Comparatives. We encourage Comodo to contact these testing labs if they are interested in having their product included in these tests.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 29 September 2010, Neil J. Rubenking, the lead analyst for security of PC Magazine, published an article on Comodo Antivirus 5.0 that included a comparative chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubenking concluded that Comodo Antivirus 5.0 blocked a higher percentage of malware than Norton AntiVirus, but was less effective than the Norton solution when it came to malware removal. Rubenking's review also noted that the Comodo malware blocking gave a number of false positives which he felt tarnished Comodo's results.
