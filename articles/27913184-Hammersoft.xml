A '''fashion boot''' is a [[boot]] worn for reasons of style or fashion (rather than for utilitarian purposes â e.g. not hiking boots, riding boots, rain boots, etc.). The term is usually applied to womenâs boots. Fashion boots come in a wide variety of styles, from ankle to thigh-length, and are used for casual, formal, and business attire. Although boots were a popular style of womenâs footwear in the Nineteenth Century, they were not recognized as a high fashion item until the 1960s. They became widely popular in the 1970s and have remained a staple of womenâs winter wardrobes since then.

==History==
=== Pre-1960s ===
In the 19th and early 20th Centuries, ankle and calf-length boots were common footwear for women. Rising hemlines made longer styles of boots popular. In 1913, Denise Poiret, the wife of celebrated French couturier [[Paul Poiret]], caused a sensation in Paris and New York by wearing knee-length boots in wrinkled Morocco leather. Designed by her husband, made by the bottier Favereau, and styled with a low heel and a square toe, she had versions in red, white, green, and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/poiret/king_of_fashion_gallerytexts.asp |title= Poiret: king of fashion |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fashionmuseum.fitnyc.edu/code/emuseum.asp?style=browse&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;page=search&amp;profile=objects&amp;searchdesc=boot&amp;quicksearch=boot&amp;sessionid=4104294B-655B-46F3-9F81-A23D2185BBD5&amp;action=quicksearch&amp;style=single&amp;currentrecord=5 |title= inventory #2005.45.1: boots by Paul Poiret, c.1916|publisher=Museum at FIT  |accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915 the [[New York Times]] was reporting that, inspired by Mme Poiret, women had adopted these &quot;[[Russian boot]]s&quot; as an acceptable alternative to baring ankles and calves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Short skirts, higher boots  | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date = 11 April 1915 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DE4DD153BE233A25752C1A9629C946496D6CF | accessdate =17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s Russian boots were available in a variety of styles, calf- or knee-length, with a Cuban or Louis heel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cox  | first = Caroline  | title = Vintage Shoes | publisher=[[Harper Collins]]  | location = New York  | year = 2008 | page = 45  | isbn = 978-0061665769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=68930&amp;sos=3/ |title= black leather Russian boot, 1925|publisher=London College of Fashion Shoe Collection |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which could be pull-on, or zip-fastened for a closer fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Steele  | first = Valerie  | authorlink = Valerie Steele |title = Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion | publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] | location = New York  | volume = 1 |year = 2005 | page = 175  | isbn = 978-0684313948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worn with knee-length skirts, they often featured decorative features such as elaborate stitching or fur trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=26225/ |title=Boots, boots, boots; latest Russian boot styles for Eve |publisher=British Pathe News |date=1920s | accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian boots were sporadically popular during the 1920s, as a more fashionable alternative to [[galoshes]], but fell out of favor by the 1930s.

One reason for the decline in popularity of boots during the first half of the 20th century may be because streets became cleaner as roads were surfaced and horse-drawn transport gave way to the motor engine. The additional protection provided by boots was no longer needed. Boots were seen as restrictive and uncomfortable when compared with the new styles of fashionable shoe that compimented a more streamlined and simplified look for women's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Quinn  | first = Bradley  | title = The Boot | publisher=Laurence King Publishing Ltd | location = London  | year = 2010 | page = 25  | isbn = 978-1-85669-663-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most retailers saw boots as a separate category of footwear from shoes, to be worn for protection from bad weather or for work. By contrast, Levine argued that boots were shoes and could be an integral part of a woman's outfit. In 1957, [[Herbert Levine (company)|Herbert Levine]] produced an entire collection of based around fashion boots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/the_costume_institute/shoes_herbert_levine/objectview.aspx?page=3&amp;sort=0&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=levine&amp;fp=1&amp;dd1=8&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=8&amp;OID=80046211&amp;vT=1&amp;hi=0&amp;ov=0/ |title= Accession # 1976.166.12a, b: Beth Levine fashion boots, 1958â60|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art  |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite widspread skepticism on the part of other designers and manufactuers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Sheppard | first = Eugenia  | title = Shoes, Like Sundials, Tell Time  | newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] | date = 22 August 1967  }}&lt;/ref&gt; calf-high, [[Kitten heel|kitten-heeled]] fashion boots for women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=82785&amp;sos=17/ |title= brown mock-croc calf-length boot, 1963|publisher=London College of Fashion Shoe Collection |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began to grow in popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Rising hemlines and the availability of new, brightly colored artificial materials such as PVC, combined to make boots an attractive fashion option for younger women.

In contrast to the preceding decade, the 1980s saw a sharp decline in the popularity of high-legged boots. Instead, ankle boots in a variety of styles were particularly popular, as were low-heeled, calf-length, pull-on styles. Knee length boots, if worn at all, tended to be low-heeled, faux riding boots that were combined with long skirts. It wasn't until the end of the decade that the inherent elegance of classic dress boot styles was rediscovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBootp30&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Quinn  | first = Bradley  | title = The Boot | publisher=Laurence King Publishing Ltd | location = London  | year = 2010 | page = 30  | isbn = 978-1-85669-663-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and 2000s===
The early 1990s saw an explosion in dance club culture and its associated fashions, many of which looked back to the 1960s for inspiration, as well as drawing on fetish-themed elements. Knee-length go-go boots, platform-soled boots, and even thigh-length PVC boots were worn by clubbers, but although some designers flirted with these styles of footwear (e.g. [[Gianni Versace]]) mainstream take-up was limited. Nonetheless, by 1993 boots were popular enough for the U.S. edition of ''Vogue'' to declare that it was âThe Year of the Bootâ.&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'' (U.S. Edition), August 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Knee-length boots became commonplace again, initially as lace-up styles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Blanco F. | first1 = Jose  | last2 = Leff | first2 = Scott | last3 = Kellogg | first3 = Ann T. | last4 = Payne | first4 = Lynn W. | title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through American History, 1900 to the Present | volume = 2 | publisher=Greenwood Press  | location = Westport CT | year = 2008

By the turn of the 21st Century, fashion boots in a variety of styles were back to the same level of ubiquity that they had enjoyed in the 1970s. A pair of knee-length boots, often with metal accents, was widely regarded as a must-have wardrobe item for the clothes-conscious woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/shoppingandfashion/3344479/The-ten-best...-boots.html |title= The ten best... boots|author=Baker, Sarah|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK | |date=21 September 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/3315502/Fabulous-looks-to-fall-for-this-autumn.html |title= Fabulous looks to fall for this autumn |author=Coulson, Clare|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK | |date=30 September 2003 |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; paired with knee length skirts and dresses for business and casual wear.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBootp30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Blanco F. | first1 = Jose  | last2 = Leff | first2 = Scott | last3 = Kellogg | first3 = Ann T. | last4 = Payne | first4 = Lynn W. | title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through American History, 1900 to the Present | volume = 2 | publisher=Greenwood Press  | location = Westport CT | year = 2008 | page = 242  | isbn = 978-0313358555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Mead, Rebecca | title = Strategy Session: The Pipeline | magazine = ''[[The New Yorker]]'' | date = 10 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankle boots also remained very popular and in the latter part of the first decade knee-length styles worn over pants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/stellamagazine/3349317/Boots-advantage-points.html |title= Boots advantage points |author=Picardie, Justine|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK | |date=29 January 2006 |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially jeans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/trendspotting/3346989/How-to-do-skinny.html |title= How to do skinny |author=Coulson, Clare|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK | |date=16 November 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were common.

[[File:Fashion boot terminology.png|thumb|180px|diagram of a typical knee-length fashion boot showing shoemaker's terminology]]Fashion boots generally employ the same range of soles and heels as are found in shoes. The defining character of the boot is the length of the shaft. Ankle boots generally have a shaft height of less than 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm), calf-length boots 8â15&amp;nbsp;inches (20â38&amp;nbsp;cm), knee-length boots 15â19&amp;nbsp;inches (38â48&amp;nbsp;cm), while over-the knee boots have shaft lengths of 19&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;cm) or more; however these divisions are arbitrary and at the boundaries the decision as to whether a boot is, for example, calf-length or knee-length is largely subjective.

The shaft of a fashion boot can be fitted (i.e. following the curve of the wearerâs calf), straight-legged, or loose-fitting (or âslouchyâ). In close-fitting boots, flexibility is achieved by the use of gussets; slits in the material either at the top of the shaft (in knee-length boots), or wider panels at the sides of the shaft (in ankle boots), which are backed with elasticized fabric. Compression folds around the ankle allow for movement of the foot. In over-the-knee boots, flexion of the knee is usually attained by a vent at the back of the boot, running from the top of the shaft to the back of the knee. This may be closed with laces, elasticized, or left open. Where a vent is not used, freedom of movement is achieved either by having the top of the shaft flare outwards above the knee, or making the entire shaft out of a stretchable material.

A variety of fasteners are seen in fashion boots. Laces are commonly used in ankle boots, but are too time-consuming for longer styles. Zip fasteners are widely employed in all styles of boot â they may run the entire length of the shaft, or just the ankle and lower calf â these partial-length zips make it easier to insert the foot into the toe of the boot by relaxing the fit around the ankle. Pull-on boots have no fasteners and tend to have a looser fit than zip or lace-up boots; they sometimes have a loop of leather at the top of the shaft, called a boot-strap, to assist with pulling the boot on. Finally, button-fastened boots were common at the beginning of the last century but are rarely seen today. If present, buttons are usually employed as design accents on boots; other decorative features include straps, buckles, studs, and decorative stitching.

===Ankle Boot===
These are the most widely-worn style of fashion boots, usually under pants.&lt;ref name=&quot;What Not To Wear&quot;&gt;{{citation | last1 = Woodall  | first1 = Trinny | last2 = Constantine | first2 = Susannah | title = What Not To Wear |  location = London  |  publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] | year = 2002 | page = 140 | isbn = 0-297-84331-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankle boots are also the only type of fashion boot commonly worn by both men and women, and the only one to have remained popular without a break since the 19th Century. They vary in length from booties or shoe boots (effectively a shoe that skims the ankle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2184051,00.html |title= Pick of the week: Shoe-boots |author=Fox, Imogen |work=Guardian |location=UK | |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=13 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to boots that cover the lower part of the calf.

===Calf-length Boot===
Because the top of this boot hits the curve of the leg at the widest point of the calf it is regarded by stylists as particularly challenging to wear; even average legs can look fat.&lt;ref name=&quot;What Not To Wear&quot;/&gt; For this reason, calf-length boots are usually worn under pants or with long skirts that cover the top of the boot.&lt;ref name=&quot;What Not To Wear&quot;/&gt;

===Knee-length Boot===
{{See also|Knee-high boots}}

These are regarded as the most versatile type of fashion boot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last = Conway | first = Susannah | title = The best new boots |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | date = 26 October 2001 | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-80472/The-best-new-boots.html | accessdate=13 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they come in a wide variety of colors and materials (e.g. leather, suede, fabric) and can be worn with skirts or dresses of any length, under or over pants, or with leggings. A boot that hits the leg just below the knee is thought to be particularly stylish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Woodall  | first1 = Trinny | last2 = Constantine | first2 = Susannah | title = What Not To Wear |  location = London  |  publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] | year = 2002 | page = 141 | isbn = 0-297-84331-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thigh-length Boot===
{{See also|Thigh-length boots}}

Also known as over-the-knee boots or cuissardes, these boots were originally worn by men in the 16th â 18th Centuries to protect the legs while riding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cox  | first = Caroline  | title = Vintage Shoes | publisher=[[Harper Collins]]  | location = New York  | year = 2008 | page = 38  | isbn = 978-0061665769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Steele  | first = Valerie  | authorlink = Valerie Steele |title = Shoes: A Lexicon of Style | publisher=Rizzoli International Publications | location = New York  | year = 1999 | page = 140  | isbn = 0-8478-2166-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last = Coleman | first = Claire | title = Speed read: thighâs the limit with this seasonâs boots |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | date = 15 October 2009 | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/fashion/article-1220353/Speed-read-Thighs-limit-seasons-boots.html | accessdate=13 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before being adapted as a fashion item for women in the 1960s. They are considered provocative because of their association with the sex industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Steele  | first = Valerie  | authorlink = Valerie Steele |title = Shoes: A Lexicon of Style | publisher=Rizzoli International Publications | location = New York  | year = 1999 | page = 132  | isbn = 0-8478-2166-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last = Coleman | first = Claire | title = Thigh-high boots are the next big thing â but who will dare to wear them? |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | date = 30 July 2009 | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1203089/Thigh-high-boots-big-thing--dare-wear-them.html | accessdate=13 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and so have had patchy mainstream acceptance. Even when popular, a combination of one or more features such as lower heels, softer materials (e.g. suede), muted colors, and avoidance of skin exposure (by wearing over pants, leggings, or opaque hose) was usually employed to avoid the so-called &quot;[[Pretty Woman]]&quot; effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haver, Sharon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;DFP2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last = Summer | first = Sydne | title = Would you wear it?
