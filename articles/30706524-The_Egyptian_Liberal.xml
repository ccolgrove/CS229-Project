==Background==
{{see|History of Libya under Gaddafi}}

===Leadership===
[[Muammar Gaddafi]] became the [[de-facto]] ruler of Libya after he led a military coup that overthrew [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Qaddafi Is No Mubarak as Regime Overthrow May Trigger a 'Descent to Chaos' |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/qaddafi-is-no-mubarak-overthrow-may-mean-descent-to-chaos-.html |date=23 February 2011|accessdate=12 March 2011| publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]| author=Viscus, Gregory| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5woom3ygF |archivedate=27 February 2011| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He abolished the [[Libyan Constitution]] of 1951, and adopted laws based on his own ideology outlined in his manifesto ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]''. He officially stepped down from power in 1977, and subsequently claimed to be merely a &quot;symbolic figurehead&quot; until 2011, with the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libyan government]] up until then also denying that he held any power.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_gaddafi&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wynne-Jones|first=Jonathan|title=Libyan minister claims Gaddafi is powerless and the ceasefire is 'solid'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8393285/Libyan-minister-claims-Gaddafi-is-powerless-and-the-ceasefire-is-solid.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jazeera_gaddafi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaddafi: Libya dignity under attack|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/03/201132113120236750.html|publisher=[[Al-Jazeera]]|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Gaddafi, Libya was theoretically a decentralized, [[direct democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=James|title=Eyewitness: Dialogue in the desert|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6425873.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=7 March 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; state run according to the philosophy of Gaddafi's ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'', with Gaddafi retaining a ceremonial position. Libya was officially run by a system of people's committees which served as local governments for the country's subdivisions, an indirectly-elected [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] as the legislature, and the [[Cabinet of Libya|General People's Committee]], led by a Secretary-General, as the executive branch. According to [[Freedom House]], however, these structures were often manipulated to ensure the dominance of Gaddafi, who reportedly continued to dominate all aspects of government.&lt;ref name=&quot;FreedomHouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2010&amp;country=7862 |title=Libya |author=Staff |work=Country Report |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WikiLeaks]]' [[United States diplomatic cables leak|disclosure of confidential US diplomatic cables]] revealed US diplomats there speaking of Gaddafi's &quot;mastery of tactical manoeuvring&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitlock 02/22&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[Craig Whitlock|Whitlock, Craig]] |title=Gaddafi Is Eccentric But the Firm Master of His Regime, Wikileaks Cables Say |work=The Washington Post |date=22 February 2011 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/22/AR2011022207298.html|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While placing relatives and loyal members of [[Qadhadhfa|his tribe]] in central military and government positions, he skillfully marginalized supporters and rivals, thus maintaining a delicate balance of powers, stability and economic developments. This extended even to his own sons, as he repeatedly changed affections to avoid the rise of a clear successor and rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitlock 02/22&quot;/&gt; 

Both Gaddafi and the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]], however, officially denied that he held any power, but claimed he was merely a symbolic figurehead.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_gaddafi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jazeera_gaddafi&quot;/&gt; While he was popularly seen as a [[demagogue]] in the West, Gaddafi always portrayed himself as a [[statesman]]-[[philosopher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes_green&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazzi|first=Mohamad|title=What Did Qaddafiâs Green Book Really Say?|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/what-did-qaddafis-green-book-really-say.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several Western media sources, Gaddafi feared a military coup against his government and deliberately kept Libya's military relatively weak. The [[Libyan Army]] consisted of about 50,000 personnel. Its most powerful units were four crack brigades of highly equipped and trained soldiers, composed of members of Gaddafi's tribe or members of other tribes loyal to him. One, the [[Khamis Brigade]], was led by his son [[Khamis Gaddafi|Khamis]]. Local militias and Revolutionary Committees across the country were also kept well-armed. By contrast, regular military units were poorly armed and trained, and were armed with largely outdated military equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;KFMBChannel8&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/14084125/clampdown-in-libyan-capital-as-protests-close-in?redirected=true |title=Qaddafi Survival Means Weak Army, Co-Opted Tribes |publisher=Associated Press (via [[KFMB-TV]]) |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/134404618/gadhafis-military-muscle-concentrated-in-elite-units |title=Gadhafi's Military Muscle Concentrated In Elite Units |publisher=[[NPR]] |date= 10 March 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115955467 |title=Video Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi's Forces Facing Modern Firepower From RAF |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date= 18 March 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], however, the reason for the country's de-militarization was a reaction to the [[Iraq War]], so that Libya wouldn't be accused of possessing [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) and face the same fate. He also accused NATO of betraying their trust and taking advantage of this weakness to launch an air attack, recommending that other nations build up their military defences in order to avoid facing the same fate as Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi's son: Libya like McDonald's for NATO - fast war as fast food|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMugPQC4ZY|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=July 1, 2011|agency=[[Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development and corruption===
Much of the state's income came from [[Oil reserves in Libya|its oil production]], which soared in the 1970s. In the 1980s, a large portion of it was spent on arms purchases, and on sponsoring militant groups and independence movements around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Staff|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18239888 |title=Endgame in Tripoli â The Bloodiest of the North African Rebellions So Far Leaves Hundreds Dead |date=24 February 2011 |work=The Economist |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Libya â The Struggle for Survival|author=Simons, Geoffrey Leslie|page=281|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] (New York City)|year=1993|isbn=978-0-312-08997-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 20.74% of Libyan citizens were unemployed, and about one-third lived below the national poverty line. More than 16% of families had none of its members earning a stable income, while 43.3% had just one. Despite one of the highest unemployment rates in the region, there was a consistent labor shortage with over a million migrant workers present on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Staff|title=Libya's Jobless Rate at 20.7 Percent: Report |agency=Reuters   |date=2 March 2009|url = http://af.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFJOE52106820090302 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These migrant workers formed the bulk of the refugees leaving Libya after the beginning of hostilities. Despite this, Libya's [[Human Development Index]] in 2010 was the highest in [[Africa]] and greater than that of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Libya had [[welfare]] systems allowing access to free [[education]], free [[healthcare]], and financial assistance for housing, while the [[Great Manmade River]] was built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Azad|first=Sher|title=Gaddafi and the media|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/10/22/fea02.asp|work=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi claimed he was planning to combat corruption in the state by proposing reforms where oil profits are handed out directly to the country's five million people&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_handout&quot;/&gt; rather than to government bodies, stating that &quot;as long as money is administered by a government body, there would be theft and corruption.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_handout&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi 'to hand out oil money'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7591458.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi urged a sweeping reform of the government [[bureaucracy]], suggesting that most of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] system should be dismantled to &quot;free Libyans from red tape&quot; and &quot;protect the state's budget from corruption.&quot; According to Western diplomats, this move appeared to be aimed at putting pressure on the government to speed up reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_handout&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya's Gaddafi tells govt to hand out oil money|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/05/08/libya-oil-gaddafi-idUKL0829452920080508|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=May 8, 2008|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Gaddafi proposed plans to dissolve the country's existing administrative structure and disburse oil revenue directly to the people.

A national vote on Gaddafi's plan to disband the government and give oil money directly to the people was held in 2009, where Libya's people's congresses, collectively the country's highest authority, voted to delay implementation.

Dissent was illegal under Law 75 of 1973, and in 1974, Gaddafi asserted that anyone guilty of founding a [[political party]] would be executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohamed Eljhami&quot;/&gt; With the establishment of the [[Jamahiriya]] (&quot;state of the masses&quot;) system in 1977, he established the [[General People's Committee|Revolutionary Committees]] as conduits for raising political consciousness, with the aim of [[Direct democracy|direct]] [[Participatory democracy|political participation]] by all Libyans rather than a traditional party-based [[Representative democracy|representative system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ham_40_1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Anthony|title=Libya|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location=Footscray, Victoria|isbn=1740594932|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lPaNiy3YisIC&amp;pg=PA40|author=Anthony Ham|edition=2nd ed.|pages=40â1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, some of the Revolutionary Committees had eventually evolved into self-appointed, sometimes zealous, enforcers of revolutionary orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ham_40_1&quot;/&gt; During the early 1980s, the Revolutionary Committees had considerable power and became a growing source of tension within the Jamihiriya,&lt;ref name=&quot;vandewalle_124&quot;/&gt; to the extent that Gaddafi sometimes criticized their effectiveness and excessive repression,&lt;ref name=&quot;ham_40_1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vandewalle_124&quot;/&gt; until the power of the Revolutionary Committees were eventually restricted in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandewalle_124&quot;/&gt;

The Revolutionary Committees occasionally kept tight control over internal dissent; reportedly, ten to twenty percent of Libyans worked as informants for these committees, with surveillance taking place in the government, in factories, and in the education sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohamed Eljhami&quot;/&gt; The government sometimes executed dissidents through public hangings and mutilations and re-broadcast them on [[public television]] channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohamed Eljhami&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/878/libya-and-the-us-qadhafi-unrepentant|title=Libya and the U.S.: Qadhafi Unrepentant|publisher=The Middle East Quarterly|author=Mohamed Eljahmi|year=2006|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis 1990&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the mid-1980s, Libya's intelligence service conducted assassinations of Libyan dissidents around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohamed Eljhami&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated758&quot;&gt;Staff (2002).

Foreign languages such as English and French were banned from school syllabus and talking with foreigners about politics reportedly carried a three-year prison term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/02/libya_fragments |title=A new flag flies in the east|date=24 February 2011|work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'', which Gaddafi authored in the 1970s, was for years the principal text of political education.

In 1988, Gaddafi criticized the &quot;excesses&quot; he blamed on the Revolutionary Councils, stating that &quot;they deviated, harmed, tortured&quot; and that &quot;the true revolutionary does not practise repression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ham_libya&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Anthony|title=Libya|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location=Footscray, Victoria|isbn=1740594932|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lPaNiy3YisIC&amp;pg=PA41|author=Anthony Ham|edition=2nd ed.|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya issued the ''Great Green Document on Human Rights'', in which Article 5 established laws that allowed greater [[freedom of expression]].

In December 2009, Gaddafi reportedly told government officials that Libya would soon experience a &quot;new political period&quot; and would have elections for important positions such as minister-level roles and the National Security Advisor position (a Prime Minister equivalent). He also promised that international monitors would be included to ensure fair elections. His speech was said to have caused quite a stir. These elections were planned to coincide with the Jamahiriya's usual periodic elections for the Popular Committees, [[General People's Committee|Basic People's Committees]], [[Basic People's Congress (country subdivision)|Basic People's Congress]]es, and [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congresses]], in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Passed to the ''Telegraph'' by WikiLeaks 9:38&amp;nbsp;pm GMT 31 Jan 2011 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/libya-wikileaks/8294906/AL-QADHAFI-SUGGESTS-LIBYAN-ELECTIONS-MAY-BE-IN-THE-OFFING.html |title=Al-Qadhafi Suggests Libyan Elections May Be In The Offing |publisher=Telegraph |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rap]], [[hip hop]] and traditional music, alongside other genres, have played a role in encouraging the dissidents to Gaddafi's government.

The other being an analysis by the [[Combating Terrorism Center]] at the [[United States Military Academy|US Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] of a set of documents called the Sinjar Records, purporting to show a statistical study of the al-Qaeda personnel records.

In the days leading up to the conflict, Gaddafi called for a rally against the government that was to be held on 17 February. The [[International Crisis Group]] believes this to have been a political manoeuvre to divert attention away from himself and the [[Jamahiriya]] political system towards government officials currently in power.&lt;ref name=&quot;crisisgroup&quot;/&gt;

Later in February, Gaddafi claimed that the rebels were influenced by [[Al-Qaeda]], [[Osama Bin Laden]], and [[hallucinogenic drugs]] put in drinks and pills. He specifically referred to substances in milk, coffee, and [[NescafÃ©]], and claimed that Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda were distributing these hallucinogenic drugs.

On 19 February, several days after the conflict began, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] announced the creation of a commission of inquiry into the violence, chaired by a Libyan judge, as reported on [[state television]]. He stated that the commission was intended to be &quot;for members of Libyan and foreign organizations of human rights&quot; and that it will &quot;investigate the circumstances and events that have caused many victims.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ladepeche_libya&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Libye: de nouveaux morts lors d'une opÃ©ration des forces libyennes|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2011/02/19/1019008-libye-de-nouveaux-morts-lors-d-une-operation-des-forces-libyennes.html|accessdate=30 October 2011|newspaper=[[La DÃ©pÃªche du Midi]]|date=19/02/2011|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]}} ([http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ladepeche.fr%2Farticle%2F2011%2F02%2F19%2F1019008-libye-de-nouveaux-morts-lors-d-une-operation-des-forces-libyennes.html&amp;act=url Translation])&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, he went on state television to deny allegations that the government had launched airstrikes against Libyan cities and stated that the number of protesters killed had been exaggerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail_gaddafi&quot;/&gt;

In March 2011, the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] concluded that Gaddafi was implementing a [[scorched earth]] strategy. The organization stated that &quot;It is reasonable to fear that he has, in fact, decided to largely eliminate, wherever he still can, Libyan citizens who stood up against his regime and furthermore, to systematically and indiscriminately repress civilians. These acts can be characterized as [[crimes against humanity]], as defined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Press release|url=http://www.fidh.org/Libya-Strategy-of-scorched-earth-desire-for |title=Libya: Strategy of Scorched Earth, Desire for Widespread and Systematic Elimination |publisher=International Federation for Human Rights |date=24 February 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) chief prosecutor [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] estimated that 500â700 people were killed by security forces in February 2011, before the rebels took up arms. According to Moreno-Ocampo, &quot;shooting at protesters was systematic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/world/africa/05nations.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world | work=The New York Times | first1=Marlise | last1=Simons | first2=Neil | last2=MacFarquhar | title=Libyan Officials' Arrests Sought by Court in Hague | date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the siege of Misrata in May 2011, Amnesty International reported &quot;horrifying&quot; tactics such as &quot;indiscriminate attacks that have led to massive civilian casualties, including use of heavy artillery, rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amnesty.ie/news/gaddafi%E2%80%99s-attacks-misratah-may-be-war-crimes | title=Gaddafi's attacks on misratah may be war crimes | publisher=Amnesty International | date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi's military commanders also reportedly executed soldiers who refused to fire on protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff|date=24 February 2011|url=http://www.maltastar.com/pages/r1/ms10dart.asp?a=14347 |title=Gruesome Footage of Executed Soldiers in Libya |work=The Malta Star|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation for Human Rights]] reported a case where 130 soldiers were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Libya-130-soldiers-executed-20110223 |title=Libya â 130 Soldiers Executed |publisher=Agence France-Presse (via [[News24]]) |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the soldiers executed by their commanders were reportedly burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Libya-Soldiers-Were-Burned-Alive-By-Their-Own-Forces-For-Refusing-To-Fignt-Protesters/Article/201102415941510?f=rss |title=Libya: Soldiers Were 'Burned Alive' Comrades|author=Waghorn, Dominic |publisher=[[Sky News]] |accessdate=24 March 2011 |date=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a more detailed investigation carried out by Amnesty International found that many of the allegations against Gaddafi and the Libyan state turned out to either be false or lack any credible evidence, noting that rebels at times appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence. According to the Amnesty investigation, the number of casualties was heavily exaggerated, some of the protesters may have been armed, &quot;there is no proof of mass killing of civilians on the scale of Syria or Yemen,&quot; and there is no evidence that aircraft or heavy anti-aircraft machine guns were used against crowds. It also doubted claims that the protest movement was &quot;entirely peaceful&quot; and &quot;presented no security challenge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyRape&quot;/&gt;

In July 2011, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] had an interview with ''[[RT (TV Network)|Russia Today]]'' in which he denied the ICC's allegations that he or his father [[Muammar Gaddafi]] ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He claimed that he was not a member of the government or the military and therefore had no authority to give such orders. He also claimed his father made recorded calls to General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]], who later defected to the rebel forces, in order to request not to use force against protesters, to which he said Fatah Younis responded that protesters were attacking a military site and soldiers were acting in self-defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;rt_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi's son: Libya like McDonald's for NATO - fast war as fast food|url=http://rt.com/news/interview-gaddafi-libya-usa/|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=July 1, 2011|agency=[[Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Gaddafi's son claims Nato wants deal with Libya|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/01/gaddafi-son-nato-libya-deal|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison sites and torture===
Gaddafi reportedly imprisoned thousands or tens of thousands residents in Tripoli, with Red Cross denied access to these hidden prisons. One of the most notorious is a prison which was setup in a tobacco factory in Tripoli where inmates are reported to have been fed just half a loaf of bread and a bottle of water a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McElroy |first=Damien |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8436286/Libya-two-British-businessmen-held-in-brutal-Libyan-prison.html |title=Libya: two British businessmen held in brutal Libyan prison |publisher=Telegraph |date= 8 April 2011|accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April, [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Susan Rice]] alleged that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were given Viagra and encouraged to commit rapes in rebel-held or disputed areas. The allegations surfaced in an ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' report the previous month from Libya-based doctors, who claimed to have found Viagra in the pockets of government soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/29/diplomat-gaddafi-troops-viagra-mass-rape |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Ewen | last=MacAskill | title=Gaddafi 'supplies troops with Viagra to encourage mass rape', claims diplomat | date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups and aid workers had previously documented rapes by loyalist fighters during the war.

In Misrata, a rebel spokesman claimed that government soldiers had committed a string of sexual assaults in Benghazi Street before being pushed out by rebels. A doctor claimed that two young sisters were raped by five Black African mercenaries after their brothers joined the rebels. According to aid workers, four young girls were abducted and held for four days, and were possibly sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1380364/Libya-Gaddafis-troops-rape-children-young-eight.html |location=London |work=Daily Mail  | title=Fuelled 'by Viagra', Gaddafi's troops use rape as a weapon of war with children as young as EIGHT among the victims | date=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a questionnaire 259 refugee women reported that they had been raped by Gaddafi's soldiers, however the accounts of these women could not be independently verified as the psychologist who conducted the questionnaire claimed that &quot;she had lost contact with them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyRape&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html|title=Amnesty questions claim that Gaddafi ordered rape as weapon of war|date=24 June 2011|work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=26 June 2011|first=Patrick|last=Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of the rape allegations is questioned by [[Amnesty International]], which has not found evidence to back up the claims and notes that there are indications that on several occasions the rebels in Benghazi appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyRape&quot; /&gt;

===Mercenaries===
Soon after Gaddafi's government started to use force against demonstrators, it became apparent that some Libyan military units refused to shoot protesters, and Gaddafi had hired foreign mercenaries to do the job. Gaddafi's ambassador to India Ali al-Essawi confirmed that the defections of military units had indeed led to such a decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamestown 23 February 2011&quot;/&gt; Video footage of this started to leak out of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamestown 23 February 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37551&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=f0b3ef8200af7c3a039bc6f593c6ffc6 |title=Special Commentary: Can African Mercenaries Save the Libyan Regime?|date=23 February 2011 |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi's former Chief of Protocol Nouri Al Misrahi stated in an interview with the ''Al Jazeera'' that [[Nigerien]], Malian, [[Chad]]ian and [[Kenya]]n mercenaries are among foreign soldiers helping fight the uprising on behalf of Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Namunane, Bernard|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102250009.html| title=Kenya: 'Dogs of War' Fighting for Gaddafi|work=[[Daily Nation]] (''via'' AllAfrica.com)|date=25 February 2011| accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defecting Libyan Deputy Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi called on African nations to stop sending mercenaries to defend the Gaddafi government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamestown 23 February 2011&quot;/&gt;

Reports by EU experts stated that Gaddafi's government hired between 300 and 500 European soldiers, including some from EU countries, at high wages. According to Michel Koutouzis, who does research on security issues for the EU institutions, the UN and the French government, &quot;In Libyan society, there is a taboo against killing people from your own tribal group.

A witness claimed that mercenaries were more willing to kill demonstrators than Libyan forces were, and earned a reputation as among the most brutal forces employed by the government. A doctor in Benghazi said of the mercenaries that &quot;they know one thing: to kill whose in front of them. Nothing else.

On 7 April, Reuters reported that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were sent into refugee camps to intimidate and bribe black African migrant workers into fighting for the Libyan state during the war. Some of these &quot;mercenaries&quot; were compelled to fight against their wishes, according to a source inside one of the refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7260G620110307|agency=Reuters|date=7 April 2011|accessdate=7 April 2011|title=Africans say Libyan troops try to make them fight|first=Douglas|last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Amnesty International]] said it found no evidence of foreign mercenaries being used, saying the [[Black people|black Africans]] claimed to be &quot;mercenaries&quot; were in fact &quot;sub-Saharan migrants working in Libya,&quot; and described the use of mercenaries as a &quot;myth&quot; that &quot;inflamed public opinion&quot; and led to lynchings and executions of black Africans by rebel forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyRape&quot;/&gt;

In October 2011 it was reported that the [[South African government]] was investigating the possibility that [[South African]] mercenaries were hired by Gaddafi to help him in his [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|failed attempt]] to escape the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|besieged]] city of [[Sirte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyMaverickMerc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2011-11-04-sa-mercenaries-in-the-mad-dogs-war | title=SA mercenaries in the Mad Dog's war | publisher=Daily Maverick | date=November 4, 2011 | accessdate=November 4, 2011 | author=Allison, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that two South African mercenaries died in that operation from a NATO air strike on Gaddafi's convoy.

On 21 February, ''The New York Times'' reported that Gaddafi had tried to impose a blackout on information from Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot;/&gt; Several residents reported that cellphone service was down, and even landline phone service was sporadic.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/world/africa/22libya.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp |title=Qaddafi's Grip Falters as His Forces Take On Protesters |date=21 February 2011 |work=The New York Times |first1=David D. |last1=Kirkpatrick |first2=Mona |last2=El-Naggar}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, every day new footage made with cell phone cameras finds its way to YouTube and the international media. Journalists and human rights researchers make daily phone calls to hundreds of civilians in government held territory.

International journalists who have attempted to cover the events have been attacked by Gaddafi's forces. A ''BBC News'' crew was beaten and then lined up against a wall by Gaddafi's soldiers, who then shot next to a journalist's ear and laughed at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spencer|first=Richard|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8372139/Libya-BBC-crew-beaten-and-given-mock-executions.html |title=Libya: BBC Crew Beaten and Given Mock Executions â A BBC Television Crew Seized at a Checkpoint in Western Libya Were Held, Beaten and Given Mock Executions in the Most Extreme Case of the Gaddafi Regime's Harassment of International Journalists |date=9 March 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=27 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A journalist working for ''The Guardian'' and another Brazilian journalist have been detained.

===International propaganda===
After the uprising began, Libyan students studying in the United States received phone calls from the Libyan embassy, instructing them to participate in pro-Gaddafi rallies. They were threatened with losing their government-funded scholarships if they refused. Gaddafi's ambassador denied the reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/2011217184949502493.html| title=Libyans in US Allege Coercion â Ambassador Denies Students' Claims Embassy Threatened To Cut Scholarships If They Missed Pro-Gaddafi Rallies| work=Al Jazeera|last=Hill|first=Evan| date=17 February 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi's men organized tours for foreign journalists in Tripoli. ''[[The Economist]]'' correspondent in Tripoli noted &quot;The picture presented by the regime often falls apart, fast. Coffins at funerals have sometimes turned out to be empty. Bombing sites are recycled. An injured seven-year-old in a hospital was the victim of a car crash, according to a note passed on surreptitiously by a nurse. Journalists who point out such blatant massaging of facts are harangued in the hotel corridors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/07/reporting-libya | title=Reporting from Libya â Close your window |work=The Economist | date=1 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' described journalism in Gaddafi's Libya as &quot;[[North Korea]] with palm trees&quot;. Journalist were not allowed to go anywhere, or talk to anyone, without authorization from Gaddafi's officials who always followed them. Journalists who didn't report events the way Gaddafi's officials instructed faced problems and sudden deportations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/13/foreign-journalists-rixos-hotel-tripoli | title=No freedom for foreign press at Tripoli's Rixos hotel |work=The Guardian |location=London | date=14 April 2011  | first=Harriet | last=Sherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Amnesty International]] criticized &quot;Western [[Media bias|media coverage]]&quot; which &quot;has from the outset presented a very one-sided view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting that the regime's security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyRape&quot;/&gt;

===Human shields===
Gaddafi forces reportedly surrounded themselves with civilians to protect themselves and key military sites like the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in Tripoli from air strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Haynes, Deborah | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/muammar-gaddafi-using-civilians-to-protect-key-sites/story-e6frg6so-1226025907998 |title=Muammar Gaddafi Using Civilians To Protect Key Sites |work=[[The Times]] (via ''[[The Australian]]'') |date=22 March 2011 | accessdate =11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has reported that Gaddafi places his tanks next to civilian facilities to use them as shields, which is a war crime under international law.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty1&quot;/&gt;

In June 2011, Muammar Gaddafi and his son [[Saif al-Islam]] announced that they were willing to hold elections and that Gaddafi would step aside if he lost. Saif al-Islam stated that the elections could be held within three months and transparency would be guaranteed through international observers. NATO and the rebels rejected the offer, and NATO soon resumed their bombardment of Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Nick|title=Rebels dismiss election offer, NATO pounds Tripoli|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/16/us-libya-idUSTRE7270JP20110616|accessdate=27 October 2011|date=June 16, 2011|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Saif al-Islam condemned NATO for bombing Libyan civilians, including his family members and their children, under the false pretence that their homes were military bases. He also stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his father if they accept a secret deal, an offer they rejected. He thus criticized the ICC as &quot;a fake court&quot; that is controlled by the NATO nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;rt_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;/&gt;

Heads of the rebellion reported on 21 August that Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, was under arrest and that they had encircled the leader's compound, suggesting that the war had reached its endgame with an imminent rebel victory. By 22 August, rebel fighters had gained entrance into Tripoli and occupied Green Square, which was promptly renamed [[Martyrs' Square, Tripoli|Martyrs' Square]] in memory of those who had died fighting in the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyan-rebels-converging-on-tripoli/2011/08/21/gIQAbF3RUJ_story.html?hpid=z1 | work=The Washington Post | first=Joel | last=Greenberg | date=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on 23 August, Saif al-Islam appeared at the Gaddafi-controlled [[Rixos Al Nasr|Rixos Hotel]] in central Tripoli and boasted his father was still in control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qaddafiâs Son Taunts Rebels in Tripoli|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/world/africa/23libya.html?_r=1&amp;hp|accessdate=23 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 August 2011|first1=David D.|last1=Kirkpatrick|first2=Kareem|last2=Fahim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day, rebels blasted open the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in Tripoli through its north gates and stormed inside.

Early the following day, 24 August, Gaddafi broadcast an address from a Tripoli local radio station in which he said the withdrawal from Bab al-Azizia had been a &quot;tactical&quot; move. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported rebel leaders as saying they believed the only areas still under Gaddafi's control, other than the immediate neighbourhood of Bab al-Azizia, were al-Hadhba and Abu Salim, the latter including the Rixos Hotel where a group of foreign journalists had been trapped for days. However, the report noted the rebels lacked a unified command and that Gaddafi loyalists and snipers remained at large in many areas of Tripoli.

===After Tripoli and NTC victory===

Efforts to mop up pro-Gaddafi forces in northwestern Libya and toward [[Sirte]] began even before the rebels fully consolidated control of Tripoli. Rebels took the city of [[Ghadames]] near the borders of Tunisia and Algeria on 29 August. Members of the Gaddafi family have taken flight to Algeria. In September, the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid was besieged by rebels, who reported that Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam was hiding in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Black in Tripoli and Chris Stephen in Misrata |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/19/gaddafi-son-spotted-bani-walid |title=Libya: Gaddafi son spotted in Bani Walid as heavy fighting continues|publisher=The Guardian |date= 19 September 2011|accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, the NTC captured the southern city of [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], and claimed to have found a large cache of [[chemical weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Black in Tripoli |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/22/libyan-rebels-gaddafis-chemical-weapons |title=Libyan rebels discover Gaddafi's chemical weapons|publisher=Guardian |date= 22 September 2011|accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were raised over the danger of Gaddafi mounting an insurgency against the new authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/05/idINIndia-59724420111005 Gaddafi determined to avoid Saddam Hussein's fate], Reuters, 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-October 2011, much of the city of [[Sirte]] had been taken by NTC forces, although [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|fierce fighting continued around the city center]], where many pro-Gaddafi fighters were encamped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/news/ferocious-fighting-in-sirte-as-ntc-tightens-grip [[Channel 4 News]].

There were also reports of harassment and theft by rebels, however the rebel army indicated it would leave unarmed civilians &quot;to their own devices&quot;, and had allowed families in the city access to supplies and medical assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_sirte&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherlock|first=Ruth|title=Gaddafi loyalists stranded as battle for Sirte rages|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8802302/Gaddafi-loyalists-stranded-as-battle-for-Sirte-rages.html|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
{{main|Aftermath of the 2011 Libyan civil war}}
Despite the defeat of Gaddafi's loyalists, capture of last loyalist cities and Gaddafi's death, Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi's son and successor, remained hiding in the southern region of Libya until his capture in mid-November. In addition, some loyalist forces crossed into Niger, though the escape attempts exploded into violence, when detected by Niger troops. 

Sporadic clashes between NTC and former loyalists also continued across Libya with low intensity. On November 23, seven people were killed in clashes at Bani Walid, five of them among the revolutionary forces and one Gaddafi loyalist.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/23/178863.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] donated medical supplies and other humanitarian aid and the UN [[World Food Programme]] provided food. Turkey sent a hospital ship to Misrata and a Turkish cargo ship brought 141 tons of humanitarian aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;reliefweb1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihh.org.tr/ihh-dan-libya-ya-insani-yardim-gemisi/en/ |title=IHH Sends Humanitarian Aid Ship to Libya |publisher=[[IHH (Turkish NGO)|IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation]]|date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another humanitarian issue was refugees fleeing the crisis. A humanitarian ship docked in harbour of Misrata in April to begin the evacuation of stranded migrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE73E0W220110415?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Rockets Bombard Misrata, Rebels Say Eight Killed |agency=Reuters   |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 10 July, over 150,000 migrants were evacutated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Migration crisis from Libya|url=http://migration-crisis.com/libya/|publisher=International Organization for Migration|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants were also stranded elsewhere in Libya, such as in the southern towns of Sebha and Gatroum. Fleeing the violence of Tripoli by road, as many as 4,000 refugees were crossing the LibyaâTunisia border daily during the first days of the uprising. Among those escaping the violence were native Libyans as well as foreign nationals including Egyptians, Tunisians and Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/live-update-thousands-flee-across-libya-tunisia-border/article1918670/ |title=Live Update: Thousands Flee Across LibyaâTunisia Border |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential militaryâhumanitarian coordination===
While the UN sanctioned military intervention has been implemented on humanitarian grounds, UN agencies seeking to ease the humanitarian crisis repeatedly rejected offers of support from the military to carry out the agencies' humanitarian operations.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Metcalfe, Victoria (2011). [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5747&amp;title=friend-foe-military-intervention-in-libya &quot;Friend or Foe? Military Intervention in Libya&quot;]. [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions under which such support may be accepted are outlined in the Guidelines on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets to Support United Nations Humanitarian Activities in Complex Emergencies (MCDA), whereby military support can be used but only temporarily and as a last resort.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Yet, there remains the concern that aid agencies' neutrality will be brought into question by accepting military support, putting aid staff at risk of being [[Attacks on humanitarian workers|attacked]] and causing some parties to prevent the agencies accessing all the areas they need to.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Furthermore, the military may not always have the technical skills required to assess the need for aid and to ensure its effective distribution.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Despite this, offers continue for the creation of an aid corridor and aid agencies have accepted military logistical support in the past, for instance in the [[2010 Pakistan floods]] response.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===Targeting of black Libyans and sub-Saharan Africans===
In August 2011, the [[UNHCR]] issued a strong call for the rights and lives of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]ns living in Libya to be protected due to reports that black Africans were being targeted by the rebel forces as cities fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e57d1cb9.html| title=UNHCR reports on blacks being targetted}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other news sources including ''[[The Independent]]'' and [[CNN]] have reported on the targeting of [[black people]] in rebel held areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/rebels-settle-scores-in-libyan-capital-2344671.html| title=Independent reports on blacks being targeted |location=London |work=The Independent  | first=Kim | last=Sengupta | date=27 August 2011}} and {{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2011/08/31/robertson.libya.african.jails.cnn?&amp;hpt=hp_c2|title=CNN reports on blacks being targeted}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/08/30/140052803/liyban-rebels-wary-of-sub-saharan-africans|title=NPR reports on blacks being targeted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Amnesty International]] statement, released on 30 August 2011, stated that on visits to detention centres in [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]] and [[Tripoli]], Amnesty International was informed that between one third and half of those detained were from Sub-Saharan Africa. A New York Times online article also comments that &quot;it seems that plenty of the black Africans captured as mercenaries were never actually involved in the fight&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/libya-fears-detainees-held-forces-loyal-ntc-2011-08-30|title=Amnesty International reports on blacks being targeted}} and {{cite news|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/blacks-in-libya-face-danger-from-rebels/|title=New York Times report on many Black Africans captured were not mercenaries | work=The New York Times|first=Elizabeth A.|last=Harris|date=1 September 2011}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/libya-fears-detainees-held-forces-loyal-ntc-2011-08-30|title=Amnesty reports round up of Black Africans}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Hundreds of thousands of sub-Saharan Africans worked in Gaddafi's Libya, doing everything from managing hotels to sweeping floors.

The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' reported that some African women have claimed rebels are raping them in [[refugee camp]]s, with additional reports of forced labour. Foreign aid workers are also claiming to be prohibited from officially talking about the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/09/07/v-fullstory/2395392/african-women-say-rebels-raped.html|title=Miami Herald reports on rebels raping Africans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Taworgha]], which supported Gaddafi prior to its [[Battle of Taworgha|capture]] by anti-Gaddafi fighters in August, has been emptied of its mostly black inhabitants in what appeared to be a &quot;major reprisal against supporters of the Gaddafi regime&quot;, according to an 11 September report from ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', and commanders of the [[Misrata Brigade]] are refusing to allow the displaced townspeople to return. One commander was quoted as saying, &quot;Taworgha no longer exists.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8754375/Gaddafis-ghost-town-after-the-loyalists-retreat.html|agency=The Telegraph|first=Andrew|last=Gilligan|date=11 September 2011|accessdate=12 September 2011|title=Gaddafi's ghost town after the loyalists retreat|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A provisional refugee camp set up at [[Ras Ejder]] with a capacity for 10,000 was overflowing with an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees. Many tens of thousands were still trapped on the Libyan side of the frontier. By 3 March, the situation was described as a logistical nightmare, with the [[World Health Organization]] warning of the risk of epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Sayar, Scott; [[Alan Cowell|Cowell, Alan]] (3 March 2011).

To continue responding to the needs of people staying at the [[Ras Ejder]] crossing point in Tunisia, the WFP and [[Secours Islamique-France]] were upgrading a kitchen that would provide breakfast for families.  Separately, the ICRC advised it was handing over its operations at the Choucha Camp to the [[Tunisian Red Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/2011/libya-update-2011-04-15.htm |title=Libya: More Aid To Reach Misrata and Other Areas |publisher= [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 24 March, the WFP  supplied over 42,500 cooked meals for TCNs at the Saloum border.

''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported on 11 September that almost the entire population of [[Taworgha]], a town of about 10,000 people, had been forced to flee their homes by anti-Gaddafi fighters after their [[Battle of Taworgha|takeover of the settlement]]. The report suggested that Taworgha, which was dominated by [[black people|black]] Libyans, may have been the subject of [[ethnic cleansing]] provoked by a combination of [[racism]] and bitterness on the part of [[Misrata]]n fighters over the town's support for Gaddafi during the [[Battle of Misrata|siege of Misrata]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

Many states and [[supranational]] bodies condemned Gaddafi's government over its attacks on civilian targets within the country. Virtually all Western countries cut off diplomatic relations with Gaddafi's government over an aerial bombing campaign in February and March, and a number of other countries led by [[Peru]] and [[Botswana]] did likewise. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970]] was adopted on 26 February, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and ten members of his inner circle and restricting their travel. The resolution also referred the actions of the government to the [[International Criminal Court]] for investigation,&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; and an arrest warrant for Gaddafi was issued on 27 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13927208 |title=Libya: Muammar Gaddafi Subject to ICC Arrest Warrant |work=BBC News  |date=27 June 2011|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an arrest warrant issued by [[Interpol]] on 8 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/09/us-libya-gaddafi-interpol-idUSTRE7882D220110909 |agency=Reuters   |first=John | last=Irish | title=Interpol issues arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi | date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's use of the [[Libyan Air Force]] to strike civilians led to the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] to create a [[Libyan no-fly zone]] on 17 March, though several countries involved in the resolution's enforcement have also carried out regular strike missions to degrade the offensive capacity of the [[Libyan Army]] and destroy the government's [[command and control]] capabilities, effectively acting in ''de facto'' support of [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] on the ground. 100 countries have recognized the anti-Gaddafi [[National Transitional Council]] as Libya's legitimate representative, with many of those countries explicitly describing it as the legal interim government of the country due to the perceived loss of legitimacy on the part of Gaddafi's government.

Many states have also either issued [[travel advisory|travel advisories]] or attempted evacuations. Some evacuations were successful in either going to [[Malta]] or via land borders to [[Egypt]] or [[Tunisia]]; other attempts were hindered by tarmac damage at [[Benghazi]]'s airport or refusals of permission to land in [[Tripoli]]. There were also several solidarity protests in other countries that were mostly composed of Libyan [[expatriates]]. Financial markets around the world had adverse reactions to the instability with oil prices rising to a two-and-a-half year high.
