'''Arturo GarcÃ­a Ortiz''' is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently working for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] under the [[ring name]] '''Rey Bucanero''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;[[Buccaneer]] king&quot;). Outside of [[lucha libre]], he has also worked in [[Japan]] for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], [[Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling]], [[Toryumon (Ãltimo DragÃ³n)|Toryumon]] and [[Dragondoor]]. He is the current [[NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Champion]].

==Professional wrestling career==
After being trained by his uncles and spending several years working undercards for [[Independent circuit|independents]] and undercards for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]], he got his first [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] in late 1996 after winning the Gran Alternativa tournament with [[Emilio Charles, Jr.]] In March 1997, he won the [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] with [[SatÃ¡nico]] and Emilio Charles but the group were transitional champions to take the Trios championship off the [[HÃ©ctor Garza]], who was preparing to leave the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. The push quickly cooled down and Bucanero began work on [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation's]] short lived [[Telemundo]] project, ''Los Super Astros'', without his mask and under the name &quot;Rey 'Pirata' Ortiz&quot;.

===Los Guerreros del Infierno===
{{main|Los Guerreros del Infierno}}
He returned to CMLL in 1999 and [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] extensively with [[OlÃ­mpico]] and the build up pointed to a mask vs. mask match between the two. However, Bucanero teamed with [[JosÃ© Luis Jair Soria|Shocker]], another up and coming [[Heel (professional wrestling)|''rudo'' (heel)]], in a &quot;Ruleta de la Muerte&quot; tournament where the losers advance and the final losing team has to fight amongst themselves in a mask vs. mask match.  Shocker and Bucanero lost in the last round and Shocker took Bucanero's mask.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncyBucanero&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Enciclopedia staff|title=Enciclopedia de las Mascaras|work=Rey Bucanero|location=[[Mexico]]|id=Tomo IV|page=11|date=October, 2007|accessdate=2009-03-28|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he also started teaming with [[Ãltimo Guerrero]] and the duo were recruited by SatÃ¡nico for his new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], Los Nuevos Infernales. The team of Bucanero and Guerrero was pushed in 2000 with a tournament win for the vacant [[CMLL World Tag Team Championship]].

In 2001, Guerrero and Bucanero turned on SatÃ¡nico by costing him a match with [[Tarzan Boy (wrestler)|Tarzan Boy]] and the trio of Guerrero, Bucanero, and Tarzan starting calling themselves &quot;[[Los Infernales]]&quot;. SatÃ¡nico recruited [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]] and [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]], two undercarders with new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmicks]], for his own Infernales group and the two groups feuded over who could use the name. Injuries kept Bucanero and Tarzan out at times so [[MÃ¡scara MÃ¡gica]] was brought in as an alternate member of the group. Bucanero's group lost a seven man cage match and they settled on the name [[Los Guerreros del Infierno]]. They spent the rest of the year feuding with [[Negro Casas]] and [[El Hijo del Santo]] over the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. After a match with an inconclusive finish in October, Los Guerreros lost to Santo and Casas on November 2.

In 2002, Guerrero and Bucanero regained their tag team titles from Santo and Casas in May. The team successfully defended their titles against [[Leonardo Carrera|DamiÃ¡n 666]] and [[Manuel Ortiz Partida|Halloween]] of [[La Familia de Tijuana]] in July. Los Guerreros spent the rest of the year feuding with [[Vampiro|Vampiro Canadiense]] and Shocker. Los Guerreros successfully defended their tag team titles against the duo but Bucanero lost his hair to Vampiro in a singles hair vs. hair match in December to close out the year. In 2003, they defended their titles successfully against Vampiro and [[Lizmark, Jr.]] and Negro Casas and [[Perro Aguayo, Jr.]] but were defeated in December by the team of Shocker and the newly arrived [[Adolfo Tapia|L.A. Park]].

Los Guerreros regained their tag team titles in early 2004 but Bucanero suffered a knee injury and was temporarily replaced by [[Black Warrior]]. Los Guerreros lost the tag titles to [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] and [[Blue Panther]] on June 25. Bucanero and new Guerreros member OlÃ­mpico challenged Atlantis and Panther for the tag team titles on the first [[Arena MÃ©xico]] show of 2005 but they lost and OlÃ­mpico injured his neck while attempting a dive. He teamed with Guerrero in a feud with newcomer [[MÃ­stico]] and recently [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] [[Dr. Wagner, Jr.]] early in the year, losing a main event tag match on March 11. In September, Bucanero and OlÃ­mpico teamed up again to unsuccessfully challenge the visiting [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] for the [[IWGP World Tag Team Championship]]. After Atlantis turned heel and Los Guerreros became known as ''Los Guerreros del AtlÃ¡ntida'', it was teased that Bucanero would break up with Guerrero but Bucanero stayed and Los Guerreros feuded with Perro Aguayo, Jr.'s [[Los Perros del Mal]] faction into 2006. At the end of April, he teamed with Tarzan Boy to win a double hair vs. hair match against [[Mr. Ãguila]] and DamiÃ¡n 666 in the main event of an Arena MÃ©xico show.

The following week, he teamed with Atlantis against [[Ãltimo DragÃ³n]] and [[Keiji Mutoh]] but his team lost after Atlantis hit him by accident. For the following weeks, Bucanero kept having trouble with his teammates and magazines hinted at a possible face turn. Later that month, Averno and Mephisto turned on him during an Arena MÃ©xico match. Shortly afterwards, Tarzan Boy and Guerrero turned on him as well, ripping his tights, signifying he was no longer a member of Los Guerreros. On July 14, he defeated Guerrero for his [[CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship]], ending Guerrero's three and a half year title reign. Actually, he is teaming with [[Dos Caras, Jr.]] and [[Lizmark, Jr.|Hijo de Lizmark]] as a tecnico; he has a notorious feud with [[Kenzo Suzuki]] and [[Ãltimo Guerrero]]. In 2008 Bucanero participated in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'s [[TNA 2008 World X Cup Tournament|World X Cup]] as a part of [[Team Mexico]], who ended up winning the whole tournament.

===La Peste Negra===
{{main|La Peste Negra}}
In July and August of 2010 Rey Bucanero filled in for [[Mr. Niebla]] while he was out with a knee injury and teamed up with ''[[La Peste Negra]]'' members Negro Casas and [[El Felino]]. When he teamed with ''La Peste Negra'' Bucanero wore ring gear that looked more like [[Jack Sparrow]] from the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|Pirates of the Caribbean]] movie series and less like his fellow ''Guerreros de la Atlantida'' members. He was also given a mascot, a [[Mini-Estrella]] wearing a parrot outfit that accompanied him to the ring. The parrot was later named Zacarias. In August, 2010 Rey Bucanero announced that he had left ''Los Guerreros'' and joined ''La Peste Negra'' because they were more interested in teaming with [[OlÃ­mpico]] than him.&lt;ref&gt;**Reference**&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3 at ''Sin Piedad 2010'' Bucanero defeated ''[[Los Invasores]]'' leader [[Mr. Ãguila]] in a ''Lucha de Apuesta'' to take his trademark hair.&lt;ref name=SinPiedad2010&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/12/03/cmll-%E2%80%9Csin-piedad-2010%E2%80%9D-cobertura-y-resultados-3-de-diciembre-del-2010-caera-una-mascara-y-una-cabellera/ | title= CMLL âSin Piedad 2010â (cobertura y resultados 3 de diciembre del 2010) ElÃ©ctrico gana la mÃ¡scara de PequeÃ±o Warrior- Rey Bucanero gana la cabellera de Mr. Ãguila | author= Ruiz Glez, Alex | date= December 3, 2010 | accessdate= December 4, 2010 | publisher=''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2011, Bucanero made an appearance for American promotion [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] (PWG), during the [[WrestleReunion#WrestleReunion 5|WrestleReunion 5]] weekend, in a match, where he was defeated by Mr. Ãguila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_47214.shtml|title=1/29 PWG results in Los Angeles: Complete &quot;virtual-time&quot; coverage of PWG Title match, Kaval vs. Davey, Roberts retirement, Legends Battle Royal|last=Massingham|first=Matt|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=August 1, 2011|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Fuerza TRT===
In April 2011 Bucanero left ''La Peste Negra'' to form a new group with [[El Texano, Jr.]] and [[El Terrible]], abandoning Zacarias in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1304729572 | title= Viva La Raza!
