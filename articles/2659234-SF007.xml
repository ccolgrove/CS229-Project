'''Norton Personal Firewall''', developed by [[Symantec]], is a discontinued [[personal firewall]] with [[ad blocking]], program control and privacy protection capabilities.

Norton Personal Firewall program control module is able to allow or deny individual applications access to the Internet. Programs are automatically allowed or denied Internet access by Norton Personal Firewall. It uses a [[blacklist]] and a [[whitelist]] to determine if the program should be allowed Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/press/2002/n020916.html |title=Symantec's New Norton Personal Firewall 2003 Provides Unparalleled Defense Against Hackers and Privacy Threats |publisher=Symantec Press Center |date=16 September 2002 |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertisement-blocking feature of this software rewrites the [[HTML]] that one's browser uses to display [[Web page]]s. It searches for code related to advertisements against a blacklist and prevents the web page from being displayed. When this happens, there is no notification from Norton Personal Firewall.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}  

The Privacy Control component blocks [[browser cookies]] and active content, and prevents the transmission of sensitive data through standard [[POP3]] e-mail clients, [[Microsoft Office]] e-mail attachments and [[Instant Messaging]] services such as [[MSN Messenger]], [[Windows Messenger]] and [[AOL Instant Messenger]] without the user's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbsnews.com.com/software/norton-personal-firewall-2005/4505-3513_7-30992807-2.html?tag=txt;page |title=Norton Personal Firewall 2005 Software reviews - CNET Reviews |publisher=CNET Reviews |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=8 November 2009 |last=Bigelow |first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
