The '''Florida Democratic Party''' ('''FDP''') is the official organization for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the state of [[Florida]].

==History==
The Florida Democratic Party has historically dominated dodo Florida's state and local politics. Florida's Governor's Mansion was closed to Republicans from [[1877]] until [[1967]], when [[Claude R. Kirk]], a Republican from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], was sworn-in as [[Governor of Florida]]. 

Florida politics was largely dominated by the Democrats until Nixon's [[Southern Strategy]], which took advantage of white objections to the advances of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]] resulted in a regional political [[realignment]] for the south. After Nixon's victory in [[1968]], the state only voted Democratic in three Presidential elections: 1976 ([[Jimmy Carter]]), 1996 ([[Bill Clinton]]), and 2008 ([[Barack Obama]]). The presidential election in 2000 was decided by a margin of 537 votes out of approximately 6 million cast, earning [[George W. Bush]] the presidency over [[Al Gore]].

The [[Florida Senate]] was dominated by Democrats until 1992, when a majority of Republicans was elected. The Florida House of Representatives turned Republican after the November 1996 election. Since then, the number of Democrats in both chambers have continued to drop. The Florida Legislature became the first legislature in any of the states of the former confederacy to come under complete Republican control when the Republicans gained control of the House and Senate in the 1996 election. However, in the 2006 election the Democrats actually gained seats in the State House, the first instance of this occurring since the early 1980s.

In the [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]], the Democratic nominee for Governor was U.S. Representative [[Jim Davis (politician)|Jim Davis]] from [[Tampa, Florida]]. He lost the election to Florida Attorney General [[Charlie Crist]].

The most Democratic region of the state is [[South Florida]], which contains the large cities of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Ft. Lauderdale, Florida|Ft. Lauderdale]], and [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. The Tampa Bay region is also relatively Democratic, although it has become much more competitive in recent electoral cycles. [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]], which contains the state capitol of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], and [[Alachua County]], home to the city of [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] and the [[University of Florida]], are also strong Democratic areas. North Florida and the panhandle are also very Democratic on the local level, although those two regions are solid Republican strongholds in presidential elections.

Florida Democrats demanded, on March 13 2008, a new primary vote, and state party officials have a proposal for recouping the 210 delegates the Sunshine State lost when it moved its primary ahead of the approved time frame.[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/13/primary.proposal.intl/index.html] After weeks of negotiations, the Florida Democratic Party said March 17 2008 it would not hold [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|a second primary]] in the state.[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/17/florida.primary.decision/index.html]

The current chairman of the Florida Democratic Party is former Florida State Senator [[Rod Smith]].
