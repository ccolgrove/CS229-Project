== History ==
The School of Educationâs history is intertwined with the history of UWM. The schoolâs predecessor, Milwaukee Normal School, opened in [[1885]] to train teachers in downtown [[Milwaukee]] at 18th Street and Wells Avenue. In [[1909]], the Normal School moved to its new location, the Milwaukee Normal School Building (todayâs Mitchell Hall on the UWM campus). The Normal School became Milwaukee State Teachers College, offering four-year degrees. In [[1951]], Milwaukee State Teachers College became Wisconsin State College (WSC), Milwaukee, with liberal arts degrees. WSC merged with UW Milwaukee Extension to form UWM.
