'''Microsoft Safety Scanner''' is a [[freeware|free]] disposable [[virus scanner]] similar to [[Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool]] which can be used to scan a system for [[computer virus]]es and other forms of [[malware]]. This program was released on 15 April 2011, following the discontinuation of [[Windows Live OneCare Safety Scanner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Microsoft Safety Scanner is not meant to be used as a day-to-day tool, since it does not provide real-time protection against viruses, cannot update its virus definitions and expires after ten days. On the other hand, it can be run on a computer which already has an antivirus product without any potential interference. Therefore, it can be used to scan a computer where there is a potential infection and the user wants a second check from another antivirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
