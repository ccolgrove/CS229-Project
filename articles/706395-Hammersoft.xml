'''Eileen Davidson''' (born June 15, 1959) is an [[United States|American]] film and [[soap opera]] [[actress]]. She is known for her role as [[Ashley Abbott]] on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' and for the multiple roles she portrayed on ''[[Days of our Lives]]''.

==Personal life==
Davidson was born in [[Artesia, California]], daughter of Charlotte, a homemaker, and Richard Davidson, an airplane parts manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/85/Eileen-Davidson.html |title=Eileen Davidson Biography (1959-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Davidson has been married three times: first to actor [[Christopher Mayer (American actor)|Christopher Mayer]] from 1985â1986.   Her second husband was former ''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Port Charles]]'',  and ''[[As the World Turns]]'' actor [[Jon Lindstrom]], to whom she was married from 1997 to 2000. She is currently married to actor [[Vince Van Patten]]. They have 1 child together: Jesse (born in 2003).&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide.sympatico.msn.ca&quot;/&gt; They met when he briefly appeared as her &quot;boyfriend&quot; on a cruise.

Davidson is related to several well-known actors through her marriage to Vince.  Vince's father is actor [[Dick Van Patten]] (&quot;Eight is Enough&quot;).  Dick's sister is actress [[Joyce Van Patten]].  Joyce was married to actor [[Martin Balsam]].  Joyce and Martin's daughter is actress [[Talia Balsam]] (&quot;Mad Men&quot;).  Talia's first husband was actor [[George Clooney]] and she is now married to [[John Slattery]] (&quot;Mad Men,&quot; &quot;Sex and the City,&quot; &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;).

==Career==
Davidson started her career as a model in Mexico City and California, eventually adding commercials and print work in Europe.  Her agent had recommended that she take acting classes to get work in commercials, but she took to acting so well that she was sent out to auditions for acting roles. She originated the role of [[Ashley Abbott]] on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' in March 1982, beating out more than 100 candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipton |first=Michael A. |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20122873,00.html |title=Daze of Their Lives |publisher=People.com |date=1997-08-11 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Ashley became a front-burner character, and Davidson became an integral part of the show. She quit the show in December 1988 and the producers took her recommendation of hiring a look-alike actress named [[Brenda Epperson Doumani]], whom Davidson had discovered waiting tables at a charity function.

Davidson then appeared in primetime television, but her show, ''Broken Badges'' (1990â1991), was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313855,00.html |title=Faces to Watch &amp;#124; TV |publisher=EW.com |date=1991-04-05 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to daytime when she assumed the role of [[Kelly Capwell]] on ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'' from May 1991 until the soap's cancellation in January 1993. She next appeared as [[Kristen Blake]] on ''[[Days of our Lives]]'' beginning in May 1993. As originally conceived, Kristen was a heroine, who had an [[Achilles' heel]] in that the show's supervillain, [[Stefano DiMera|Stefano]], had raised her after the death of her parents. [[James E. Reilly]], who assumed head writing reins in 1993, began to make Kristen more of a villainess. Reilly eventually developed an outrageous second role for Davidson, having her play [[Susan Banks]], a Kristen look-alike. Reilly eventually penned three more roles for Davidson (Sister Mary Moira, Thomas, and Penelope). Her character, Kristen, intended to keep her other character, Susan, prisoner on an island, but Susan ultimately prevailed and Kristen has remained on the island and has not been heard from since. All related characters were last seen in May 1998.  Davidson's five roles earned her a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1998.  

After a year-long vacation, she returned to her role on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' in March 1999. After a successful return as Ashley Abbott, which included Davidson's second Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress, Davidson was fired from the show.  In December 2006, Davidson told ''[[TV Guide]]'' that she was fired from ''The Young and the Restless'' due to lack of storyline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Soaps/QA/default.aspx?posting={CEC3A44A-57E4-43C5-B900-B5354CCBA885} TVGuide.com]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last airdate as Ashley was January 11, 2007.  According to co-star [[Melody Thomas Scott]], the firing was protested behind the scenes of ''The Young and the Restless'' and was seen as unfair.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007mtssow&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Y&amp;R's Melody Thomas Scott May Not Have a Storyline, But She Has a Lot to Say | date=2007-02-13 | publisher= Soap Opera Weekly|  pages = 10â11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott said: &quot;That was so heartbreaking.  We're still upset about that.  That was a blow.  Terrible.  Eileen Davidson was such a part of the core of the show and such a brilliant actress; beautiful and always prepared.  It was crazy.  I'm not the only one who feels that way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2007mtssow&quot;/&gt;

In a surprise move a few months later, Davidson signed a three-year contract with ''The Young and the Restless'''s sister soap ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' to once again play her ''The Young and the Restless'' character Ashley Abbott at the request of ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' executive producer [[Bradley Bell]]. She first aired on March 9, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007sow&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Eileen Davidson to B&amp;B! | date=2007-02-13 | publisher= Soap Opera Weekly|  page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ken Corday]] called Davidson about a week before she was fired from ''The Young and the Restless'' to get permission to use a picture of her on ''[[Days of our Lives]]''. The picture, which featured Davidson as Susan, was shown in December 2006.

After she was fired from ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' but before being cast in ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', her niece [[Devon Martt]], a fashion designer, approached her about designing clothes together.  Davidson liked the idea and formed a clothing company called Femmeology.  

Davidson co-wrote her first novel with author [[Robert J. Randisi]], a mystery set in the soap opera world titled ''Death in Daytime'', released in October 2008.  Her second mystery novel, ''Dial Emmy for Murder,'' was released in June 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide.sympatico.msn.ca&quot;&gt;[http://tvguide.sympatico.msn.ca/Murder+She+Wrote/Soaps/Features/Articles/080917_eileen_davidson_NB.htm?isfa=1 ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyoungandtherestless.com/news_events/detail_4591.html |title=News and Events: Eileen Davidson's New Mystery |publisher=The Young and the Restless |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her third mystery novel, ''Diva Las Vegas'' was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://eileendavidsonbooks.com/content/diva_las_vegas.asp?id=buy&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Eileen was downgraded to recurring status at ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. She returned to ''The Young and the Restless'' full-time as Ashley on September 26, 2008.
