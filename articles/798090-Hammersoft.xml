''Welcome to Eltingville'' features [[mc chris]], who had recently started working under the Adult Swim brand through ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', in a small role as a short boy disliked by the rest of the cast.

The pilot, as well as the comic, are based on Dorkin's days as a comic store employee at Jim Hanley's Universe's Richmond Avenue store in [[Staten Island]], [[New York]] ([[Eltingville]] is one of Staten Island's neighborhoods); this store is still in business today, at their New Dorp location. Contrary to popular belief, the store did not change names to The Alternate Realm (a different comic book shop, that opened near Hanley's original location, years after they moved to New Dorp) and close down. The exterior shots of the comic shop in the show reflect both the location of the actual store and the Island's most famous view, the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]]. Characters from Dorkin's comic ''[[Milk &amp; Cheese]]'' can be seen in different backgrounds throughout the pilot as a hidden [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]].

The opening and closing [[theme music|themes]] were written and performed by [[The Aquabats]].

|ShortSummary =
The pilot introduces the four members of the Eltingville Club: Bill Dickey, Josh Levy, Pete DiNunzio and Jerry Stokes. The episode begins with the Eltingville Club playing a game of ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', where they are introduced as losers even in their own fantasy world. They argue with Jerry over who gets resurrected, wake up Bill's mom and Bill and Josh get into a fight after blaming each other. Afterward the members go through their business: Jerry has collected 300 letters of support to get a [[Hikaru Sulu|Captain Sulu]] show, Pete built a ''[[The Thing with Two Heads|Thing with Two Heads]]'' model, and Bill failed to contact [[Gene Roddenberry]] from the beyond the grave. All of their accounts are put to shame by Josh's build up of his Sexy Sirens [[VHS|video tape]] until they actually view the tape; it turns out to be a video of ''[[The Hair Bear Bunch]]''. Josh is made fun of by the others making him angry and causing him to choke Pete and Jerry. They all get into a fight, wake up Bill's mom (again) and Bill kicks Josh out of the club. The next day, Bill awakes from a nightmare which he called a &quot;freaky premonition,&quot; and decides to let Josh back into the club. The club reconvenes at the movie theater, where they plan on hopping movies, After two hours they were discovered and tossed out. After that, they go to a toy store, play video games, and steal a kid's toy at a fast food restaurant. They end their day at a comic book shop.

Inside the store, Josh and Bill discover a [[mint condition]] [[Kenner]] 12-inch [[Boba Fett]] from the 1980s, [[Wookiee]] scalps and all. They both jump to buy it from Joe, who sees the opportunity to take advantage of them and charges them $300 for the toy. Since the two cannot settle their differences, Josh challenges Bill to a [[trivia]]-off, with Fett as the prize. The contest rages on with questions until Bill defeats Josh by asking &quot;Who says 'bidi bidi bidi'?&quot; Josh accidentally answers Jerry (who commonly repeats the phrase) although he knowingly meant [[Twiki]] from ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers]]''. Josh declares that he's going home to get the money for the toy before Bill can. The two race back to their homes, causing many incidents on the way. Bill finds his mother's checkbook and Josh takes his mother's purse. When they get back to the store they learn Joe won't take checks nor credit cards, and the two get into a fight over Fett. They accidentally snap off his head resulting in the both of them having to combine their funds to purchase the expensive, now worthless toy. All four are then kicked out of the store. Bill angrily walks away with Fett's head and leaves Josh with the body. While Josh weeps on the ground, Willoughby breaks the [[fourth wall]] to ask if this is the &quot;end of the Eltingville Club?!&quot;, which, ironically enough, seeing as this was the only episode, it was.
