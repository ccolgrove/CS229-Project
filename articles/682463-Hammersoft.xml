'''Highway 29''', known locally as ''Don Philips Way'', is a shortcut route from the [[British Columbia Highway 97|John Hart Highway]] to the [[Alaska Highway]].  It is also the main access to the coal mining community of [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]], as well as the [[W. A. C. Bennett Dam]] facility near [[Hudson's Hope, British Columbia|Hudson's Hope]].  The highway gained its '29' designation from [[Chetwynd, British Columbia|Chetwynd]] north to Hudson's Hope in [[1967]], and then [[1984|seventeen years later]], the road from Chetwynd south to Tumbler Ridge was given the same number.
