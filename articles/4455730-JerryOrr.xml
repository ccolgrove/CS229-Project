'''George Pettibone''' (died August 3, 1908) was an [[Idaho]] miner. He was convicted of [[contempt of court]] and criminal [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] in the [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899]]. 

He was later implicated in the 1905 assassination of [[Frank Steunenberg]], ex-governor of Idaho, by a confession and testimony coerced from [[Albert Horsley|Harry Orchard]] by [[James McParland]], a [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent hired to conduct the investigation. 

[[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) general secretary [[Bill Haywood]] and WFM president [[Charles Moyer]] were also implicated. Haywood was represented by [[Clarence Darrow]], the most renowned defense lawyer of the day, who obtained an acquittal. Pettibone was tried after Haywood, and was defended by [[Orrin N. Hilton]] of Denver. Pettibone was also acquitted. Charges against Moyer were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood,'' 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pettibone fell ill with cancer during his trial.  He returned home to [[Denver, Colorado]], where he died on August 3, 1908, after an operation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;George Pettibone Dead,&quot; ''New York Times,'' August 4, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;
