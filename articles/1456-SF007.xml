The '''AWK''' utility is a data extraction and reporting tool that uses a [[data-driven programming|data-driven]] [[scripting language]] consisting of a set of actions to be taken against textual data (either in files or data streams) for the purpose of producing formatted reports. The language used by awk  extensively uses the [[String (computer science)|string]] [[datatype]], [[associative array]]s (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and [[regular expression]]s.

AWK is one of the early tools to appear in [[Version 7 Unix]] and gained popularity as a way to add computational features to a Unix [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]]. A version of the AWK language is a standard feature of nearly every modern [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] available today. AWK is mentioned in the [[Single UNIX Specification]] as one of the mandatory utilities of a [[Unix]] [[operating system]]. Besides the [[Bourne shell]], AWK is the only other scripting language available in a standard Unix environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unix.org/version3/apis/cu.html The Single UNIX Specification, Version 3, Utilities Interface Table]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also present amongst the commands required by the [[Linux Standard Base]] specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/command.html#AEN32008 Linux Standard Base Core Specification 4.0, Chapter 15. Commands and Utilities]&lt;/ref&gt; Implementations of AWK exist as installed software for almost all other operating systems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

AWK was created at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1726534212;fp;4194304;fpid;1 The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK]&lt;/ref&gt; and its name is derived from the [[family name]]s of its authors â [[Alfred V. Aho|Alfred Aho]], [[Peter J. Weinberger|Peter Weinberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan]]. The name is not commonly pronounced as a string of separate letters but rather to sound the same as the name of the bird, [[auk]] (which acts as an emblem of the language such as on [http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/ The AWK Programming Language] book cover - the book is often referred to by the abbreviation ''TAPL''). &lt;tt&gt;awk&lt;/tt&gt;, when written in all lowercase letters, refers to the [[Unix]] or [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] program that runs other programs written in the AWK programming language.

The power, terseness, and limitations of early AWK programs inspired [[Larry Wall]] to write [[Perl]] just as a new, more powerful POSIX AWK and gawk (GNU AWK) were being defined. Although AWK and [[sed]] were designed to support [[one-liner program]]s, even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs. Despite its limited intended area of use, AWK is [[Turing-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Structure of AWK programs==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;'''AWK''' is a language for processing files of text. A file is treated as a sequence of records, and by default each line is a record. Each line is broken up into a sequence of fields, so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field, the second word as the second field, and so on. An AWK program is of a sequence of pattern-action statements. AWK reads the input a line at a time. A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed.&quot; - Alfred V. Aho&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1726534212;pp;2 The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''AWK''' program is a series of pattern action pairs, written as:

 ''condition'' { ''action'' }

where ''condition'' is typically an expression and ''action'' is a series of commands.
The input is split into records, where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines. The program tests each record against each  of the conditions in turn, and executes the ''action'' for each expression that is true.
Either the ''condition'' or the ''action'' may be omitted.
The ''condition'' defaults to matching every record.
The default ''action'' is to print the record.

In addition to a simple '''AWK''' expression, such as &lt;code&gt;foo == 1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/^foo/&lt;/code&gt;, the ''condition'' can be ''BEGIN'' or ''END'' causing the ''action'' to be executed before or after all records have been read, or ''pattern1, pattern2'' which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches ''pattern1'' up to and including the record that matches ''pattern2'' before again trying to match against ''pattern1'' on future lines.

In addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators, AWK expressions include the tilde operator, ''~'', which matches a [[regular expression]] against a string.
As handy [[syntactic sugar]], ''/regexp/'' without using the tilde operator matches against the current record.

==AWK commands==
AWK commands are the statement that is substituted for ''action'' in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of [[dynamically linked library|dynamically linked libraries]], which can also provide more functions.

For brevity, the enclosing curly braces ( ''{ }'' ) will be omitted from these examples.

===The ''print'' command===
The ''print'' command is used to output text. The output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator (ORS) whose default value is a newline. The simplest form of this command is:

; &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;
:This displays the contents of the current record. In AWK, records are broken down into ''fields'', and these can be displayed separately:

; &lt;tt&gt;print $1&lt;/tt&gt;
: Displays the first field of the current record

; &lt;tt&gt;print $1, $3&lt;/tt&gt;
: Displays the first and third fields of the current record, separated by a predefined string called the output field separator (OFS) whose default value is a single space character

Although these fields (''$X'') may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in [[perl]]), they actually refer to the fields of the current record.  A special case, ''$0'', refers to the entire record.  In fact, the commands &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print $0&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; are identical in functionality.

The ''print'' command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls:

 print 3+2
 print foobar(3)
 print foobar(variable)
 print sin(3-2)

Output may be sent to a file:

 print &quot;expression&quot; &gt; &quot;file name&quot;

or through a [[pipe (Unix)|pipe]]:

 print &quot;expression&quot; | &quot;command&quot;

===Built-in variables===
Awk's built-in variables include the field variables: $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 represents the entire record). They hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record.

Other variables include:

*NR: Keeps a current count of the number of input records.
*NF: Keeps a count of the number of fields in an input record. The last field in the input record can be designated by $NF.
*FILENAME: Contains the name of the current input-file.
*FS: Contains the &quot;field separator&quot; character used to divide fields on the input record. The default, &quot;white space&quot;, includes any space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character to change the field separator.
*RS: Stores the current &quot;record separator&quot; character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a &quot;newline&quot;.
*OFS: Stores the &quot;output field separator&quot;, which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a &quot;space&quot; character.
*ORS: Stores the &quot;output record separator&quot;, which separates the output records when Awk prints them. The default is a &quot;newline&quot; character.
*OFMT: Stores the format for numeric output. The default format is &quot;%.6g&quot;.

===Variables and syntax===
Variable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators ''+ - * /'' represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string [[concatenation]], simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other. It is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved, but two variable names cannot be placed adjacent to each other without having a space in between. String constants are [[delimited]] by double quotes. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using ''#'' as the first character on a line.

===User-defined functions===
In a format similar to [[C (programming language)|C]], function definitions consist of the keyword &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt;, the function name, argument names and the function body.  Here is an example of a function.

 function add_three (number) {
   return number + 3
 }

This statement can be invoked as follows:

 print add_three(36)     # Outputs '''39'''

Functions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function. It is convention to add some [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] in the argument list before the local variables, in order to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin

==Sample applications==
===Hello World===
Here is the customary &quot;[[Hello world]]&quot; program written in AWK:

 BEGIN { print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }

Note that an explicit &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not needed here; since the only pattern is &lt;tt&gt;BEGIN&lt;/tt&gt;, no command-line arguments are processed.

===Print lines longer than 80 characters===
Print all lines longer than 80 characters. Note that the default action is to print the current line.

length($0) &gt; 80

===Print a count of words===
Count words in the input, and print the number of lines, words, and characters (like [[wc (Unix)|wc]])

 {
     w += NF
     c += length + 1
 }
 END { print NR, w, c }

As there is no pattern for the first line of the program, every line of input matches by default so the increment actions are executed for every line. Note that &lt;tt&gt;w += NF&lt;/tt&gt; is shorthand for &lt;tt&gt;w = w + NF&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Sum last word===

 { s += $NF }
 END { print s + 0 }

''s'' is incremented by the numeric value of ''$NF'' which is the last word on the line as defined by AWK's field separator, by default white-space. ''NF'' is the number of fields in the current line, e.g. 4. Since ''$4'' is the value of the fourth field, ''$NF'' is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has, or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines. $ is actually a unary operator with the highest [[operator precedence]]. (If the line has no fields then ''NF'' is 0, ''$0'' is the whole line, which in this case is empty apart from possible white-space, and so has the numeric value 0

At the end of the input the ''END'' pattern matches so ''s'' is printed. However, since there may have been no lines of input at all, in which case no value has ever been assigned to ''s'', it will by default be an empty string. Adding zero to a variable is an AWK idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value. (Concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string, e.g. ''s &quot;&quot;''.  Note, there's no operator to concatenate strings, they're just placed adjacently.) With the coercion the program prints ''0'' on an empty input, without it an empty line is printed.

===Match a range of input lines===

 $ yes Wikipedia | awk 'NR % 4 == 1, NR % 4 == 3 { printf &quot;%6d  %s\n&quot;, NR, $0 }' | sed 7q
      1  Wikipedia
      2  Wikipedia
      3  Wikipedia
      5  Wikipedia
      6  Wikipedia
      7  Wikipedia
      9  Wikipedia
 $

The [[yes (Unix)|yes]] command repeatedly prints its argument (by default the letter &quot;y&quot;) on a line. In this case, we tell the command to print the word &quot;Wikipedia&quot;. The action statement prints each line numbered. The printf function emulates the standard C [[printf]], and works similarly to the print command described above. The pattern to match, however, works as follows: ''NR'' is the number of records, typically lines of input, AWK has so far read, i.e. the current line number, starting at 1 for the first line of input. ''%'' is the [[modulo operation|modulo]] operator. ''NR % 4 == 1'' is true for the first, fifth, ninth, etc., lines of input. Likewise, ''NR % 4 == 3'' is true for the third, seventh, eleventh, etc., lines of input. The range pattern is false until the first part matches, on line 1, and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches, on line 3. It then stays false until the first part matches again on line 5. The [[sed]] command is used to print the first 7 lines, to prevent &lt;tt&gt;yes&lt;/tt&gt; running forever. It is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;head -n7&lt;/tt&gt; if the [[head (Unix)|head]] command is available.

The first part of a range pattern being constantly true, e.g. ''1'', can be used to start the range at the beginning of input. Similarly, if the second part is constantly false, e.g. ''0'', the range continues until the end of input:
 /^--cut here--$/, 0
prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression ''^--cut here--$'', that is, a line containing only the phrase &quot;--cut here--&quot;, to the end.

===Calculate word frequencies===
Word frequency uses [[associative array]]s:

 BEGIN {
     FS=&quot;[^a-zA-Z]+&quot;
 }
 {
      for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++)
           words[tolower($i)]++
 }
 END {
     for (i in words)
          print i, words[i]
 }

The BEGIN block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters. Note that separators can be regular expressions. After that, we get to a bare action, which performs the action on every input line. In this case, for every field on the line, we add one to the number of times that word, first converted to lowercase, appears. Finally, in the END block, we print the words with their frequencies. The line
 for (i in words)
creates a loop that goes through the array words, setting i to each ''subscript'' of the array. This is different from most languages, where such a loop goes through each value in the array. The loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count. &lt;tt&gt;tolower&lt;/tt&gt; was an addition to the One True awk (see below) made after the book was published.

===Match pattern from command line===
This program can be represented in several ways. The first one uses the [[Bourne shell]] to make a shell script that does everything. It is the shortest of these methods:

 $ cat grepinawk
 pattern=$1
 shift
 awk '/'$pattern'/ { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }' &quot;$@&quot;
 $

The &lt;tt&gt;$pattern&lt;/tt&gt; in the awk command is not protected by quotes.  A pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line (&lt;tt&gt;$0&lt;/tt&gt;) matches. &lt;tt&gt;FILENAME&lt;/tt&gt; contains the current filename. awk has no explicit concatenation operator; two adjacent strings concatenate them. &lt;tt&gt;$0&lt;/tt&gt; expands to the original unchanged input line.

There are alternate ways of writing this. This shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk:

 $ cat grepinawk
 pattern=$1
 shift
 awk '$0 ~ ENVIRON[&quot;pattern&quot;] { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }' &quot;$@&quot;
 $

This is a shell script that uses &lt;tt&gt;ENVIRON&lt;/tt&gt;, an array introduced in a newer version of the One True awk after the book was published. The subscript of &lt;tt&gt;ENVIRON&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of an environment variable; its result is the variable's value. This is like the [[getenv]] function in various standard libraries and [[POSIX]]. The shell script makes an environment variable &lt;tt&gt;pattern&lt;/tt&gt; containing the first argument, then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file.

&lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand; &lt;tt&gt;!~&lt;/tt&gt; is its inverse. Note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables.

The next way uses command-line variable assignment, in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable:

 $ cat grepinawk
 pattern=$1
 shift
 awk '$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }' &quot;pattern=$pattern&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
 $

Finally, this is written in pure awk, without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script (as the variable assignment on command line one does), but is a bit lengthy:

 BEGIN {
     pattern = ARGV[1]
     for (i = 1; i &lt; ARGC; i++) # remove first argument
         ARGV[i] = ARGV[i + 1]
     ARGC--
     if (ARGC == 1) { # the pattern was the only thing, so force read from standard input (used by book)
         ARGC = 2
         ARGV[1] = &quot;-&quot;
     }
 }
 $0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME &quot;:&quot; $0 }

The &lt;tt&gt;BEGIN&lt;/tt&gt; is necessary not only to extract the first argument, but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the &lt;tt&gt;BEGIN&lt;/tt&gt; block ends. &lt;tt&gt;ARGC&lt;/tt&gt;, the number of arguments, is always guaranteed to be â¥1, as &lt;tt&gt;ARGV[0]&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the command that executed the script, most often the string &lt;tt&gt;&quot;awk&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Also note that &lt;tt&gt;ARGV[ARGC]&lt;/tt&gt; is the empty string, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line.

Note the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; block. awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command. This means that
 awk 'prog'
only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before &lt;tt&gt;prog&lt;/tt&gt; is run! If you explicitly set &lt;tt&gt;ARGC&lt;/tt&gt; to 1 so that there are no arguments, awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files. Therefore, you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Self-contained AWK scripts==
As with many other programming languages, self-contained AWK script can be constructed using the so-called &quot;[[shebang (Unix)|shebang]]&quot; syntax.

For example, a UNIX command called &lt;tt&gt;hello.awk&lt;/tt&gt; that prints the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; may be built by creating a file named &lt;tt&gt;hello.awk&lt;/tt&gt; containing the following lines:

 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN { print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }

The &lt;tt&gt;-f&lt;/tt&gt; tells awk that the argument that follows is the file to read the awk program from, which is placed there by the shell when running.

== Versions and implementations==
AWK was originally written in 1977, and distributed with [[Version 7 Unix]].

In 1985 its authors started expanding the language, most significantly by adding user-defined functions. The language is described in the book ''The AWK Programming Language'', published 1988, and its implementation was made available in releases of [[UNIX System V]]. To avoid confusion with the incompatible older version, this version was sometimes known as &quot;new awk&quot; or ''nawk''. This implementation was released under a [[free software license]] in 1996, and is still maintained by Brian Kernighan. (see external links below)

Old versions of Unix, such as [[UNIX/32V]], included &lt;tt&gt;awkcc&lt;/tt&gt;, which converted AWK to C. Kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into C++; its state is not known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awkc++.ps An AWK to C++ Translator]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''BWK awk''' refers to the version by [[Brian Kernighan|Brian W. Kernighan]], also known as ''nawk''. It has been dubbed the &quot;One True AWK&quot; because of the use of the term in association with the book that originally described the language and the fact that Kernighan was one of the original authors of AWK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/ '''The AWK Programming Language''', ISBN 0-201-07981-X.]&lt;/ref&gt; FreeBSD refers to this version as ''one-true-awk''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/contrib/one-true-awk/FREEBSD-upgrade?rev=1.9&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup FreeBSD's work log for importing BWK awk into FreeBSD's core], dated 2005-05-16, downloaded 2006-09-20&lt;/ref&gt; This version also has features not in the book, such as &lt;tt&gt;tolower&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ENVIRON&lt;/tt&gt; that are explained above; see the FIXES file in the source archive for details. This version is used by e.g. [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]] or [[MacOS X]].
*'''gawk''' ([[GNU]] awk) is another free software implementation and the only implementation that made serious attempts at implementing [[Internationalization and localization]] and TCP/IP networking. It also allows the user to extend the functionality of the program via user-written shared libraries. It was written before the original implementation became freely available, and is still widely used. Many [[Linux distribution]]s come with a recent version of ''gawk'' and it is widely recognized as the ''de facto'' standard implementation in the [[Linux]] world. ''gawk'' version 3.0 was included as ''awk'' in [[FreeBSD]] prior to version 5.0. Subsequent versions of FreeBSD use ''BWK awk'' in order to avoid the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/bsdl-gpl/ FreeBSD's view of ''GPL Advantages and Disadvantages'']&lt;/ref&gt; a [[BSD and GPL licensing|more restrictive]] license than the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.0R/relnotes-i386.html#USERLAND FreeBSD 5.0 release notes] with notice of '''BWK awk''' in the base distribution&lt;/ref&gt;
