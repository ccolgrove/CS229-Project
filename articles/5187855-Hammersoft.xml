The '''Banjo Bowl''' is the annual rematch game between the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) after the [[Labour Day Classic]].

While the traditional Labour Day Classic game is always played on the Sunday before [[Labour Day]] at [[Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], there is usually a rematch on the following weekend between these two rival [[Canadian Prairies|prairie]] teams at [[Canad Inns Stadium]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].  

The &quot;Banjo Bowl&quot; moniker was coined by Blue Bombers board member [[David Asper]] in early 2004, inspired by an infamous comment made by Bombers [[placekicker]] [[Troy Westwood]] in the week prior to a [[2003 CFL season|2003]] Western Division Semi-final game between the two teams. Westwood was quoted in the media as saying that people from Regina were &quot;a bunch of [[banjo]]-pickin' [[inbred]]s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The game is sponsored by the [[Manitoba Lotteries Corporation]]. The game has been sold out every year since 2005. As of the 2011 season, the series is tied 4-4.

As on Labour Day weekend when many Winnipeg fans visit Regina to support the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers|Bombers]], many Saskatchewan fans visit Winnipeg the following weekend to support the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders|'Riders]].  Many come, tongue-in-cheek, with banjos.
