The '''Danube''' ({{IPA-en|ËdÃ¦njuËb}} {{respell|DAN|yoob}}) is a river in the [[Central Europe]] and the [[Europe]]'s second longest river after the [[Volga]]. It is classified as an [[international waterway]].

The river originates in the [[Black Forest]] mountain range in [[Germany]] as the much smaller [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers which join at the German town of [[Donaueschingen]]. After that it is  known as the Danube and flows southeastward for a distance of some {{convert|2,872|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through four [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an capitals, before emptying into the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Danube Delta]] in [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]].

Known to history as one of the long-standing frontiers of the [[Roman Empire]], the river flows through or acts as part of the borders of ten countries: Germany (7.5%), [[Austria]] (10.3%), [[Slovakia]] (5.8%), [[Hungary]] (11.7%), [[Croatia]] (4.5%), [[Serbia]] (10.3%), [[Bulgaria]] (5.2%), [[Moldova]] (1.6%), [[Ukraine]] (3.8%) and [[Romania]] (28.9%). (The percentages reflect the proportion of the total Danube [[drainage basin]] area).&lt;ref name=icpdr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-pages/countries.htm|title=Countries of the Danube River Basin|publisher=International Commission for the protection of the Danube River|accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Danube, Sarengrad.JPG|thumb|250px| Danube in [[Å arengrad]], [[Croatia]]]]

==Name==
The Danube was known in [[Latin]] as {{lang|la|Danubius, Danuvius, Ister}}, in [[Ancient Greek]] as á¼¼ÏÏÏÎ¿Ï (''Istros'') .
The [[Dacian language|Dacian]]/[[Thracian language|Thracian]] name was  Î¤Î¬Î½Î±Î¹Ï/''Donaris'' / ''Donaris'' (upper Danube) and ''Istros'' (lower Danube).&lt;ref name=&quot;KatiicRadislav&quot;&gt;KatiÄic', Radislav. ''Ancient Languages of the Balkans, Part One''. Paris: Mouton, 1976: 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''DÄnuvius'' is presumably a loan from Celtic ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]), or possibly Iranic. It is one of a number of river names derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language]] word ''*dÄnu'', apparently a term for &quot;river&quot;, but possibly also of a primeval cosmic river, and of a Vedic river goddess (see [[Danu (Asura)]]), perhaps from a root ''*dÄ'' &quot;to flow/swift, rapid, violent, undisciplined.&quot; 
Other river names with the same etymology include [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Donets]], [[Dnieper]] and [[Dniestr]]. 
Dniepr,(pre-Slavic Danapir by Gothic historian [[Jordanes]])  and Dniestr, from ''Danapris'' and ''Danastius'', are presumed from [[Scythian language|Scythian]] Iranic ''*DÄnu apara'' &quot;posterior river&quot; and ''*DÄnu nazdya-'' &quot;anterior river&quot;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;.
[[Julius Pokorny]] (1959):  ''dÄ-'' &quot;fluid, to flow&quot;,  ''dÄnu-'' f. &quot;river&quot;;
Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. ''The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture''. London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997: 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greek ''Istros'' was a borrowing from [[Thracian language|Thracian]]/[[Dacian language|Dacian]] meaning &quot;strong, swift&quot;, akin to [[Sanskrit]] ''is.iras'' &quot;swift&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatiicRadislav&quot; /&gt;

Since the [[Norman conquest of England]], the English language has used the Latin-derived word ''Danube''. 
In the languages of the modern countries through which the river flows, it is:
*{{lang-bg|''ÐÑÐ½Ð°Ð²''}} (transliterated: ''Dunav'')
*{{lang-hr|Dunav}}
*{{lang-cz|Dunaj}}
*{{lang-de|Donau}} {{IPA-de|doËnaÊÌ¯|pron}}
*{{lang-hu|Duna}}
*{{lang-ro|DunÄrea}} {{IPA-ro|ËdunÉreÌ¯a|pron}}
*{{lang-sr|''ÐÑÐ½Ð°Ð²''}}, {{lang|sr-Latn|''Dunav''}} {{IPA-sh|dÇnavÌ|pron}} or {{IPA-sh|dÃ»naËvÌ|}}

==Geography==
[[Image:The Danube Spills into the Black Sea.jpg|thumb|The Danube discharges into the Black Sea.]]

===Drainage basin===
In addition to the bordering countries (see above), the [[drainage basin]] includes parts of eight more countries: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (4.8%), the [[Czech Republic]] (2.5%), [[Slovenia]] (2.2%), [[Switzerland]] (0.32%), [[Italy]] (0.15%), [[Poland]] (0.09%), the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (0.03%) and [[Albania]] (0.03%).&lt;ref name=icpdr /&gt; The highest point of the drainage basin is the summit of ''[[Piz Bernina]]'' at the ItalyâSwitzerland border, {{convert|4049|m}}.

===Tributaries===
{{Main|List of tributaries of the Danube}}
The Danube's watershed extends into many other countries. Many Danubian tributaries are important rivers in their own right, navigable by barges and other shallow-draught boats. From its source to its outlet into the Black Sea, its main tributaries are (in order):

===Sectioning===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bratislava]] --&gt;
*Upper Section: From spring to [[DevÃ­n Gate]]. Danube remains a characteristic mountain river until [[Passau]], with average bottom gradient 0.0012%, from Passau to DevÃ­n Gate the gradient lessens to 0.0006%.
*Middle Section: From DevÃ­n Gate to [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]]. The riverbed widens and the average bottom gradient becomes only 0.00006%.
*Lower Section: From Iron Gate to [[Sulina]], with average gradient as little as 0.00003%.

==Modern navigation==

[[File:Tvdjava iz vazduha.jpg|thumb|Confluence of [[Sava]] into Danube in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]]]
The Danube is navigable by ocean ships from the Black Sea to [[BrÄila]] in [[Romania]] and by river ships to [[Kelheim]], Bavaria, Germany; smaller craft can navigate further upstream to [[Ulm]], [[WÃ¼rttemberg]], Germany. About 60 of its tributaries are also navigable.

Since the completion of the German [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal|RhineâMainâDanube Canal]] in 1992, the river has been part of a trans-European waterway from [[Rotterdam]] on the [[North Sea]] to [[Sulina]] on the Black Sea (3500&amp;nbsp;km). In 1994 the Danube was declared one of ten [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European transport corridors]], routes in Central and Eastern Europe that required major investment over the following ten to fifteen years. The amount of goods transported on the Danube increased to about 100 million tons in 1987. In 1999, transport on the river was made difficult by the [[NATO]] bombing of three bridges in Serbia. The clearance of the debris was finished in 2002. The temporary pontoon bridge that hampered navigation was removed in 2005.

At the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], the Danube flows through a [[gorge]] that forms part of the boundary between Serbia and Romania; it contains the [[Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station]] [[dam]], followed at about 60&amp;nbsp;km downstream (outside the gorge) by the [[Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station]]. On 13 April 2006, a record peak discharge at Iron Gate Dam reached 15,400 mÂ³/s.

There are three artificial waterways built on the Danube: the [[Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal|DanubeâTisaâDanube Canal]] (DTD) in the [[Banat]] and [[BaÄka]] regions ([[Vojvodina]], northern province of Serbia); the 64&amp;nbsp;km [[Danube-Black Sea Canal|DanubeâBlack Sea Canal]], between [[CernavodÄ]] and [[ConstanÅ£a]] (Romania) finished in 1984, shortens the distance to the Black Sea by 400&amp;nbsp;km; the [[RhineâMainâDanube Canal|Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]] (about 171&amp;nbsp;km), finished in 1992, linking the North Sea to the Black Sea.

==The Danube delta==
{{Main|Danube Delta}}
The Danube Delta has been a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1991. Its wetlands (on the [[Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance]]) support vast flocks of migratory birds, including the endangered [[Pygmy Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax pygmaeus''). Rival canalization and drainage schemes threaten the [[delta]]: see [[Bastroe Channel]].

==International cooperation==
===Ecology and environment===
[[File:Pelicani din Delta Dunarii.PNG|thumb|right|[[Pelicans]] in the Danube Delta, Romania]]
{{Main|International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River}}
The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) is an organization consisting of 14 member states (Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Montenegro and Ukraine) and the [[European Union]]. The commission, established in 1998, deals with the whole Danube River Basin, which includes tributaries and the groundwater resources. Its goal is to implement the Danube River Protection Convention by promoting and coordinating sustainable and equitable water management, including conservation, improvement and rational use of waters and the implementation of the EU [[Water Framework Directive]].

===Navigation===
{{Main|Danube Commission}}
The Danube Commission is concerned with the maintenance and improvement of the river's navigation conditions. It was established in 1948 by seven countries bordering the river. Members include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Serbia, It meets regularly twice a year. It also convenes groups of experts to consider items provided for in the commission's working plans.  

The commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856 and 1921, which established for the first time an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the Danube.

==Geology==
[[Image:IJzeren Poort 2.jpg|thumb|right| [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gates]], Serbia-Romania border]]
[[File:IJzeren Poort Stuwdam.JPG|thumb|right|[[Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station]], Romania-Serbia]]
Although the [[headwater]]s of the Danube are relatively small today, geologically, the Danube is much older than the [[Rhine]], with which its catchment area competes in today's southern Germany. This has a few interesting geological complications. Since the Rhine is the only river rising in the [[Alps]] mountains which flows north towards the North Sea, an invisible line beginning at [[Piz Lunghin]] divides large parts of southern Germany, which is sometimes referred to as the [[European Watershed]]. 

Before the last [[ice age]] in the [[Pleistocene]], the Rhine started at the southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that today feed the Rhine were carried east by the so-called ''Urdonau'' (original Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of the [[Swabian Alb]]. After the [[Upper Rhine valley]] had been eroded, most waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine. Today's upper Danube is but a meek reflection of the ancient one.

Since the Swabian Alb is largely shaped of porous [[limestone]], and since the Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the Danube carries little water, it completely oozes away noisily into these underground channels at two locations in the Swabian Alp, which are referred to as the [[:de:Donauversickerung|de:''Donauversickerung'']] ([[Danube Sink]]). Most of this water resurfaces only 12&amp;nbsp;km south at the [[Aachtopf]], Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an average of 8500 litres per second, north of [[Lake Constance]]âthus feeding the Rhine. The European Water Divide applies only for those waters that pass beyond this point, and only during the days of the year when the Danube carries enough water to survive the sink holes in the Donauversickerung.

Since such large volumes of underground water erode much of the surrounding limestone, it is estimated that the Danube upper course will one day disappear entirely in favor of the Rhine, an event called [[Stream capture|stream capturing]].

[[Image:Bratislavaminorflood.jpg|thumb|[[Bratislava]] does not usually suffer major floods, but the Danube sometimes overflows its right bank]]

The Danube basin was the site of some of the earliest human cultures. The [[Danubian culture|Danubian Neolithic]] cultures include the [[Linear Pottery culture]]s of the mid-Danube basin. The third millennium BC [[VuÄedol culture]] (from the VuÄedol site near [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]]) is famous for its ceramics. Many sites of the sixth-to-third millennium BC [[VinÄa culture]], (VinÄa, Serbia) are sited along the Danube. The river was part of the [[Roman Empire]]'s ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''. The Romans often used the river Danube as a northern border for their empire.    

Alexander the Great defeated the Triballian king Syrmus and the northern barbarian Thracian and Illyrian tribes by advancing from Macedonia as far as the Danube in 336BC.

===Ancient cultural perspectives of the lower Danube===
Part of the Danubius or Istros river was also known as (together with the Black Sea) the ''Okeanos'' in ancient times, being called the ''Okeanos Potamos'' (Okeanos River). The lower Danube was also called the ''Keras Okeanoio'' (Gulf or Horn of Okeanos) in the ''Argonautica'' by Apollonius Rhodos (Argon. IV. 282). &lt;!-- [needs not only cites but some explanation of relevance, particularly for references to Lithuanian linguistics]{{Or|date=July 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.--&gt; The lower Danube has a slow, deep, wide course, so it can be seen why it was considered as part of the Okeanos.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

At the end of the ''Okeanos Potamos'', is the holy island of Alba (Leuke, Pytho Nisi, Isle of Snakes), sacred to the Pelasgian (and later, Greek) Apollo, greeting the sun rising in the east. [[Hecateus Abderitas]] refers to Apollo's island from the region of the Hyperboreans, in the Okeanos. It was on Leuke, in one version of his legend, that the hero Achilles was buried (to this day, one of the mouths of the Danube is called Chilia). Old Romanian folk songs recount a white monastery on a white island with nine priests.&lt;ref name=Densusianu&gt;[http://www.pelasgians.org ''Dacia Preistorica''], Nicolae Densusianu (1913).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
===Drinking water===
Along its course, the Danube is a source of drinking water for about ten million people. In [[Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg]], Germany, almost thirty percent (as of 2004) of the water for the area between [[Stuttgart]], [[Bad Mergentheim]], [[Aalen]] and [[Alb-Donau (district)]] comes from purified water of the Danube. Other cities such as [[Ulm]] and [[Passau]] also use some water from the Danube.

In Austria and Hungary, most water is drawn from ground and spring sources, and only in rare cases is water from the Danube used. Most states also find it too difficult to clean the water because of extensive pollution; only parts of Romania where the water is cleaner still obtain drinking water from the Danube on a regular basis. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Navigation and transport===
As [[Pan-European corridors|&quot;Corridor VII&quot;]] of the [[European Union]], the Danube is an important transport route. Since the opening of the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal|RhineâMainâDanube Canal]], the river connects the Black Sea with the industrial centers of [[Western Europe]] and with the [[Port of Rotterdam]]. The waterway is designed for large-scale inland vessels (110Ã11.45 m) but it can carry much larger vessels on most of its course. The Danube has been partly canalized in Germany (5 locks) and Austria (10 locks). Proposals to build a number of new locks to improve navigation have not progressed, due in part to environmental concerns. 

Downstream from the [[Freudenau River]] plant's locks in Vienna, canalization of the Danube was limited to the [[GabÄÃ­kovo - Nagymaros Dams|GabÄÃ­kovo dam]] and locks near Bratislava and the two double Iron Gate locks in the border stretch of the Danube between Serbia and Romania. These locks have larger dimensions (similar to the locks in the Russian [[Volga]] river, some 300 by over 30 m). Downstream of the Iron Gate, the river is free flowing all the way to the Black Sea, a distance of more than 860 kilometres.

The Danube connects with the RhineâMainâDanube Canal at [[Kelheim]], and with the [[Wiener Donaukanal]] in Vienna. Apart from a couple of secondary navigable branches, the only major navigable rivers linked to the Danube are the [[Drava]], [[Sava]] and [[Tisa]]. In Serbia, a canal network also connects to the river; the network, known as the [[Dunav-Tisa-Dunav canals]], links sections downstream.

===Fishing===
The importance of [[fishing]] on the Danube, which was critical in the [[Middle Ages]], has declined dramatically. Some fishermen are still active at certain points on the river, and the [[Danube Delta]] still has an important industry.

===Tourism===
[[Image:Wachau Valley Durnstein.jpg|thumb|right|Wachau Valley near [[Durnstein]].]]
Important tourist and natural spots along the Danube include the [[Wachau]] Valley, the [[Nationalpark Donau-Auen]] in Austria, [[Gemenc]] in Hungary, the [[Naturpark Obere Donau]] in Germany, [[KopaÄki rit]] in Croatia, [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] in Serbia and Romania, the  [[Danube Delta]] in Romania, and the [[Srebarna Nature Reserve]] in Bulgaria.

The [[Donauradweg|Danube Bike Trail]] (also called Danube Cycle Path or the ''Donauradweg'') is a bicycle trail along the river. It is divided into four sections:
#[[Donaueschingen]]-[[Passau]] (559&amp;nbsp;km)
#[[Passau]]-[[Vienna]] (340&amp;nbsp;km)
#[[Vienna]]-[[Budapest]] (306&amp;nbsp;km)
#[[Budapest]]-[[Black Sea]] (1670&amp;nbsp;km)

==Cultural significance==
*The Danube is mentioned in the title of a famous [[waltz]] by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[composer]] [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]], ''[[The Blue Danube|An der schÃ¶nen, blauen Donau]]'' (''On the Beautiful Blue Danube''). This piece is well known across the world and is also used widely as a [[lullaby]]. ''[[The Waves of the Danube]]'' ({{lang-ro|Valurile DunÄrii}}) is a waltz by the Romanian composer [[Ion Ivanovici]] (1845â1902). [[Joe Zawinul]] wrote a [[symphony]] about the Danube called ''[[Stories of the Danube]]''. It was performed for the first time at the 1993 [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] festival, at [[Linz]].

*The Danube figures prominently in the [[Mila Rodino|Bulgarian National Anthem]], as a symbolic representation of the country's natural beauty. In [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] folklore songs appearance of Danube (Dunojus, DunojÄlis) is more common than the appearance of the longest Lithuanian river [[Neman River|Neman]].

*The German tradition of landscape painting, the [[Danube school]], was developed in the Danube valley in the 16th century One of [[Claudio Magris]]'s masterpiece is called ''Danube'' (ISBN 1-86046-823-3).

*[[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Danube Pilot]]'' (1908) (&quot;Le Pilote du Danube&quot;) depicts the adventures of fisherman Serge Ladko as he travels down the river. [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s [[The Willows (story)|''The Willows'']], about a boat excursion on the river, is considered one of the greatest stories in the literature of the supernatural.

*The river is the subject of the film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]'' (2004) (official site here [http://www.theister.com/]). Parts of the German road movie ''[[Im Juli]]'' take place along the Danube. In Nicolas Roeg's 1980 film ''[[Bad Timing]]'', the border crossing over the Danube between Bratislava and Vienna is a recurring site in which the romance between Milena (Teresa Russell), Alex (Art Garfunkel) and Milena's husband Stefan (Denholm Elliot) is played out.

*In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the [[Danube class starship|''Danube''-class runabout]] is a type of [[starship]] used by the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[Starfleet]], most notably in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' series.

There are also Hasidic (Chabad Nigunnim) songs which are called &quot;dunai&quot;, dating from around 200 years ago. They are often lullabys and are named after the '''Dunay river'''. Farmers around the river used to come to the river and sing spiritual songs to thank their god about the great beauty which they saw every day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
