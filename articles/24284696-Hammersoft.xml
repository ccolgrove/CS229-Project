The '''Naica Mine''' of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] is a working [[Mining|mine]] that is best known for its extraordinary [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] [[crystals]].&lt;ref&gt; GarcÃ­a-Ruiz, Juan Manuel, 2007, ''Formation of natural gypsum megacrystals in Naica, Mexico,'' Geology, 35(4): p. 327 {{doi|10.1130/G23393A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Located in [[Naica]] in the municipality of [[Saucillo (municipality)|Saucillo]], the Naica Mine, a [[lead]], [[zinc]] and [[silver]] mine 
operated by [[PeÃ±oles|Industrias PeÃ±oles]], is Mexico's largest lead producer. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penoles.com.mx/penoles/ingles/about_penoles/about_penoles.php &quot;Naica: largest lead producing mine in Mexico&quot;] &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cave of the Crystals|Caverns]] discovered during mining operations contain crystals of selenite ([[gypsum]]) as large as {{convert|4|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|50|ft|m}} long.

==Cave of the Crystals==
{{main|Cave of the Crystals}}

The Cave of Crystals (''Cueva de los Cristales'') is a cave approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m}} below the surface in the limestone host rock of the mine. The chamber contains giant selenite [[crystals]], some of the largest natural crystals ever found.&lt;ref&gt; [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text National Geographic, 2008. Cavern of Crystal Giants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NG2007&gt; [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070406-giant-crystals.html National Geographic, 2007. Giant Crystal Cave's Mystery Solved]&lt;/ref&gt;
The selenite crystals were formed by [[hydrothermal]] fluids emanating from the [[magma]] chambers below. The cavern was discovered while the miners were drilling through the [[Naica fault]], which they were worried would flood the mine.

==The Cave of Swords==
The Cave of Swords is another chamber in the Naica Mine, also containing gypsum crystals but each only about a meter long.&lt;ref name=NG2007/&gt;
