'''Downey''' is a city located in southeast [[Los Angeles County, California]], [[United States]], {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of downtown [[Los Angeles]].  The city is best known as the birthplace of the [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], and is the city where folk singer [[Karen Carpenter]] lived and died.  As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 111,772, up from 107,323 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in [[Alta California]], the area that now comprises Downey was inhabited by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] ethnic group, which came to be called the [[Gabrielino]] by the Spanish.  The nearest Tongva settlements appear to have been just north and northeast of present-day Downey, although there is difficulty is locating them very precisely.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCawley&quot;&gt;McCawley, William (1996). ''The First Angelinos: the Gabrielino Indians of Los Angeles.''  Banning, CA: Malki Museum Press/Ballena Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The villages of ''Naxaawânga'' and ''Sehat'' seem to have been situated near the present-day community of Los Nietos, or perhaps farther west on sites that were lost to floods of the San Gabriel River.  ''Chokiishnga'' and ''Huutnga'' are other Tongva  place names that may have referred to villages in the general area north of Downey between the San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid&quot;&gt;Reid, Hugo (1852). &quot;Los Angeles County Indians.&quot; ''Los Angeles County Star'', '''1'''(41)â'''2'''(11) (24 February-24 July 1852).&lt;/ref&gt;  In all four cases, it is difficult to relate the original location descriptions, based on ranchos and land grants, to more specific sites identifiable by todayâs landmarks. [[Mission San Gabriel Arcangel]] was initially founded on September 8, 1771, near these concentrations of Tongva population, at a site in the Whittier Narrows on a bluff overlooking the Rio Hondo near the intersection of todayâs San Gabriel Blvd and Lincoln Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kyle&quot;&gt;Kyle, Douglas E. (1990). ''Historic Spots in California'', 4th ed. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  After five years, flooding forced the relocation of the mission to its present site in [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]].

In 1784, Governor [[Pedro Fages]] granted to former soldier [[Manuel Nieto]] (1734â1804) the largest of the land concessions made during the Spanish control of California.  Its {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}} stretched from the [[Santa Ana River]] on the east to the Old [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] (now the [[Rio Hondo (California)|Rio Hondo]] and [[Los Angeles River]]) on the west, and from the mission highway (approximately [[Whittier Boulevard]]) on the north to the ocean on the south.  Its acreage was slightly reduced later at the insistence of [[Mission San Gabriel]] on whose lands it infringed. The Spanish concessions, of which 25 were made in California, were unlike the later Mexican land grants in that title was not transferred, but were similar to grazing permits, with the title remaining with the Spanish crown.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Warren A., Haase, Ynez D. (1974). ''Historical Atlas of California''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rancho Los Nietos]] passed to Manuel Nieto's four children upon his death and remained intact until, in 1833, his heirs petitioned Mexican Governor [[JosÃ© Figueroa]] to partition the property.  The northwestern portion of the original rancho, comprising the Downey-Norwalk area, was granted as [[Rancho Santa Gertrudes]] to Josefa Cota, the widow of Manuel's son, Antonio Nieto.  At approximately {{convert|21,000|acre|km2}}, Santa Gertrudes was itself a sizable rancho and contained the old Nietos homestead, which was a center of social life east of the pueblo of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Charles Russell (1973). ''The History of Downey, California'' Published by Elena Quinn; copyright by City of Downey, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Mexican-American war]] concluded in 1848, many of the [[Californio]] ranchos were obtained by affluent [[English-American|Anglo-Americans]] who were immigrating west under the [[United States]] [[manifest destiny]] doctrine, and marrying into established [[Californio]] Spanish families.

Unlike most Southern California towns, Downey can claim some of its roots came from [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=Ireland&gt;[http://www.jdcjr.us/irish.html jdcjr's Irish History Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Downey was founded by and named for the former and youngest ever [[governor]] of [[California]], [[John G. Downey|John Gately Downey]], who was born in Ireland.  Although he was an Irish Democrat, he supported the Republican Lincoln in his efforts to keep the Union intact during the [[Civil War]]. He pioneered the modern subdivision with land he acquired between the [[Rio Hondo (California)|Rio Hondo]] and the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]], in about 1865.  Downey was convinced that oranges would flourish in Southern California, so he imported several varieties, and therefore set in motion what became one of the state's biggest cash crops.&lt;ref name=Ireland/&gt;  In 1935 Downey was described as an &quot;orange-grove town&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Romance &amp; History of California Ranchos. Myrtle Garrison. 1935. page 11. Harr Wagner Publishing Company, San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] arrived in 1873, and farmers in the area grew grain, corn, castor beans and fruit until around 1940.

Downey was incorporated in 1956, and instituted a charter form of government in 1964.  Suburban homes and factories replaced the farms after World War II.  The largest employer was originally [[Vultee Aircraft]], then [[North American Aviation]], (later [[North American Rockwell]], then [[Rockwell International]] which was then bought by the [[Boeing]] company) whose facilities  were the birthplace of the systems for the [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]] as well as the [[Space Shuttle]].  For over 70 years, Downey's Rockwell [[NASA]] plant produced and tested many of the 20th century's greatest aviation, missile, and space endeavors.  By the early 1970s, the facilities encompassed some {{convert|1700000|sqft|m2}} of enclosed area over more than 200 acres. But, by the early 1990s, Downey  was brutally hit by cutbacks in the defense budget. Rockwell International, who once had over 30,000 employees, had less than 5,000 in 1992. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The seventy year history of airplane and space vehicle manufacturing in Downey came to an end when the Rockwell plant closed in 1999.  The former Rockwell plant has been converted to the Downey Landing shopping complex, a [[Kaiser Permanente]] hospital, a park, a space museum and [[Downey Studios]].

Near the center of the city lies what was once one of the busiest intersections in the world, the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Firestone Boulevard (former State Route 42).  Route 19 was a major thoroughfare between [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and the port at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], and Route 42 was part of the old Spanish Trail system that connected Los Angeles to [[San Diego]].  In the 1960s the town's Downey Records achieved a small notoriety with recordings like [[The Chantays]]' surfing instrumental &quot;[[Pipeline (song)|Pipeline]]&quot;. Downey's two main public [[high school]]s are named for [[John G. Downey|Governor Downey]] and [[Earl Warren|Governor (and later, Chief Justice) Earl Warren]].  Downey is home to [[Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center]], which is the main public rehabilitation hospital for [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]].  Rancho Los Amigos is renowned worldwide for its innovative contributions to the care of [[Spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] and [[post-polio syndrome]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Downey was featured in the 2008 American action comedy film ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''.  Many of the buildings along Florence Ave. can be viewed in a driving scene early in the film. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== McDonald's restaurant===
{{main|Oldest McDonald's restaurant}}
[[Image:DowneyMcdonalds.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oldest operating McDonald's restaurant on Lakewood and Florence in Downey, California]]
The 1953 [[McDonald's]] restaurant at 10207 [[Lakewood Blvd.]] (at Florence Ave.) was the third  McDonald's built and is the oldest surviving McDonald's. It was listed on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s [[America's Most Endangered Places|1994 list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places]]. It was the second restaurant franchised by [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]], prior to the involvement of [[Ray Kroc]] in the company, and it still has the two original {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} &quot;[[Golden arches]]&quot; and a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} animated neon &quot;[[Speedee]]&quot; sign.

With low sales, damage from the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]], and the lack of a drive-up window and indoor seating, the restaurant was closed. However with both the public and preservationists demanding the restaurant be saved, McDonald's spent two years restoring the restaurant and reopened it. Customers today can visit the original restaurant and an adjoining gift shop and museum.
&lt;!--Ray Kroc DID NOT franchise this restaurant!--&gt;

===Harvey's/Johnie's Broiler===
[[Johnie's Broiler]] (originally Harvey's Broiler) was a drive-in restaurant and coffee shop, which has been in movies and sitcoms as well as TV commercials and music videos. Completed in 1958, it is an example of [[Googie]] architecture. Johnie's was well known to [[Southern California]] locals, many of which drove miles to cruise through its massive lot. In the mid-1960s, renowned author [[Tom Wolfe]] immortalized the cruising, car and fashion scene that surrounded Harvey's Broiler at the time; The article, &quot;The Hair Boys,&quot; appears in a bestselling 1968 collection of his articles titled, ''[[The Pump House Gang]]''. He made drawings of the denizens of Harvey's that appear in a later book, ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. The Broiler was a regular commercial and movie location for films such as ''[[Heat (movie)|Heat]]'', ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', ''[[Unstrung Heroes]]'', ''[[Reality Bites]]'', ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]'', ''[[Jawbreaker (movie)|Jawbreaker]]'', as well as a television episode of ''[[The X-Files]]''. Lily Tomlin played a waitress who worked at Johnie's in ''[[Short Cuts]]''. The last film shot at Johnie's was ''[[The Country Bears]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;john&quot;&gt;[http://www.johniesbroiler.net/history.htm History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The restaurant was closed in 2001, and a used car dealership leased the property. In January 2007, the leasees of Johnie's started to illegally tear it down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedowneypatriot.net/pdfs/1-12-07.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the building was halted, with extreme damage to the building, though the sign is intact.&lt;ref name=&quot;john&quot;/&gt; Tenants made significant alterations to the dining room without permits, and the City of [[Downey]] had to issue several stop work orders and citations.&lt;ref name=&quot;john&quot;/&gt;

===Bob's Big Boy===
In April 2008, Jim Louder, owner of the [[Bob's Big Boy]] restaurant in Torrance, California, entered into a long-term lease agreement with the owner of Johnie's Broiler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Long Beach Press Telegram&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Gonzaga| first = Samantha| title = Bob's Big Boy to Replace Johnie's| publisher = [[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]| date = 2008-04-08| url = http://www.presstelegram.com/ci_8857848| accessdate = 2008-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The restaurant was rebuilt as a Bob's Broiler and incorporated the surviving architectural elements of the old structure into the new restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Gonzaga| first = Samantha | title = New Future for Johnie's | publisher = [[Long Beach Press-Telegram]] | date = 2008-11-08 | url=http://www.presstelegram.com/lifestyle/dining/ci_10172183 | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob's Big Boy Broiler is now open for business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobsbigboybroiler.com/ Bob's Big Boy Broiler, Downey, California - Restaurant - Downey | Facebook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Taco Bell===

==Downey Farmers' Market==
The Downtown Downey Farmers' Market was approved by the Downey City Council in 2008.  It has rapidly blossomed into a community main attraction, with the standard fruit and vegetable stands and a growing number of food booths. It is open every Saturday from 9 AM to 1 PM on Second Street between New St. and La Reina.  The market is intended to be a community gathering place, an opportunity to purchase California-grown products, homemade tamales and a vehicle to  improve and finance Downtown Downey.

'''Anti-gang activities'''

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Downey saw an increase in gang activity.  Today there is still gang activity going in the south area of Downey.  In response, Downey formed [[GOOD (Gangs Out Of Downey)]], a community-based organization that helps encourage young people between the ages of 10-20 to stay away from gangs. GOOD is also responsible for organizing many community events and programs such as various sports, after school care, scholarship programs for at-risk students looking to attend college, and counseling for both young people and their parents. GOOD has kept a close partnership with [[Downey Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointsoflight.org/downloads/pdf/awards/dpol/DailyPOLF2002.pdf#search=%22gangs%20out%20of%20downey%22]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public libraries===
The Downey City Library serves the city. The first library in Downey was established in 1901 by a women's social club that was founded in 1898. The [[County of Los Angeles Public Library]] opened a branch in Downey in September 1915. The county branch moved several times; its final location was in the County Civic Center. In 1958 the Downey City Council voted to establish its own library and withdraw from the county system. The city library services were originally provided out of the back of a bookstore. The city library opened in the former cafeteria of the former Downey Elementary School, then being used as the city hall and police station, on July 1, 1958. A permanent library building was built on December 7, 1959. It had almost {{convert|16000|sqft|sqm}} and it was built for $186,200, costing $11.97 per square foot. It was dedicated on December 17 and opened on December 18. In February 1984 an addition of almost {{convert|12000|sqft|sqm}} was completed and dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.downeylibrary.org/about/ About the Library].&quot; Downey Public Library.
