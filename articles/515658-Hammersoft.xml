'''MTV Networks''' is a division of [[media conglomerate]] [[Viacom]] that oversees the operations of many [[television channels]] and [[Internet]] brands, including the original [[MTV]] (Music Television) channel in the [[United States]]. MTV Networks also operates MTV Networks International.

The company was established in 1984 after [[Warner Communications]] and [[American Express]] decided to divest the basic cable assets of [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]], renaming it MTV Networks, Inc. Warner-Amex originally created and owned [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], MTV, [[VH1]] and [[The Movie Channel]] (TMC). 

Viacom acquired 66% of the company in 1985, and then acquired the remaining interest in 1986. It was then folded into Viacom International Inc., a subsidiary of Viacom Inc., and is no longer a distinct legal entity.
