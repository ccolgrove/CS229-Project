''Final Fantasy: Pray'' is an arranged album of music from the first six games in the series composed by Nobuo Uematsu and arranged for vocals by Toshiro Mitsutomi, Masatsugu Shinozaki and Yoshiro Nakamura and sung by [[Risa Ohki]]. The tracks were sung in many languages, including English, French, Japanese, and Portuguese. The album covers a duration of 47:02, and was released on June 25, 1994 by [[NTT Publishing]], and subsequently re-released on October 1, 2004. The original release bears the catalog number PSCN-5006, while the re-release bears the catalog number NTCP-5006.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFPRAY&quot;/&gt; 

''Final Fantasy: Pray'' was well received by reviewers such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, who found the album to be &quot;one of the most original&quot; albums produced for the ''Final Fantasy'' series and described it as &quot;simply incredible&quot;.  He did, however, take issue with some of the lyrics, finding that when translated into English they made little sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFPRAY&quot;/&gt; Kevin Murphy of Soundtrack Central agreed, finding the arrangements to be &quot;great&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-2&quot;/&gt; Dan of Square Enix Music Online also enjoyed the album, although he found the lyrics to be &quot;nothing too special&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFVOCALSEMO&quot;/&gt;

The ''Final Fantasy Anthology'' was released by Square on October 5, 1999, and the album did not have a catalog number.  It spans 22 tracks and covers a duration of 57:27.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFANTH&quot;/&gt;

The album was poorly received by critics such as Daniel K of Soundtrack Central, who derided the track selection and declared that the album was only acceptable because it came free with the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-6&quot;/&gt; Chris of Square Enix Music Online also disliked the track selection for the album, terming it an &quot;an unworthy 'best of' selection&quot; and claiming that the album &quot;offers nothing&quot; to both casual listeners and ''Final Fantasy'' music fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-7&quot;/&gt; Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, said that while many of the best songs from the games were not included, the album was still &quot;an enjoyable listening experience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFANTH&quot;/&gt;

The album contains a selection of musical tracks from the games, arranged and remixed by Sherman F. Heinig and performed by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra and the Electric Sound Ensemble. Vocals were performed by Tamara Woodman in &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot;. It was first released on September 26, 2000 by Big Ear Music, and subsequently re-released on October 9, 2001 as ''Music Inspired By Final Fantasy'', containing an additional track, &quot;Alexandria (Vivi's Theme)&quot; from ''Final Fantasy IX'', by WB Music Corp. &quot;Alexandria&quot; was performed by KFSS Studios.

The album was poorly received by critics, with Daniel Space of RPGFan terming it a &quot;disappointment&quot; and criticizing the quality of the synthesized instruments and vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGF9499&quot;/&gt; Stahn Mahn of RPGFan was more approving, calling it &quot;average&quot;, but also disliked the synthesized instruments and the quality of the remixing.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGF9499&quot;/&gt; Chris Tilton of Soundtrack Central was more derogatory, saying that &quot;if you can name any kind of harm you can do to music, it's on this CD&quot; and was greatly disapproving of the quality of the synthesized instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-8&quot;/&gt;

''Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy'' is a recording of orchestral music from the ''Final Fantasy'' video game series. The album contains a selection of musical tracks from the games, composed by Nobuo Uematsu, arranged for orchestra by ShirÅ Hamaguchi, Sachiko Miyano, Naoshi Mizuta, Hiroyuki Nakayama, and Arnie Roth, and performed by the [[Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra]]. It was recorded in August 2007 at the [[Stockholm Concert Hall]], prior to the &quot;Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; [[concert tour]], which opened in Stockholm on December 4, 2007. The album was released on December 4, 2007 by AWR Records with the catalog number AWR-10101.  The album spans 13 tracks and covers a duration of 74:22.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFDW&quot;/&gt;

The album received mixed reviews from critics, with Patrick Gann of RPGFan saying that &quot;The recording quality is decent, the performance is standard, and it's all the classic Final Fantasy you've come to love&quot;, but expressing disappointment that the album contained only one new arrangement, with the other songs composed of arrangements originally made for other concerts.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFDW&quot;/&gt; Andre of Square Enix Music Online, however, despite also wishing for more original arrangements, felt that the quality was superb and that the album as a whole was &quot;one of life and energy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;u-20&quot;/&gt; Chris of Square Enix Music Online also praised the album, finding similar features and flaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-21&quot;/&gt;

''Final Fantasy Finest Box'' is a promotional album containing the soundtracks from ''[[Final Fantasy IV#Re-releases|Final Fantasy IV Advance]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy V#Re-releases|Final Fantasy V Advance]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VI#Game Boy Advance|Final Fantasy VI Advance]]'', all composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The ''Final Fantasy IV'' disk included several tracks which were not included in the original OST, such as the &quot;Chocobo Forest&quot; theme, the music for the dancing girl, the short intro to &quot;Cry in Sorrow/Sorrow and Loss&quot;, and various fanfares. The other two games' disks included all the same tracks as their respective OSTs, remade for the hardware of the [[Game Boy Advance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFFinestBox&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;u-22&quot;/&gt; It was offered on March 28, 2007 to 5,000 people in Japan as part of the &quot;[[List of Final Fantasy video games#Collections|Finest Fantasy for Advance]]&quot; campaign. The box set spans 183 tracks and covers a duration of 6:30:28. The album was well received by critics such as Mark Tjan of RPGFan, who praised the quality of the remade songs, though he lamented the price of the collection due to the limited release.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFFinestBox&quot;/&gt;

''Final Fantasy Remix'' is a remix album containing dance club remixes of music from games throughout the series by Ante, a DJ group composed by Ian Hartley and Matt Baggiani. It was released on August 6, 2008, by Square Enix. The release bears the catalog number SQEX-10119.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFREMIX&quot;/&gt;

The album was poorly received by critics; Patrick Gann of RPGFan said that while it was better than the previous time ''Final Fantasy'' music had been remixed in this style, in ''Final Fantasy Mix'', it was still &quot;a disappointment&quot;.  He felt that the album was full of &quot;amateur-ish mistakes that no remixer should allow&quot;, lamented the track selection, and said that several of the remixes had mistakes related to basic musical theory. Though still finding fault with them, he singled out &quot;Eternal Wind&quot; and &quot;Zanarkand&quot; as the best tracks of a poor album.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFREMIX&quot;/&gt;
