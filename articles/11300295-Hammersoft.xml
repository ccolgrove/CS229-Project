'''WQKK''' is an FM radio station operating on 106.9 MHz licensed to [[Renovo, Pennsylvania]]; the station is owned by Magnum Broadcasting. It airs an [[adult contemporary]] format branded as &quot;Y106.9&quot;.

Air personalities include Drew Shannon and Todd Brown (Mornings from 6-10am), Program Director Mike Ford (Middays from 10am-3pm), Troy Craig (Afternoons from 3-7pm), A J (Evenings from 7pm-Midnight) and Glennie B (Overnights from Midnight to 6am). 

Diana Stapleford serves as General Manager and Sam Jordan is Operations Manager along with staff led by Glennie B and Tracy D.

When not simulcasting WQCK, 106.9 WQKK carries NASCAR Sprint Cup action and select high school sporting events.

106.9 was previously a Hot Adult Contemporary station known as Y106.9 from 1996 until 2004; the station changed ownership and on January 1 2005 became &quot;106.9 The Surge&quot; adopting a rock format. In May 2008 the rock format was dropped in favor of a simulcast of Country sister station 105.9 WJOW (105.9 Joe FM). In March 2009 the format was adjusted to a mix of Country and Classic Rock with the moniker &quot;Rockin' Country 105.9/106.9 Joe FM. The current rock format was instituted in September 2009. The call sign WQKK was requested and assigned in October 2009.

In addition to its main signal WQKK operates a 20 watt on-channel booster station, known as WQKK-FM1, also licensed to Renovo, Pennsylvania.

On October 28, 2011 WQKK split from its simulcast with WQCK, changed format to soft adult contemporary and returned to using the brand &quot;Y106.9&quot;.
