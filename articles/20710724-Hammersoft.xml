The '''1989 Houston Cougars football team''', also known as the '''Houston Cougars''', '''Houston''', or '''UH''', represented the [[University of Houston]] in the [[1989 NCAA Division I-A football season]].  It was the 44th year of season play for Houston.  The team was coached by third-year head coach [[Jack Pardee]].  Serving as offensive coordinator was [[John Jenkins (American football)|John Jenkins]], who would later serve in the capacity of head coach the next season.  The team played its games off-campus at the [[Astrodome]], which had recently received upgrades to seat 62,439 spectators.  The Cougars finished the season ranked as #14 by the [[AP Poll]].  Houston quarterback [[Andre Ware]] won the [[Heisman Trophy]] and [[Davey O'Brien Award]] following the conclusion of the season.  Under probation by the [[NCAA]] from rules violated in prior seasons, Houston was disallowed from participating in a [[bowl game]], television appearances, and the [[Coaches' Poll]].
   
==Regular season==
[[Andre Ware]] became the first black quarterback to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1989, along with the [[Davey O'Brien Award]], the latter award given to the most outstanding college quarterback of the year. That year, his junior year, he threw for 4,699 yards, 44 touchdowns, and set 26 [[NCAA]] records.  Many of the records were thanks to the innovative use of the [[Run &amp; Shoot]] offense, which his successor, [[David Klingler]], also used to great effect.  The Cougars ended the season ranked the #14 team in the nation by the [[Associated Press]]. He then declared for the [[NFL Draft]], foregoing his senior year.
