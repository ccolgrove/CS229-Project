The '''United States gubernatorial elections of 2008''' were the elections of state and territorial governors and were held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008 in 11 states and 2 territories. Prior to the election, eight of the total seats were held by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and five by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Two governors were prohibited by [[term limit]]s from seeking re-election in 2008.

These elections coincided with the [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential election]], as well as the elections of the [[United States Senate elections, 2008|United States Senate]] and the [[United States House elections, 2008|United States House of Representatives]] and countless local elections, state elections and ballot propositions.

===Retired Democratic governors===
====Ruth Ann Minner (Delaware)====
{{main|Delaware gubernatorial election, 2008}}

[[Ruth Ann Minner]] was term limited in 2008.  As of [[2008]], Democrats have controlled the [[Delaware]] governorship for 16 years. In an upset, state Treasurer [[Jack A. Markell|Jack Markell]] defeated Lieutenant Governor [[John C. Carney, Jr.|John Carney]] by 51 to 49% for the Democratic nomination on [[September 9]]. The Republican nominee was former state Superior Court Judge [[William Swain Lee|William Swain &quot;Bill&quot; Lee]], defeating airline pilot Michael Protrack. Lee was the Republican nominee for Governor in 2004, and lost to Minner by a narrow margin.

The race got more attention due to the Vice Presidential candidacy of [[U.S. Senator]] [[Joe Biden]].  Since Biden, a senator, was elected to be [[Vice President]], he needed to resign his Senate seat. The new Governor was then called upon to appoint someone to replace Biden in the Senate. Since Lee would naturally have been more inclined to select a Republican, his election could have caused a Republican pickup in the Senate by proxy. However, he was defeated by a wide margin on election day by Markell. Senator Biden resigned his seat in the United States Senate on January 15, 2009, and Governor Minner appointed [[Ted Kaufman]] to Biden's seat. Kaufman had previously served as Senator Biden's Chief of Staff during his tenure in the [[United States Senate]].

====Mike Easley (North Carolina)====
{{main|North Carolina gubernatorial election, 2008}}

[[Mike Easley]] was term limited in 2008, in another state whose Governorship has been held by Democrats for 16 years. Democratic Lieutenant Governor [[Beverly Perdue]] was the Democratic nominee, defeating [[Charlotte]] Mayor [[Pat McCrory]], the Republican nominee.

===Retired Republican governors===
====Matt Blunt (Missouri)====
{{main|Missouri gubernatorial election, 2008}}

[[Matt Blunt]] was considered to be the most vulnerable incumbent in the 2008 election cycle, but decided on January 22, 2008 not to seek re-election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mattblunt.com/news/Read.aspx?ID=298 MattBlunt.com - Governor Matt Blunt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Blunt's approval rating was the nation's second-lowest after Governor Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky for much of 2007, though his approval rating improved and approached 50% in a May poll conducted by SurveyUSA.

The Republican nominee was Congressman [[Kenny Hulshof]]. The Democratic nominee was four-term [[Missouri]] Attorney General [[Jay Nixon]], who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1998. Nixon defeated Hulshof comfortably, despite the fact that Missouri ultimately voted for [[John McCain]], a Republican, for President. Missouri was the only state not to re-elect the incumbent party for Governor in 2008.

===Democratic incumbents===
====Togiola Tulafono (American Samoa)====
{{main|American Samoa gubernatorial election, 2008}}

[[American Samoa]]'s [[Togiola Tulafono]] sought re-election in 2008 with [[Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia]]. He won his first term 55.7% to 44.3% in the 2004 run-off against [[Afoa Moega Lutu]].&lt;ref name=snn&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=CSC graduate wins runoff election in American Samoa |url=http://www.swnebr.net/newspaper/cgi-bin/articles/articlearchiver.pl?156685|work=[[Southwest Nebraska News]] |publisher=|date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulafono was again challenged by [[Afoa Moega Lutu]] and [[Velega Savali]], who ran as a [[nonpartisan]] team for governor and lieutenant governor respectively.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Togiola, Ipulasi Announce Re-election Bid |url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/05/11/togiola-ipulasi-announce-re-election-bid|work=[[Pacific Magazine]] |publisher=|date=2008-05-11 |accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Utu Abe Malae]] and [[Tuika Tuika]] also ran to become the next Governor on separate, nonpartisan tickets.&lt;ref name=pacm&gt;{{cite news |first=Fili|last=Sagapolutele |title=17,000 Registered Voters Ready For The Polls In American Samoa|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/10/31/17000-registered-voters-ready-for-the-polls-in-asamoa|work=[[Pacific Magazine]]|publisher= |date=2008-11-31 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulafono won in a close vote that split three ways.

====Brian Schweitzer (Montana)====
{{main|Montana gubernatorial election, 2008}}

Democrat [[Brian Schweitzer]] of [[Montana]] (running with Lt. Governor [[John Bohlinger]]) was heavily favored to win re-election as he had better funding and high approval ratings as current Governor. The Republican nominee was State Senator [[Roy Brown (Montana politician)|Roy Brown]] (running with [[Steve Gaines]]), and the Libertarian nominee was Stan Jones (running with Michael Baker).[1]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2008/01/25/election/state/mt69.txt Missoulian: Sen. Roy Brown to seek Republican nomination for governor&lt;br&gt;Posted on Oct. 30&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Schweitzer won some press coverage with his well-received speech to the 2008 Democratic National Convention [http://blogs.forbes.com/trailwatch/2008/08/schweitzer-spee.html].  He was criticized, however, for a speech in July in which he jested that he helped defeat U.S. Senator [[Conrad Burns]] in 2006 by tampering with the vote totals [http://www.helenair.com/articles/2008/09/11/top/55st_080911_tampering.txt], which he insisted was purely a joke. Schweitzer won re-election by a comfortable margin despite the criticism.

====John Lynch (New Hampshire)====
{{main|New Hampshire gubernatorial election, 2008}}

In [[New Hampshire]], Democrat [[John H. Lynch|John Lynch]] easily won re-election against State Senator [[Joseph D. Kenney]], the Republican nominee.[http://www.kenney08.com/]

'''NOTE''': New Hampshire's gubernatorial elections are held every in alternate (even-numbered) years, instead of every fourth year.

====AnÃ­bal Acevedo VilÃ¡ (Puerto Rico)====
{{main|Puerto Rico gubernatorial election, 2008}}
[[AnÃ­bal Acevedo VilÃ¡]] of [[Puerto Rico]] ran for a second term in 2008. In 2004, Acevedo narrowly beat former Governor and Senator [[Pedro RossellÃ³]], also a Democrat, by a mere 3,566 votes.

Republican at-large [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]] [[Luis FortuÃ±o]], who announced in December 2006 that he would not again seek re-election to his current post, ran against him. There was also a movement to elect Senator RossellÃ³ as a write-in choice for governor.

The [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]]'s candidate was [[Edwin Irizarry Mora]], while a fourth candidate, [[Rogelio Figueroa]] ([[Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party]]), ran on an environmentalist platform.

Acevedo was defeated by FortuÃ±o on election day. The federal indictment against Acevedo for alleged corruption schemes when he was in Congress, and generally low approval, may have been a drag on his candidacy and chances of winning re-election.

====Christine Gregoire (Washington)====
{{main|Washington gubernatorial election, 2008}}

Democrat [[Christine Gregoire]] ([http://www.chrisgregoire.com/ campaign website]) is perhaps best known for having won in [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2004|2004]] by 133 votes in the third official count, after having lost the initial count by 261 votes and the first recount by 24 votes. Her 2004 opponent, Republican former State Senator [[Dino Rossi]] ([http://www.dinorossi.com/ campaign website]), officially announced his candidacy on October 25, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2003968578_rossi23m.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Rossi due to make rematch official | first=Andrew | last=Garber | date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-election SurveyUSA polls showed Gregoire leading Rossi by a statistically insignificant 50% to 47% margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=9f4931dd-b0c7-4b2e-a5f2-e864ca429614 SurveyUSA Election Poll #13982&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A September 10 poll by Rasmussen Reports showed Rossi pulling ahead by a 52% to 46% margin [http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_governor_elections/washington/election_2008_washington_governor]. The race was expected to be extremely close, but Gregoire was reelected by a wider than expected margin of 7.44%.&lt;ref&gt;http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2008&amp;fips=53&amp;off=5&amp;f=0&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joe Manchin (West Virginia)====
{{main|West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2008}}

Democrat [[Joe Manchin]] ran for re-election in [[West Virginia]] and was heavily favored according to pre-election polls. On November 4, he faced former State Senator [[Russ Weeks]], a Republican, and [[Mountain Party]] candidate Jesse Johnson, who ran in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics1.com/wv.htm Politics1 - Online Guide to West Virginia Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Butch Paugh of the Constitution Party also attempted a run but failed to qualify for the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/05/18/constitution-party-west-virginia-petition/ Ballot Access News Â» Blog Archive Â» Constitution Party West Virginia Petition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin won re-election by a landslide.

===Republican incumbents===
====Mitch Daniels (Indiana)====
{{main|Indiana gubernatorial election, 2008}}
Incumbent Republican [[Mitch Daniels]] ([http://www.mymanmitch.com/ campaign website]) faced Democratic nominee former Congresswoman and Undersecretary of Agriculture [[Jill Long Thompson]] ([http://hoosiersforjill.com/ campaign website]), and Libertarian nominee engineer [[Andy Horning]] ([http://www.horningforgovernor.com/ campaign website]) who also ran for Governor in 2000.

Some pundits thought Mitch Daniels was vulnerable in 2008, but polling taken by SurveyUSA on October 21 and 22, 2008 showed Daniels with a significant 54-35 lead. Daniels won re-election easily, confirming these predictions.

While Indiana had not voted Democratic for President since 1964, Daniels was the first Republican elected governor in 16 years there. Daniels was also endorsed by the state's largest newspapers, the [[Indianapolis Star]], the [[Evansville Courier &amp; Press]], the [[Fort Wayne Journal Gazette]], The [[Times of Northwest Indiana]], the [[Gary Post-Tribune]] and the [[Louisville Courier-Journal]].

====John Hoeven (North Dakota)====
{{main|North Dakota gubernatorial election, 2008}}

Republican [[John Hoeven]] announced he would seek re-election for a third term in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoevengovernor.com/ Hoeven for Governor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Hoeven won re-election with 74% of the vote.  Soundly defeating the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, [[North Dakota Senate|State Senator]] [[Tim Mathern]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathern.org/ Mathern&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (24%) and independent candidate DuWayne Hendrickson (2%).

====Jon Huntsman, Jr. (Utah)====
{{main|Utah gubernatorial election, 2008}}

[[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]] was heavily favored to win re-election in [[Utah]]. As of 2008, Republicans have controlled the Utah governorship for 24 years. Democrat [[Bob Springmeyer]] challenged Huntsman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin.sltrib.com/news/ci_8529731 A daunting task: Springmeyer to challenge popular Gov. Huntsman - Salt Lake Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but was decisively defeated.

====Jim Douglas (Vermont)====
{{main|Vermont gubernatorial election, 2008}}

Three-term incumbent [[Jim Douglas]] ran as a Republican, and House Speaker [[Gaye Symington]] ran as a Democrat. Other candidates included [[Anthony Pollina]] of the [[Vermont Progressive Party]] and [[Cris Ericson]] of the [[United States Marijuana Party|Marijuana Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics1.com/vt.htm Politics1 - Online Guide to Vermont Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas was re-elected.

==Total Results==
At the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 Elections]], all 55 governorships of the states and territories were occupied. However, in the 2008 election cycle, only thirteen seats were up for election- eleven were statewide, and two were territorial. Eight seats were held by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and the remaining five were held by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Each state/territory elects its own governor separately, so the number of seats won are not based on proportional share of the vote. Here is the summary of results.
