The '''David Whitney Building''' is a historic class-A [[skyscraper]] on the northern edge of [[downtown]] [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It is located at 1553 [[Woodward Avenue]], adjacent to [[Grand Circus Park (Detroit)|Grand Circus Park]]. The building stands on a wedge-shaped site at the junction of Park Avenue, [[Woodward Avenue]], and Washington Boulevard. Construction on the 19-floor structure began in 1914. It is currently unused and awaiting redevelopment.

It is named for [[David Whitney Jr.]], a wealthy Detroiter who earned millions of dollars as a lumber baron dealing in [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]]; his father was said to be the employer of [[Paul Bunyan (lumberjack)|Paul Bunyan]]. Famed [[Chicago]]-[[architect]] [[Daniel Burnham]] designed the Whitney. Appropriately for Detroit, the exterior was originally styled with clean lines in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style faced with [[terra cotta]] and glazed brick.  The original [[facade]] was altered in 1959 when decorative cornices were replaced with a 'modern' top. The first four stories of this building contain a large retail [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. It was one of Detroit's first major [[mixed-use]] projects and was a popular location for many medical offices. The [[Detroit People Mover]]'s [[Grand Circus Park (Detroit People Mover)|Grand Circus Park station]] is located at the first and second floors of this building. 

It stands across Woodward Avenue from the [[David Broderick Tower]].  The building is visible from the Detroit [[People mover|People Mover]], as well as [[Comerica Park]]. Together with the adjacent  Broderick Tower, it forms a &quot;gateway&quot; of sorts to downtown Detroit when viewed from the north. The ''[[Metro Times]]'', an early [[alternative weekly]], once published from offices in the highrise.  There are 19 floors housing office and retail space with a two-story mechanical penthouse at the rear of the building.

In January 2011, the Detroit Downtown Development Authority approved a $1 million loan to help Whitney Partners purchase and renovate the building.  Their plan includes creating a mixed-use building and restoring the decorative exterior elements that were removed in 1959 and the four-story lobby.  The partnership is still finalizing plans and financing for the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;freep&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=DDA approves mixed-use plan to renovate the Whitney Building| author=John Gallagher| work=Detroit Free Press| publisher=freep.com| url=  http://www.freep.com/article/20110113/BUSINESS04/101130554/1322/DDA-approves-mixed-use-plan-to-renovate-Whitney-Building| date=January 13, 2011| accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
