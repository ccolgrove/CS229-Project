'''GTK+''' ([[GIMP]] Toolkit) is a [[cross-platform]] [[widget toolkit]] for creating [[graphical user interface]]s. It is licensed under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU LGPL]], allowing both [[Free software|free]] and [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] software to use it. It is one of the most popular toolkits for the [[X Window System]], along with [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]].{{Whom?|date=July 2011}}

The name GTK+ originates from '''GTK'''; the plus was added to distinguish an enhanced version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-faq/stable/x90.html | title = What is the + in GTK+? }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally created for the [[GNU Image Manipulation Program]] (GIMP), a [[free software]] [[raster graphics editor]], in 1997 by [[Spencer Kimball]] and [[Peter Mattis]], members of [[eXperimental Computing Facility]] (XCF) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It is now maintained by members of the [[GNOME Foundation]].

==Design==
GTK+ is an [[object-oriented]] [[widget toolkit]] written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]; object-orientation is achieved by using the [[GObject|GLib object system]]. On the X11 display server, GTK+ uses [[Xlib]] to draw widgets. Using Xlib provides flexibility and allows GTK+ to be used on platforms where the [[X Window System]] is unavailable. While GTK+ is primarily targeted at the [[X Window System]], other platforms are supported, including [[Microsoft Windows]] (interfaced with the [[Windows API]]), and [[Mac OS X]] (interfaced with [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]]). [[HTML5]] and [[Wayland (display server)|Wayland]] backends are in development.

GTK+ can be configured to change the look of the widgets drawn; this is done using different '''display engines'''. Several display engines exist which try to emulate the look of the native widgets on the platform in use.

===Programming language bindings===
A library written in one programming language may be used in another programming language if [[Language binding|bindings]] are written; GTK+ has bindings in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtk.org/language-bindings.php GTK+ Language Bindings]&lt;/ref&gt;

===GUI designers===
There were several attempts to create a [[Graphical user interface builder|GUI designer]] for GTK+. The following projects are active as of July 2011:
* [[Glade Interface Designer|Glade]], supports '''GtkBuilder''', which is a GTK+ built-in GUI description format.
* [http://nothing-personal.googlecode.com/ Crow Designer], relies on its own '''GuiXml''' format and '''GuiLoader''' library.
* [[Stetic]], part of MonoDevelop, oriented towards [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]].

==History==
GTK+ was originally designed and used in the [[GIMP|GNU Image Manipulation Program]] (GIMP) as a replacement of the [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] toolkit; at some point [[Peter Mattis]] became disenchanted with Motif and began to write his own GUI toolkit called the GIMP toolkit and had successfully replaced Motif by the 0.60 release of GIMP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19990417052141/http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-01/lw-01-gimp.html LinuxWorld - Where did Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis go?]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally GTK was re-written to be object oriented and was renamed GTK+. This was first used in the 0.99 release of GIMP.

The GTK+ 2.0.0 release series introduced new features which include improved text rendering using [[Pango]], a new [[theme engine]], improved accessibility using the [[Accessibility Toolkit]], complete transition to [[Unicode]] using [[UTF-8]] strings, and a more flexible API.  Starting with version 2.8, GTK+ 2 depends on the [[cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] graphics library for rendering vector graphics in GTK+ 2.

GTK+ version 3.0.0 included revised input device handling, support for [[Theme (computing)|themes]] written with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]-like syntax, and the ability to receive information about other opened GTK+ applications.

===Future developments===
''Project Ridley'' is an attempt to consolidate several libraries that are currently external to GTK+, including libgnome, libgnomeui, libgnomeprint22, libgnomeprintui22, libglade, libgnomecanvas, libegg, libeel, gtkglext, and libsexy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.gnome.org/ProjectRidley ProjectRidley - GNOME Live!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers are also considering new directions for the library, including removing deprecated [[Application programming interface|API]] components and adding an integrated [[scene graph]] system, similar to the [[Clutter (computing)|Clutter]] graphics library, effectively integrating GTK+ with [[OpenGL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2008/03/gtk-hackfest-20.html Alberto Ruiz's Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2008-March/msg00017.html Havoc Pennington's scene graph proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Development and design of the GTK+ 3 release of the toolkit started in February 2009 during the GTK+ Theming Hackfest held in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2009/02/gtk-30-theming.html Alberto Ruiz Hackfest announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;  A first draft of the development roadmap has been released on 9 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://testbit.eu/~timj/blogstuff/GtkRoadmap3Draft2.html Gtk+ 3 roadmap draft]&lt;/ref&gt;

==GTK+ hello world==
The following is a graphical GTK+ [[Hello world program|hello world]] program in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. This program has a window with the title &quot;Hello, world!&quot; and a label with similar text.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *label;

    gtk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

    /* Create the main, top level window */
    window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);

    /* Give it the title */
    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), &quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

    /*
    ** Map the destroy signal of the window to gtk_main_quit;
    ** When the window is about to be destroyed, we get a notification and
    ** stop the main GTK+ loop by returning 0
    */
    g_signal_connect(window, &quot;destroy&quot;, G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);

    /*
    ** Assign the variable &quot;label&quot; to a new GTK label,
    ** with the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
    */
    label = gtk_label_new(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

    /* Plot the label onto the main window */
    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), label);

    /* Make sure that everything, window and label, are visible */
    gtk_widget_show_all(window);

    /*
    ** Start the main loop, and do nothing (block) until
    ** the application is closed
    */
    gtk_main();

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Using [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[pkg-config]] in a [[Unix shell]], this code can be compiled with the following command (assume above source has file name &quot;helloworld.c&quot;):

&lt;code&gt;
$ gcc -Wall helloworld.c -o helloworld `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`
&lt;/code&gt;

===GTK+ example using Vala instead of C===

To create a &quot;Hello World&quot; program in [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]] instead of C, do the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vala&quot;&gt;
using Gtk;

int main (string[] args) {
    Gtk.init (ref args);

    var window = new Window ();
    window.title = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
    window.border_width = 10;
    window.window_position = WindowPosition.CENTER;
    window.set_default_size (350, 70);
    window.destroy.connect (Gtk.main_quit);

    var label = new Label (&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);

    window.add (label);
    window.show_all();

    Gtk.main();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:GIMP2.4-English.png|thumb|Screenshot of [[GIMP]] 2.4. GTK+ is responsible for managing the interface components of the program, including the menus, buttons, and input fields.]]

; Environments that use GTK+
* [[GNOME]] is based on GTK+, meaning that programs native to GNOME use GTK+
* [[Xfce]] is based on GTK+
* [[LXDE]] (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is based on GTK+
* [[ROX Desktop]] is a lightweight desktop, with features from the [[GUI]] of [[RISC OS]]
* [[GPE Palmtop Environment]]
* [[Access Linux Platform]] (successor of the [[Palm OS]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] platform)
* [[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]] is a desktop environment oriented on helping children learn, which uses GTK+ and [[PyGTK]]
* [[KDE]], though based on Qt, has integration with GTK+-based programs and themes (since version 4.2).

GTK+ programs do not require a [[desktop environment]] made with GTK+. If the required libraries are installed, a GTK+ program can run on top of other X11-based desktop environments or window managers; this includes [[Mac OS X]] if [[X11.app]] is installed (which is the default since the Leopard release). GTK+ can also run under [[Microsoft Windows]], where it is used by some popular cross-platform applications like [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] and GIMP. [[wxWidgets]], a cross-platform GUI toolkit, uses GTK+ for Unix-like operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/WxWidgets_Compared_To_Other_Toolkits#GTK.2B work = WxWidgets Compared To Other Toolkits | title = GTK+ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ports include [[DirectFB]] (used by the [[Debian-Installer|Debian installer]], for example) and [[ncurses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/26/2042206 |title=GTK+ TTY Port |publisher=Slashdot |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
