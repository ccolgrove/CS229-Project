'''Lee Sungmin''' ì´ì±ë¯¼ (born January 1, 1986), or most commonly known as '''Sungmin''' ì±ë¯¼, is a [[South Korean idol]] [[singer]] and actor. He is one of the four lead vocalists and one of the main dancer of the [[South Korean]] boy band [[Super Junior]]. He is also a member of [[Super Junior]] subgroup [[Super Junior-T]], [[Super Junior-H]] and recently became a member of [[Super Junior-M]] alongside [[Eunhyuk]]. He is known to be a delicate yet strong, feminine yet manly, sexy yet cute type of man. Fans normally refer to '''Sungmin''' as ' sweet pumpkin', ([[Korean language|Korean]] danhobak ë¨í¸ë°) because of a line he had to recite in MBC Drama âSea of Sisters&quot;, and 'aegyo king' due to his baby-face and cuteness.

==Biography==
Sungmin was born in the Hogae district of [[Anyang]], [[Gyeonggi]]. He has a younger brother, Lee Sungjin.&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superjunior.smtown.com|title=Super Junior's Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the 2001 ''SM Youth Best Contest'' and jointly won first place for the Best Outward Appearance award with future band mate [[Lee Donghae|Donghae]]. Together, they signed a contract with [[SM Entertainment]] and began to receive training in singing, dancing, and acting.

In 2002, Sungmin was briefly placed in a project R&amp;B group with [[Xiah]] and future band mate [[Eunhyuk]]. Along with Typhoon, Rose and Attack, the six of them made their first television appearance in a show called ''Heejun vs. Kangta, Battle of the Century: Pop vs. Rock'' [[Moon Hee Jun|Moon Hee-jun]] taught Typhoon, Rose and Attack on how to properly sing [[rock (music)|rock]] while Sungmin, Xiah, and Eunhyuk were taught other singing techniques by [[Kangta]]. The six trainees quickly separated a year later, however, when Typhoon, Rose, and Attack debuted as member of rock band [[TRAX (band)|TRAX]] and Xiah debuted as a member of [[TVXQ]]. Both Sungmin and Eunhyuk joined ten other trainees and formed the group Super Junior 05, being the first generation of the rotational boy band Super Junior.

==Career==
===Super Junior===
{{See also|Super Junior#Musical career|l1=Super Junior's musical career}}
Super Junior 05 officially debuted on November 6, 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS's]] music program ''Popular Songs'', performing their first single, &quot;[[TWINS (Knock Out)]]&quot;. Their debut performance attracted over 500 fans and also garnered oversea viewers from both China and Japan. A full studio album was released a month later, which debuted at #3 on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005twins&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Album Sales of December 2005 | date= | work=Recording Industry Association of Korea | pages=1 | url=http://www.miak.or.kr/stat/kpop_200512.htm | accessdate=2007-10-16 | language=Korean}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. The group dropped the suffix &quot;05&quot; and became officially credited as Super Junior.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} Sina.com. [http://ent.sina.com.cn/y/2006-05-24/16371091920.html Super Junior adds new member, transformed into 13-person super group] May 24, 2006.Retrieved May 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-polished group hit big after they released their first CD single &quot;[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]&quot; the following summer, which became Super Junior's most successful single in the music charts until the release of &quot;[[Sorry, Sorry (song)|Sorry, Sorry]]&quot; in March 2009.

During his career with Super Junior, Sungmin has been put into three subgroups, smaller groups that are branched off of the larger main group. In February 2007, Sungmin was placed in the [[trot (music)|trot]]-singing [[Super Junior-T]]. A year later, he became a member of [[Super Junior-Happy]]. In 2011, he was also placed as one of the two new members of [[Super Junior-M]] along with [[Eunhyuk]].

And around the first half of June 2011, Super Junior went back to the recording studio to prepare for their upcoming 5th album that ELFs all over the world are looking forward to .

During the last 2 weeks of July 2011, SM Entertainment started releasing different teaser images of Super Junior for their new album. They started with Eunhyuk, followed by Donghae, Leeteuk, Kyuhyun, Shindong, Sungmin, Ryeowook, Yesung, Siwon and then, Heechul. They released their new Teaser for their new single, Mr. Simple, last August 1, 2011. The songs was then released online through Naver, Soribada, Mnet etc. on August 2, 2011, followed by the release of their new album on August 3, 2011. And on August 4, they held a press conference followed by the release of their new music video. 

On August 22, 2011, Super Junior released Version B of their Mr. Simple album. The concept for this one is a lot different from their Version A. They had the military concept in their photoshoot. This version has song SUPERMAN which they sang during their comeback stage that got fans hooked. You get to hear Sungmin and the rest of the Super Junior sing in a low key.

On September 21, 2011, Super Junior released C vercion of their 5th album which includes 4 new tracks. A-cha, which would be the new single.

Last October 13, 2011, SM Entertainment released the tickets which will kick off Super Junior's Super Show 4 WORLD TOUR at the Seoul Olympic Stadium in November. The tickets were sold up in less than 8 minutes. The confirmed cities, so far, that they will be visiting are, Osaka, Beijing, Taipei, Bangkok and Singapore.

===Acting===
Sungmin played young Kang Dong-shin in the MBC drama ''[[Sisters of the Sea]]'' in early 2005, right before the debut of Super Junior. A year later, Sungmin guest starred in SBS's Banjun Theatre drama ''[[Banjun Theater#Finding Lost Time|Finding Lost Time]]'' and played [[Micky (singer)|Micky's]] high school friend. 

Sungmin's first big-scale film was the Super Junior film ''[[Attack on the Pin-Up Boys]]'', an SM Pictures production that premiered for the first time in July 2007. He played the role of a pretty school boy who later gets attacked by an unknown criminal. 

In early 2008, Sungmin participated in a short half-hour drama ''[[Super Junior Unbelievable Story]]'' with [[Leeteuk]]. Sungmin starred as himself, a member of the popular group [[Super Junior-T]] who is constantly overshadowed by his members. 

In 2009, he was casted in the musical &quot;Akilla&quot; starring as the main lead, Ro. 

In 2010, he was casted in the musical &quot;Hongildong&quot; starring as the main lead, Hongildong, alongside fellow bandmate [[Yesung]]. 

SM Entertainment recently announced that Sungmin was cast in the KBS drama &quot;President&quot; as Jang Sungmin, the ambitious son of Jang Il Joon the president. The drama will air on December 15, 2010 in KBS2-TV.

And just recently, he performed as Daniel in the musical &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; that was staged on July 7, 2011. The last day of his performance as Daniel was on August 10, 2011 at the matinee show. His family (parents and sungjin), Fellow Super Junior member Cho Kyuhyun, Dong Bang Shin Ki's Shim Changmin and F(x)'s Amber were all there to give him support.

===MC===
Sungmin replaced band mate [[Kangin]] as one of the key [[DJ]]s of ''Reckless Radio'' and was hosting it with Sooyoung of [[Girls' Generation]] in the later half of 2007. On February 3, 2008, Sooyoung's band mate Sunny replaced her position. The program ended in late July 2008.

===Other activities===
In October 2010, Sungmin was one of the twenty idols from different South Korean groups that recorded the song, &quot;Let's Go&quot;, for the purpose of increasing public participation in the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit]]. He provided vocals along with labelmates [[Seohyun]], [[Jonghyun]] and [[Luna (singer)|Luna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/2010/09/20-idol-singers-unite-to-sing-the-g20-seoul-summit-theme-song|title=20 idol singers unite to sing the G20 Seoul Summit theme song|date=September 30, 2010|publisher=allkpop.com|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concert===
Sungmin has been in three concerts of Super Junior already. All where sold out and had the chance to showcase his abilities through his solo segments on the said concert. Super Junior's Super Show were all sold out in Asia that they are thinking of expanding it into a world tour.

And just recently, they have concluded SM Town in Paris. The first KPOP concert held in Paris, France that surprised them on how warm the reception of the French were to them.

With the release of their 5th album, Mr. Simple, another concert is in the works but, it was informed on their press conference on the 4th of August that there won't be an Asian tour but will be replaced with a world tour.

===Twitter===
Last August 9, 2011, a user with the tweet ID &quot;Mystericsmile&quot; came out on twitter and claimed to be Sungmin's official twitter account. But, later that day, Sungjin, Sungmin's younger brother officially announced that his brother doesn't have any twitter account and that the user &quot;mystericsmile&quot; was a fake. He also stated that this was the reason why his brother doesn't like twitter.

Sungmin used to have an account under the ID, &quot;myblacksmile&quot; but he removed it after a couple of months and also, he removed his cyworld for unspecified reasons. He continues to update his fans through his me2day account.
