The '''Freedom and Justice Party''' ({{Lang-ar|Ø­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ­Ø±ÙØ© ÙØ§ÙØ¹Ø¯Ø§ÙØ©}} , ''á¸¤izb al-á¸¥urriya wa al-âadala''), is an [[Islamism|Islamist]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Islamism1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Islamism2&quot;/&gt; [[political party]] in [[Egypt]]. The party is nominally independent but has strong links to the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt]], the largest and best organized political group in Egypt. It has stated that it plans to run candidate in just under half of all constituencies in the upcoming parliamentary election.&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt; 

== History ==
The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] announced on 21 February 2011, in the aftermath of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], that it intended to found the Freedom and Justice Party, set to be led by Dr. Saad Ketatni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/muslim-brotherhood-establish-freedom-and-justice-party Muslim Brotherhood to establish 'Freedom and Justice Party' | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=28088 Ikhwanweb :: The Muslim Brotherhood Official English Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=209563&amp;R=R3 Muslim Brotherhood sits at Egyptâs new democratic table&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was officially founded on 30 April 2011, and it was announced that it would contest up to half the seats in the upcoming [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary election]]. The Muslim Brotherhoodâs legislative body appointed Mohamed Morsy as president of the Freedom and Justice Party, Essam al-Erian as vice president and Saad al-Katatny as secretary general.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/418600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13249434&lt;/ref&gt; The three are former members of the Muslim Brotherhood &quot;Guidance Office&quot; or ''Maktab al-Irshad'', the highest level body of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref name=Trager&gt;''Foreign Affairs magazine'', September October 2011, &quot;The Unbreakable Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, by Eric Trager, p.114-222 (full text not available for free on internet)&lt;/ref&gt;

The party is expected to win &quot;the vast majority&quot; of the seats that it contests in the 2011 parliamentary election -- i.e. just under half of the seats in parliament -- as &quot;no other party&quot; has &quot;anything close to the network of committed supporters&quot; that it has. In addition the MB is working with independent candidates promising them support.&lt;ref name=Trager&gt;''Foreign Affairs magazine'', September October 2011, &quot;The Unbreakable Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, by Eric Trager, p.114-222&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Political platform ==
On launching the new party, the Muslim Brotherhood confirmed that it does not object to women or [[Copts]] in a ministerial post (cabinet),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=28077 MB announces establishment of political party: Freedom and Justice]. ''IkhwanWeb''. 2011-02-21.[[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;/ref&gt; although it deems both &quot;unsuitable&quot; for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/352738 Brotherhood sticks to ban on Christians and women for presidency]| 14 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The group supports free-market [[capitalism]], but without &quot;manipulation or monopoly&quot;. The partyâs political program would include tourism as a main source of national income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/328074 Al-Arian: Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party to be based on Islamic Law]. ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]''. 2011-02-23. Al-Masry Al-Youm.&lt;/ref&gt; The Freedom and Justice Party will be based on [[Sharia|Islamic law]], &quot;but will be acceptable to a wide segment of the population,&quot; said leading MB member Essam al-Arian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/328074&lt;/ref&gt; The partyâs membership will be open to all Egyptians who accept the terms of its program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/6119/Egypt/Politics-/MB-form-Freedom-and-Justice-political-party.aspx MB form 'Freedom and Justice' political party]. ''Ahram''. 2011-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesperson for the party said that &quot;when we talk about the slogans of the revolution â freedom, social justice, equality â all of these are in the [[Sharia]] (Islamic law).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/23/138826.html Muslim Brothers see corruption-free Egypt flourishing].
