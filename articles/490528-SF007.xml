'''VLC media player''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open source]] [[media player (application software)|media player]] and [[multimedia framework]] written by the [[VideoLAN]] project.

VLC is a [[porting|portable]] multimedia player, encoder, and streamer supporting many audio and video [[codec]]s and [[file format]]s as well as [[DVD]]s, [[video CD|VCDs]], and various [[streaming media|streaming]] [[communications protocol|protocols]]. It is able to stream over [[computer network|networks]] and to transcode multimedia files and save them into various formats. ''VLC'' used to stand for ''VideoLAN Client'', but since VLC is no longer simply a client, that [[initialism]] no longer applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2006/11/23/VLC-Name | title=VLC Name | author=Jean-Baptiste Kempf | date=November 23, 2006 | work=Yet another blog for JBKempf | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wiki.videolan.org/Intellectual_Properties#Names_.2F_Trademark | title=Intellectual Properties | author=VideoLAN Team | work=VideoLAN Wiki | accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[cross-platform]] media player, with versions for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[BeOS]], [[MorphOS]], [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], and [[eComStation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;playback_features&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default distribution of VLC includes a large number of [[free software|free]] decoding and encoding libraries, avoiding the need for finding/calibrating proprietary plugins. Many of VLC's [[codec]]s are provided by the [[libavcodec]] library from the [[FFmpeg]] project, but it uses mainly its own [[muxer]] and demuxers. It also gained distinction as the first player to support playback of encrypted DVDs on Linux by using the [[libdvdcss]] DVD decryption library.

==History==
The VideoLan project was originally started as an academic project in 1996. It was intended to consist of a client and server to stream videos across a campus network. VLC was the client for the VideoLAN project, with VLC standing for ''VideoLan Client''. Originally developed by students at the [[Ãcole Centrale Paris]], it is now developed by contributors worldwide and is coordinated by the [[VideoLAN]] non-profit organization.

Rewritten from scratch in 1998, it was released under the GPL on 1 February 2001. The functionality of the server program, ''VideoLan Server'' (VLS), has mostly been subsumed into VLC and has been deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videolan.org/vlc/streaming.html | title=VideoLAN - The streaming solution | accessdate=2009-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project name has been changed to ''VLC'' because there is no longer a client/server infrastructure.

The cone icon used in VLC is a reference to the [[traffic cone]]s collected by Ecole Centrale's Networking Students' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nanocrew.net/2005/06/23/vlc-cone/ | title=VLC cone | author=[[Jon Lech Johansen]] | date=June 23, 2005 | work=So sue me: Jon Lech Johansenâs blog | accessdate=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cone icon design was changed from a hand drawn low resolution icon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob_plain;f=share/vlc48x48.png;hb=85e4b3a17d6a107a0f73be40c52c080354b3ddd0 | title=vlc48x48.png | format=PNG | work=VideoLAN Project | accessdate=2010-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a higher resolution [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-rendered version in 2006, illustrated by Richard Ãiestad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob_plain;f=share/vlc48x48.png;hb=9ef388cc16e200fa0a4571f9b006c0d58e9ba115 | title=vlc48x48.png | format=PNG | work=VideoLAN Project | accessdate=2010-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 13 years of development, version 1.0.0 of VLC media player was released on July 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/07/vlc-10-officially-released.ars | title=VLC 1.0 officially released after more than 10 years of work| accessdate=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VLC is 3rd in the sourceforge.net overall download count.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/top/topalltime.php?type=downloads] SourceForge.net.&lt;/ref&gt; VLC was available for the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPod Touch]] from the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple AppStore]], but was pulled due to a licensing conflict between the GPL and the iTunes Store agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple pulls VLC media player from the App Store|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/11/01/07/move.said.to.be.related.to.licensing.dispute/|publisher=MacNN|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==
VLC 1.0.0 has more than 380 modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/browser/modules/LIST | title=VLC media player List of modules | work=VLC media player trac system }}&lt;/ref&gt; VLC, like most [[multimedia framework]]s, has a very [[modular (programming)|modular]] design which makes it easier to include modules/plugins for new file formats, codecs, or streaming methods.

The VLC core creates dynamically its own graph of modules depending on the situation: input protocol, input file format, input codec, video card capabilities and other parameters. In VLC, almost everything is a module, like interfaces, video and audio outputs, controls, scalers, codecs, and audio/[[filter (video)|video filters]].

===Interfaces===
[[File:Vlc wx kde.png|thumb|right|VLC with the [[wxWidgets]] interface, running on [[KDE]]]]
In VLC, interfaces are modules, which means that VLC's core can launch one, many, or no interfaces.

The default [[GUI]] is based on [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] 4 for Windows and Linux, [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] for Mac OS X, and [[Be API]] on BeOS; but all give a similar standard interface. The old default [[GUI]] was based on [[wxWidgets|wx]] on Windows and Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2007/02/10/Qt4-Interface | title=Qt4 Interface | author=Jean-Baptiste Kempf | date=February 10, 2007 | work=Yet another blog for JBKempf | accessdate=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vlc115macosx.png|thumb|right|VLC v1.1.5 on [[Mac OS X Leopard]] ]]
The interface contains an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] which changes the VLC traffic cone logo so that it's wearing a [[Santa hat]]. The logo changes on December 18, one week before [[Christmas]], and reverts to its normal appearance on January 1.

VLC supports highly customizable [[Skin (computing)|skins]] through the skins2 interface, also supporting [[Winamp]] 2 and [[XMMS]] skins. The customizable skins feature can malfunction depending on which version is being used.[[File:Skin VLC eDark.png|thumb|VLC with the popular eDark theme]]

[[File:VLCncurses.png|thumb|right|VLC with the [[ncurses]] interface, running on [[Mac OS X]]]]
For [[computer console|console]] users, VLC has a remote control interface and an [[ncurses]] interface. As VLC can act as a streaming server, rather than a media player, it can be useful to control it from a remote location and there are interfaces allowing this. The Remote Control Interface is a text-based interface for doing this. There are also interfaces using [[telnet]] and [[HTTP]] ([[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]).

===Control===
In addition to these interfaces, it is possible to control VLC in different ways:
* Configurable hotkeys
* [[Mouse gesture]]s
* [[LIRC]] and infrared controllers
* [[D-Bus]]
* Laptop motion
* [[application software|Apps]] for operating systems, such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch)

==Features==
[[File:VLCmenu 1 0 6.png|thumb|right|VLC's right-click Menu on GNU/Linux (Kubuntu 10.04)]]
Because VLC is a [[Packet (information technology)|packet-based]] media player, it can play the video content of some damaged, incomplete, or unfinished videos. (For example, files still downloading via [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networks). It also plays m2t [[MPEG transport stream]]s (.TS) files while they are still being digitized from an [[HDV]] camera via a [[FireWire]] cable, making it possible to monitor the video as it is being played. The player can also use libcdio to access [[.iso]] files so that users can play files on a [[disk image]], even if the user's operating system cannot work directly with .iso images.

VLC supports all audio and video formats and all file formats supported by [[libavcodec]] and libavformat. This means that VLC can play back [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] or [[MPEG-4]] video as well as support [[Flash Video|FLV]] or [[Material Exchange Format|MXF]] file formats &quot;out of the box&quot; using FFmpeg's libraries. Alternatively, VLC has modules for codecs that are not based on FFmpeg's libraries. VLC is one of the [[free software]] and [[open source]] DVD players that ignores [[DVD region code#Software DVD players|DVD region coding]] on RPC-1 firmware drives, making it a region-free player. However, it does not do the same on RPC-2 firmware drives. VLC media player has some filters that can distort, rotate, split, [[deinterlace]], mirror videos, create display walls, or add a logo overlay.  It can also output video as [[ASCII art]].

VLC media player can play [[High-definition video|high definition]] recordings of [[D-VHS]] tapes duplicated to a computer using CapDVHS.exe. This offers another way to archive all D-VHS tapes with the DRM copy freely tag. Using a [[FireWire]] connection from cable boxes to computers, VLC can stream live, unencrypted content to a monitor or HDTV. VLC media player can display the playing video as the [[computer wallpaper|desktop wallpaper]], like [[Windows DreamScene]], by using [[DirectX]], only available on Windows operating systems. VLC media player can create [[screencast]]s and record the desktop. On Microsoft Windows, VLC also supports the Direct Media Object (DMO) framework and can thus make use of some third-party [[dynamic-link library|DLLs]]. On most platforms, VLC can tune in to and view DVB-C, DVB-T, and DVB-S channels. On Mac OS X the separate EyeTV plugin is required, on Windows it requires the card's BDA Drivers.

VLC can be installed or run directly from a [[USB flash drive]] or other external drive. VLC can be extended through scripting. It uses the [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://addons.videolan.org/ Addons for VLC]. Retrieved on 2011-22-5.&lt;/ref&gt; VLC can play videos in the [[AVCHD]] format, a highly compressed format used in recent [[High-definition video|HD]] camcorders. VLC can generate a number of [[music visualization]] displays.

===Browser plugins===
On Windows, Linux, Mac, and some other Unix-like platforms, VLC provides an [[NPAPI]] plugin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videolan.org/doc/play-howto/en/ch04.html#id293992 |title=Chapter 4. Advanced use of VLC |publisher=Videolan.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enables users to view [[QuickTime]], [[Windows Media]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg]] files embedded in websites without using additional products. It supports many [[web browser]]s including [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[Mozilla Application Suite]], and other [[Netscape]] plug-in based browsers; [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], and other [[WebKit]] based browsers; and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]. [[Google]] used this plugin to build the [[Google Video]] web browser plugin before switching to use [[Adobe Flash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/patches.html |title=Open Source Patches and Mirrored Packages - Google Code |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with version 0.8.2, VLC also provides an [[Component Object Model|ActiveX]] plugin, which lets people view QuickTime (MOV), Windows Media, MP3, and Ogg files embedded in websites when using [[Internet Explorer]].

===Applications which use the VLC plugin===
VLC can handle incomplete files and can be used to preview files being downloaded. Several programs make use of this, including eMule and [[KCeasy]]. The free/open-source Internet television application [[Miro (software)|Miro]] also uses VLC code. [[HandBrake]], an open-source video encoder, loads [[libdvdcss]] from VLC Media Player.

==Format support==
===Readable formats===
[[File:Vlc mediaplayer 0.9.8a runing on KDE 4.2.1 with fedora 10.png|thumb|right|250px|VLC running under [[KDE]]]]
VLC can read several formats, depending on the [[operating system]] VLC is running on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html | title=VLC features list | work=VideoLAN Project | accessdate=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The VLC media player software installers for the Mac OS X platform and the Windows platform include the [[libdvdcss|libdvdcss DVD decryption library]], even though this library may be legally restricted in certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videolan.org/support/faq.html |title=VideoLAN - VideoLAN - Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2010-11-12 |publisher=[[VideoLAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
At least one recent release of the VLC media player software is able to read video and audio data from DVDs that incorporate [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) encryption, even though the VLC media player software lacks a CSS decryption license.&lt;ref name=&quot;pc_world_dvds_css&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/168622/ |title=VLC Video Player's New DVD-Copying Feature Could Run Afoul of the MPAA - PCWorld |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2010-11-12 |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]] |author=Horton, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unauthorized decryption of CSS-encrypted DVD content and/or the unauthorized distribution of CSS decryption tools may violate the US [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]],&lt;ref name=pc_world_dvds_css/&gt; although the decryption of CSS-encrypted DVD content has been temporarily authorized for certain purposes (such as [[documentary film]]making that uses short portions of DVD content for criticism and/or commentary) under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act#Anti-circumvention exemptions|anticircumvention exemptions]] that were issued by the [[US Copyright Office]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/1201/ |title=Rulemaking on Exemptions from Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Measures that Control Access to Copyrighted Works |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2010-11-14 |publisher=[[US Copyright Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These exemptions do not change the DMCA's ban on the distribution of CSS decryption tools.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2005/11/dmca-triennial-rulemaking-failing-consumers-completely |title=DMCA Triennial Rulemaking: Failing Consumers Completely |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-11-14 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |author=von Lohmann, Fred |authorlink=Fred von Lohmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;
