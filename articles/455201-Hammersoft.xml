A '''spaceplane''' is a vehicle that operates as an [[aircraft]] in Earth's atmosphere, as well as a [[spacecraft]] when it is in [[KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line|space]]. It combines features of an aircraft and a spacecraft, which can be thought of as an aircraft that can endure and maneuver in the vacuum of space or likewise a spacecraft that can fly like an airplane. Typically, it takes the form of a spacecraft equipped with [[wing]]s, although [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] have been designed and tested. The propulsion to reach space may be purely rocket based or may use the assistance of air-breathing engines.

To date, only pure [[rocket-powered aircraft|rocket spaceplanes]] have succeeded in reaching space, although several have been carried up to an altitude of several tens of thousands of feet by a purely atmospheric aircraft mothership before release. All spaceplanes have been [[VTHL|vertical takeoff horizontal landing (VTHL)]] vehicles that use only rocket lift for the ascent phase in reaching space (excluding mothership first stage) and only used atmospheric lift for the reentry and landing phase.

A spaceplane features some differences from rocket launch systems.

=== Aerodynamic lift ===
{{Main|Lift (force)}}

All aircraft utilize [[wing|aerodynamic surface]]s in order to generate lift. For spaceplanes different shaped wings can be used, delta wings are common, but straight wings, [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] and even [[rotorcraft]] have been proposed. Typically the force of lift generated by these surfaces is many times that of the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] that they induce.  The ratio of these forces (the [[Lift-to-drag ratio]] or L/D) varies between different aircraft designs. 
It can be as high as 60 in high performance gliders, but is usually closer to 7 or less for typical supersonic aircraft configurations, but may be significantly lower for hypersonic aerospace planes.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In practice a lift to drag ratio of 7 means that a thrust force equal to 1/7 of the weight of the aircraft is sufficient to support it in flight.  This low thrust requirement significantly reduces the amount of fuel required to carry the weight of an aerospace plane in comparison to rocket launch systems which must provide thrust greater than the weight of the vehicle.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- need a citation; in practice, in the main, most spaceplanes have been [[VTHL]] and don't use the lift capability of the wings to much advantage during launch, if at all. --&gt;

A partially off-setting difference between these systems is that the aerospace plane would typically experience powered flight for much longer periods of time than a rocket. In addition winged vehicles need extra dry mass for the wings, and this penalizes vehicles towards the end of the flight.
Rockets are also able to use their high thrust at an angle which gives reasonable lifting efficiency when burning for orbit. However, spaceplanes typically undergo what is called{{by whom|date=January 2011}} a &quot;zoom maneuver&quot; when transitioning from air-breathing flight to pure rocket propulsion to reach space, in which they change their attitude and climb rate significantly, translating some forward velocity into vertical velocity in order to get above the remaining atmosphere so the rocket engine can operate most efficiently.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Atmospheric reentry ===
Because [[suborbital spaceplane]]s are designed for trajectories that do not reach [[orbital speed]], they do not need the kinds of thermal protection orbital spacecraft required during the [[hypersonic]] phase of [[atmospheric reentry]]. The [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]], for example, protects the orbiter from surface temperatures that could otherwise reach as high as {{convert|3000|F|C}}, well above the melting point of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/tps.htm |title = ORBITER THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM |publisher = NASA KSC |year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propulsion ===
[[File:Buran rear view (Le Bourget 1989).JPEG|200px|thumb|right|Buran orbiter rear showing rocket engine nozzles, for maneuvering in low Earth orbit and thin air]]

==== Rocket engines ====

All spaceplanes to date have used [[rocket engine]]s with chemical fuels.   Due to the [[orbital insertion]] burn necessarily being done in space, orbital spaceplanes require rocket engines for at least that portion of the flight.

==== Air breathing engines ====
{{main|Airbreathing jet engine}}

A difference between rocket based and air-breathing aerospace plane launch systems is that aerospace plane designs typically include minimal [[oxidizer]] storage for propulsion.  Air-breathing aerospace plane designs include engine inlets so they can use atmospheric oxygen for [[combustion]].  Since the mass of the oxidizer is, at takeoff, the single largest mass of most rocket designs (the [[Space Shuttle]]'s liquid oxygen tank weighs 629,340&amp;nbsp;kg, more than one of its [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Space Shuttle external tank#Technical data]]&lt;/ref&gt;), this provides a huge potential weight savings benefit. However, air breathing engines are usually very much heavier than rocket engines and the empty weight of the oxidiser tank, and since, unlike oxidiser, this extra weight must be carried into space it greatly offsets the overall system performance.

Types of air breathing engines proposed for spaceplanes include [[scramjet]], [[liquid air cycle engine]]s, [[precooled jet engine]]s, [[pulse detonation engine]] and [[ramjet]]s. Some engine designs combine several types of engines features into a combined cycle. For instance, the [[Rocket-based combined cycle]] (RBCC) engine uses a rocket engine inside a ramscoop so that at low speed, the rockets thrust is boosted by ejector augmented thrust. It then transitions to ramjet propulsion at near-supersonic speeds, then to supersonic combustion or scramjet propulsion, above Mach 6, then back to pure rocket propulsion above Mach 10.

=== Harsh flight environment ===
The flight trajectory required of air-breathing aerospace vehicles to reach orbit is to fly what is known as a 'depressed trajectory' which places the aerospace plane in the high-altitude hypersonic flight regime of the atmosphere.  This environment induces high dynamic pressure, high temperature, and high heat flow loads particularly upon the [[leading edge]] surfaces of the aerospace plane.  These loads typically require special advanced materials, [[active cooling]], or both for the structures to survive the environment.

However, even rocket-powered spaceplanes can face a significant thermal environment if they are burning for orbit, but this is nevertheless far less severe than air-breathing spaceplanes.

Suborbital space planes designed to briefly reach space do not require significant thermal protection, as they experience peak heating for only a short time during re-entry. Intercontinental suborbital trajectories require much higher speeds and thermal protection more similar to orbital [[spacecraft reentry]].

=== Center of mass issues ===
A wingless launch vehicle has lower aerodynamic forces affecting the vehicle, and [[Flight dynamics|attitude control]] can be active perhaps with some fins to aid stability. For a winged vehicle the centre of lift moves during the atmospheric flight as well as the centre of mass; and the vehicle spends longer in the atmosphere as well. Historically, the [[X-33]] and [[HOTOL]] spaceplanes were rear engined and had relatively heavy engines. This puts a heavy mass at the rear of the aircraft with wings that had to hold up the vehicle. As the wet mass reduces, the centre of mass tends to move rearward behind the centre of lift, which tends to be around the centre of the wings. This can cause severe instability that is usually solved by extra fins which add weight and decrease performance.

=== Overall weight ===
A vertically launched rocket forms the shape of a cylinder stood on end. This structure can be made very light and strong. A horizontally launched spaceplane approximates a cylinder on its side. This structure experiences greater bending forces, so must be strengthened. This makes it heavier, requiring advanced materials and design techniques to reduce weight. For example [[Burt Rutan]] of [[Scaled Composites]] recently patented a method of gluing the fuel tank directly to the vehicle skin, saving the weight of fasteners while also stiffening both parts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== Single stage to orbit ===
Future orbital spaceplanes may take off, ascend, descend, and land like conventional aircraft, providing true [[single stage to orbit]] (SSTO) capability.

Proponents of scramjet technology often cite such a vehicle as being a possible application of that type of engine, however pure rocket and subsonic combustion jet designs have also been proposed and may be easier to design and build.  The main problem with SSTO operation is [[Spaceplane#Overall_weight|overall weight]].

== Flown spaceplanes ==
=== Orbital spaceplanes ===

All four of the ''[[orbit]]al'' spaceplanes successfully flown to date utilize a [[VTVL#VTHL|VTHL]] (vertical takeoff, horizontal landing) design.  They include the piloted [[United States]] [[Space Shuttle]] and three unmanned spaceplanes:  the early-1980s [[BOR-4]] (subscale test vehicle for the [[Spiral spaceplane]] that was subsequently cancelled), the late-1980s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]], and the early-2010s [[Boeing X-37]].

These vehicles have used [[Airfoil|wings]] to provide [[aerobraking]] to return from orbit and to provide [[Lift (force)|lift]], allowing them to land on a [[runway]] like conventional aircraft. These vehicles are still designed to ascend to orbit vertically under [[rocket]] power like conventional [[expendable launch system|expendable launch vehicles]]. One drawback of spaceplanes is that they have a significantly smaller [[payload fraction]] than a ballistic design with the same takeoff weight. This is in part due to the weight of the wings â around 9-12% of the weight of the atmospheric flight weight of the vehicle. This significantly reduces the payload size, but the reusability is intended to offset this disadvantage.

While all spaceplanes have used atmospheric lift for the reentry phase, none to date have succeeded in a design that relies on aerodynamic lift for the ascent phase in reaching space (excluding mothership first stage). Efforts such as the Sanger and [[X-30]]/[[X-33]] have all failed to materialize into a vehicle capable of successfully reaching space. The [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] winged booster has had many successful flights to deploy orbital payloads, but since its aerodynamic vehicle component operates only as a booster, and not operate in space as a spacecraft, it is not typically considered to be a spaceplane.

On the other hand, [[OREX]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocket.jaxa.jp/fstrc/0c01.html|title=OREX|publisher=Space Transportation System Research and Development Center, JAXA|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a test vehicle of [[HOPE-X]] and launched into 450&amp;nbsp;km LEO using [[H-II]] in 1994. OREX succeeded to reenter, but it was only hemispherical head of HOPE-X, that is, not plane-shaped.

=== Suborbital spaceplanes ===
[[File:X-15 flying.jpg|thumb|right|The X-15's rocket engine used ammonia and liquid oxygen.]]
Other spaceplane designs are [[suborbital spaceplane|suborbital]], requiring far less energy for propulsion, and can use the vehicle's wings to provide lift for the ''ascent to'' space in addition to the rocket. As of 2010, the only such craft to reach space have been the [[North American X-15|X-15]] and [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]]. Neither of these craft was capable of entering orbit. The X-15 and SpaceShipOne both began their independent flight only after being lifted to high altitude by a carrier aircraft.

[[Scaled Composites]] and [[Virgin Galactic]] unveiled on December 7, 2009, the [[SpaceShipTwo]] space plane, the VSS Enterprise, and its [[WhiteKnightTwo]] mothership, &quot;Eve&quot;. SpaceShipTwo is designed to carry two pilots and six passengers on suborbital flights, with flight testing scheduled to be completed in the 2012 time frame.

[[XCOR Aerospace]] signed a $30 million contract with [[Yecheon Astro Space Center]] to build and lease its [[Lynx rocketplane|Lynx Mark II]] spaceplane, which would be designed to take off from a runway under its own rocket power, and to reach the same altitude and speed range as SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, due to the fact that Lynx is propelled by higher specific impulse fuels. Lynx is designed to only carry a pilot and one passenger, although tickets are expected to be around half those quoted for Virgin Galactic services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704238104574602492468293788.html |title=XCOR Aerospace Gets First Lease Customer for Its Space Plane |author=Andy Pasztor |date=December 17, 2009 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hyflex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/hyflex.htm|title=Hyflex|publisher=astronautix.com|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocket.jaxa.jp/fstrc/0c02.html|title=HYFLEX|publisher=Space Transportation System Research and Development Center, JAXA|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a miniaturized suborbital demonstrator of HOPE-X launched in 1996. Hyflex flew 110&amp;nbsp;km altitude and succeeded to reenter, though it was failed to recover.

[[File:Space Shuttle concepts.jpg|thumb|right|United States STS [[Space shuttle]] concepts circa 1970s]]

Various types of spaceplanes have been suggested since the early twentieth century. Notable early designs include [[Friedrich Zander]]'s spaceplane equipped with wings made of combustible alloys that it would burn during its ascent, and [[Eugen SÃ¤nger]]'s [[Silbervogel]] [[bomber aircraft|bomber]] design. Also in [[Nazi Germany]] and then in the USA, winged versions of the [[V2 rocket]] were considered during and after [[World War II]], and when public interest in space exploration was high in the 1950s and '60s, winged rocket designs by [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Willy Ley]] served to inspire [[science fiction]] artists and filmmakers.

===United States===
The [[U.S. Air Force]] invested some effort in a paper study of a variety of spaceplane projects under their [[Aerospaceplane]] efforts of the late 1950s, but later ended these when they decided to use a modified version of SÃ¤nger's design. The result, [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]], was to have been the first orbital spaceplane, but was canceled in the early 1960s in lieu of [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]] and the U.S. Air Force's [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program. The [[Rockwell X-30]] National Aero-Space Plane (NASP), begun in the 1980s, was an attempt to build a scramjet vehicle capable of operating like an aircraft and achieving orbit like the shuttle.  It was canceled due to increasing technical challenges, growing budgets, and the loss of public interest. In 1994 Mitchell Burnside Clapp proposed a single stage to orbit peroxide/kerosene spaceplane called &quot;[[Black Horse (spaceplane)|Black Horse]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/blahorse.htm Black Horse]. astronautix.com&lt;/ref&gt; This was notable in that it was to take off almost empty and undergo [[Aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]] before accelerating to orbit.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The [[Lockheed Martin X-33]] was a prototype made as part of an attempt by NASA to build a SSTO hydrogen-fuelled spaceplane [[VentureStar]] that failed when the hydrogen tank design proved to be unconstructable in the planned way. The March 5, 2006 edition of [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] published a story purporting to be &quot;outing&quot; a highly classified U.S. military two-stage-to-orbit spaceplane system with the code name [[Blackstar (spaceplane)|Blackstar]], [[SR-3/XOV]] among other nicknames. The alleged system, using an XB-70-like first-stage mother ship, capable of Mach 3, is said to launch an upper-stage &quot;[[waverider]]&quot; spaceplane capable of carrying small payloads and crews near to or into orbit or on [[skip-diving]] flights, ostensibly for reconnaissance and other missions, achieving surprise that cannot be attained by satellite. There has been considerable controversy over this story and its claims.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[File:Boeing X-37B inside payload fairing before launch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Boeing X-37B]] being prepared for launch in 2010 on an expendable orbital rocket]]

In 1999 NASA started the [[Boeing X-37]] project, an unmanned, remote controlled spaceplane. The project was transferred to the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2004. It had its first flight as a drop test on 7 April 2006, at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. The spaceplane's first orbital mission, USA-212 was launched on 22 April 2010 using an Atlas V rocket, and the heat shield and hypersonic aerodynamic handling was tested. A second X-37B test flight was launched on 5 March 2011.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Boeing has proposed that a larger variant of the X-37B, the X-37C could be built to carry up to six passengers up to [[low-Earth orbit|LEO]].  The spaceplane would also be usable for carrying cargo, with both upmass and downmass (return to Earth) cargo capacity.  The ideal size for the proposed derivative &quot;is approximately 165 to 180 percent of the current X-37B.&quot;&lt;ref name=sdc20111007&gt;

In December 2010, [[Orbital Sciences]] made a commercial proposal to NASA to develop the [[Prometheus (spacecraft)|Prometheus]], a [[lifting body|lifting-body]] spaceplane vehicle about one-quarter the size of the [[Space Shuttle]], in response to NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) {{nowrap|phase 2}} solicitation.  The vehicle would be launched on a human-rated (upgraded) [[Atlas V]] rocket but would land on a runway.&lt;ref name=wsj20101214&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704694004576020192942362626.html?mod=WSJ_topics_obama &quot;Orbital Proposes Spaceplan for Astronauts&quot;]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', December 14, 2010. Accessed: December 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
For the same solicitation, [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] proposed {{nowrap|phase 2}} extensions of its [[Dream Chaser]] spaceplane technology, partially developed under the first phase of NASA's CCDev program.&lt;ref name=aw20101217/&gt; Both the Orbital Sciences proposal and the Dream Chaser are [[lifting body]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;

====National Aerospace Plane====
[[File:X-30 futuristic nasa.jpg|thumb|right|NASP taking off]]
President [[Ronald Reagan]] described NASP in his 1986 [[State of the Union]] address as &quot;...a new Orient Express that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles Airport and accelerate up to twenty-five times the speed of sound, attaining low earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two hours...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/mystery/nasp.htm |title=X-30 National Aerospace Plane (NASP) |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were six identifiable technologies which were considered critical to the success of the NASP project.  Three of these &quot;enabling&quot; technologies were related to the propulsion system, which would consist of a hydrogen-fueled scramjet.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot; /&gt;  The NASP program became the Hypersonic Systems Technology Program (HySTP) in late 1994.

HySTP was designed to transfer the accomplishments made in hypersonic technologies by the National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) program into a technology development program. On January 27, 1995 the Air Force terminated participation in (HySTP).&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot; /&gt;

===Soviet Union and Russia===
[[File:Antonov An-225 with Buran at Le Bourget 1989 Manteufel.jpg|thumb|left|Buran orbiter being transported via [[Antonov An-225|An-225]]]]

The [[Soviet Union]] firstly considered a preliminary design of rocket-launch small spaceplane Lapotok in early 1960s. Then the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105#Uragan|Spiral]] airspace system with small orbital spaceplane and rocket as second stage was widely developed in the 1960s-1980s. Although test flights of prototypes of spaceplane were fulfilled in air (MiG-105) and space ([[BOR-4]]), program was canceled in 1987, a year before the first [[Buran]] flight. Project of [[Tupolev]] Design Bureau of military suborbital spaceplane-bomber Tu-136/139 Zvezda was canceled in early stage. Another project of Uragan spaceplane, a smaller sibling to Buran, launched by Proton and Zenit rockets, never been confirmed by Soviet or Russian authorities as really conducted, although an existence of similar project of [[Chelomei]]'s LKS (Kosmolyot) spaceplane was confirmed.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Cosmoplane====
In recent times, an orbital spaceplane, called ''cosmoplane'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð¾Ð¿Ð»Ð°Ð½) capable of transporting passengers has been proposed by Russia's Institute of Applied Mechanics. According to researchers, it could take about 20 minutes to fly from [[Moscow]] to [[Paris]], using hydrogen and oxygen fueled engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russia-ic.com/news/show/1925/ Russia Develops New Aircraft â Cosmoplane]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rususa.com/news/news.asp-nid-2632 RusUsa.com ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð¾Ð¿Ð»Ð°Ð½ â ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¾Ð»ÐµÑ Ð±ÑÐ´ÑÑÐµÐ³Ð¾]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Initiated by [[France]] joint European program of ESA of [[Hermes (spaceplane)|Hermes]] manned spaceplane launched by [[Ariane rocket]] continued a few years before it was canceled in early 1990s. Earlier France Dassault-Avion company proposed Astrobus spaceplane and now develops ARES spaceplane as prototype for [[FLPP]]. [[Hopper (spacecraft)|Hopper]] was proposed as European spaceplane by [[EADS]] which also develops ARES spaceplane as prototype for ESA FLPP/FLTP program and [[EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project|commercial suborbital spaceplane]] for [[space tourism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Japan===
'''[[HOPE-X|HOPE]]''' was a [[Japan]]ese experimental spaceplane project designed by a partnership between [[National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA]] and [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan|NAL]] (both now part of [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]]), started in the 1980s. It was positioned for most of its lifetime as one of the main Japanese contributions to the [[International Space Station]], the other being the [[Japanese Experiment Module]]. The project was eventually cancelled in 2003, by which point test flights of a sub-scale testbed had flown successfully.

===Germany===
[[File:F-104G ZLL at Luftwaffenmuseum Berlin Gatow.jpg|right|thumb|[[F-104]]G ZLL at [[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr]], Berlin Gatow, for [[Zero length launch]]]]
After the [[Germany|German]] SÃ¤nger-Bredt RaBo and [[Silbervogel]] of the 1930s and 1940s, [[Eugen SÃ¤nger]] worked for time on various space plane projects, coming up with several designs for [[Messerschmitt-BÃ¶lkow-Blohm]] such as the [[MBB Raumtransporter-8]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saengeri.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, West Germany funded design work on the [[MBB SÃ¤nger II]] with the [[Hypersonic Technology Program]]. Development continued on MBB/Deutsche Aerospace SÃ¤nger II/HORUS until the last 1980s, when it was canceled. Germany went on to participate in the Ariane rocket, Columbus space station and Hermes spaceplane of [[ESA]], [[Spacelab]] of ESA-NASA and ''Deutschland'' missions (non-U.S. funded Space Shuttle flights with Spacelab). The SÃ¤nger II had predicted cost savings of up to 30 percent over expendable rockets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saegerii.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace RLV]] was a much later small reusable spaceplane prototype for ESA FLPP/FLTP program.

===United Kingdom===
The [[MUSTARD|Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device]] (MUSTARD) was a concept explored by the [[United Kingdom|British]] Aircraft Corporation (BAC) around 1964-1965 for launching payloads weighing as much as 5,000&amp;nbsp;lb into orbit. It was never constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/MUSTARD.html |title=MUSTARD INFO |author=David Darling |year=2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Government also began development of a SSTO-spaceplane, called [[HOTOL]], but the project was canceled due to technical and financial issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/bkgrnd.html |title= HOTOL History|author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=Reaction Engines Limited |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead engineer from the HOTOL project has since set up a private company dedicated to creating a similar plane called [[Reaction Engines Skylon|Skylon]] with a different combined cycle rocket/turbine [[precooled jet engine]] called [[Reaction Engines SABRE|SABRE]]. This vehicle is intended to be capable of a single stage to orbit launch also and, if successful, would be far in advance of anything currently in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/faq.html#q6|title=Skylon FAQ |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher= Reaction Engines Limited|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
'''[[Avatar (spacecraft)|AVATAR]]''' ({{lang-sa|à¤à¤µà¤¤à¤¾à¤°}}) (from &quot;'''A'''erobic '''V'''ehicle for Hypersonic '''A'''erospace '''T'''r'''A'''nspo'''R'''tation&quot;) is a [[SSTO|single-stage]] [[RLV|reusable]] spaceplane capable of [[CTOL|horizontal takeoff and landing]], being developed by India's [[Defense Research and Development Organization]] along with [[Indian Space Research Organization]] and other research institutions; it could be used for cheaper military and civilian [[satellite]] launches.
