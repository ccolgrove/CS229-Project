The '''Polish Embassy''' in [[Copenhagen]] is the diplomatic mission of the [[Republic of Poland]] to the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. The chancery is located at Richelieus Alle 12, Hellerup, Copenhagen.

The embassy is housed within a rococo style building on the banks of the [[Ãresund]] sound. The main chancery building is adjoined by the ambassador's residence which is also of a rococo architectural style and the embassy's consular complex which was designed in a neo-classical style with elements of Danish baroque architecture such as the tented roof.

The current ambassador of the Polish Republic to the Kingdom of Denmark is Mr Adam Halamski who presented his credentials to HM Queen [[Margrethe II]] on 8 December 2006.
