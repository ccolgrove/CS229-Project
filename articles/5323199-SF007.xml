'''''X''''' is the third and final studio album released by British pop group [[Liberty X]]. The album was released on 10 October 2005, and was re-issued on 19 June 2006. The album featured the singles &quot;Song 4 Lovers&quot;, the double A-side &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; / &quot;Everybody Dance&quot; and &quot;X&quot;. The album was the least successful of their three studio albums, only peaking at #27 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and selling less than 50,000 copies. The album featured a selection of remixes of the group's previous singles. The Australian version of the album was packaged with a bonus DVD containing several of the group's music videos from throughout their career, however, omits the tracks &quot;It's OK&quot; and &quot;Everybody Dance&quot; for contractual reasons.
