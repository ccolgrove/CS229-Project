'''''Nuestra Belleza Latina 2008''''' was the Second season of Nuestra Belleza Latina. The second season of [[Nuestra Belleza Latina]] (Our Latin Beauty) premiered on February 2008. Auditions were once again held in five major US cities (Los Angeles, California; Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; and New York City, New York) and in San Juan, Puerto Rico. During the audition process, 75 young women were given passes to the semi-finals in Miami, Florida. The elimination process was quick, with 15 women leaving the first week, 40 on the second week, and finally, on March 28, 2008, 8 women were eliminated leaving the 12 finalists who will be moving into a Miami mansion were they will be living together for the rest of the competition. Each week, viewers will have a chance to vote for their favorite finalists. The three women with the least number of votes will then be in danger of being eliminated. However, two of the women in the bottom three will have the chance of being saved, one by her fellow finalists, and the other by the judges.

[[Melissa Marty]], a contestant representing [[Puerto Rico]], won the competition.

==Changes==
There were some major changes to this Season, two of the judging panel, [[Galavision|Carlos Calderon]] and [[Alicia Machado]] left the show.
