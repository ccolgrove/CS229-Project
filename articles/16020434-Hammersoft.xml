'''Jalisco''' ({{IPA-es|xaËlisko}}) officially ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Jalisco'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of Jalisco}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is located in [[Western Mexico]] and divided in [[Municipalities of Jalisco|125 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Guadalajara]].
It is one of the more important states in Mexico because of its natural resources as well as its history.&lt;ref name=&quot;generalidades&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3ifEB8PY68gIwN_Ex9jAyM3fx9HlyBXAxMfc6B8JE55ICCgOxxkH379IHkDHMDRQN_PIz83Vb8gN8Igy8RREQCX72OH/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfTFRMSDNKUjIwTzRMMzAyRk9MQURSRTBLMDQ!/|title= Generalidades |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=General information |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; Many of the characteristic traits of [[Mexican culture]], particularly outside Mexico, are originally from Jalisco, such as [[mariachi]], [[Ranchera|ranchera music]], [[tequila]], [[jaripeo]], etc. Economically, it is ranked third in the country, with industries centered in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, the second largest metropolitan area in Mexico.
The state is home to two significant indigenous populations, the [[Huichol]]s and the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]]. There is also a significant foreign population, mostly retirees from the United States and Canada, living in the [[Lake Chapala]] area.
==Geography and environment==
With a total area of 78,599km2, Jalisco is the seventh largest state in Mexico, accounting for 4.1% of the countryâs territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;territorio&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/jal/territorio/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=14|title= Superficie |publisher= [[INEGI]] |language=Spanish |trans_title=Surface area |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;resumen&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/jal/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=14|title= Resumen |publisher= [[INEGI]] |language=Spanish |trans_title=Summary |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jalgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/pj/jalisco/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwOLYAsLA8_gUAN3Q7NQQ1cDU_1wkA6zeJ8QHw9jryAjA38TH2MDIzd_H0eXIFcDIIDIG-AAjgb6fh75uan6BdnZaY6OiooAzQCPbA!!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfTFRMSDNKUjIwTzRMMzAyRk9MQURSRTA0TDc!/ |title= Jalisco |publisher=State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; The state is in the center west of the country, bordering the states of [[Nayarit]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[San Luis PotosÃ­]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Colima]] and [[MichoacÃ¡n]] with 342km of coastline on the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;jalgob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;territorio&quot;/&gt;

Jalisco is made up of a diverse terrain that includes forests, beaches, plains and lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2409-the-cuisine-of-jalisco-la-cocina-tapatia |title= The cuisine of Jalisco: la cocina tapatia |first= Karen |last=Hursh Graber |date= June 1, 2007 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Altitudes in the state vary from between 0 and 4,300 meters above sea level from the coast to the top of the [[Nevado de Colima]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;&gt; {{cite journal |last=Cuevas Arias |first=Carmen Teresa |coauthors=Ofelia Vargas and AarÃ³n RodrÃ­guez |year=2008 |month=June |title=Solanaceae Diversity in the State of Jalisco, Mexico |journal=Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=67â79 |location=Mexico City |publisher=[[UNAM]] |issn=1870-3453 |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |url= http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/src/inicio/ArtPdfRed.jsp?iCve=42579105 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;magiccircle&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3709-the-magic-circle-mexico-s-five-ecosystems-meet-around-guadalajara |title= The Magic Circle: Mexico's five ecosystems meet around Guadalajara |first=John |last=Pint |date= November 7, 2010  |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The Jalisco area contains all five of Mexicoâs natural ecosystems: arid and semi arid scrublands, tropical evergreen forests, tropical [[deciduous]] and thorn forests, grasslands and [[mesquite]] grasslands and temperate forests with oaks, pines and firs.&lt;ref name=&quot;magiccircle&quot;/&gt; Over 52% of the bird species found in Mexico live in the state, with 525, 40% of Mexicoâs mammals with 173 and 18% of its reptile species. There are also 7,500 species of veined plants. One reason for its biodiversity is that is lies in the transition area between the temperate north and tropical south. It also lies at the northern edge of the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] and is on the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], which provides a wide variety of ecological conditions from tropical rainforest conditions to semi arid areas to areas apt for conifer forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/jalisco/ |title= Medio FÃ­sico  |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Jalisco |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Government of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title= Environment |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Its five natural regions are Northwestern Plains and Sierras, [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], Central Plateau, Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which covers most of the state and the Sierra Madre del Sur.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; It has an average altitude of 1550 masl, but ranges from 0 to over 4000 masl.&lt;ref name=&quot;jalgob&quot;/&gt; Most of the territory is semi flat of between 600 and 2,050 masl, followed by rugged terrain of between 900 and 4,260 masl and a small percentage of flat lands of between 0 and 1,750 masl. Priniciple elevations include the Nevado de Colima, the Volcan de Colima, the Sierra El MadroÃ±o, the [[Tequila Volcano]], the Sierra Tapalpa, Sierra Los Huicholes, Sierra San Isidro, Sierra ManantlÃ¡n, Cerro El Tigre, Cerro GarcÃ­a, Sierra Lalo, Sierra Cacoma, Cerro Gordo, Sierra Verde and the Sierra Los Guajolotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; 

Jaliscoâs rivers and streams eventually empty into the Pacific Ocean and are divided into three groups: the [[Lerma River|Lerma/Santiago River]] and its tributaries, rivers that empty directly into the Pacific and rivers in the south of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;  Jalisco has several river basins with the most notable being that of the Lerma/Santiago River, which drains the northern and northeastern parts of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; The Lerma River enters extends from the State of Mexico and empties into [[Lake Chapala]] on the east side. On the west, water flows out in the Santiago River, which crosses the center of Jalisco on its way to the Pacific, carving deep canyons in the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;magiccircle&quot;/&gt; Tributaries to the Santiago River include the Zula, the Verde River, the Juchipila and the BolaÃ±os. About three quarters of the stateâs population lives near this river system.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; In the southwest of the state, there are a number of small rivers that empty directly into the Pacific Ocean. The most important of these is the Ameca, with its one main tributary, the Mascota River. This river forms the stateâs border with Nayarit and empties into the Ipala Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; The TomatlÃ¡n, San NicolÃ¡s, PurificaciÃ³n, Marabasco-MinatitlÃ¡n, Ayuquila, Tuxcacuesco, ArmerÃ­a and Tuxpan rivers flow almost perpendicular to the Pacific Ocean and drain the coastal area.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; Another river of this group is the CihuatlÃ¡n River, which forms the boundary between Jalisco and Colima emptying into the [[Barra de Navidad]] Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;  The southeastern corner belongs to the [[Balsas River]] basin.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; This includes the Ayuqila and Tuxcacuesco, which join to form the ArmerÃ­a and the Tuxpan.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Chapala.jpg|thumb|left|Along the shore of Lake Chapala]]
The other main surface water is [[Lake Chapala]], and is the largest and most important freshwater lake in Mexico, accounting for about half of the countryâs lake surface.. The lake acts as a regulator of the flow of both the Lerma and Santiago Rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; There are a number of seasonal and salty lakes linking to form the Zacoalco-Sayula land-locked system.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; There are other smaller lakes called CajititlÃ¡n, Sayula, San Marcos, and Atotonilco. Dams include the CajÃ³n de PeÃ±a, Santa Rosa, La Vega, TacotÃ¡n and Las Piedras. Jaliscoâs surface water accounts for fifteen percent of the surface freshwater in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; 

In 1986, four beaches in Jalisco were designated as [[Mexican Nature Sanctuaries|federal marine turtle sanctuaries]]: El TecuÃ¡n, Cuitzmala, Teopa and PlayÃ³n de Mismaloya, with an extension of eight km.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Playa Majahuitas is 27km southwest of [[Puerto Vallarta]] with a rugged coastline, numerous inlets and outcroppings. The CaÃ±on Submarino underwater canyon is located offshore. [[Chamela, Jalisco|Chamela Bay]] has the greatest number of [[islet]]s in Mexico, many of which are inhabited by numerous bird species.&lt;ref name=&quot;youknew&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.acta.ca/?Jalisco |title= Jalisco: it's Puerto Vallarta and much more  |publisher= Association of Canadian Travel Agencies |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DCFN0034.JPG|thumb|Near the Primavera Forest]]
Jalisco has eight areas under conservation measures totaling 208,653.8 hectares. Two contains scientific research centers. These areas cover 4.8% of the state and only one, the Sierra de ManantlÃ¡n Biosphere accounts for sixty percent of all legally protected land at 139,500 hectares. The other protected areas include the Chamela-Cuitzmala Bioshere Reserve (13,143 hectares), [[Nevado de Colima National Park]] (10,143 hectares), Bosque de la Primavera (30,500 hectares), Sierra de Quila (15,1923 hectares) and the Marine Turtle Protection Zone (175.8 hectares) .&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Thirteen plant communities are present in the state. Forty five to fifty percent of the state is characterized by deciduous and sub-deciduous forests. They occur along the coastal plains as well as in canyons in the central part of the state from sea level to 1600masl. Some areas, scattered within the tropical sub-deciduous forest along the coastal plains, are dominated by palms. Conifer and oak forests are most common in the highlands between 800 and 3,400masl, covering about one fourth of the stateâs surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; One major [[conifer]] and oak forest is the Primavera Forest.&lt;ref name=&quot;magiccircle&quot;/&gt; Pine dominated areas in lower elevations are only found in the western corner of the state. Cloud and fir-dominated forests are restricted to ravines and protected steep slopes within the conifer and oak forest zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; Jaliscoâs cloud forests include the Bosque de Maples and those on El Cerro de ManantlÃ¡n.&lt;ref name=&quot;magiccircle&quot;/&gt;  Savannas are found between 400 and 800 masl in the area the slopes towards the Pacific Ocean. These grasslands are a transition area between the tropical sub-deciduous forest and oak forest. The thorn forest includes an area of the coastal plains in the western part of the state as well as an area dominated by mesquite within the tropical deciduous forest. Grasslands are restricted to the northeastern corner interspersed with [[xerophilous]] scrub. There are [[mangroves]] along the ocean where waves are gentle. Beach and frontal dune vegetation dominates the rest of the coastline.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt;

==Climate==
Most of the state has a temperate climate with humid summers which are tropical. There is a distinct rainy season from June to October.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; The climate can be divided into 29 different zones from hot to cold and from very dry to semi moist. In most of the state, most of the rain falls between June and August.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The coastal area receives the most precipitation and has the warmest temperatures, at an average of between 22 and 26C and an average precipitation of about 2,000 mm annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; In the north and northwest, a dry climate predominates with average temperatures of between 10 and 18C, and average annual precipitation between 300 and 1,000mm. The center of the state has three different climates, but all are mostly temperate with an average temperature of 19C and an average rainfall of between 700 and 1000mm.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; The northeastern corner and coastal plains of [[TomatlÃ¡n]] are the driest areas with less than 500mm annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt; The Los Altos region has a number of [[microclimate]]s due to the rugged terrain. The area is mostly dry with an average temperature of 18C except in the north, where it fluctuates between 18 and 22C.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; In the highlands, the average temperature is less than 18C.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt;

In various parts of the state there are areas with a semi-moist, temperate climate, some with average temperatures of between 10 and 18C and others of between 18 and 22C.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

In the highlands of the Sierra de ManantlÃ¡n, Cacola, Cuale and [[Mascota]] near the coastal plains there is the most rainfall reaching 1600mm per year. In the highlands, the average temperature is less than 18C.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuevas&quot;/&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Huichol Trabajando.JPG|thumb|A Huichol man making a beaded jaguar head]]
As of 2010, the state population is 7,350,682, the fourth most populated state in Mexico, with 6.5% of Mexicoâs total population.&lt;ref name=&quot;numero&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/jal/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=14|title= NÃºmero de habitantes |publisher= [[INEGI]] |language=Spanish |trans_title=Number of inhabitants |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;resumen&quot;/&gt; Over half of the stateâs population lives in the [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara metro area]].

Despite the fact that the number of children per woman has dropped by more than half from a high of 6.8 in 1970, the total population has grown from 5,991,175 in 1995 to the present number.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; One important factor in population growth is migration into the state. Since 1995, over 22% of the state population was born somewhere else. About three quarters of these live in the Greater Guadalajara area. Those who migrate into the state are from MichoacÃ¡n, [[Mexico City]], [[State of Mexico]], [[Sinaloa]] and [[Baja California]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;migrainegi&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/jal/poblacion/m_migratorios.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=14|title= Movimientos migratorios |publisher= [[INEGI]] |language=Spanish |trans_title=Migration |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;  87% live in urban areas, above the national average of 78% for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;resumen&quot;/&gt; 

The state ranks third in socioeconomic factors. As of 2010, there were 1,801,306 housing units in the state. 94.2% have running water, 97.4% have sewerage, 99% have electricity. 25% of households are headed by women, with 65.6% occupied by nuclear families. 22.2% are occupied by extended families.&lt;ref name=&quot;vivienda&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/jal/poblacion/vivienda.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=14|title= Vivienda |publisher= [[INEGI]] |language=Spanish |trans_title=Housing |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

There is also emigration from the state, mostly to the United States. Jalisco is ranked seventh in Mexico for the number of people who leave for this country.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; A large percentage of Mexicans migrating to the United States come from Jalisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/jalisco.html |title=The History of Jalisco |first=Donna S. |last=Morales |coauthors=John P.

There are no official numbers for ethnic groups but as of 2005, the state has a population of 42,372 people who spoke an indigenous language.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; Eight out of every 1000 people speak an indigenous language, above the national average of six per 1000.&lt;ref name=&quot;resumen&quot;/&gt;  As of 2010, the most common indigenous language is [[Huichol language|Huichol]] with 18,409 speakers, followed by [[Nahuatl]] at 11,650, then [[PâurhÃ©pecha]] at 3,960 and variations of [[Mixtec language|Mixtec]] at 2,001. In total, 51,702 people over the age of five speak an indigenous language, which is less than one percent of the total population of the state. Of these indigenous speakers fourteen percent do not speak Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;diversidadinegi&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/jal/poblacion/diversidad.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=14|title= Diversidad |publisher= [[INEGI]] |language=Spanish |trans_title=Diversity |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities with the highest indigenous population in general are [[Mezquitic]], [[Zapopan]] and Guadalajara. Zapopanâs and Guadalajaraâs indigenous population is mostly made up of those who have migrated to the area for work.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

The [[Huichol people|Huichols]] are concentrated in the municipalities of Mezquitic and [[BolaÃ±os]] in the north of the state. In this same area are four of this ethnicityâs most important ceremonial centers, San AndrÃ©s Cohamiata, Santa Catarina CuexcomatitlÃ¡n, San SebastiÃ¡n TeponahuaxtlÃ¡n and Tuxpan de BolaÃ±os. The fifth, Guadalupe OctÃ¡n, is in Nayarit.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; The Huichols are of the same ethnic heritage as the [[Aztec]]s and speak a [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]]. They are best known for the preservation of their pre Hispanic [[shaman]]ic traditions. The Huichol romanticize their past, when game was plentiful and they were free to roam the vast mountain ranges and deserts of their homeland. This was a time of freedom for them, before they became tethered to the growing of maize. Agriculture is difficult in the mountainous areas they live. Elaborate ceremonies are enacted to help ensure cropsâ success. There are three basic elements in Huichol religion, which is corn, deer and the [[peyote]] cactus. The last is obtained by a yearly pilgrimage to an area called [[Wirikuta]], where it is harvested with great ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotey&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/183-the-huichol-of-jalisco-and-nayarit |title= The Huichol of Jalisco and Nayarit |first= Robert |last=Otey |date= May 1, 1997 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinct group living in the state is foreign temporary residents or expats, with overwhelming majority of which are from the United States and Canada, concentrated in and around the small town of [[Ajijic, Jalisco|Ajijic]] by [[Lake Chapala]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;youknew&quot;/&gt; The Lake Chapala area has the largest population of Americans outside of the country. The phenomenon began at the beginning of the 20th century. Cars with U.S. plates are not uncommon and many signs are in English and Spanish. There are no official numbers but the number of ex-pats in the area is estimated at 20,000. Half of these are from the US with most of the rest from Canada with some from European and Asian countries. Most are retirees although there is a notable artist community. In the winter, the number of foreigners in the area can reach 50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;zapata&quot;&gt; {{cite news |title= Ajijic, la California mexicana |author= BelÃ©n Zapata |url= http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/10/25/ajijic-la-california-mexicana |newspaper=CNN MÃ©xico |location=Mexico City |date=October 25, 2010 |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Ajijic, the Mexican California }} &lt;/ref&gt; Another area popular with foreigners is [[Lagos de Moreno]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt;

The appearance of these styles indicates a certain specialization of labor, with distinct settled cultures established by 1000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;aborigengob&quot;/&gt; The earliest settled cultures were centered on the site of ChupÃ­cuaro, Guanajuato, which has a large zone of influence from [[Durango]] east, crossing through modern Jaliscoâs north. Sites related to these cultures have been found in BolaÃ±os, Totoate, the BolaÃ±os River Canyon and Totatiche as well as other locations in the Los Altos Region.&lt;ref name=&quot;aborigengob&quot;/&gt; Cultures dating to the early part of the Christian era are distinguished by the use of [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|shaft tombs]], with major examples found in  AcatlÃ¡n de JuÃ¡rez, El Arenal and Casimiro Castillo. The use of this type of tomb is unkno
wn anywhere else in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aborigengob&quot;/&gt; 
In the 7th century, [[Toltec]] and [[Teotihuacan]] influence is evident in the area, with a dominion called Xalisco established by the Toltecs in 618.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contcronologiahistoriajalisco  |title= CronologÃ­a |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Chronology |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; The dominion was established through the military domination of the weaker local groups.  During this time, ceramics were improved and the working of gold, silver and copper appeared. More recent archeology of the area has produced evidence of larger cities, large scale irrigation and a kind of script used by various cultures of the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; The Toltec influence had a strong influence over religious development with deities formalizing into gods recognized by the later Aztec civilization such as [[Tlaloc]], [[Mictlantecuhtli]] and [[Quetzalcoatl]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;aborigengob&quot;/&gt; A number of cities were built during this time, including [[Ixtepete]], which show many features of [[Mesoamerica]]n architecture such as the building of pyramid bases, temples and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. However, these are sparse because there were very few communities of the size needed to support them. Stones used for building were often cut in angles and with relief such as those found in Tamazula and [[El Chanal]], Colima. Ixtepete from the tenth century has talud/tablero construction showing Teotihuacan influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;aborigengob&quot;/&gt; By 1112, the tribes dominated by the Toltecs rebelled and brought an end to the domination; however, the area would be conquered again in 1129, this time by the [[Chichimeca]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;

By 1325, the [[PâurhÃ©pecha]] had become dominant in parts of the state, but in 1510, the indigenous settlements of ZapotlÃ¡n, Sayula and Zacoalco pushed back the PâurhÃ©pecha during the [[Salitre War]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

One reason for ancient civilizations in the area was the large deposits of [[obsidian]] and it was the center of the TeuchitlÃ¡n nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;magiccircle&quot;/&gt; Evidence of the most advanced pre Hispanic cultures are found in the center and south of the state. The most important site is Ixtepete in [[Zapopan]] which dates from between the 5th and 10th centuries and shows Teotihuacan influence. Other sites include AtitlÃ¡n, El Mirador, El Reliz and Las Cuevas in San Juanito de Escobedo, Portezuelo in Ameca, Santa Cruz de BÃ¡rcenas in Ahualulco de Mercado, Santa QuiterÃ­a, Huaxtla and Las Pilas in El Arenal, La Providencia, Laguna Colorada, Las Cuevas, El Arenal and Palacio de Oconahua in EtzatlÃ¡n, Cerro de la Navaja, Huitzilipa and Xochitepec in Magdalena and the Ixtapa Ceremonial Center in Puerto Vallarta.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt; 
===Colonial period===
Over its history, the Jalisco area has been occupied by a variety of ethnicities including the Bapames, Caxcans, Cocas, Cuachilchils, Huichols, Cuyutecos, Otomis, Nahuas, Tecuejes, Tepehuans, Tecos, PâurhÃ©pechas, Pinomes, Tzaultecas and Xilotlantzingas. Some writers have also mentioned groups such as the Pinos, Otontlatolis, Amultecas, Coras, Xiximes, Tecuares, Tecoxines and Tecualmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; When the Spanish arrived the main ethnic groups were the Cazcanes, who inhabitd the northern regions near Teocalteche and the Lagos de Morenos and the Huichols, who also inhabited the northwest near HuejÃºcar and ColotlÃ¡n. Other groups included the Guachilchile in the Los Altos area, the Nahuatl speaking Cuyutecos in the west, the Tecuexes and Cocas near what is now Guadalajara and the Guamares in the east near the [[Guanajuato]] border.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; 

Shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztecs]] in 1521, the Spanish pushed west.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; They overpowered the PâurepÃ©cha in MichoacÃ¡n, converting their capital of [[Tzintzuntzan]] as a base to move further west.  One reason for the push towards the Pacific was to build ships and shipping facilities in order to initiate trade with Asia. Another draw was to find more mineral wealth as the PâurÃ©pecha had already developed copper working along with silver and gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;conquistagob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contconquistahistoriajalisco  |title= Conquista |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Conquest |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1522, [[CristÃ³bal de Olid]] was sent by [[HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s]] northwest from Mexico City into Jalisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;  Other incursions were undertaken by  Alonso de Avalos and  Juan Alvarez Chico in 1521, [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] in 1522 and Francisco CortÃ©s de San Buenaventura in 1524.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; The first area explored now belongs to the south of Jalisco down into what it now the state of Colima.&lt;ref name=&quot;conquistagob&quot;/&gt; In 1529, the president of the First Audencia in New Spain, [[NuÃ±o de GuzmÃ¡n]] came west from Mexico City with a force of 300 Spanish and 6,000 Indian allies, traveling through MichoacÃ¡n, Guanajuato, Jalisco and Sinaloa. At the end of 1531, GuzmÃ¡n founded the Villa del EspÃ­ritu Santo de la Mayor EspaÃ±as as the capital of the newly conquered western lands. The name was changed shortly thereafter to Santiago Galicia de Compostela.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; In 1531, GuzmÃ¡n ordered his chief lieutenant, Juan de OÃ±ate to found the Villa of Guadalajara, named after GuzmÃ¡nâs hometown in Spain. It was initially founded in what is now [[NochistlÃ¡n]] in [[Zacatecas]]. Construction began in 1532, but the small settlement came under repeated attacks from the Cazcanes until it was abandoned in 1533. The town of Guadalajara would move four times in total before coming to its modern site in 1542.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; 

Most of Jalisco was conquered by NuÃ±o de GuzmÃ¡n, who then sent expeditions from there into Zacatecas and Aguascalientes in 1530.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;  The first [[encomienda]]s were granted to the Spanish conquistadors in Nueva Galicia by NuÃ±o de GuzmÃ¡n and later by Antonio de Mendoza.&lt;ref name=&quot;colonizacion&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contcolonizahistoriajalisco  |title= Colonizacion |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Colonization |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;conquistagob&quot;/&gt; NuÃ±o de GuzmÃ¡n founded five Spanish settlements, San Miguel, Chiametla, Compostela, PurificaciÃ³n and Guadalajara to form the first administrative structure of the area. However, most of these settlements were too small to support the grand plans of many Spanish in America and attracted few settlers. By the end of the early colonial period, all of these settlements either disappeared or were moved to other locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;conquistagob&quot;/&gt; GuzmÃ¡n was named the first governor of the region and Franciscans established monasteries in TetlÃ¡n and Ajijic.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; 

GuzmÃ¡n was brutal to the local indigenous populations, sending many to slavery in the Caribbean and committing genocide in areas. This would eventually lead to his imprisonment in 1536 by viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; However, not only GuzmÃ¡n was to blame for subsequent indigenous hostility. The Spanish in Guadalajara and other locations began to take indigenous peoples as slaves in 1543.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; These Spanish in the area were looking to enrich themselves as fast as possible, following the success of the same of those who arrived first to the Mexico City area.  This led to abuses of the native populations, widespread corruption and confrontations between the Spanish and the indigenous and among the Spanish themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;colonizacion&quot;/&gt; Overwork and disease reduced the native population by about ninety percent between 1550 and 1650.&lt;ref name=&quot;colonizacion&quot;/&gt;

This would begin a history of conflict and uprising in the Jalisco area which would last from the 16th century to the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; Early uprisings include that in CuliacÃ¡n in 1533, of the Coaxicoria in 1538 and the Texcoixines and Caxcanes in 1541.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; Subduing the indigenous peoples proved difficult in general due to a lack of large dominion to co-opt as was done in the Mexico City area. In the early colonial period, it was not certain that the Spanish could impose its language or culture onto the native population. The initial effect of colonization was the influence of Nahuatl, as mestizos and indigenous from central Mexico had a greater impact on the local populations than the sparse Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;colonizacion&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;conquistagob&quot;/&gt; 

The most significant early revolt was the [[MixtÃ³n Rebellion]] in 1541. United under a leader named Tenamaxtli, the indigenous of the Jalisco area laid siege to Guadalajara. The Spanish provincial government under OÃ±ate could not withstand the assault and [[Pedro de Alvarado]] was sent to area from Mexico City but this initial attempt was thwarted. During a battle, a horse fell on Alvarado, mortally wounding him. Viceroy Mendoza then arrived with a force of 300 horsemen, 300 infantry, artillery and 20,000 Tlaxcalan and Aztec allies to recapture the territory held by the indigenous resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;  The MixtÃ³n War prompted Charles V to create the Audencia of Nueva Galicia which extended from MichoacÃ¡n and into the present states of Jalisco, Colima, and parts of Zacatecas, Durango and Sinaloa.&lt;ref name=&quot;conquistagob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;  An Indian Council was formed to advise the four members of the new Spanish government.&lt;ref name=&quot;colonizacion&quot;/&gt; The area was called Nueva Galicia because the Crown wanted to reproduce in the new lands a territory similar to that of Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;conquistagob&quot;/&gt; The seat of this colony was moved to Guadalajara in 1561, and it was made independent of Mexico City in 1575.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;

Most of the evangelization fell to regular clergy instead of monks.&lt;ref name=&quot;colonizacion&quot;/&gt; The bishopric of Guadalajara was established by Pope Paul II in 1546.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; 

The Chichimeca War began in 1550. In 1554, the Chichimecas attacked a Spanish caravan of sixty wagons at the Ojuelos Pass, carrying off 30,000 pesos of clothing, silver and other valuables. At the end of the century, the Spanish were able to negotiate a peace with most.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; There later uprisings such as in Guaynamota in 1584, in Acaponeta in 1593, one led by Cogixito in 1617, and one in Nostic in 1704. The last major colonial era insurrection occurred in 1801 led by an indigenous named Mariano.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; The last of the Chichimeca groups were ultimately defeated in 1591.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; However, these uprisings would gradually be overshadowed by the consolidation of political and economic power and peace treaties negotiated with indigenous groups such as the Coras and indigenous groups such as the Otomi were brought to settle.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;

The province of Jalisco was separated from MichoacÃ¡n in 1607 with the name of Santiago.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

Despite these conflicts, the 17th and 18th centuries brought development and economic prosperity to the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; In the colonial period, Guadalajara grew as the center of an agricultural and cattle produing area.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt; Guadalajara grew from about 6,000 people in 1713 to 20,000 in mid century to 35,000 at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;sigloxviiigob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contnuevagaliciahistoriajalisco  |title= Nueva Galicia en el Siglo XVIII |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Nueva Galicia in the 18th century |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; The regionâs ceramic tradition began in the early colonial period, with native traditions superimposed by European ones. The center of ceramic production was TonalÃ¡ due to its abundance of raw materials. The Guadalajara tradition became famous enough for wares to be exported to other parts of New Spain and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;colonizacion&quot;/&gt; The area was also important to the commerce of New Spain, as its strategic location funneled imported goods to other parts of the colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;

In 1786, New Spain was reorganized into twelve âintendenciasâ and three provinces. The Intendencia of Guadalajara included what is now Jalisco, Aguascalientes, Nayarit and Colima.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; Aguascalientes was separated from Jalisco in 1789.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

The [[University of Guadalajara]] was founded in 1792.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;
===Independence===
[[File:Prisciliano SÃ¡nchez (pintura).JPG|thumb|Painting of Prisciliano SÃ¡nchez, first governor of the state]]
At the beginning of the 19th century, Colima, parts of Zacatecas and the San Blas region (Nayarit)  were still part of the Intendencia of Guadalajara.&lt;ref name=&quot;sigloxviiigob&quot;/&gt; The area had relative freedom from Spanish colonial authorities and prospered with fewer trade restrictions. This, along with lingering indigenous resentment to Spanish rule since the 16th century, led it to be sympathetic to insurgent movements in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

Political instability in Spain, news of rebellions in South America and [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]]âs [[Grito de Dolores]] prompted small groups to begin fighting against Spanish rule. There were two main groups in Jalisco, one headed by Navarro, Portual and Toribio Huirobo in areas such as JalostotitlÃ¡n, Arandas, Atotonilco and La Barca and the other headed by JosÃ© Antonio Torres in Sahuayo, TizapÃ¡n el Alto, Atoyac and Zacoalco. Another insurrection occurred in 1812 along Lake Chapala with Mezcala Island as an insurgent fortress. Skirmishes between the indigenous there and royalist forces lasted until 1816, when lacking supplies, the insurgents accepted an amnesty.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;indgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contindependenhistoriajalisco  |title= Independencia |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Independence |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; Insurgent sympathies led to economic advantages for the Mexican born [[criollo]]s over the Spanish born with many Spanish families moving into the city of Guadalajara for safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;indgob&quot;/&gt;

Miguel Hidalgoâs army entered Jalisco during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. In 1810, Guadalajara JosÃ© Antonio Torres defeated the local royalist army and invited Hidalgo and his troops into the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;  Hidalgo was heading west from the State of Mexico, pursued by [[Felix MarÃ­a Calleja]] and his troops loyal to the Spanish king. Hidalgo entered the city in November of 1810. Hidalgoâs troops arrested many Spanish, and Hidalgo issued a decree abolishing slavery. Hidalgo was able to recruit soldiers for his army in the city, bringing it up to 80,000 men by the time Calleja arrived in January 1811. The rebels took up positions outside the city at a place called the Puente de CalderÃ³n. Royalist forces won this battle, ending the initial phase of the War and forcing Hidalgo to flee north. Hidalgo was captured and executed later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;indgob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;

The end of Hidalgo did not finish insurgent aspirations. The newspaper âDespertador Americanoâ was founded in 1811 in Guadalajara, sympathetic to the insurgent cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; However, no other major battles of the war would be fought in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;

Independence was won by [[AgustÃ­n de Iturbide]]âs [[Army of the Three Guarantees]], which would make Iturbide Mexicoâs first emperor, and making Jalisco one of a number of âdepartmentsâ which answered directly to Mexico City. This act broke Nueva Galiciaâs tradition of relative independence and provoked support for federalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; In 1821, a proposal for a âRepublic of the United States of AnÃ¡huacâ circulated in Guadalajara which called for a federation of states to allow for the best political union in Mexico. Much of these principles appeared with the 1824 Constitution which was enacted after Iturbide was dethroned.&lt;ref name=&quot;epocafedgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contepocafedhistoriajalisco  |title= Epoca federal |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Federalist era |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; Under this Constitution, Colima, Aguascalientes and Nayarit were still part of Jalisco. Its first governor was Prisciliano SÃ¡nchez.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; The new state was divided into eight cantons, Guadalajara, Lagos, La Barca, Sayula, EtzatlÃ¡n, AutlÃ¡n, Tepic and ColotlÃ¡n.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

Independence and the new Constitution did not bring political stability to Jalisco or the rest of the country. In the sixty-year period from 1825 to 1885, Jalisco witnessed twenty-seven peasant (primarily indigenous) rebellions. Seventeen of these uprisings occurred within one decade, 1855-64, and the year 1857 witnessed ten separate revolts.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;  Along with the rest of the county, Jaliscoâs states vacillated between state and department as Liberals (who supported federalism) and Conservatives fought for permanent control of Mexico. The peasant rebellions and other political acts were in favor of the Liberals and against centralize rule from Mexico City. Jalisco and other western states tried to form a coalition in 1834 against the rule of [[Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna]], but the leaders of Guadalajara were forced to resign under threat of violence instigated by Santa Anna sympathizers, keeping the state in line.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;  
During the [[Mexican-American War]], Jalisco planned defensive measures along with the states of [[State of Mexico|Mexico]], [[QuerÃ©taro]], [[San Luis PotosÃ­]], Zacatecas and Aguascalientes. However, although the [[U.S. Navy]] came as close as the port of [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], the state was not invaded before the war ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaiven&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contvaivenhistoriajalisco  |title= VaivÃ©n polÃ­tico, econÃ³mico |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Political, economic instability |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The national struggles between Liberals and Conservatives continued in the 1850s and 1860s, with Jaliscoâs government changing eighteen times between 1855 and 1864. While there was support for Federalism, most Liberals were politically aligned against the Church, which enjoyed strong support in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; During the [[Reform War]], [[Benito JuÃ¡rez]]âs Liberal government was forced out of Mexico City, arriving to Guadalajara in 1858. Despite this, Conservatives in power made Jalisco a department under direct rule from Mexico City. Jalisco remained mostly in Conservative hands until 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; The war was devastating to the stateÂ´s economy and forcing mass migrations. Of the thirty most important battles of the Reform War, twelve took place in Jalisco territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;

During the [[French Intervention in Mexico]], French forces supporting Mexicoâs second emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], entered the state in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;The emperor was mostly not supported by the people of the state and in the following year, French forces were defeated at the La Coronilla Hacienda in AcatlÃ¡n by Mexican General Eulogio Parra. This would allow Liberal forces to retake Guadalajara and push French forces out of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; One permanent result of the French occupation was the separation of the San Blas area into a separately administered military district, which would eventually become the state of Nayarit.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaiven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;

In the 1870s, more than seventy percent of the population lived in rural areas.(vaivÃ©n) By 1878, the state of Jalisco extended over 115,00km2 with twelve cantons, thirty department and 118 municipalities, accounting for ten percent of the countryâs population.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaiven&quot;/&gt; 

The end of the century would be dominated by the policies of Mexican President [[Porfirio DÃ­az]]. Livestock, which had been a traditional economic pillar of the state, began to decline during this time. The stateâs agricultural output also declined slightly relative to the rest of the country during the same period. However,  Guadalajara was one of the wealthiest cities in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;porfiriatogob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3ifEB8PY68gIwN_Ex9jAyM3fx9HlyBXA5MwQ6B8JE55ICCgOxxkH379IHkDHMDRAK9-Ex9zfT-P_NxU_YLcCIPMgHRFACUYhq0!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contporfiriatohistoriajalisco  |title= Porfiriato  |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Porfirio Diaz period |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Revolution to present===

Opposition to the DÃ­az regime was not organized in the state with only isolated groups of miners, students and professionals staging strikes and protests.(mexrebgob) Presidential challenger [[Francisco I. Madero]] visited Guadalajara twice, once in 1909 to campaign and the other in 1910 to organize resistance to the DÃ­az regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;
During the [[Mexican Revolution]], most of the rural areas of the state supported [[Venustiano Carranza]], with uprisings in favor of this army in Los Altos, Mascota, Talpa, CuquÃ­o, Tlajomulco, Tala, AcatlÃ¡n, EtzatlÃ¡n, Hostotipaquillo, Mazamitla, AutlÃ¡n, Magdalena, San AndrÃ©s and other places. However, these were isolated incidences and did not coalesce into an organized army to confront the federal government.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; Carranza vied for power in the state with [[Ãlvaro ObregÃ³n]] and [[Francisco Villa]] during the early part of the war with skirmishes among the various forces, especially between those loyal to Carranza and Villa.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

In 1914, Carranza supporter Manuel M. DiÃ©guez was named governor of Jalisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; DiÃ©guez persecuted the clergy, confiscated the property of the rich and imprisoned or executed the supporters of [[Victoriano Huerta]], whose forces he had pushed out of the city. Villa forced DiÃ©guez to flee and released imprisoned clergy, but he too took money from the rich to give to the poor in exchange for their support. However, by April 1915, Carranzaâs forces were on the rise again, pushing Villaâs forces out and reinstating DiÃ©guez as governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

Carranza gained the Mexican presidency in 1915, putting into place various social and economic reforms such as limits on Church political power and redistribution of agricultural lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mexrevgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_ashistoriajalisco/pj_contrevolucionhistoriajalisco  |title= RevoluciÃ³n Mexicana en Jalisco |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=December 3, 2009 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Mexican Revolution in Jalisco |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; One major consequence of the Revolution was the [[Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]]. This put severe constraints of the Church including the secularization of public education and even forbade worship outside of churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; One other result was the creation of Jaliscoâs current boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

The new restrictions on the Church by the Constitution were followed by further laws against the practice of religion which were not supported by many in the state. The lower classes split into those loyal to the church and not.&lt;ref name=&quot;mexrevgob&quot;/&gt; In particular were the âIntolerable Actsâ enacted by President [[Plutarco ElÃ­as Calles]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt; In 1926, a boycott was organized against these laws. In 1927, thirteen Catholic unions organized by priest Amando de Alba took up arms against the government in an uprising called the [[Cristero War]]. In 1928, Cristero leaders formed a rebel government in areas controlled by them, which was mostly in the Los Altos and far northern areas of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;The struggle resulted in ten different governors of the state between 1926 and 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt; At its height, the Cristeros had a force of about 25,000 until the conflict was officially ended in 1929, with sporadic outbreaks of violence continuing until the 1930s. This waning of hostilities was due to the lack of enforcement of the Calles laws, despite remaining on the books.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;

During this time, the modern [[University of Guadalajara]] was founded in 1926, but it was closed in 1933, then reopened in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;

More successful was the implementation was economic reforms begun by Carranza in 1915. By 1935, various agricultural lands were redistributed in the form of ejidos and other communal land ownership.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mexrevgob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cronologiagob&quot;/&gt;

From 1950s, the major concern for the state has been economic development. Most of the stateâs development has been concentrated in its capital of Guadalajara, resulting is economic inequality in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

In 1974, a guerilla group kidnapped former governor JosÃ© Guadalupe Zino but released him days after.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

[[Ciudad GuzmÃ¡n, Jalisco|Ciudad GuzmÃ¡n]], the center of the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|1985 earthquake]] that destroyed parts of Mexico City, received reconstruction aid. Another major earthquake affected the population of [[CihuatlÃ¡n]], Jalisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;
==Tourism==
[[File:Puerto vallarta skyline.jpg|thumb|View of Puerto Vallarta]]
The most important tourist areas in the state are [[Puerto Vallarta]], the Guadalajara metro area, the [[Costalegre]] and Los Altos Regions, [[Lake Chapala]] and the MontaÃ±a Region.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt;

The Guadalajara areaâs attractions are principally in the city itself and [[Zapopan]], [[Tlaquepaque]] and [[TonalÃ¡, Jalisco|TonalÃ¡]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt; Although the area is mostly urban there are also rural zones such as the Bosque La Primavera, El Diente and Ixtepete.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonacentroturgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://visita.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/ContZonaCentro |title= Zona Centro |publisher= Secretary of Tourism State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the most famous tourism attractions of the state is the â[[Tequila Express]]â which runs from Guadalajara to the town of [[Tequila, Jalisco|Tequila]]. This tour includes visits to tequila distilleries which often offer regional food in buffets accompanied by [[mariachi]] musicians and regional dancers.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt; The Tequila Valley area is known for the liquor named after it, made primarily from the [[blue agave]] plant. This valley is filled with tequila haciendas, archeological sites and modern distillation facilities. The main historical centers are the towns of Tequila, Cocula, Magdalena and TeuchitlÃ¡n. The aggregate of the agave fields in this area have been named a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;zonateqturgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://visita.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/ContZonaValleTequila |title= Zona Valle de Tequila  |publisher= Secretary of Tourism State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Valley of Tequila Zone |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Vallarta on Banderas Bay has beaches such as Los Muertos, Conchas Chinas, Las Glorias, Mismaloya, Punta Negra and Playa de Oro with large hotels, bars, restaurants and discoteques.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt; It has a population of about 250,000 and is the sixth largest city in Jalisco. This bay was a haven for pirates in the 16th century, but today it is one of Mexicoâs favored diving destinations because of the range of marine life and an average water temperature of between 19 and 23C. Expert level diving is practiced at Marieta Islands at the edge of the bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;youknew&quot;/&gt; On land, one major attraction is the cityâs nightlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonacostaturgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://visita.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/ContZonaCostera |title= Zona Costera |publisher= Secretary of Tourism State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Coastal area |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; Ecotourism and extreme sports such as [[bungee jumping]] and [[parasailing]] are available.&lt;ref name=&quot;youknew&quot;/&gt; 
Jaliscoâs coast includes other beaches such as Careyes, Melaque, BucerÃ­as and Tamarindo along with world famous Puerto Vallarta. The north part of the coast is called the [[Costalegre|Costalegre de Jalisco]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;zonacostaturgob&quot;/&gt; The Costalegre area is classified as a ecological tourism corridor with beaches such as Melaque, Barra de Navidad, Tenacatita, Careyes, El TecuÃ¡n, Punta Perula, Chamela and El Tamarindo. All of these have five-star hotels along with bars, restaurants and discoteques.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt; Many coast areas offer activities such as scuba, snorkeling, kayaking, and sports fishing. Majahuas is a marine turtle sanctuary in which visitors may liberate newly hatched turtles into the sea. Puerto Vallarta is known for its nightlife along with its beaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonacostaturgob&quot;/&gt;

The popularity of [[Lake Chapala]] began with President Porfirio DÃ­az who chose the area as a getaway in the late 19th century. This made it popular with Mexicoâs elite and established the lakeâs reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;porfiriatogob&quot;/&gt; Today, Lake Chapala is popular as a weekend getaway and the area is home to a large foreign population.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt;  The lake is a tourist attraction, on which people sail, fish and [[jet ski]]. The Lake is surrounded by a number of small rural towns including IxtlahuacÃ¡n de los Membrillos, OcotlÃ¡n and TizapÃ¡n el Alto. The area has been promoting ecotourism with activities such as [[rock climbing]], [[rappelling]], hiking, golf and tennis along with spas/water parks such as those in Chapala, Jamay, La Barca and Jocotepec.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonaribturgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://visita.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/ContZonaRiberaChapala |title= Zona Ribera de Chapala |publisher= Secretary of Tourism State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Chapala Lake area |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===âTypically Mexicanâ===
Many of things which are typically associated with Mexico have their origins in Jalisco. These include [[mariachi]]s, rodeos called [[charreada]]s and [[jaripeo]]s, dresses with wide skirts decorated with ribbons, the [[Mexican Hat Dance]], [[tequila]] and the wide brimmed sombrero hat.&lt;ref name=&quot;houston&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;generalidades&quot;/&gt;
===Mariachi and other music===
Mexicoâs best known music, mariachi, is still strongly associated with the state within Mexico, although mariachi bands are popular in many parts of the country. It is a myth that the origin of the name comes from the French word for marriage, as the word existed before the [[French Intervention in Mexico]]. Its true origin is unknown but one theory states that it has an indigenous origin. Another postulates that it comes from a local pronunciation of a common mariachi song âMarÃ­a ce son.â It is thought to have originated from the town of Cocula, and this kind of band, with variations, spread into Sinaloa, MichoacÃ¡n, Colima, Nayarit and Zacatecas. The music became most developed in and around the city of Guadalajara,&lt;ref name=&quot;mariachigob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_asfolklor/pj_conthistomariachijalisco  |title= Historia del Mariachi |author= Ricardo Ivo Ramirez Lamas |date=January 11, 2011 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=History of Mariachi |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; which has a Mariachi Festival in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt;

Other common folk music in the state is the [[jarabe]] and the [[son (music)|son]]. The jarabe is a type of music which began as a type of hymn especially to the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]. During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], this style was adopted by the insurgents for secular music as well. Some example of famous traditional songs in this style include âLos Enanos,â âEl Gato,â âEl Paloâ and âEl Perico.â  However, the most famous song is the âJarabe TapatÃ­o.â The word âjarabeâ is thought to come from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word âsharabâ which means syrup or something sweet. The musical style has its roots in [[Andalucia]], Spain and was transplanted to Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt; The jarabe is mostly associated with Jalisco but it is also popular in a number of other western states such as Nayarit, Colima and Guanajuato. Sons are particularly popular in the south of the state. Some traditional ones from Jalisco include El Son de la Madrugada, El Sion de las Alanzas, El Son del la Negra and El Son de las Copetonas.&lt;ref name=&quot;folklorico&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.folklorico.com/bailes/jalisco/sintesis-jalisco.html |title= Sones, Jarabes y Danzas |first=David |last=Rojas |publisher= Instituto Cultural &quot;Raices Mexicanas&quot;  |language=Spanish |trans_title=Sons, Jarabes and Dances |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;
===Traditional clothing and dance===
The traditional ranch style clothing of Jalisco is an imitation of Spanish dress that the women of the court wore. The original was heavy in expensive lace and ribbons but the Jalisco version focused on multicolored ribbons. The dresses were made from cotton instead of silk and brocades. The popularity of this dress grew during the [[Mexican Revolution]] to various parts of the country, as it was worn by a number of famous female soldiers of the time. Today, it is one considered one type of traditional Mexican dress. Today, this dress is mostly worn for dancing to sons and jarabes. The ribbon dress of Jalisco consists of a ample skirt in one of a number of bright colors. The bottom ruffle generally measures up to 35cm wide onto which are placed ten strips of ribbons about 1.5cm wide in colors that contrast with that of the skirt. The blouse is usually of the same color as the skirt with sleeves extending to the elbows and also decorated with ribbons, especially around the collar. This and other type of folk dance is most often worn on special occasions when traditional dance is performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;folklorico&quot;/&gt;
===Tequila===
Tequila is a type of hard liquor which comes from a small region of Jalisco, which is made primarily from the blue agave plant. Its the most famous type of [[mezcal]] produced in Mexico, and the only mezcal which is produced industrially with strict standards.  The tequila industry supports large scale cultivation of the blue agave, with about 200,000 people employed through it directly or indirectly. It is named after a small town northwest of the city of Guadajalara in the center of where it is produced and the native region of the blue agave. The plant was used in pre Hispanic times to make a ceremonial drink. The Spanish used the sweet heart of the mature plant, called a piÃ±a (literally pineapple) to create a fermented and distilled beverage. The first person to have official permission to make and sell the liquor was [[JosÃ© Antonio Cuervo]] in 1758. In 1888, the first license to export was given to the Sauza family. The drinkâs popularity rose with the introduction of the railroad, facilitating its shipping.  It comes in three styles, white (unaged), reposado (aged for two or three months) and aÃ±ejo which is aged for over a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;histeqgob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_asfolklor/pj_conttequilajalisco  |title= Historia del Tequila |author= Ricardo Ivo Ramirez Lamas |date=January 11, 2011 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=History of Tequila |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastronomy===
The pre Hispanic diet of the states fish from the various lakes, various birds including wild turkey and small native dogs often eaten with salsas made from a wide variety of ground or crushed chili peppers. The Spanish introduced European staples of bread, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dairy products, rice and various fruits and vegetables. The European settlers quickly adopted another of local foodstuffs such as chili peppers and tomatoes to create hybrid dishes such as [[barbacoa]] and [[puchero]]. Accepting corn as a staple, the Spanish created todayâs enchiladas, quesadillas and gorditas. They also adopted pre Hispanic [[tamale]]s, but these were significantly altered with the addition of large quantities of lard.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt; [[TonalÃ¡, Jalisco|TonalÃ¡]] is said to be the origin of [[pozole]], and it is claimed that the local Tonaltecas originally prepared it with human flesh as  religious rite.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt;

Classic dishes for the area include local versions of pozole, sopitos, [[menudo]], [[guacamole]], cuachala, [[birria]], pollo a la valenciana and [[tortas ahogadas]]. Birria is a meat stew made with roasted chili peppers, spices and with either goat, mutton or beef. Tortas ahorgadas are pork sandwiches on French rolls which are covered in a tomato and chili pepper sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt;  Common street foods include sopes, tacos, enchiladas tapitÃ­os.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gastrogob&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.jalisco.gob.mx/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzb2djr1AXEwMDF383A0_3MEdXxwBDD0dLc6B8pFm8T4iPh7FXkJGBv4mPsYGRm7-Po0uQqwEQENAdDrIPv36QvAEO4GiAV7-Jjzl--TBDfT-P_NxU_YLcCINMT11HAH03lqQ!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfNktDM0pVRDQwMERPRjBJR1ZBRUFQMUhBOTc!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/portaljalisco2009/contenidos/gobierno+del+estado+jalisco/jalisco/pj_asfolklor/pj_contgatronomiajalisco  |title= GastronomÃ­a en Jalisco |author= Rosa MarÃ­a Espiritu Miguel |date=January 11, 2011 |publisher= State of Jalisco |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Gastronomy in Jalisco |accessdate=September 9, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; Tapalpa is known for its Borrego al pastor (grilled mutton); Cocul and Ciudad GuzmÃ¡n are known for birria; the Lake Chapala area is known for a dish called charales and Guadalajara is known for tortas ahogadas.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt; Sweets include alfajor, squash seeds with honey, coconut candies, [[buÃ±uelo]]s and fruits conserved in syrup. Drinks include tequila, aquamiel, [[pulque]], [[tejuino]] and fruit drinks.&lt;ref name=&quot;gastrogob&quot;/&gt; Raicillia is a drink made along the coast. Tuba is made in AutlÃ¡n de Navarro. [[Rompope]] is made in Sayula and Tapalpa and tejuino is most common in the center of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccul&quot;/&gt;

Along the coast, seafood is prominent. Some popular seafood preparations include shrimp breaded with coconut, and rollo del mar, which is a fish fillet stuffed with chopped shrimp and octopus, rolled and sometimes wrapped in bacon and covered in either a chili pepper or almond sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt; Puerto Vallarta has become a gourmet dining attraction as the site of the Mexican Gastronomy Fair held each November. It was a fishing village before a tourist destination and simple grilled fish dish called pescado zarandeado is still popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;khursh&quot;/&gt;
===Religion===
Jalisco is home to three highly venerated images of the Virgin Mary which were created in the 16th century and referred to as âsisters.â These are the images found in [[San Juan de los Lagos]], [[Zapopan]] and [[Talpa de Allende|Talpa]], with the first two the best known in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;vzapopan&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2640-pilgrimage-with-la-virgen-de-zapopan-from-a-house-in-the-sun-by-dane-chandos|title= Pilgrimage with La Virgen de Zapopan from &quot;A House in the Sun&quot; |first= Dane |last=Chandos  |date= February 4, 2007 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The image at San Juan de los Lagos has made this small town one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Mexico, receiving about seven million visitors each year from all parts of the country. While this image is most often referred to by the place name, she is also called by her native name âCihiuapilliâ which mean âGreat Lady.â Her church is filled with folk paintings called âex votosâ or âretablos,â which are created to petition the Virgin or to offer thanks for favors received. This image of the Virgin Mary dates from the early 16th century and believed to have been brought here by missionaries from [[MichoacÃ¡n]]. The first major miracle attributed to the image occurred in 1623 when a child was revived after being accidentally stuck with spears. The first building dedicated to the image was constructed in 1643, but the current one was finished in 1779. In 1904, the pope granted permission to crown the image and the church received official cathedral status in 1972. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the image in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;rferguson&quot;/&gt;

The [[Virgin of Zapopan]] has her own basilica in the city of that name, but the image spends about half the year traveling to the various parishes of Guadalajara proper.   According to legend, thunderstorms in the Guadalajara area were so strong that they killed church bell ringers. The origin of the images yearly travels was to project these communities from destruction. Today, the Virgin of Zapopan still travels to the cathedral of Guadalajara every year to spend the rainy season there from June through September. While in Guadalajara, the image travels among the various churches there, accompanied by dancers, musicians and other faithful. In early October, she is returned to her Basilica with much fanfare as a long procession in which the image is carried by foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;vzapopan&quot;/&gt;

The image travels in a carriage followed plumed black horses, but the carriage is pulled by human volunteers. The procession is less than five miles but it takes long to pass through the crowds that lines the route. The Basilica is an important pilgrimage site, including those from [[Ajijic, Jalisco|Ajijic]] who come each year traveling on food or donkey for three or four days to arrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;vzapopan&quot;/&gt;

During the 19th century, the university was in turmoil because of the struggle between Liberals and Conservatives, changing name between Instituto de Ciencias del Estado and the Universidad de Guadalajara, depending on who was in power. The name was settled to the latter in 1925 under reorganization. In the 1980s, it was reorganized again and expanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisuguad&quot;&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.udg.mx/historia |title= Historia  |publisher= University of Guadalajara  |language=Spanish |trans_title=History |accessdate=September 9, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;
