'''Covina''' is a small city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]] about {{convert|22|mi|km}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] region. The population was 47,796 at the 2010 census, up from 46,837 at the 2000 census.  The city's slogan, &quot;One Mile Square and All There&quot; was coined when the incorporated area of the city was only (some say slightly less than) one square mile, making it the smallest city in area in the country.

Covina is often confused with [[West Covina, California|West Covina]] which is actually larger in both area and population, located to its south and westside. [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] lies to the west, as well as the [[unincorporated area]] of Vincent, and the city of Baldwin Park. [[Azusa, California|Azusa]] and [[Glendora, California|Glendora]] are to the north, the unincorporated community of [[Charter Oak, California|Charter Oak]] to the northeast, [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]] to the east, the unincorporated areas of Ramona and Via Verde, and the city of [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] to the southeast.

== History ==
The city was founded in 1882 by Joseph Swift Phillips, on a {{convert|2,000|acre|km2}} tract that was purchased from the [[John Edward Hollenbeck]] holdings.  The City of Covina was named by a young engineer, Frederick Eaton, who was hired by Phillips to survey the area. Impressed by the way in which the valleys of the adjacent San Gabriel Mountains formed a natural cove around the vineyards that had been planted by the region's earlier pioneers, Eaton merged the words &quot;cove&quot; and &quot;vine&quot;, and in 1885, created the name Covina for the new township.&lt;ref name=&quot;cove&quot;&gt;http://www.covina.com/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's slogan, &quot;One Mile Square and All There&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;cove&quot;/&gt; was coined by Mrs F. E. Wolfarth, the winner of a 1922 slogan contest sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce, when the incorporated area of the city was only (some say slightly less than) one square mile, making it the smallest city in area in the country.

The city was incorporated in 1901. It would be [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[grapefruit]] trees, not vineyards, that would soon blanket the area and make it famous.  By 1909, the city was the third largest orange producer in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;cove&quot;/&gt; and it still claimed to have &quot;the best oranges in the world&quot; as late as the 1950s.  Since [[World War II]], however, the orange groves have been largely replaced by single family and multiple family dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Leonard, and Dale Pitt. ''Los Angeles A to Z : an encyclopedia of the city and county.'' Berkeley, Calif. : University of California Press, 1997.  ISBN 0-520-20274-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The Covina Valley Historical Society maintains an extensive archive illustrating the city's history in the 1911-built Firehouse Jail Museum, Covina's first municipal building, located immediately behind City Hall in Covina's Old Town.&lt;ref name=&quot;cove&quot;/&gt;

==Currently==
Today, Covina claims to have the largest movie multiplex in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. Opened in 1997, the Covina [[AMC Theatres|AMC 30]] located at Arrow Hwy. and [[California State Route 39|Azusa Ave.]] is one of the busiest theatres in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecdev.covina.ca.us/hotspots/ed-nazusa.htm|title=North Azusa|accessdate=2007-05-04|work=City of Covina: The Tour|quote=During the summer of 1999 the Covina AMC 30 Theater was ranked 28th in the nation in attendance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[movie theater]] was built on the site of a former [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] building.

It has been a sister city of [[Jalapa, Mexico]] since 1964. A replica of a giant stone [[Olmec]] head, located in front of the city police station, was given to the city in 1989 by the state of [[Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vine&quot;&gt;http://www.covinacalifornia.com/local/cityinfo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the election held March 6, 2007, nine candidates ran for two of the five positions on the city council.  The voters then rejected the 10-year renewal of a 6% Utility Users Tax the city has had since 1999.  Only 3,797 ballots were cast out of 21,633 registered voters.  The Utility Users Tax was subsequently renewed at the June 3, 2008 election which attracted 5,032 voters.

2008 marked both the opening as well as charter season of the [[Covina Center for the Performing Arts]], a newly remodeled multimillion dollar theatrical venue in downtown Covina.

==Christmas Massacre==
{{Main|Covina massacre}}
On December 24, 2008, a shooting and arson occurred in Covina, in which a man, Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, dressed in a Santa Claus costume entered a Christmas party at his ex-wife's residence and proceeded to open fire.

At least 9 people were believed to have been killed as a result of the massacre.  Nine bodies were found in ruins of 'Santa massacre' home.  After the attack, Pardo put on his street clothes and drove his  rental car to his brother's house in Sylmar, approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} away from the crime scene, where he was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/26/santa.shooting/index.html|title=Coroner: Ninth body found in ruins of 'Santa massacre' home|accessdate=2008-12-26|work=CNN|quote=The car was parked outside a Sylmar, California, home where Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, 45, committed suicide hours after he opened fire at a holiday party and then started a raging blaze inside a Covina, California, home, police said. | date=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
