In [[computing]], '''klibc''' is a minimalistic subset of the [[C standard library|standard C library]] developed by [[Peter Anvin|H. Peter Anvin]]. It was developed mainly to be used during the [[Linux startup process]], and it is part of the [[early user space]], i.e. components used during kernel startup, but which do not run in [[kernel mode]].&lt;ref name=readme&gt;http://free-electrons.com/kerneldoc/latest/early-userspace/README&lt;/ref&gt; These components do not have access to the standard library (usually [[GNU C Library|glibc]]) used by normal [[userspace]] programs.

The development of klibc library was part of the 2002 effort to move some Linux initialization code out of the kernel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Corbet]], (November 2002) [http://lwn.net/Articles/14776/ Initramfs arrives], [[LWN.net]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=103622506919278&amp;w=2 |title=initramfs merge, part 1 of N  |date=2002-02-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=103626389507412&amp;w=2 |title= Re: initramfs merge, part 1 of N  |date=2002-02-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its documentation, the klibc library is optimized for correctness and small size.&lt;ref name=readme/&gt; Because of its design, klibc is also technically suitable for [[embedded software]] in general, and even some full-featured programmes such as the [[Korn_shell#Variants|MirBSD Korn Shell]]. Unlike many other [[open source]] libraries, klibc is licensed under the full [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license, which (unlike [[LGPL]]) imposes itself on any code linked with it. (This only applies to klibc as a whole due to embedding some Linux kernel derived files; most of the library source code is actually&lt;ref&gt;[http://git.kernel.org/?p=libs/klibc/klibc.git;a=blob;f=usr/klibc/LICENSE;h=aa6d7a7e37015f95f852ceb29cc417519919d806;hb=75216b5c62b3b3635ae0c6cf7ee47757d7d99100 usr/klibc/LICENSE as of klibc-1.5.18]&lt;/ref&gt; available under [[BSD licenses|a BSD licence]] from UCB or the [[Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer]].) This may limit its applicability to commercial embedded software.&lt;ref name=p286&gt;Hagen, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Linux startup process, klibc is loaded from within a temporary [[tmpfs|RAM file system]], [[initramfs]]. It is incorporated by default into initial RAM file systems that are created by the &lt;code&gt;mkinitramfs&lt;/code&gt; script in [[Debian]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.debian.org/source/lenny/klibc Debian Lenny Klibc] retrieved February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. Furthermore it has a set of small Unix utilities that are useful in [[early user space]]: [[cpio]], [[Debian Almquist shell|dash]], fstype, [[mkdir]], [[mknod]], mount, nfsmount, run-init, etc. all using the ''klibc'' library. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://git.kernel.org/?p=libs/klibc/klibc.git;a=tree;f=usr;h=f3224b691ca990bed5081ea31106bed47ce23653;hb=HEAD|title=libs/klibc/klibc.git / tree }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  An alternate strategy is to include everything in one executable, like [[BusyBox]], which determines the program via arguments or a [[Symbolic_link|symlink]].
