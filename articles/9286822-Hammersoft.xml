This list includes information on the '''records and statistics''' relating to '''[[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]''' football club, and includes information on honours, appearances, goalscorers and managers. 

==Honours==
In the all-time table since the league's inception in 1888, Wolves sit in the all-time top four, behind only [[Manchester United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in terms of all time league position.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSSF&quot;&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engprof-alltime.html &quot;England â Professional Football All-Time Tables 1888/89â2008/09&quot;] ''RSSSF.com'' (Retrieved: 2 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumulatively, they are the eighth most successful club, behind [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], with 13 major trophy wins (see [[Football records in England#Most successful clubs overall (1871 â present)|English Football Records]]). 

Uniquely, they are the only club to have won titles in five different Football League divisions,&lt;ref&gt;Ingle, Sean; Hughes, Matt; [http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,534448,00.html &quot;Wolves: The only team to have won it all&quot;] ''[[The Guardian|Guardian.co.uk]]'', 9 August 2001 (Retrieved: 17 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1988, their Fourth Division title glory made them the first team to have been champions of all four professional leagues in English football, although this feat has since been matched by [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 1992 and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] in 1996. They remain the only club to have won all top national cups ([[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup]] and [[Football League Trophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wolves completed the set when they won the (then) Sherpa Van Trophy in 1988. Apart from four FA Cups (1893, 1908, 1949, 1960), three First Division championships (1953â54, 1957â58, 1958â59) and two League Cups (1974, 1980), the Wolves set also includes the Charity Shield (beating Forest in 1959), the FA Youth Cup (1958) and the Anglo-Scottish Cup (1971). Having also won the Second Division (1931â32, 1976â77), the Third Division (1988â89), the Third Division North (1923â24) and the Fourth Division (1987â88)&quot;, only the renamed Championship remained and was duly completed (2008â09). Bryant, Tom; Roopanarine, Les; Chesterton, George; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/oct/03/theknowledge &quot;KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE&quot;] ''[[The Guardian|Guardian.co.uk]]'', 3 October 2007 (Retrieved: 12 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 

During their [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.#The Stan Cullis era &amp; the birth of European football|main period of success in the 1950s]], Wolves were the first team to pass the 100-goal mark for three seasons in succession, in 1957â58, 1958â59 and 1959â60 seasons. They were also the first team to score 7,000 league goals&lt;ref name=club&gt;{{cite web|title=Club Records|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/History/0,,10307~60475,00.html|publisher=Wolves Official Site|accessdate=22 December 2010|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trail only [[Manchester United]] in terms of total league goals as of the end of the 2010â11 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSSF&quot;/&gt;
