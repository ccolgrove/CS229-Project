===PS3 Slim and console rebranding===
Following speculation that a 'slim' model was in the pipeline Sony officially announced the PS3 CECH-2000 model on August 18, 2009 at the Sony [[Gamescom]] press conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3SlimPressRelease&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Entertainment on PS3 has a new look |publisher=PlayStation UK |url=http://uk.playstation.com/games-media/news/articles/detail/item229653/Entertainment-on-PS3-has-a-new-look/ |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sony Announces Slim PS3 - It Lives This September! |publisher=Kotaku |url=http://kotaku.com/5339968/ |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its features are a slimmer form factor and quieter noise when powered on. It was released in major territories by September 2009. As part of the release for the slim model, the logo was changed from the &quot;[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]] font&quot; and capitalized ''PLAYSTATION 3'' to a more traditional [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[PlayStation 2]] like 'PlayStation 3' logo with &quot;PS3&quot; imprinted on the console.  Along with the console and logo redesign, the boot screen of all consoles changed from &quot;Sony Computer Entertainment&quot; to &quot;PS3 PlayStation 3&quot;, with a new chime and the game start splashscreen being dropped. The cover art and packaging of games has also been changed to reflect the redesign.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3&quot;/&gt;

==Console configurations==
===System unit===

The PlayStation 3 is convex on its left side, with the PlayStation logo upright, when vertical (the top side is convex when horizontal) and has a glossy black finish. PlayStation designer Teiyu Goto stated that the [[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]-font-inspired logo ''&quot;was one of the first elements [[SCEI]] president [[Ken Kutaragi]] decided on and the logo may have been the motivating force behind the shape of PS3&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=161017| title=Kutaragi &quot;insisted&quot; on Spider-Man font for PS3| date=2007-03-29| publisher=computerandvideogames.com| accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayStation 3 uses the Sony, [[Toshiba]], [[IBM]]-designed [[Cell microprocessor]] as its [[CPU]], which is made up of one 3.2&amp;nbsp;GHz PowerPC-based &quot;Power Processing Element&quot; (PPE) and eight Synergistic Processing Elements (SPEs).&lt;ref name=&quot;CELLSpecs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-01.ibm.com/chips/techlib/techlib.nsf/techdocs/D21E662845B95D4F872570AB0055404D/$file/2053_IBM_CellIntro.pdf|format=PDF| title=Cell Introduction| publisher=IBM| accessdate=2008-01-14}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth SPE is disabled to improve chip yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/cluster/ps3/ |title=Sony PlayStation 3 Cell Processor| publisher=North Carolina State University| accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GameDevelMag&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Optimizing Cell Code | author=Martin Linklater | work=Game Developer Magazine, April 2007 | pages=15â18 | quote=To increase fabrication yelds, Sony ships PlayStation 3 Cell processors with only seven working SPEs.

On March 22, 2007, SCE and [[Stanford University]] released the [[Folding@home]] project for the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/folding/en/|title=Folding@home|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program allows PS3 owners to lend the computing power of their consoles to help study the [[physical process]] of [[protein folding]].

===Original model===

It was rumored that the Cell processors in the third-generation PS3s (40&amp;nbsp;GB, 2008 80&amp;nbsp;GB and 160&amp;nbsp;GB) would move from a 90&amp;nbsp;nm process to the newer 65&amp;nbsp;nm process,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cell65LowerPower&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/30/40gb-ps3-features-65nm-chips-lower-power-consumption/ |title=40GB PS3 features 65nm chips, lower power consumption (30% less) |publisher=[[Engadget]] |author=Conrad Quilty Harper |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which SCEI CEO Kaz Hirai later confirmed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/833/833700p1.html |title=New PS3 Uses 65nm Process |publisher=ign |author=Anoop Gantayat |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later to 45&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Slim model===

The redesigned, slimmer version of the PlayStation 3 (commonly referred to as the &quot;PS3 Slim&quot; and officially branded &quot;PS3&quot;) is currently the only model in production.

The PS3 slim also includes support for [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface#CEC|CEC]] (more commonly referred to by its manufacturer brandings of BraviaSync, VIERA Link, EasyLink etc.) which allows control of the console over HDMI by using the TV's remote control. The PS3 Slim no longer has the &quot;main power&quot; switch like the previous PS3 models, similar to redesigned [[PlayStation 2#slimline|slimline PlayStation 2]]. Support for emulation to play PS2 titles is not present in the Slim version, however shortly after the release of the PS3 slim, Sony announced a new series of PS2 remasters called [[Classics HD]] as in PS2 and PSP titles remastered in HD for the PS3 with trophies added and sometimes [[PlayStation Move]] compatibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3SlimPressRelease&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3SlimSpecs&quot;/&gt;

==Controllers and accessories==

[[File:DualShock3-in-Hand.jpg|thumb|[[DualShock 3]] controller in hand]]
Numerous accessories for the console have been developed. These accessories include the wireless [[Sixaxis]] and [[DualShock 3]] controllers, the [[Logitech Driving Force GT]], the [[PlayStation 3 accessories#Logitech Cordless Precision Controller|Logitech Cordless Precision Controller]], the [[PlayStation 3 accessories#Official PS3 Bluetooth Blu-ray remote|BD Remote]], the [[PlayStation Eye]] camera, and the [[PlayTV]] [[DVB-T]] tuner/[[digital video recorder]] accessory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Accessories|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080113064221/http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Accessories|archivedate=2008-01-13 |title=PlayStation 3 Accessories| publisher=SCEA| accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PlayTV press release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=PlayTV on PlayStation 3 explained |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Europe ''via'' Kotaku |date=August 22, 2007 |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/clips/play-tv-on-ps3-explained-292541.php| accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Sony's 2006 E3 press conference, the (then) standard wireless [[Sixaxis]] controller was announced. The controller was based on the same basic design as the [[PlayStation 2|PlayStation&amp;nbsp;2's]] [[DualShock 2]] controller but was wireless, lacked vibration capabilities, had a built-in accelerometer (that could detect motion in three directional and three rotational axes; six in total, hence the name Sixaxis) and had a few cosmetic tweaks.

At its press conference at the 2007 [[Tokyo Game Show]], Sony announced the [[DualShock 3]] (trademarked DUALSHOCK 3), a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with vibration capability included.&lt;ref name=&quot;DualShock 3 PR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/070920be.html|title=DualShock 3 Wireless Controller With Rumble Feature To Be Introduced For PlayStation 3|accessdate=2007-09-20|date=2007-09-20|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hands-on accounts describe the controller as being noticeably heavier than the standard Sixaxis controller and capable of vibration forces comparable to the DualShock 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;TGS DualShock 3 hands-on&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6179170.html|title=TGS '07: Spot On&amp;nbsp;â The Dual Shock 3|accessdate=2007-09-20|date=2007-09-19|publisher=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in Japan on November 11, 2007;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/vibe/dualshock-3-getting-all-ceramic-white-for-japan-308546.php| title=DualShock 3 will launch on November 11 in Japan| date=2007-10-08| publisher=Kotaku| accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in North America on April 5, 2008;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Sony+Announces+New+80GB+PS3+Bundle+DualShock+3+Red+PSP/article10868.htm| title=Sony Announces New 80GB PS3 Bundle, DualShock 3, Red PSP| date=2008-02-26| publisher=Daily Tech| accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia on April 24, 2008; in New Zealand on May 9, 2008; in mainland Europe on July 2, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/821/821289p1.html |title=TGS 07: DualShock 3 announced| date=2007-09-19| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on July 4, 2008.

During [[E3 09|E3 2009]], Sony unveiled plans to release a motion controller later to be named [[PlayStation Move]] at GDC 2010. It was released on September 15, 2010 in Europe; September 19, 2010 in North America and October 21, 2010 in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;E3 2010 PR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scei.co.jp/corporate/release/100616ae.html |title=PlayStation Move motion controller to hit worldwide market starting this September |date=2010-06-16 |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2010, Sony announced an official surround sound system for the PS3 through the official PlayStation [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElYL8EBItWc |title=The official surround sound system for your PS3 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
[[File:Yellow Light of Death- PlayStation 3.png|thumb|upright|The PlayStation 3 illuminating the yellow light, indicating a non-specific failure]]

A 2009 study by [[SquareTrade]], a warranty provider, found a two-year failure rate of 10% for PlayStation 3s.&lt;ref&gt;Sands A, Tseng V. (2009). [http://www.squaretrade.com/pages/xbox360-ps3-wii-reliability-08-2009/ Game Console Failure Rates: Wii 9 times more reliable than Xbox 360, 4 times more than PS3]. SquareTrade.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ars Technica]], the number of PlayStation 3 consoles that have experienced failure is well within the normal failure rates in the consumer electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuchera |first=Ben |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/02/xbox-360-failure-rates-worse-than-most-consumer-electornics.ars |title=Xbox 360 failure rates worse than most consumer electronics |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellow light of death===
In September 2009, the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Watchdog (TV series)|Watchdog]]'' aired a report investigating the &quot;yellow light of death&quot; (YLOD) issue, a yellow light that indicates a non-specific hardware failure which renders the system unusable. According to the report the failure was likely to occur after 18-24 months, whilst the standard Sony warranty is one year in duration, after which PlayStation 3 owners can pay Sony a set fee for a refurbished console.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009WatchdogReport&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/watchdog/2009/09/playstation3_and_the_yellow_li.html#more |title=BBC &quot;Watchdog&quot; report on &quot;Yellow Light of Death&quot; |publisher=BBC |author=Rob Unsworth |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2010-05-31 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sony claimed that, according to its statistics of returned consoles approximately only 0.5% of consoles were reported as showing the YLOD.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009WatchdogReport&quot;/&gt; In response to the program Sony issued a document criticizing the program's accuracy and conclusions; specifically that the faults were evidence of a manufacturing defect. The document also complained that the report had been innapropiate in tone, and might do damage to Sony's brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/sony-tackles-bbc-over-ps3-failure-report | title = Sony tackles BBC over 'PS3 failure' report| work = www.gameindustry.biz|date = September 17, 2009|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8263063.stm |title=Sony rebuts BBC PlayStation claim| work = news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=[[BBC News]] |author= |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leap year bug===
On March 1, 2010 (UTC), many of the original (non-Slim) PlayStation 3 models worldwide were experiencing errors related to their internal system clock. The error had a multitude of symptoms. Initially, the main problem seemed to be the inability to connect to the [[PlayStation Network]]. However, the root cause of the problem was unrelated to the PlayStation Network, since even users who had never been online also had problems playing installed offline games (which queried the system timer as part of startup) and using system themes. At the same time many users noted that the console's clock had gone back to December 31, 1999. The event was nicknamed the '''ApocalyPS3''', a play on the word ''[[wikt:apocalypse|apocalypse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/03/apocalyps3/ |title=ApocalyPS3: Buggy Clock Drives PlayStation 3 Haywire &amp;#124; GameLife |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[error code]] displayed was typically 8001050F and affected users were unable to sign in, play games, use dynamic themes and view/sync trophies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/sony/7344758/Sony-PS3-network-glitch-affects-thousands.html Sony PS3 network glitch affects thousands] The Daily Telegraph, March 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem only resided within the 1st through to the 3rd generation original PS3 units while the newer &quot;Slim&quot; models were unaffected due to different internal hardware for the clock.

Sony confirmed that there was an error and stated that they were narrowing down the issue and were continuing to work to restore service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/01/playstation-network-status-update/ |title=PlayStation Network Status Update â PlayStation.Blog.Europe |work=blog.eu.playstation.com|publisher = [[PlayStation.Blog]] |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2 (UTC), 2010, owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/01/ps3-issues-apparently-resolved-game-on/ |title=PS3 issues apparently resolved, game on |publisher=Engadget |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a [[leap year]], due to a bug in the [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] method of storing the date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10461881-1.html|title=PS3 console errors fixed, leap year bug to blame|author=Jeff Bakalar|publisher=[[CNET.com]]|date=2010-03-01|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/technology/02sony.html|title=Error Blocked PlayStation 3 From Using Its Network|author=Hiroko Tabuchi|publisher=New York Times|date=2010-03-01|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some users, the hardware's operating system clock (mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the internal clock) needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet.

On June 29, 2010, [[Sony]] released [[PS3 system software]] update 3.40, which improved the functionality of the internal clock to properly account for leap years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/ps3/features/ps_ps3_softwareupdates.html|title=PlayStation 3 Features Software Updates|accessdate=2010-09-03|publisher=[[Sony]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PlayStation Network outage===

{{main|PlayStation Network outage}}
On April 20, 2011, Sony shut down the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a prolonged interval, revealing on April 23 that this was due to &quot;an external intrusion on our system&quot;. Sony later revealed that the [[personally identifiable information|personal information]] of 77 million users might have been taken, including: names; addresses; countries; email addresses; birthdates; PSN/Qriocity logins, passwords and handles/PSN online IDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSN/Qriocity Service Update&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2011/04/26/psnqriocity-service-update/|title=PSN/Qriocity Service Update â PlayStation.Blog.Europe|date={{Date|2011-04-26|mdy}}|accessdate={{Date|2011-05-05|mdy}}|publisher= [[PlayStation.Blog]] |work = blog.eu.playstation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that it was possible that users' profile data, including purchase history and billing address, and PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSN/Qriocity Service Update&quot;/&gt; There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled out, and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSN/Qriocity Service Update&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2011/04/28/playstation-network-and-qriocity-outage-faq/|title=PlayStation Network and Qriocity Outage FAQ â PlayStation.Blog.Europe|date={{Date|2011-04-28|mdy}}|accessdate={{Date|2011-05-05|mdy}}|publisher=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |work = blog.eu.playstation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number from the back of the credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2384561,00.asp?kc=PCRSS03069TX1K0001121|title=PlayStation Network Credit Card Data Encrypted, Sony Says|author=Chloe Albanesius|date=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the incident, Sony announced a &quot;Welcome Back&quot; program, 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, two free downloadable PS3 games, and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesley Yin-Poole |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-05-01-psn-sony-outlines-welcome-back-gifts |title=PSN: Sony outlines &quot;Welcome Back&quot; gifts News - PlayStation 3 - Page 1 |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2011-05-01 |accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/05/playstation-network-nears-restoration-users-get-id-theft-protection/1 |title=PlayStation Network nears restoration; users get ID theft protection - Game Hunters: In search of video games and interactive awesomeness - USATODAY.com |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating system==
{{See also|PlayStation 3 system software#Compatible media formats|l2=PlayStation 3 system software&amp;nbsp;â Compatible media formats}}

===System software===
{{Main|PlayStation 3 system software}}

Sony has included the ability for the operating system, referred to as ''System Software'', to be updated.&lt;ref name=&quot;SystemUpdate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Features/SystemUpdate| title=PlayStation.com - PLAYSTATION3 - Features - SystemUpdate| publisher=SCEA| accessdate=2010-02-04}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updates can be acquired in several ways:
* If the PlayStation 3 has an active [[Internetworking|Internet connection]], updates may be downloaded directly from the PlayStation Network to the PS3 and subsequently installed.  Systems with active Internet will automatically check online for software updates each time the console is started.
* Using an external PC, a user may download the update from the official PlayStation website, transfer it to portable [[Computer storage|storage media]] and install it on the System.
* Some game discs come with [[system software]] updates on the disc.  This may be due to the game requiring the update in order to run.  If so, the software may be installed from the disc.&lt;ref name=&quot;SystemUpdate&quot;/&gt;

The original PlayStation 3 also included the ability to install other operating systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/osinstall.html |title=Install Other OS |accessdate=2007-04-25 |year=2007 |work=PlayStation 3 User's Guide |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Linux on the PlayStation 3|Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6162316.html?sid=6162316|title=Yellow Dog Linux launches for PS3|date=2006-11-27|first=Emma|last=Boyes|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not included in the newer slim models and was removed from all older PlayStation 3 consoles with the release of firmware update 3.21 in April 2010. The functionality is now only available to users of original consoles who choose not to update their system software beyond version 3.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;nolinuxphat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/29/linux-support-dropped-from-ps3-firmware-3-21/|title=Linux support dropped from PS3 firmware 3.21|accessdate=2010-03-29|date=2010-03-29|publisher=Joystiq|author=Andrew Yoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Graphical user interface====
{{Main|XrossMediaBar#PlayStation 3 XMB|l1=XrossMediaBar&amp;nbsp;â PlayStation 3 XMB}}

The standard PlayStation 3 version of the XrossMediaBar (pronounced [[Cross Media Bar]], or abbreviated XMB) includes nine categories of options. These are: ''Users'', ''Settings'', ''Photo'', ''Music'', ''Video'', ''Game'', ''Network'', ''PlayStation Network'' and ''Friends'' (similar to the [[PlayStation Portable]] media bar). A tenth ''TV'' category is displayed between ''Music'' and ''Video'' if [[PlayTV]] or torne is installed or if the console meets certain criteria to access select [[Internet television|catch-up television]] services. By default, the ''[[#What's New|What's New]]'' section of ''PlayStation Network'' is displayed when the system starts up. The PS3 includes the ability to store various master and secondary user profiles, manage and explore photos with or without a musical [[Slideshow|slide show]], play [[music]] and copy [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CD]] tracks to an attached [[data storage device]], play movies and video files from the hard disk drive, an optical disc (Blu-ray Disc or DVD-Video) or an optional USB [[mass storage]] or Flash card, compatibility for a USB keyboard and mouse and a [[web browser]] supporting in/compatible file download function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://us.playstation.com/ps3/features/ps_ps3_connectivity.html| title=PlayStation 3 Features Connectivity| publisher=Sony| accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Universal Plug and Play|UPnP]] media will appear in the respective audio/video/photo categories if a [[UPnP AV MediaServers|compatible media server]] or [[Digital Living Network Alliance|DLNA]] server is detected on the local network.  The Friends menu allows mail with emoticon and attached picture features and [[Videoconferencing|video chat]] which requires an optional [[PlayStation Eye]] or [[EyeToy]] webcam.&lt;ref name=&quot;about PSN&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/About/PSN| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080112145945/http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/About/PSN| archivedate=2008-01-12| title=About the PlayStation Network| publisher=Sony| accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Network menu allows [[online shop]]ping through the [[PlayStation Store]] and connectivity to the PlayStation Portable via Remote Play.&lt;ref name=&quot;about PSN&quot; /&gt;

===Digital rights management===
The PlayStation 3 console protects certain types of data and uses digital rights management to limit the data's use.  Purchased games and content from the PlayStation Network store are governed by PlayStation's Network Digital Rights Management (NDRM). The NDRM allows users to access the data from up to 5 different PlayStation 3's that have been activated using a user's PlayStation Network ID.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDRM&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://us.playstation.com/support/answer/index.htm?a_id=1030| title=PlayStation Knowledge Center| publisher=Sony| accessdate=2010-07-06|quote= Can multiple PlayStationÂ®Network accounts access PlayStationÂ®Store content that was purchased by a different account?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PlayStation 3 also limits the transfer of copy protected videos downloaded from its store to other machines and states that copy protected video &quot;may not restore correctly&quot; following certain actions after making a backup such as downloading a new copy protected movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Restore Video&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://us.playstation.com/support/answer/index.htm?a_id=1562| title=PlayStation Knowledge Center| publisher=Sony| accessdate=2010-07-06|quote = How do I back up and restore videos that were downloaded from the PlayStationÂ®Store?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photo management===
;Photo Gallery
[[File:PhotoGalleryPS3.png|thumb|Photo Gallery main menu]]
Photo Gallery is an optional application to view, create and group photos from the PS3, which is installed separately from the system software at 105&amp;nbsp;MB. It was introduced in system software version 2.60 and provides a range of tools for sorting through and displaying the system's pictures. The key feature of this application is that it can organize photos into groups according to various criteria. Notable categorizations are colors, ages, or [[facial expression]]s of the people in the photos. Slideshows can be viewed with the application, along with music and playlists. The software was updated with the release of system software version 3.40 allowing users to upload and browse photos on [[Facebook]] and [[Picasa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EU3.40&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = PS3 System Software Update â 3.40| accessdate = 2010-06-28| url = http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/28/ps3-system-software-update-v3-40-and-playstation-plus-available-later-today/| work = blog.eu.playstation.com| publisher = [[PlayStation.Blog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Video on demand
In addition to the video service provided by the [[Sony Entertainment Network]] the PlayStation 3 console has access to a variety of third party video services, dependant on region:

Since June 2009 [[VidZone]] has offered a free music video streaming service in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200924/3858/function.mysql-connect| title =VidZone gives PlayStation 3 a free music video jukebox| author =Stevie Smith | date =12 June 2009| work = www.thetechherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/25629/532/| title = VidZone review - The online music video jukebox| author =Mike Bantick| date = 12 June 2009| work = www.itwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=73133 VidZoneâ¢ comes to PLAYSTATIONÂ®3 providing free music videos ANNOUNCEMENT LINK --&gt; In October 2009, Sony Computer Entertainment and [[Netflix]] announced that Netflix would also be available on the PlayStation 3 for in the United States; initially had to use a free Blu-ray disc to access the streaming video.

===PlayStation Portable connectivity===
{{Main|Remote Play|PlayStation Store (PC) for PSP}}
The [[PlayStation Portable]] can connect with the PlayStation 3 in many ways, including in-game connectivity. For example, ''[[Formula One Championship Edition]]'', a racing game, was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time [[rear-view mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/705/705926p1.html |title=E3 2006: Formula One 06 Resurfaces |accessdate=2007-01-21 |last=Haynes |first=Jeff |date=2006-05-08 |publisher=IGN PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store, transfer and play them on the PSP as well as the PS3 itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/downloadable-ps1-games-hit-the-psp-provided-you-have-a-ps3-220164.php |title=Downloadable PS1 Games Hit The PSP (Provided You Have a PS3) |accessdate=2007-01-21 |last=Deleon |first=Nicholas |date=2006-12-07 |publisher=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154561 |title=Phil Harrison Talks Downloadable PS1 Games on PS3 |accessdate=2007-04-03 |last=Kennedy |first=Sam |date=2006-10-20 |publisher=1up.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to use the [[Remote Play]] feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games, remotely on the PSP over a network or internet connection.

Sony has also demonstrated the PSP playing back video content from the PlayStation 3 hard disk across an [[Mobile ad-hoc network|ad-hoc]] wireless network. This feature is referred to as Remote Play located under the browser icon on both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable. Remote play has since expanded to allow [[remote access]] to the PS3 via PSP from any [[wireless access point]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/740/740689p1.html |title=PSP and PS3 Play Together |accessdate=2007-01-21 |last=Nix |first=Marc |date=2006-10-20 |publisher=IGN PSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===OtherOS support===
{{main|OtherOS}}
The PlayStation 3 initially shipped with the ability to install an alternative operating system alongside the main system software; [[Linux]] and other [[Unix]] based operating systems were available. The hardware allowed access to six of the seven ''Synergistic Processing Elements'' of the [[Cell microprocessor]], but not the [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer']] graphics chip.

The 'OtherOS' functionality was not present in the updated PS Slim models, and the feature was subsequently removed  from previous versions of the PS3 as part of the machine's [[firmware]] update version 3.21 which was released on April 1, 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PSA: PS3 Firmware Update 3.21 available now |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/01/psa-ps3-firmware-update-3-21-available-now/ |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony cited security concerns as the rationale. The firmware update 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PS3 Firmware (v3.21) Update |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/03/28/ps3-firmware-v3-21-update |date=2010-03-28 |accessdate=2010-03-28| work = blog.us.playstation.com| publisher = [[PlayStation.Blog]]| quote = .. but due to security concerns, Sony Computer Entertainment will remove the functionality through the 3.21 system software update}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal caused some controversy; as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products, and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sony Steals Feature From Your PlayStation 3|url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/sony-steals-feature-from-your-playstation-3|date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OtherOSLawsuits&quot;&gt;Sources:

===PlayStation Plus===
{{Main|PlayStation Plus}}
'''PlayStation Plus''' (commonly abbreviated ''PS+'' and occasionally referred to as ''PSN Plus'') is a premium PlayStation Network subscription service that was officially unveiled at [[E3 2010]] by Jack Tretton, President and CEO of SCEA. Rumors of such service had been in speculation since Kaz Hirai's announcement at TGS 2009 of a possible paid service for PSN but with the current PSN service still available. Launched alongside PS3 firmware 3.40 and PSP firmware 6.30 on June 29, 2010, the paid-for subscription service provides users with enhanced services on the PlayStation Network, on top of the current PSN service which is still available with all of its features. These enhancements include the ability to have demos, game and system software updates download automatically to the PlayStation 3. Subscribers also get early or exclusive access to some [[betas]], game demos, premium downloadable content and other PlayStation Store items. North American users also get a free subscription to [[Qore (PlayStation Network)|Qore]]. Users may choose to purchase either a one-year or a three-month subscription to PlayStation Plus.{{-}}

===PlayStation Store===
{{Main|PlayStation Store}}
[[File:PlayStationStore-Screenshot.png|thumb|The European PlayStation Store on the PlayStation 3.]]
The '''PlayStation Store''' is an online virtual market available to users of [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s PlayStation 3 (PS3) and [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) [[Video game console|game consoles]] via the [[PlayStation Network]]. The Store offers a range of [[downloadable content]] both for purchase and available free of charge. Available content includes full games, add-on content, [[Game demo|playable demos]], [[Theme (computing)|themes]] and game and movie [[Trailer (film)|trailers]]. The service is accessible through an icon on the [[XrossMediaBar|XMB]] on the PS3 and PSP. The PS3 store can also be accessed on the PSP via a [[Remote Play]] connection to the PS3. The PSP store is also available via the PC application, [[Media Go]]. As of September 24, 2009, there have been over 600 million downloads from the PlayStation Store worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/102/1027747p1.html|title=TGS 2009: Keynote Address|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayStation Store is updated with new content each Tuesday in North America, and each Wednesday in [[PAL]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PSN Thursday no more: say hello to PSN Tuesday and Wednesday|url=http://joystiq.com/2010/04/15/psn-thursday-no-more-say-hello-to-psn-tuesday-and-wednesday/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 this was changed from Thursdays to allow PSP games to be released digitally, closer to the time they are released on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/04/23/psn-store-day-move-not-due-to-360/|title=PSN Store Day Move Not Due To 360|publisher=Thesixthaxis.com|date=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===What's New===
[[File:Whats-new.png|thumb|The ''What's New'' screen]]
What's New was announced at Gamescom 2009 and was released on September 1, 2009, with PlayStation 3 system software 3.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;Firmware_3.00&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.playstation.com/games-media/news/articles/detail/item229653/Entertainment-on-PS3-has-a-new-look/|title=PlayStation Games &amp; Media News: â Entertainment on PS3 has a new look|publisher=SCEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was to replace the existing [Information Board], which displayed news from the PlayStation website associated with the user's region. The concept was developed further into a major PlayStation Network feature, which interacts with the [Status Indicator] to display a ticker of all content, excluding recently played content (currently in North America and Japan only).

The system displays the What's New screen by default instead of the [Games] menu (or [Video] menu, if a movie was inserted) when starting up. What's New has four sections: &quot;Our Pick&quot;, &quot;Recently Played&quot;, latest information and new content available in PlayStation Store. There are four kinds of content the What's New screen displays and links to, on the sections. &quot;Recently Played&quot; displays the user's recently played games and online services only, whereas, the other sections can contain website links, links to play videos and access to selected sections of the PlayStation Store.

The PlayStation Store icons in the [Game] and [Video] section act similarly to the What's New screen, except that they only display and link to games and videos in the PlayStation Store, respectively.{{-}}

''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]'' and ''[[MotorStorm]]'' were the most successful titles of 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/6736809.stm| title=Cathedral row over video game| date=2007-06-09| publisher=BBC| accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/motorstorm-completes-hat-trick| title=Motorstorm completes hat-trick| date=2007-04-05| publisher=Eurogamer| accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both games subsequently received sequels in the form of ''[[Resistance 2]]'' and ''[[MotorStorm: Pacific Rift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Evolution Studios | year=2007 |title=''MotorStorm 2 sequel confirmed for PS3, in development at Evolution Studios''| url= http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2007/05/15/motorstorm-2-sequel-confirmed-for-ps3-in-development-at-evolution-studios.htm | work=www.videogamesblogger.com | accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequel1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Insomniac Games | year=2007 | title=''Full Moon Show Podcast'' | url=http://www.insomniacgames.com/podcast/podcast.php | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927212526/http://www.insomniacgames.com/podcast/podcast.php | archivedate=2007-09-27 | work=www.insomniacgames.com | accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[History of E3#2007 (July 11â13)|E3 2007]], Sony was able to show a number of their upcoming video games for the PlayStation 3, including ''[[Heavenly Sword]]'', ''[[Lair (video game)|Lair]]'', ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction]]'', ''[[Warhawk (PlayStation 3 game)|Warhawk]]'' and ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]''; all of which were released in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. They also showed off a number of titles that were set for release in [[2008 in video gaming|2008]] and [[2009 in video gaming|2009]]; most notably ''[[Killzone 2]]'', ''[[Infamous (video game)|Infamous]]'', ''[[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]'', ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' and ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/game-critics-awards/best-of-e3-2007-winners-284570.php |title=Best of E3 2007 Winners |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of third-party exclusives were also shown, including the highly anticipated ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6177964.html?action=convert&amp;om_clk=latestnews&amp;tag=latestnews;title;1 |title=Haze now Fully PS3 Exclusive, 360 &amp; PC Dropped |accessdate=2007-08-11 |last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |date=2007-07-11 |publisher=Gamespot}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other high-profile third-party titles such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto 4]]'', ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 5]]''.

Sony have since launched their [[budget range]] of PlayStation 3 titles, known as the [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits range]] in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/07/28/ps3-greatest-hits-launch-today/ |title=PS3 Greatest Hits Launch Today |publisher=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |work=blog.us.playstation.com |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Platinum range]] in Europe and Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193450|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080717234048/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=193450|archivedate=2008-07-17 |title=PS3 Platinum range in UK from August |publisher=Computerandvideogames.com |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Best range]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/ps3/ps3thebest/ |title=PlayStation 3 the best |publisher=Jp.playstation.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the titles available in the budget range include ''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]'', ''[[MotorStorm]]'', ''[[Uncharted: Drakes Fortune]]'', ''[[Rainbow Six: Vegas]]'', ''[[Call Of Duty 3]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Ninja Gaiden Sigma]]''.

When they are put on the &quot;[[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]]&quot; list the new unused copies retail for $30 USD and are re-shipped in a new red case.

As of September 30, 2010, there have been 350.6 million games sold for the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/data/bizdataps3soft_sale_e.html |title=PLAYSTATION3 Worldwide Software Unit Sales |accessdate=2010-05-23 |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereoscopic 3D===
{{main|List of 3D PlayStation 3 games}}
In December 2008, the [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of [[Blitz Games]] announced that it would bring [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3D gaming and movie viewing to the [[Xbox 360]] and PlayStation 3 with its own technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Blitz-Games-Introduces-True-Stereoscopic-3D-For-Xbox-360-And-PS3-13735.html|title=Blitz Games Introduces True Stereoscopic 3D For Xbox 360 And PS3 |publisher=Cinemablend.com |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was first demonstrated publicly on the PS3 in January 2009 at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]]. Journalists were shown ''[[Wipeout HD]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]'' in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/01/ces-2009-sony-teases-with-high-quality-ps3-3d.ars|title=Sony teases with high-quality PS3 HD|publisher=Ars Technica|date=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; System software update 3.30 has prepared the PS3 for stereoscopic 3D gaming, while 3.50 prepared it for 3D films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/04/21/ps3-3-30-system-software-update/|title=PS3 3.30 System Software Update|publisher=[[PlayStation.Blog]]| work = blog.us.playstation.com|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firmware update 3.30 officially allows PS3 titles to be played in 3D, requiring a compatible display for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/39216/Sony-dates-PS3-3D-update|title=Sony dates PS3 3D update|publisher=MCV|date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the game itself must be programmed to take advantage of the 3D technology, titles may be patched to add in the functionality retroactively. Titles with such patches include ''Wipeout HD'', ''[[Pain (video game)|Pain]]'', and ''[[Super Stardust HD]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by JC Fletcher on May 31st 2010 3:15PM |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/05/31/first-ps3-3d-game-updates-available-in-japan-june-10/ |title=First PS3 3D game updates available in Japan on June 10 |publisher=Joystiq |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homebrew==
===PlayStation Jailbreak===
In August 2010, '''[[PlayStation Jailbreak]]''', a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] device that allows execution of unsigned code (such as backup games and [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]]) on the PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techie-buzz.com/gaming/ps3-jailbreak-usb-dongle.html |title=PS3 Jailbreak is Finally Here |publisher=Techie Buzz |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device included a piece of software called ''Backup Manager'', which allows users to copy original games from the Blu-ray Disc to either the internal hard disk drive (HDD) or an external HDD ([[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] formatted).

The original device was soon [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] and many clones, such as ''PS3 Key'' and ''PS3 Break'', have since been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/new-ps3-break-ps3-jailbreak-copy-%E2%80%93-usb-break-coming-soon |title=New PS3 Break PS3 Jailbreak Copy â USB Break is coming soon |publisher=Press Release Point |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[open source]] implementation known as ''PS Groove'' was also released, which allows the same functionality to be achieved using various external devices, such as calculators and portable media players, via a USB connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5628137/ps3-jailbreak-code-hits-internet-no-stopping-it-now |title=PS3 Jailbreak Code Hits Internet, No Stopping It Now |publisher=Kotaku |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open source clone of ''Backup Manager'', known as ''Open Manager'', which mimics and expands upon the original's features has also been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todosoluciones.es/2010/10/01/open-manager-1-0-ps3/ |title=Open Manager 1.0 PS3 |publisher=Todo Soluciones |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2010-10-06 |language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private key compromised===
At the 2010 [[Chaos Communication Congress]] (CCC) in Berlin, a group calling itself ''fail0verflow'' announced it had succeeded in bypassing a number of the PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3's security measures, allowing unsigned code to run without a dongle. They also announced that it was possible to recover the [[private key]] used by Sony to sign software, due to an improper implementation of the [[Elliptic Curve DSA]] (ECDSA), but chose not to publish this key because it was not necessary to run homebrew software on the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bendel|first=Mike|title=Hackers Describe PS3 Security As Epic Fail, Gain Unrestricted Access|publisher=Exophase.com|date=2010-12-29|url=http://exophase.com/20540/hackers-describe-ps3-security-as-epic-fail-gain-unrestricted-access/|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of this key would allow anyone to sign their code and therefore be able to run it on any PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3 console. This would also mean that no countermeasures could be taken by Sony without rendering old software useless, as there is no distinction between official and homebrew software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fildes |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12116051 |title=iPhone hacker publishes secret Sony PlayStation 3 key |publisher=BBC |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 2011, [[George Hotz|geohot]] published the aforementioned private key, as well as a [[Hello world program]] for the PS3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5723105/hacker-claims-to-have-the-ps3s-front-door-keys |title=Hacker Claims To Have The PS3's Front Door Keys |publisher=Kotaku |date=2011-01-03 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psx-scene.com/forums/f6/geohot-here-your-ps3-root-key-now-hello-world-proof-74255/|title=Geohot: Here is your PS3 Root Key! - Now with &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; proof!|publisher=(psx-scene administrator)}} (original GeoHot posting to psx-scene with key and hello world program)&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment America filed lawsuits against both ''fail0verflow'' and ''geohot'' for violations of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] and [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act|CFAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-sony-vs-jailbreak-hackers|title=Sony to Geohot: See you in court|date={{Date|2011-01-12|mdy}}|accessdate={{Date|2011-01-12|mdy}}|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/46739945/Motion-for-TRO |title=Motion for TRO |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Custom firmware (CFW)===
To allow for homebrew using the newly{{When|date=April 2011}} discovered encryption keys, several modified versions of system update 3.55 have been released by Geohot and others.  The most common feature is the addition of an &quot;App Loader&quot; that allows for the installation of homebrew apps as signed DLC-like packages. Although Backup Managers could run at that time, they could not load games at first even though some success had been made by making backups look like DLC games and then signing them. An LV2 patch was later released to allow Backup Managers to load game backups and was later integrated into the Managers themselves so that it doesn't have to be run whenever the PS3 is restarted. This CFW jailbreak method is now the trend in jailbreaking the PS3 because it doesn't need any special hardware and can be permanently installed onto any PS3.

[[PS3 System Software]] updates v3.56 and v3.60 added security measures to prevent creation of custom firmwares, building on previous updates which blocked the PS Jailbreak exploit. However, users may choose not to update and games requiring a firmware version above 3.55 can be patched to run on v3.55 or lower. Soon after v3.60 was released, updates to the [[Playstation Network]] were conducted to block any methods known that allowed PSN access on firmwares older than the latest official firmware (v3.66 currently), thereby blocking users who chose not to update.

A custom firmware known as ''&quot;Rebug&quot;'',&lt;ref&gt;The site [http://rebug.me/ rebug.me] is credited in an April 26 [http://www.eurogamer.es/articles/2011-04-26-posible-causa-de-la-caida-de-psn Eurogamer.es] report.&lt;/ref&gt; released on March 31, gave retail PS3s most of the options and functionality of debug/developer PS3 units.  One week later, tutorials became available allowing users to download PSN content for free, using fake (rather than stolen) credit card numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/299243/news/playstation-network-taken-down-to-halt-piracy/|title=PlayStation Network taken down to halt piracy?|publisher=computerandvideogames.com|date=2011-04-25}} and linked articles&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A possible example of such a tutorial at [http://www.ps3hax.net/showthread.php?p=192155 ps3hax.net] was deleted approximately April 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  One April 12 report described hackers using the jailbroken firmware to access the dev-PSN to get back on games like [[Call of Duty]], with widespread reports of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/playstation-3-hackers-using-developer-network-to-access-psn/|title=PlayStation 3 Hackers Using Developer Network to Access PSN|date=2011-04-12|publisher=attackofthefanboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some sources blamed ''Rebug'' for the subsequent intrusion to Sony's private developer network, ''Time''{{'s}} &quot;Techland&quot; described such theories as &quot;highly--as in looking down at the clouds from the tip-top of Mount Everest highly--speculative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/04/26/did-custom-%E2%80%98rebug%E2%80%99-firmware-kill-sony%E2%80%99s-playstation-network/|title=Did Custom 'Rebug' Firmware Kill Sony's PlayStation Network?|author=Matt Peckham|date=2011-04-26|publisher=techland.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, [[Kaz Hirai]], [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Sony Computer Entertainment, suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, &quot;the next fiscal year starts in April and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing&quot; and that &quot;[profitability] is not a definite commitment, but that is what I would like to try to shoot for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN0737530820080107?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technology-media-telco-SP|title=Sony's Hirai eyes PS3 profit as costs decline|accessdate=2008-04-22|date=2008-01-07|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, market analysts [[Nikko Citigroup]] have predicted that the PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/ps3-profitable-by-august-say-nikko-citigroup-analysts|title=PS3 profitable by August, say Nikko Citigroup analysts|accessdate=2008-04-22|date=2008-04-21|publisher=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for the PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing the PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;financialtimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1c46ad2e-5678-11dd-8686-000077b07658.html |title=Sony sets 150m sales target for PS3 |author=Chris Nuttall |date=2008-07-20 |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nofi |url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2009/01/29/sonys-game-division-in-profit/ |title=Sonyâs Game Division In Profit |publisher=TheSixthAxis |date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Original model===
Early PlayStation 3 reviews soon after launch were critical of its high price and lack of quality launch games, but commended the system's hardware capabilities and potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Review, Trusted Reviews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/video-games/review/2007/03/23/Sony-PlayStation-3/p15 |title=Sony PlayStation 3 |author=Riyad Emeran |publisher=Trustedreviews.com |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=698 |title=First review: PlayStation 3 |date=2007-03-01 |author=Danny Allen |publisher=PC Advisor |accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a series of price revisions, Blu-ray's victory over [[HD DVD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm |title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses |publisher=[[Toshiba]] |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the release of several well received titles, the system received better reviews. [[IGN]] judged the PlayStation 3 to have the best game line-up of 2008, based on their review scores in comparison to those of the Wii and Xbox 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea |first=Cam |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/939/939461p2.html |title=IGN: Aussie Console Showdown 08: PS3 vs. Wii vs. 360 |publisher=Ps3.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PS3 was given the number-eight spot on ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' magazineâs list of &quot;The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006&quot;, where it was criticized for being &quot;Late, Expensive and Incompatible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/128265-4/the_top_21_tech_screwups_of_2006.html|title=The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006 |accessdate=2007-02-03 |last=Tynan |first=Dan |date=2006-12-20 |publisher=PC World}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] ranked the PS3 as the top item in a feature on game-related [[Public relations|PR]] disasters, asking how Sony managed to &quot;take one of the most anticipated game systems of all time and&amp;nbsp;â within the space of a year&amp;nbsp;â turn it into a hate object reviled by the entire internet&quot;, but added that despite its problems the system has &quot;untapped potential&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamesradar.com/ps3/f/the-top-7-pr-disasters/a-2007031912215876016/g-20060314115917309058/p-7

PR disasters|accessdate=2007-03-21 |last=Reparaz |first=Mikel |date=2007-03-21 |publisher=GamesRadar}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Business Week]]'' summed up the general opinion by stating that it was &quot;more impressed with what [the PlayStation 3] could do than with what it currently does&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_664610.htm |title=PS3: Soon to Be a Great System |author=Cliff Edwards |publisher=[[Business Week]] |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers have also found the machine difficult to program for. In 2007, [[Gabe Newell]] of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] said &quot;The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted&quot;.  He continued &quot;I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=155309| title=Valve: PS3 a &quot;total disaster on so many levels&quot;| date=2007-01-15| first=Stuart| last=Bishop| publisher=computerandvideogames.com| accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that they are interested in developing for the console and are looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qj.net/qjnet/playstation-3/valve-open-to-work-with-ps3-development.html|title=Valve open to work with PS3 development

He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of ''Portal 2'' the best console version on the market.

[[Activision Blizzard]] CEO [[Bobby Kotick]] has criticized the PS3âs high development costs and inferior [[attach rate]] and return to that of the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]]. He believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console.  In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' Kotick stated &quot;I'm getting concerned about Sony; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they don't make it easy for me to support the platform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article6531367.ece| title = Sony should beware â Activision chief is not simply playing games| date = 2009-06-19| first = Dan |last = Sabbagh | publisher = timesonline.co.uk| accessdate = 2009-07-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, &quot;It's expensive to develop for the console, and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better. Games generate a better [[return on invested capital]] (ROIC) on the Xbox than on the PlayStation.&quot; Kotick also claimed that Activision Blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed. â[Sony has] to cut the [PS3âs retail] price, because if they don't, the attach rates are likely to slow. If we are being realistic, we might have to stop supporting Sony.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.develop-online.net/news/32222/Kotick-slams-PS3-for-high-dev-costs| title=Kotick slams PS3 for âhighâ dev costs| date=2009-06-19| first=Rob| last=Crossley| publisher=develop-online.| accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement, notably from developer [[Bioware]] who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move, and referred to the statement as &quot;silly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=219357 | title = BioWare: Activision PS3 comment &quot;silly and biased towards what is popular.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, [[Kazuo Hirai]], [[chairman]] of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] argued for the choice of a complex architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/hirai-were-the-official-industry-leader| title = Hirai: We're the &quot;official&quot; industry leader |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|quote=''We don't provide the easy to program for console that [developers] want, because easy to program for means that anybody will be able to take advantage of pretty much what the hardware can do, so then the question is what do you do for the rest of the nine-and-a-half years?''| date=2009-01-20| accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the initial negative press, several websites have given the system very good reviews. [[CNET]] United Kingdom praised the system saying, &quot;the PS3 is a versatile and impressive piece of home-entertainment equipment that lives up to the hype [...] the PS3 is well worth its hefty price tag.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4370234 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070328170257/http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4370234 |archivedate=2007-03-28 |title=PS3 Reviewed |accessdate=2007-04-21 |last=Carnoy |first=Dave |year=2007 |month=March |publisher=CNet.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNET awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10 and voted it as its number one &quot;must-have&quot; gadget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/must-have-gadgets/ |title=Top 10 Must-haves |accessdate=2007-02-22 |author=CNET Staff |date=2006-11-21 |publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/consoles/sony-playstation-3-60gb/4505-10109_7-31355103.html |title=Sony PlayStation 3 (60 GB) Reviews |accessdate=2007-02-03 |last=Carnoy |first=David |date=2006-11-14 |publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, both ''Home Theater Magazine'' and ''Ultimate AV'' have given the system's Blu-ray playback very favorable reviews, stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone Blu-ray Disc players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheatermag.com/discplayers/1206playstation3/ |title=Sony PlayStation 3 |accessdate=2007-02-22 |last=Chiarella |first=Chris |year=2006 |month=December |work=Home Theater Magazine |publisher=Primedia Magazines, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/hddiscplayers/1206ps3blu/index3.html |title=PlayStation3 Blu-ray Disc Player |accessdate=2007-02-22 |last=Buettner |first=Shane C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |month=December |work= |publisher=Primedia Magazines, Inc. |pages=4 of 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hexus Gaming'' reviewed the PAL version and summed the review up by saying, &quot;as the PlayStation 3 matures and developers start really pushing it, weâll see the PlayStation 3 emerge as the console of choice for gaming.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=8185&amp;page=6 |title=Review : Sony PlayStation 3 |accessdate=2007-04-25 |last=Haywood |first=Nick |date=2007-03-23 |publisher=HEXUS.gaming |pages=6 of 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Game Developers Conference|GDC]] 2007, [[Shiny Entertainment]] founder [[David Perry (game developer)|Dave Perry]] stated, &quot;I think that Sony has made the best machine.

===Slim model and rebranding===
The PlayStation 3 Slim received extremely positive reviews as well as a boost in sales; less than 24 hours after its announcement the PS3 Slim took the number-one bestseller spot on Amazon.com in the video games section for fifteen consecutive days. It regained the number-one position again one day later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slim Amazon Bestseller&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=PS3 Slim gets back Bestseller top spot on Amazon |url=http://www.qj.net/qjnet/playstation-3/ps3-slim-gets-back-bestseller-top-spot-on-amazon.html |date=September 1, 2009 |work= |publisher=qj.net |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PS3 Slim also received praise from PC World giving it a 90 out of 100 praising its new repackaging and the new value it brings at a lower price as well as praising its quietness and the reduction in its power consumption. This is in stark contrast to the original PS3's launch in which it was given position number-eight on their &quot;The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006&quot; list.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3 Slim Review PCW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Priced right, Sony's slim-line PlayStation 3 (120GB) bundles the top-notch features of the earlier PlayStation 3 into a smarter, sleeker package |url=http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/product/301007/review/playstation_3.html |date=September 2, 2009 |work= |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]  |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNET awarded the PS3 Slim four out of five stars praising its Blu-ray capabilities, 120&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive, free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point, but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for PlayStation 2 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET PS3 Slim Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony PlayStation 3 Slim - 120GB Review |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/consoles/sony-playstation-3-slim/4505-10109_7-33765068.html |date=August 19, 2009 |publisher=CNET |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; TechRadar gave the PS3 Slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating &quot;Over all, the PS3 Slim is a phenomenal piece of kit. It's amazing that something so small can do so much&quot;. They criticized the exterior design of the PS3 Slim, calling it &quot;ugly&quot; and described the build quality as &quot;cheap&quot; compared to the original PS3.&lt;ref name=&quot;TechRadar PS3 Slim Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony PlayStation 3 Slim 120GB review |url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/sony-playstation-3-slim-630534/review?artc_pg=5 |date=September 1, 2009 |work= |publisher=TechRadar |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
