The '''Italian elections of 1972''' were held on [[May 7]]. The '''sixth''' Parliament of republican Italy was selected, while voters were 37,049,654 for the [[italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and 34,524,108 for the [[Italian Senate|Senate]].

[[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Democrazia Cristiana]] (DC) remained stable with around 38% of the votes, as it happened to the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party]] (PCI) which obtained the same 27% of [[Italian general election, 1968|1968]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PSI) continued in its decline, reducing to less than 10%. The most important growth was that of the post-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]], who nearly doubled its votes from 4.5 to c. 9%, after that its leader [[Giorgio Almirante]] launched the formula of the ''National Right'', proposing his party as the sole group of the Italian right side. After the dismaying result, less than 2%, against 4.5% of 1968, the [[Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity]] was disbanded, its majority joining the [[Italian Communist Party]].

==Electoral system==
[[File:1972 Italian Senate election map.png|thumb|left|220px|Regional pluralities in Senate]]
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system for the Chamber of Deputies. [[Italian province]]s were united in 32 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at national level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

For the Senate, 237 single-seat constituencies were established, even if the assembly had risen to 315 members. The candidates needed a landslide victory of two thirds of votes to be elected, a goal which could be reached only by the German minorities in South Tirol. All remained votes and seats were grouped in party lists and regional constituencies, where a [[D'Hondt method]] was used: inside the lists, candidates with the best percentages were elected.

==Results==
Mathematically, the election seemed to give the same results of four years before, the three major parties receiving quite the same preferences. However, the success of the operation of the National Right by anti-constitutional, neo-fascist [[Italian Social Movement|MSI]], gave a golden share to the [[Italian Socialist Party|PSI]], because the Christian Democrats had no more possibilities to look at their right to built a democratic government, the alliance with the Socialists becoming quite obliged. Incumbent Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] tried to continue his [[centrism|centrist]] strategy, but his attempt only lasted a year. Former Premier [[Mariano Rumor]] so returned at the head of the government with his traditional [[centre-left]] alliance between DC, PSI, [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|PSDI]] and [[Italian Republican Party|PRI]], but he was abandoned by the Republicans after eight months. He continued with a new squad, but he couldn't withstand the shocks deriving by the [[Italian divorce referendum, 1974|divorce referendum of 1974]]. After the consequent great controversies between Catholics and secularists, former Premier [[Aldo Moro]] persuaded the Socialists to accept a minority government composed only by the Christian Democrats and the Republicans. However, new problem arose from the [[Italian regional elections, 1975|regional elections of 1975]], which marked a great success of the [[left (politics)|left]], which consequently called for new national elections. When the Republicans too left Moro in 1976, no possibilities of a new government remained, and a fresh, early vote was obliged to be celebrated.
