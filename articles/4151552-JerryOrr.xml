'''Tronica''' (a.k.a. Ronica) was a trademark brand manufacturing handheld LCD games during the 80s. Some of their machines used to be a combination of game, watch, alarm clock and calculator, much in the line of the [[Nintendo]] [[Game and Watch]] models, that became famous in that decade. Tronica manufactured about 45 different models of these machines, for example, Air Fighter, Space Revenger, Stuka or Thief in Garden.
