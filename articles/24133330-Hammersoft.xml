The '''kidnapping of Jaycee Lee Dugard''' occurred on June 10, 1991 in [[South Lake Tahoe, California]]. Dugard was 11 years old at the time and was [[child abduction|abducted]] from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after the kidnapping, but no reliable leads were generated. She remained missing for more than 18 years.

On August 25, 2009, convicted sex offender Phillip Craig Garrido visited the campus of [[UC Berkeley]] accompanied by two young girls. Their unusual behavior there sparked an investigation that led to his bringing the two girls to a parole office on August 26, accompanied by a young woman who was then identified as Dugard.

Garrido, 58, and his wife Nancy Garrido, 54, of [[Antioch, California]], were arrested for kidnapping and other charges; they pleaded guilty on April 28, 2011 to Dugard's kidnapping and sexual assault. Law enforcement officers believe Dugard was kept in a concealed area behind Garrido's house in Antioch for 18 years. During this time Dugard bore two daughters who were aged 11 and 15 at the time of her reappearance.

On June 2, 2011, Phillip Garrido was sentenced to 431 years imprisonment; his wife received 36 years to life.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Background of kidnappers==
{{Garridosinfo}}
Phillip Craig Garrido was born in [[Contra Costa County, California]], on April 5, 1951. He grew up in [[Brentwood, California|Brentwood]], where he graduated from [[Liberty High School (Brentwood, California)|Liberty High School]] in 1969. His father, Manuel Garrido, who continues to reside in Brentwood, said his son was a &quot;good boy&quot; as a child, but radically changed after a serious motorcycle accident as a teenager, and later turned to drug use (primarily [[methamphetamine|crystal meth]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Dugard: I never tried to run from Garridos|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/06/02/BAFB1JP44B.DTL&amp;tsp=1|accessdate=3 June 2011|newspaper=SF Gate|date=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' and the [[Associated Press]] have reported that the elder Garrido has begun demanding money in exchange for speaking with reporters; both organizations have refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1972, Garrido was arrested and charged with [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] a 14-year-old girl, but the case did not go to trial after the girl declined to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

At Leavenworth, Garrido met Nancy Bocanegra, who was visiting another prisoner, her uncle. On October 5, 1981, Garrido and Bocanegra were married at Leavenworth. On January 22, 1988, Garrido was released from Leavenworth to Nevada State Prison, where he had served seven months of a five-years-to-life Nevada sentence. He was transferred to federal parole authorities in Antioch on August 26, 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;ktvn-NDPS&quot;/&gt; In Antioch, the Garridos lived in the home of his elderly mother, who suffered from [[dementia]]. As a parolee, he was monitored, later wore a [[GPS]]-enabled ankle bracelet, and was regularly visited by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Abduction and search effort==
In September 1990, Jaycee Dugard and her family moved from the [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] city of [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] to South Lake Tahoe. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in fifth grade attending Meyers Elementary School near South Lake Tahoe.{{fact|date=August 2011}}

On June 10, 1991 Dugard's stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed the abduction from within sight of their home. He saw two people in a gray sedan (possibly a [[Mercury Monarch]] or [[Mercury Zephyr]]) make a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forced Dugard into the car.  (In a ''[[Primetime (TV series)|Primetime]]'' interview on July 10, 2011, Dugard stated a stun-gun was used to incapacitate her). Probyn then gave chase on a bicycle, but he was unable to overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Ken Slayton, Dugard's biological father. Probyn took and passed several [[polygraph]] tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.{{fact|date=August 2011}}

Within hours of Dugard's disappearance, local and national media converged upon South Lake Tahoe to cover the story. Within days, dozens of local volunteers assisted in the search effort, which involved nearly every resource within the community. Within weeks, tens of thousands of fliers and posters were mailed to businesses throughout the United States. Since Dugard's favorite color was pink, the entire town was blanketed in pink ribbons as a constant reminder of her disappearance and a demonstrated support for the family throughout the community.{{fact|date=August 2011}}

Dugard's mother, Terry Probyn, founded a group called Jaycee's Hope, which directed the volunteer and fundraising effort. Cassette tapes of the song ''Jaycee Lee'' along with T-shirts, sweatshirts and buttons were sold to raise money for poster materials, postage, printing and related expenses. Child Quest International and The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children were also involved in the effort. A reward was offered, which was displayed on the posters and fliers. The kidnapping case also attracted nationwide attention and was featured many times on the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.{{fact|date=August 2011}}

The ensuing months and years were a continuous effort of child safety awareness, fundraising events and candlelight vigils marking Dugard's disappearance and keeping her story before the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,543640,00.html

== Captivity ==
The Garridos' home on Walnut Avenue is in an [[unincorporated area]] in northeast [[Antioch, California|Antioch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LAtimes2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/31/local/me-kidnapped31 | author = La Ganga, Maria L., Dolan, Maura, and Hennessy-Fiske, Molly

He said that she had identified herself by the name &quot;Jaycee&quot; and that's when he asked her if she lived there or was just visiting, she answered that she lived there. At that point Phillip Garrido came out and took her back indoors. The Garridos later built a privacy fence around the property, which already had several large trees in the yard.&lt;ref name='CostaContraTimes'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.contracostatimes.com/jayceedugard/ci_13223494
|author = Costa, Hilary | title = Neighbor spoke to Jaycee Lee Dugard through fence | publisher = Contra Costa Times | date = 2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April to August 1993, Phillip Garrido was returned to [[federal prison]] for parole violation.

Jaycee Lee Dugard bore two daughters by Phillip Garrido, born in August 1994 and in November 1997.&lt;ref name='kcra birth'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kcra.com/news/22351413/detail.html | author = | title = Judge Issues Birth Certificates For Dugard's Kids | publisher = KCRA.com

Her two daughters also told others she was their older sister.&lt;ref name='telegraph'&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6127898/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-daughters-thought-she-was-their-sister.html

Garrido operated a print shop, where Dugard acted as the graphics artist. Ben Daughdrill, a customer of Garrido's printing business, claimed he met and spoke by telephone with Dugard and that she did excellent work. During this time, Dugard had access to the business phone and an email account. One customer of the printing business indicated she never hinted to him about her childhood abduction or true identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/us/29abduct.html | title = Kidnapping Victim Was Not Always Locked Away | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2009-08-28 | accessdate = 2009-09-01 | author = McKinley, Jessie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Antioch, Garrido also kept a [[blog]] associated with what he called &quot;Gods Desire Church.&quot; In the blog Garrido said he had the power to control sound with his mind. Garrido asked several people, including customers, to sign testimonials confirming that they witnessed his ability to &quot;control sound with my mind&quot; and a device he developed &quot;for others to witness this phenomena.&quot;&lt;ref name=merc_28_1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_13231478 | author = Simerman, John | title = Accused abductor of Jaycee Dugard turned increasingly zealous, customers say | publisher = Silicon Valley Mercury News | date = 2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://voicesrevealed.blogspot.com/
 | title = Phillip Craig Garrido's blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement officers believe that at the time they became involved in 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Phillip Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was [[soundproof]]ed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two tents, and what has been described as a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a {{Convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by a [[tarpaulin]]. Privacy in the yard was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, as well as an old car similar to the one used in the abduction. Law enforcement officers visited the residence at least twice in recent years, but did not give the backyard more than a quick inspection. When police investigated, they found the backyard to be crowded with typical childhood possessions, including books and toys, among the tents and sheds. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Jaycee Dugard was seen in the house and sometimes answered the front door. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car. Garrido claims to have home-schooled the two girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_13237170 | author = de SÃ¡, Karen | title = Cops search two Antioch homes for evidence in the Jaycee Dugard case | publisher = Silicon Valley Mercury News | date = 2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, and a former business associate of the Garridos, Cheyvonne Molino, have commented that Dugard's children looked healthy. Tina Dugard said that upon her meeting them after their reappearance, they &quot;always appeared and behaved like normal kids&quot;. Molino said of the times she met them while they were captive &quot;that in her presence the girls never acted robotically&quot; and didn't wear unusual clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ocregister.com/news/jaycee-143194-dugard-tina.html |author=Hardesty, Greg | title = Exclusive video: Interview with Jaycee's aunt | publisher = Orange County Register | date = 2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/01/crimesider/entry5279423.shtml | author = Smith, Ryan | title = Controversy: Jaycee Dugard Daughter's Photos | work = Crimesider

===Missed opportunities to rescue Dugard===

* Police failed to make the connection that Jaycee Lee Dugard was kidnapped in South Lake Tahoe, the same location as Garrido's 1976 kidnapping of Katherine Callaway Hall.

* On April 22, 1992, less than a year after her kidnapping, a male caller contacted the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station in [[Oakley, California]], less than two miles from the Garridos' home in Antioch.  The caller reported that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge.  In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property, one that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call and the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further.&lt;ref name='SFChronicle'&gt;{{cite news

* In June 2002, the fire department responded to a report of a juvenile with a shoulder injury that occurred in a swimming pool at Garrido's home. This information was not relayed to the parole office, which had no record of either a juvenile or a swimming pool at Garrido's address.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot; /&gt;

* In 2006, one of Garrido's neighbors called [[9-1-1]] to inform them there were tents in the backyard with children living there and that Garrido was &quot;[[psychosis|psychotic]]&quot; with [[sexual addiction]]s. A deputy sheriff spoke with Garrido at the front of the house for about 30 minutes and left after telling him there would be a code violation if people were living outside on the property. After Dugard was found in August 2009, the local police issued an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/missing-girl-could-have-been-found-in-2006-1778997.html | author = Adams, Guy | title = Missing girl could have been found in 2006 | publisher=The Independent | date=2009-08-29

* On November 4, 2009, the California Office of the Inspector General issued a report&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oig.ca.gov/media/reports/BAI/reports/Special%20Report%20on%20CDCR's%20Supervision%20of%20Parolee%20Phillip%20Garrido.pdf | title = Special Report: The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Supervision of Parolee Phillip Garrido | publisher=California Office of the Inspector General | date = 2009-11-04 | accessdate = 2009-11-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enumerated various lapses by the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] that contributed to Dugard's continued captivity. The central finding was that Garrido was incorrectly classified as needing only low-level supervision and all other lapses were derived from it. In his report, the inspector general detailed an instance in which a parole agent encountered a 12-year-old girl at the home of Phillip Garrido, but accepted Garrido's &quot;explanation that she was his brother's daughter and [the agent] did nothing to verify it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-jaycee-dugard5-2009nov05,0,1237255.story | title = State prison watchdog strongly criticizes procedures in Jaycee Dugard case

On August 24, 2009, Garrido visited the [[San Francisco]] office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and left a four-page essay containing his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his own past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his own criminal sexual behaviors and how that information could be used to assist in curing other [[sexual predator]]s by &quot;controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts.&quot; On the same day, Phillip Garrido went to a [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[University of California Police Department|police office]] seeking permission to hold a special Christian event on campus as a part of his &quot;God's Desire&quot; program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as odd and asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. The next morning, August 25, Campbell notified campus police officer Ally Jacobs about the meeting later that morning with Garrido, and her concerns. Jacobs ran a background check, learned that Garrido was on parole for [[rape]], and decided to sit in on the meeting. Garrido arrived with two girls, whom he introduced as his daughters. At the meeting, Jacobs felt that the girls' behavior was unusual, and phoned the parole office to relay her concerns. As no one was in, she left a report of the meeting on voicemail.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After hearing Jacobs' recorded message, two parole agents drove to Garrido's house later that day. Upon arrival, they handcuffed him and searched the house, only finding his wife Nancy and his elderly mother at home. Then the parole agents drove Garrido back to the parole office.
En route, Garrido said that the two girls who had accompanied him to UC Berkeley &quot;were the daughters of a relative, and he had permission from their parents to take them to the university.&quot; Although the parole office had barred Garrido from being around minors a month before, the agents overlooked this violation. After reviewing his file with a supervisor, they drove him home and ordered him to report back to the office again the next day to further discuss his visit to UC Berkeley and follow up on their concerns about the two girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot; /&gt;

Garrido arrived at the parole office in [[Concord, California|Concord]] on August 26 with his wife, Nancy, the two girls and Jaycee Lee Dugard, who was introduced as &quot;Allissa&quot;. When they arrived, his parole officer was on the phone with Jacobs to obtain a more detailed description of her interaction with Garrido and the two girls. Jacobs informed the officer that the girls were calling Garrido &quot;Daddy,&quot; but the parole officer believed that Garrido had no children. The parole officer then decided to separate Garrido from the women and girls to obtain an identification.

Dugard, maintaining her false identity as &quot;Allissa&quot;, stated that she was the girls' mother. When the parole officer said that she looked too young to be the mother and asked her age, &quot;Alyssa (''sic'') said that she was 29 years old, laughingly explaining that she often gets that comment and that people believe she is the girls' sister,&quot; the report states. As the questioning continued, Dugard and Nancy Garrido became agitated and wanted to know why they were being questioned. When the parole officer explained that he was investigating Garrido's visit to the UC campus with the two girls, Dugard said that she knew Garrido had taken the girls to the campus and that she also knew he was a paroled sex offender who had kidnapped and raped a woman. &quot;She added that Garrido was a changed man and a great person who was good to her kids. Allissa subsequently stated that she didn't want to provide any additional information and that she might need a lawyer.&quot;

It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signature signs of [[Stockholm syndrome]] during her questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The parole agent then asked Garrido in another room to explain the relationship between him and &quot;Allissa&quot; and the two girls. Garrido said that all three were his nieces, the daughters of his brother in [[Oakley, California|Oakley]]. &quot;Garrido stated that the parents were divorced, the girls were living with them and other people, and he did not know his brother's address or phone number,&quot; the report states. The parole officer returned to the women and insisted on seeing identification from &quot;Allissa,&quot; but Dugard replied that she &quot;had learned a long time ago not to carry or give any personal information to anyone.&quot; She also said she needed a lawyer. At this point, the parole officer called in [[Concord, California|Concord]] police.

The report continues: &quot;As they waited for the officer to arrive, Alyssa (''sic'') said she was sorry that she had lied. She explained that she was from Minnesota and had been hiding for five years from an abusive husband. She was terrified of being found, she said, and that was the reason she could not give the parole agent any information.&quot; Two Concord police officers continued the questioning of Dugard, who maintained her false identity and the story she had told to the parole agent. In the other room, a Concord police sergeant questioned Garrido, who finally admitted that he was the father of the two girls. When the parole agent resumed his questioning of Garrido, the latter admitted to kidnapping and raping &quot;Allissa&quot;. Under further questioning, Dugard revealed her true identity and confirmed that she had been kidnapped and raped by Garrido.

Garrido and his wife were then placed under arrest. An [[FBI]] [[Special agent]] put Dugard on the telephone with her mother, Terry Probyn. Dugard retained custody of her children and was soon reunited with her mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;cop&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Reunion and afterward===

In the days following Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that she and her daughters were in good health and intelligent, their reunion was going well, and they were proceeding slowly. He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Phillip Garrido, and the girls cried when they learned of their father's arrest. According to Jaycee Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, about the two girls: &quot;They are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:garritobackyard1.jpg|thumb|Investigators at the Antioch home]]
Garrido repeatedly told the reporter how he &quot;filed documents&quot; with the [[FBI]] on August 24, 2009, which, when they were published, would cause people to &quot;fall over backwards&quot; and that he could not reveal more because he &quot;had to protect law enforcement&quot; and &quot;what happened&quot; [...] was &quot;something that humans have not understood well.&quot; In the interview Garrido denied he had ever harmed Dugard's two daughters. He said their births changed his life and &quot;they slept in my arms every single night since birth. I never touched them.&quot; On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but declined to discuss further details.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcra&quot; /&gt; The document, titled 'Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed', was eventually released by the FBI. The document is about stopping [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenics]] from turning violent and controlling sounds with the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mr. and Mrs. Garrido both made a 'full confession' in the case, said Tapson at a press conference on February 28, 2011. The development came as lawyers for both sides have re-opened discussions on a possible plea deal that may obviate the need for a trial. Mrs. Garrido's attorney acknowledged that she was facing &quot;241 years, eight months to life&quot; and that he was working for a reduced sentence in the 30 year range. He stated that the prosecutor had acknowledged that Mr. Garrido was a master-manipulator and that Mrs. Garrido was under both his influence and that of substances during the period of Dugard's kidnapping so should receive some consideration while alluding to parallels with [[Patty Hearst]] and [[Stockholm Syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/27029177/detail.html?cxntlid=cmg_cntnt_rss|title=Garridos Confess To Dugard Kidnapping|author=not stated|publisher=KTVU TV|date=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, April 7, 2011, Phillip and Nancy Garrido, instead of pleading guilty (as had been expected based on their previous statements) pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended indictment. Phillip Garrido's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been improperly selected and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. The developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represents Nancy Garrido; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip Garrido had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that Tapson should only speak about his own client, Nancy Garrido. Tapson said he only found out about Gellman's plans late on Wednesday. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado County, California District Attorney Vern Pierson did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail his case against the Garridos.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On April 28, 2011, the Garridos pleaded guilty to kidnapping and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorman |first=Steve |title=The California couple charged with abducting 11-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard in 1991 and holding her captive for 18 years pleaded guilty on Thursday to kidnapping and sexual assault charges that carry life prison sentences. |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/28/us-kidnap-california-plea-idUSTRE73R6P720110428 |accessdate=April 28, 2011 |newspaper=Reuters |date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Attorney also stated Nancy Garrido seemed to feel genuinely guilty, while it was said that Dugard was relieved that she and her children would not have to testify.

On June 2, 2011, Phillip Garrido was sentenced to 431 years; his wife received 36 years to life.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt; Phillip Garrido is serving his sentence at [[California State Prison, Corcoran]] while Nancy Garrido is incarcerated at [[Valley State Prison for Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salonga|first=Robert|title=Jaycee Dugard kidnappers now official state prison inmates|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_18293681|accessdate=9 September 2011|newspaper=Contra Costa Times|date=June 16, 2011|comment=the article reports Nancy Garrido as being sent to Central California Women's Facility (CSP-CCWF).

Dugard, who did not attend the sentencing, had sent a written statement that was read aloud in court :
{{quote|&quot;I chose not to be here today because I refuse to waste another second of my life in your presence. I've chosen to have my mom read this for me. Phillip Garrido, you are wrong. I could never say that to you before, but I have the freedom now and I am saying you are a liar and all of your so-called theories are wrong. Everything you have ever done to me has been wrong and someday I hope you can see that. What you and Nancy did was reprehensible. You always justified everything to suit yourself but the reality is and always has been that to make someone else suffer for your inability to control yourself and for you, Nancy, to facilitate his behavior and trick young girls for his pleasure is evil. There is no God in the universe that would condone your actions. To you, Phillip, I say that I have always been a thing for your own amusement. I hated every second of every day of 18 years because of you and the sexual perversion you forced on me. To you, Nancy, I have nothing to say. Both of you can save your apologies and empty words. For all the crimes you have both committed I hope you have as many sleepless nights as I did. Yes, as I think of all of those years I am angry because you stole my life and that of my family. Thankfully I am doing well now and no longer live in a nightmare. I have wonderful friends and family around me. Something you can never take from me again. You do not matter any more.&quot;

===Settlement with the State of California===
In July 2010, the State of California approved a $20 million dollar settlement with Jaycee Dugard, to compensate her for &quot;various lapses by the Corrections Department [which contributed to] Dugard's continued captivity, ongoing sexual assault and mental and/or physical abuse.&quot; The settlement, part of AB1714, was approved by the [[California State Assembly]] by a 70 to 2 vote, and by the [[California State Senate]] by a 30 to 1 vote. [[San Francisco County Superior Court]] Judge Daniel Weinstein, who mediated the settlement, stated that the settlement was reached to avoid a lawsuit which would be a &quot;greater invasion of privacy and greater publicity for the state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/02/local/la-me-0702-dugard-settlement-20100702|title=Jaycee Lee Dugard's family will receive $20 million from California|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=July 11, 2011|author=Maria L.

===Lawsuit against the United States===
On September 22, 2011, Dugard filed suit in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] accusing the United States of failing to monitor Garrido when he was a federal parolee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/23/us-crime-dugard-lawsuit-idUSTRE78M03G20110923|author=Emmet Berg|title=Jaycee Dugard sues U.S. over monitoring of her captor|publisher=Reuters|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
