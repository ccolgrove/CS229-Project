'''''Watchmen: Music from the Motion Picture''''' is the film [[soundtrack]] album for the 2009 film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''. The soundtrack features three songs written by Bob Dylan: &quot;[[Desolation Row]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]&quot;, and &quot;[[All Along The Watchtower]]&quot;.

The film uses some of the songs mentioned in the comic, including &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot;, [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s cover of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;; [[Simon and Garfunkel]]'s &quot;[[The Sounds of Silence]]&quot;; [[Nena]]'s &quot;[[99 Luftballons]]&quot;; a [[muzak]] version of [[Tears For Fears]]' &quot;[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]&quot;; and [[Nat King Cole]]'s &quot;[[Unforgettable (song)|Unforgettable]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Larry Carroll|title=Snyder Reveals Hendrix, Dylan, Other Tracks in âWatchmen,â No Smashing Pumpkins|work=[[MTV]] Splash Page|date=2008-07-23|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/07/23/snyder-reveals-hendrix-dylan-other-tracks-in-watchmen-no-smashing-pumpkins/|accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the period songs were up-mixed to 5.1 surround for the film using the [[Penteo]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penteo process|url=http://www.penteosurround.com|publisher=PenteoSurround.com|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates said the challenge was composing music that would transition effectively into these famous songs.&lt;ref name=soundoff&gt;{{cite news|author=Spencer D.|title=Watchmen Composer Sounds Off|work=[[IGN]]|date=2009-02-06|url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/952/952338p1.html|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder and Bates received Dylan's permission to use the [[stem (music)|stems]] from &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot; so the three-minute song could play over the six minute opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mania.com/watches-watchmen_article_113476.html|title=He Watches the Watchmen|author=Rob Vaux|work=Mania|date=2009-03-06|accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of how Dr. Manhattan came to be is accompanied by a montage of the pieces &quot;Prophecies&quot; and &quot;Pruit Igoe&quot; by [[Philip Glass]], originally composed for the 1983 cult film ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' . Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II's sex scene aboard the Owl Ship is set to the tune of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s &quot;[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]&quot;. Originally Zack Snyder used a recording of the song by [[Allison Crowe]] for the scene, but decided Crowe's version was &quot;too romantic&quot; and &quot;too sexy&quot; for a scene that is intended to come across as ironic and &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Snyder ended up placing the original Cohen studio recording in this scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04653139/2/zack_snyder_talks_watchmen.html|title=Crave Online: Zack Snyder Talks Watchmen|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[My Chemical Romance]], whose members are fans of the comic, covered Dylan's &quot;[[Desolation Row]]&quot; for the first half of the closing credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buzznet.com/tags/gerardway/journals/3626261/mcr-desolation-row-press-release/|title=Warner Sunset/Reprise Records to Release 12&quot; Picture Disc of My Chemical Romanceâs Reinterpretation of &quot;Desolation Row&quot; for Watchmen on January 27, 2009|work=Buzznet|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This line is also quoted at the end of the chapter.

The music video for My Chemical Romance's version was directed by [[Zack Snyder]] (who also directed the ''Watchmen'' film and, as a result, features similar effects to that of the film). It features the band playing in an old-school punk arena. After the show becomes sold out and dozens of fans can't get in, a riot ensues as the band plays on. Eventually the police arrive but are too powerless to stop the rioting both inside the show and out. Eventually a SWAT team arrives, arrests the band, and disperses the rioters.

During MCR's parts in the video multiple ''Watchmen'' imagery (such as [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]]'s mask and [[Characters of Watchmen#Comedian|The Comedian]]'s smiley face button) are seen.

My Chemical Romance's [[Gerard Way]] has stated in interviews that he is a long time fan of the ''Watchmen'' graphic novel. ''Watchmen'' comic book merchandise can be seen in his home on the DVD ''[[Life on the Murder Scene]]''.

The song was also the last to feature former drummer Bob Bryar, who left the band a little over a year after the song was released and in the early stages of recording their fourth album ''[[Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys]]''.
