'''freenode''', formerly known as '''Open Projects Network''', is an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] [[computer network|network]] used to discuss peer-directed projects.&lt;ref&gt;Mutton, Paul. ''IRC Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips &amp; Tools''. Cambridge: [[O'Reilly Media]] 2004. ISBN 0-596-00687-X&lt;/ref&gt; Their servers are all accessible from the [[Domain name system|domain name]] [irc://chat.freenode.net chat.freenode.net], which [[Load balancing (computing)|load balances]] connections by using the actual servers in rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml |title=About freenode: IRC Servers |publisher=freenode.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010, it was the largest [[free and open source software]]-focused IRC network, encompassing more than 70,000 users and 40,000 channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andreas Gelhausen |url=http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/details.php.en?net=freenode&amp;submenu=weeks |title=Network statistics over the last two weeks |publisher=irc.netsplit.de |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peer-Directed Projects Center |url=http://freenode.net/history.shtml |title=Freenode history statistics |publisher=freenode.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

freenode began as a 4-person [[Linux]] support channel called #LinPeople on [[EFnet]], another IRC network. By 1995 it had moved from being just a channel to its own network, irc.linpeople.org. In early 1998 it changed to Open Projects Net (OPN) with about 200 users and under 20 channels. The OPN soon grew to become the largest network for the [[free software community]], and 20th largest in the world. In 2002 the name changed to freenode and the [[Peer-Directed Projects Center]] was founded as the legal umbrella organization{{fact|date=March 2011}}.

On June 24, 2006, a user with the nickname &quot;ratbert&quot; gained the network privileges of freenode [[Network administrator|administrator]] [[Rob Levin]] (&lt;tt&gt;lilo&lt;/tt&gt;) and took control of the network. It is likely that approximately 25 user passwords were stolen as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=189470&amp;cid=15603568 |title=Freenode Network Hijacked, Passwords Compromised? |publisher=It.slashdot.org |date=2006-06-26 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This user proceeded to [[K-line]] many freenode staff members, and most freenode servers subsequently went down for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=32634 Freenode IRC Network hacked] [[The Inquirer]] article about NickServ hack&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Unlike many other networks,{{fact|date=March 2011}} freenode is centrally managed. Staffers (as IRC operators are called) have the same access across all servers. Some operations that would normally only apply to one server (like k-lines) are propagated across the whole network. Servers are &quot;donated&quot; to the network, rather than &quot;linked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freenode.net/hosting_ircd.shtml|title=freenode Ircd|accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The network focuses on supporting peer-directed and open source projects. Channels not related to these things are considered off-topic and encouraged to find a home elsewhere. To support this distinction, channels are divided into namespaces. Primary on-topic channels begin with a single #, and groups wanting to use such a channel must officially register with freenode. &quot;About&quot; channels begin with two ##, and are available on a first-come, first-served basis without needing a group registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnaming|title=freenode naming scheme|accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Server Software ===
freenode currently runs ircd-seven, a set of freenode-specific patches on the Charybdis IRC server. The network previously ran an ircd called hyperion. The replacement of hyperion with ircd-seven&lt;ref&gt;[http://freenode.net/seven.shtml freenode.net]&lt;/ref&gt; occurred on Saturday, January 30, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.freenode.net/2010/01/migration-to-new-ircd/ |title=Migration to ircd-seven.
