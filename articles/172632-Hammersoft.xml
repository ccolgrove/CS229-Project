'''William of Wykeham''' (1320 or 1324 &amp;ndash; 27 September 1404) was [[Bishop of Winchester]], [[Chancellor]] of England, founder of [[Winchester College]], [[New College, Oxford]], [[New College School]], Oxford, and builder of a large part of [[Windsor Castle]].

==Life==

William was born to a [[peasant]] family, in [[Wickham]], [[Hampshire]], and educated at a school in [[Winchester]]. He was appointed [[Justice in Eyre]] south of the [[River Trent|Trent]] along with [[Peter Atte Wode]] in 1361, a position he held until about 1367.  He became secretary to the [[constable#Ancient Court Position|constable]] of [[Winchester Castle]] and in that capacity learned a lot about building. This led to architectural work for King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], for whom he reconstructed [[Windsor Castle]] whilst residing at Bear's Rails in [[Old Windsor]]. William was paid for these services by being given the incomes of various churches, and eventually, in 1362, he was ordained. He had shown considerable talent as an administrator and in June 1363 was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]]&lt;ref name=Powicke91&gt;Powicke ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and then in October 1366 he was elected [[Bishop of Winchester]],&lt;ref name=Powicke258&gt;Powicke ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1367, [[Chancellor of England]].&lt;ref name=Powicke84&gt;Powicke ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned this position in 1371&lt;ref name=Powicke84/&gt; and began a long conflict with [[John of Gaunt]].  However, with the ascension of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] to the throne, William was reappointed Chancellor in 1389, retaining that office through 1391.&lt;ref name=Powicke85&gt;Powicke ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

He had many ups and downs in his long career, but at the time of his death on 27 September 1404,&lt;ref name=Powicke258/&gt; he was one of the richest men in England. Much of his wealth went into the schools he patronized, but he also contrived to leave a fortune to a nephew, whose descendants include the Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes family.

His motto was 'Manners makyth man'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester College, Arms&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.winchestercollege.org/arms | title = Winchester College, Arms | accessdate = 2010-11-22 | work = Winchester College website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, along with a [[coat of arms]], were assumed by him and not acquired by descent. His biography was written by [[Robert Lowth|Bishop Lowth]]. He was also written about by Lord Brougham in his 'Old England's Worthies' (1857) and by [[Froissart]]. 'Manners Makyth Man' is also the motto of the establishments Wykeham founded, Winchester College and New College, Oxford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester College, Arms&quot;/&gt;
