He was born in [[Verucchio]]. 

He was originally the leader of the [[Guelphs]] in [[Romagna]] and became ''[[podestÃ ]]'' (chief magistrate) of [[Rimini]] in 1239. In 1295, he made himself complete master of Rimini by killing the chief members of the rival [[Ghibelline]] family, the [[Parcitati]], including their leader [[Montagna de' Parcitati|Montagna]]. 

His eldest son was [[Giovanni Malatesta]], famous for the 1285 tragedy, recorded in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'', in which he killed his wife [[Francesca da Rimini|Francesca da Polenta]] and his younger brother Paolo, having discovered them in adultery. 

He was succeeded as seignior of Rimini by his other son [[Malatestino Malatesta|Malatestino]].
