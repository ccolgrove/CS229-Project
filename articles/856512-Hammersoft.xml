'''Richmond College''' is a [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]] in [[Galle]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The school was established in 1814 by [[mission (Christianity)|Christian missionaries]]&lt;!-- Or is the intention [[Weleyan Christian Missionaries (organization)|]]? --&gt;. Richmond College is now a well established institution with a reputation as one of the finest schools in  Sri Lanka. Approaching the end of its second century as a school, it has produced many prominent citizens, including two in the highest political positions, namely the current President, and a former Prime Minister.

==History==
The history of Richmond College is in a special way connected with the pioneer Wesleyan Missionaries who landed in Ceylon on the 29th of June 1814. The sailing ship in which they came made port at Galle. One of the boats that brought two of the party owing to a monsoon gale eventually landed at Weligama Bay. Of the party, &quot;the Rev. Benjamin Clough remained in Galle and opened the first Wesleyan School in all Asia in the up-stair house of Mr. E. R. Gunaratne (a Mudliyer by rank) in Dickson Road, Galle.&quot; this was the precursor to current Richmond College. [[The Jubilee Memorials of Wesleyan Mission written by Rev. Robert Spence Hardy]] (printed in 1862) on page 210 states that first school started by the mission was in Galle. This is irrefutable evidence that Richmond was started in 1814. Further, in support of the 1814 claim in a letter by Rev. Langdon who became the Principal of Galle High School which later was named Richmond, sent to the synod in UK states that the schools was started with 100 boys with 45 boys from the former school standing in the same spot. This was written in 1877 and now there is no doubt that a school or schools of sort existed from the inception in 1814. Unfortunately most schools in Ceylon did not have any distinct names and such names came in to being much later. Most schools were then called Wesleyan Boys or Girls English School. No amount of name changes can alter the birth date of an institution or a person.   

In 1857 the Rev, Joseph Rippon, who was then stationed in Galle, with daring foresight persuaded the Mission to purchase 17 acres of land at Kumbalwella, two miles to the north of Galle Fort. This block consisted of five contiguous allotments of a land called Mount Seymour or Seymour Hill. The original owner of this land was, Doctor Robert Seymour Sillery M.D., Under Sillery it became known as âDostara Kandaâ or âDoctor's Hillâ. After the Mission purchased it the missionaries started living there and the people began calling it âPadilikandaâ or the âHill of the Padresâ.

Rev. Rippon probably had his theological training at Richmond College in Surrey. This institution which is situated on the banks of the Thames is famous for the grandeur of the scenery round about. Rev. Rippon either out of love for his old College or because of the scenic splendour of the local counterpart renamed this place Richmond Hill.

Wesleyan Mission did not go in for what is called &quot;higher education&quot; till long after the jubilee in 1864. It devoted all its powers to elementary teaching, the preaching of the Gospel, translating the scriptures and in building up congregations. The time came, however, for the establishment of High Schools and Colleges, and the Mission started several superior institutions for the imparting of higher education in few large cities. 

In 1864 the Rev. George Baugh succeeded Rev. Rippon. Almost from the beginning he pursued the idea of establishing a &quot;superior&quot; English School on Richmond Hill. Rev. George Baugh's reasons were mainly that the standard of English of the local Theological students was not satisfactory and that the energies of the missionaries and local ministers were going to waste because the children of the Church were attending non-Methodist English Schools in Colombo. For these reasons he and his fellow-workers made frequent representations to the Foreign Missions Committee of the Wesleyan Methodist Church in England about the necessity for such a school.

Wesleyan missionary Rev. George Baugh is credited with changing the name of the school that was existing from &quot;Boys' Anglo-Vernacular School&quot; to Galle High School which was later renamed in 1882 as Richmond College as it was sited on Richmond Hill, which began its existence on 1 May 1876. Rev. Samuel Langdon was its first principal. He is also credited with having a proper school organized. The School began with a staff of 8 and with 104 pupils on the roll. Thus the school was opened for enrollment of the public in 1876 which up until then had a restricted enrollment.

Latin, Mathematics, Science, Arts and Religion were included in the curriculum, and children were trained to sit for British public examinations. A prize giving was held in its very first year, and a library with 500 books was opened in 1878.

From these facts, it is evident that from the beginning, Richmond College was conducted as a comprehensive educational institution. The school which was known by different names since 1814 was named &quot;The Galle High School&quot; in 1876, and six years later in 1882 was renamed &quot;Richmond College&quot;.

The first College magazine was published in 1887. It was only the second occasion that a school in Ceylon had produced a magazine. The same year, the English Literary Union was formed and cricket was started in the school. In 1894, under the principal-ship of Rev. Hartley, the Old Boys' Association was formed. Another important occurrence during that year was the establishment of the College Cadet Corps.

Rev. James Horne Darrell assumed duties as principal in 1896. The school experienced both physical expansion as well as qualitative growth. During his period, Richmond rose to be recognized as one of the best schools in the island. At the local Cambridge Examinations of 1905, Richmond earned top position among assisted schools and second place among all schools in Ceylon{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. The same year, the [[RichmondâMahinda Cricket Encounter|Richmond - Mahinda Match]] was played for the first time, with the two Principals, Rev. Darrell of Richmond and Mr. [[Frank Lee Woodward|F. L. Woodward]] of Mahinda, officiating as umpires. Rev. Darrell sacrificed his life for the college nursing the pupils who were afflicted 'Typhoid' when there was an outbreak in the country and was buried at the Dadalla Cemetery, Galle. Rev. W. J. T. Small became principal following the death of Rev. Darrell.

Commerce was introduced as a subject in 1912. This was also the year in which Football was started at Richmond. In 1915, the 2nd Galle (Richmond) Scouts Group was established. Scouting at Richmond College enjoyed remarkable success from the beginning. The first two King's Scouts in the island were produced by Richmond. In 1916, Ceylon 's first Cub Pack was started at Richmond College.

A notable event during Rev. Small's period was the formation of the National Association at Richmond in 1915. It was in effect a forum within the school for the emerging nationalist movement.

In 1922, Rev. Alec Sneath took over the principalship of Richmond College. He was responsible for many measures which brought refinement and qualitative development to the school.

In 1926, a well equipped library was established in a new building. The Science Society was started the same year. In 1931, the Sinhala Literary Union came into being.

In 1940, the last of the missionary principals left, leaving the school in the hands of local graduates.

Mr. E. R. de Silva, an old boy(alumni) of the school, had the distinction of becoming the first Ceylonese principal of Richmond College. This was a period which saw major changes in the educational structure of Ceylon. The Free Education Scheme which was devised by Mr. [[C. W. W. Kannangara]], an illustrious old boy of Richmond College, was being implemented, and the school had to be geared to suit the changes.

In 1962, Richmond College, which was owned by the Methodist Mission, was nationalised. Mr. D. G. Welikala, the first head of Richmond College under state management, was also its first Buddhist principal. With the take over, the Methodist Vernacular School on Richmond Hill was amalgamated with Richmond. This school was referred to as the &quot;Kaha Iskole&quot; by some and &quot;Pin Iskole&quot; meaning free school by others, has been in existence from the time the Missionaries established a learning seat on Richmond Hill.   

During this period, considerable expansion and change had to take place to cater to the new situation. Richmond College faced the challenge of transition so successfully that the then Minister of Education commended Richmond on several occasions, describing it as a model institution among nationalised schools{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

Richmond College was one of the first schools in the island to start the teaching of Agriculture as a subject. In 1969, it became the first school in the country to start an Agricultural stream for the Advanced Level.

In 1976, the College celebrated its centenary as &quot;Richmond College&quot; although in reality it was 162 years in existence. In terms of the provisions of the White Paper on Education, Richmond College was named as a National School in 1986.
