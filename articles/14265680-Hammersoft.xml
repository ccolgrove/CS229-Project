&lt;br&gt;[[File:Joseph Smith, Jr. portrait owned by Joseph Smith III.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=Portrait of Joseph Smith, Jr|An 1842 portrait of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]]]

This '''list of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement''' provides a listing of churches that form a part of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]âsometimes collectively referred to as ''[[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]]'' or ''[[Mormonism]]''âwhether still extant or not.  A member of any of these sects is properly referred to as a ''Latter Day Saint'' in the general sense, regardless of the particular church to which he or she may belong (or belonged).  While this list is far from complete, it currently incorporates all of the major known sects within the movement, past or present.

The Latter Day Saint movement includes:
* The original church within this movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], was the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|''Church of Christ'']], which was later named the ''Church of the Latter Day Saints''. It was renamed the ''Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'' in 1838, which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844.  This organization subsequently splintered into several different sects, each of which claims to be the legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other sects within the movement to claim this distinction.
* The largest denomination within the contemporary movement is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (''LDS Church'' or, colloquially, ''[[Mormon]] church'') with 14 million members. It is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and uses the term ''Latter-day Saints'' to describe itself and its members (note the hyphenation and variation in capitalization usage).
* The second-largest denomination is the [[Community of Christ]] (first named the ''Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,'' known as the ''Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'' from 1872â2001), a Missouri-based, 250,000-member denomination.  Though members of this church have traditionally been called ''Latter Day Saints'' (without the hyphen), the Community of Christ has more recently stated that it rejects the use of the term ''Saints'' as a designation for its members in any official reference or publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofchrist.org/herald/PublishingStyleguide.pdf Herald House Style Guide], an official publication of the Community of Christ.  See under entry &quot;Saints&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other sects within the movement either formed around various would-be successors to Joseph Smith, Jr., or else broke from sects that did.  These, together with the two sects listed above, are detailed in the table of denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, below.

The term ''Mormonism'' is often used as a collective description of the movement and especially of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; however, many other Latter Day Saint sects are opposed to the use of this term, as they consider it to be derogatory and connected to the [[polygamy]] once practiced by the Utah church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Robinson |first=B.A. |title=Denominations in the LDS Restorationist Movement: The Community of Christ |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |year=2010 |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/rlds.htm |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These other groups tend to prefer the terms ''Restorationist'' or ''Latter Day Saint.''

Though a few minuscule factions broke with Smith's organization during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance of the vast majority of Latter Day Saints until [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|his murder]] in June 1844. Following Smith's death, his movement experienced a profound [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|leadership crisis]] which led to a schism within his church.  The largest group followed [[Brigham Young]], settling in what would become the [[Utah Territory]] (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). The second-largest faction coalesced around [[Joseph Smith III]], eldest son of Joseph Smith, Jr. (the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]), currently headquartered in [[Independence, Missouri]].  Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the [[First Presidency]], [[Sidney Rigdon]], the newly-baptized [[James Strang]] from Wisconsin, and [[Alpheus Cutler]], one of the [[Council of Fifty]].  Each of these men still retains a following as of 2010âhowever tiny it may be in some casesâand all of their organizations have experienced further schisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cadman/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher&quot;/&gt;  Other claimants such as [[Granville Hedrick]], [[William Bickerton]] and [[Charles B. Thompson|Charles Thompson]], among others, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.

| After LDS Church missionaries visited the town of Uyo in 1953, Obot decided to form unauthorized branches of the church in Nigeria and wrote for more information to LDS headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah.  However, due to Nigerian government visas restrictions and the absence of church leadership, these branches deviated from LDS Church doctrine.  This included some practicing of polygamy and establishment their own black priesthood hierarchy, both of which were prohibited at the time by church doctrine.

Given the large number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult. A common approach in a number of [[Mormon studies|histories and studies]] is to use ''Rocky Mountain Saints'' for those denominations headquartered in the [[American West]] and ''Prairie Saints'' for those sects that formed in and around [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]; [[Voree, Wisconsin]]; [[Independence, Missouri]], and other locations in the [[Midwest]] and East.  These terms do not necessarily relate the current geographical locations of all sects within those two groupings, but rather the original location of their respective parent organizations, which may be seen in the table below. 

Another method uses provenance: for instance, all sects that ultimately trace their history back to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah are organized as one factional group, since the LDS church is directly connected historically to Joseph Smith, Jr.'s, organization, of which it claims to be the sole legitimate continuation.  ''Divergent Paths of the Restoration''âa reference work on this subjectâfollows this approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilds&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Shields |first=Steven |title=Divergent Paths of the Restoration |publication-place=Independence, Missouri |publisher=Restoration Research |year=1990 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0942284003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such studies, and in general Latter Day Saint parlance, the [[wiktionary:-ite|''-ite'']]-suffixed terms ''Josephite'' and ''Brighamite'' have been used for Missouri-based &quot;Community of Christ&quot; and Utah-based &quot;LDS Church&quot; respectively; and these terms have sometimes been used to distinguish groups of sects, as well.  Those sects within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of sects by use of commonly understood names such as ''Mormon Fundamentalist'' or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group (for example, ''Joseph Smith III'' in reference to &quot;Community of Christ&quot; (&quot;Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;) as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it).
