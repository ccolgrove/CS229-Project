'''WBUP''' is the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated [[television station]] for [[Michigan]]'s Central [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] licensed to [[Ishpeming, Michigan|Ishpeming]]. It broadcasts a [[high-definition television|high definition]] digital signal on [[VHF]] channel 10 from a transmitter in [[Humboldt Township, Michigan|Humboldt Township]]. The station can also be seen on [[Charter Communications|Charter]] channel 10 and in high definition on digital channel 780. Owned by the [[Stephan Marks|Marks Radio Group]], WBUP is sister to [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WBKP]] and the two share studios on Ash Street in Ishpeming. [[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WBUP includes ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', and ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' among others. It can also be seen on WBKP's second [[digital subchannel]] (VHF channel 5.2) from a transmitter on Tolonen Hill in [[Adams Township, Houghton County, Michigan|Atlantic Mine]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Wbkp-wbup.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Former shared logo.]]

In August 1997, the area's original ABC affiliate WBKP launched repeater station W28BX on channel 28 in [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]] to cover the city proper. Since this [[low-power television|low-powered]] over-the-air signal was very weak, it could only be picked up in Marquette and [[Negaunee, Michigan|Negaunee]]. In Spring 2003, WBKP replaced the low-powered repeater with full-time satellite WBUP. This aired a full-powered analog signal on VHF channel 10 from a transmitter southeast of [[Republic, Michigan|Republic]] in [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette County]]. 

At this point, WBUP and WBKP took the on-air branding &quot;ABC 5&amp;10&quot;. Eventually, WBUP's transmitter was moved to the tower of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] affiliate [[WNMU (TV)|WNMU]] in [[Ely Township, Michigan|Ely Township]] and then to its current location in Humboldt Township. In January 2004, the Scanlan family sold WBUP/WBKP and [[WBKB-TV]] to [[Lake Superior]] Community Broadcasting which is a company owned by Stephan Marks of [[Maryland]]. In July 2007, the two stations split with WBKP becoming a CW affiliate as part of [[The CW Plus]] while WBUP remained with ABC. 

Since it was granted an original [[construction permit]] after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) finalized the [[digital television|DTV]] allotment plan on April 21, 1997, this station did not receive a companion channel for a digital [[television station]]. Instead around June 12, 2009 (which was the end of the digital television conversion period for full-service stations), WBUP turned-off its [[analog signal]] and turned on its [[digital signal]] though a &quot;[[flash-cut]]&quot;. It then began offering a [[standard definition]] simulcast of WBKP on a new second [[digital subchannel]] in order to expand its reach.

==Newscasts==
[[File:Wbup news 2010.png|thumb|right|175px|News logo.]]

WBUP is the one of two sources for local newscasts in the area, since [[WFRV]] [[semi-satellite]] [[WJMN-TV]] offers brief Upper Peninsula-specific news and weather updates produced at facilities in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. Despite that, WLUC has held the number one spot in [[Nielson ratings]] by a wide margin for its entire existence. WBUP maintains a smaller local news operation compared with that station and most other [[Big Three television networks|big three]] outlets. In March 2002, an initial attempt to take on WLUC with a news department of its own was shut down due to low ratings and budget cuts. 

Shortly after Stephan Marks acquired WBUP/WBKP, a second attempt at airing newscasts was launched. This time, shows known as ''UGN News'' (with &quot;UGN&quot; meaning &quot;Upper Great &lt;Lakes&gt; News &lt;Network&gt;&quot;) were simulcasted on WBKB in Alpena. The broadcasts featured regional news and weather coverage from the entire Upper and Northern [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsulas]]. In 2006, ''UGN News'' was re-focused to the Upper Peninsula and only originated from WBUP/WBKP. At some point after becoming a separate station and taking over primary news production, WBUP re-branded its newscasts to ''ABC 10 News NOW''. 

Currently, this station produces local news weeknights at 5:30, 10 (on WBKP), and 11. In December 2007, WBUP began producing the [[media market|market]]'s first prime time newscast on WBKP. Known as ''CW 5 News NOW at 10'', this can be seen on weeknights for thirty minutes. As of September 8, 2009, the show competes with another one airing at the same time on [[Fox Network|Fox]] affiliate [[WLUC-DT2]]. Although WBUP does not have a meteorologist on its staff, the station subscribes to [[AccuWeather]] allowing the news anchor to give a brief forecast. It also shares resources with ''[[The Mining Journal]]'' in Marquette.
