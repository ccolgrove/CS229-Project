The '''[[2007 NFL season|2007]] [[San Francisco 49ers]] season''' was the franchise's 62nd season.  They ended their season with a disappointing record of 5-11 in 2007, failing to improve upon their 7-9 record from [[2006 San Francisco 49ers season|2006]].

==Coaching staff==
Head coach [[Mike Nolan]] entered his third year with the 49ers. He was joined by offensive coordinator [[Jim Hostler]], defensive coordinator [[Greg Manusky]], and special teams coordinator [[Al Everest]].

==Offseason==
===Free agency===
The 49ers addressed their problems in the secondary with the signing of veteran cornerback [[Nate Clements]] from the [[Buffalo Bills]]. The contract was worth $80 million for 8 years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history. They also signed strong safety [[Michael Lewis (NFL safety)|Michael Lewis]] from [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] on the same day. Other key defensive pickups included linebackers [[Colby Bockwoldt]] and [[Tully Banta-Cain]] and nosetackle [[Aubrayo Franklin]]. The team also addressed its wide-receiver needs by signing former [[Denver Broncos|Denver Bronco]] and [[Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta Falcon]], [[Ashley Lelie]] and [[Seattle Seahawks|Seattle Seahawk]], [[Darrell Jackson]].
San Francisco also used the free agency period to extend [[Frank Gore|Gore's]] contract to 4 years worth $28 million, $14 million of which is guaranteed.

===Draft===
In the [[2007 NFL draft]], they addressed their need for an inside linebacker by picking [[Patrick Willis]] in the first round and also gave up their 2008 first round pick to the [[New England Patriots]] and selected 28 overall Offensive Tackle [[Joe Staley]]. In the 2nd round the 49ers traded their pick for the [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts']] number one pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. On the second day of the NFL Draft, the San Francisco 49ers traded a 4th round pick for [[Seattle Seahawks]] leading receiver, [[Darrell Jackson]].

Trying to snap an eight-game losing streak, the 49ers flew to the [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] for a Week 12 NFC West rematch with the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. In the first quarter, the Niners trailed early as Cardinals QB [[Kurt Warner]] completed a 28-yard TD pass to WR [[Larry Fitzgerald]].

In the third quarter, the Niners retook the lead as Dilfer completed a 57-yard TD pass to WR [[Arnaz Battle]] for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, it was back-and-forth as Cardinals QB [[Tim Rattay]] (a former 49er) completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE [[Ben Patrick]], while Gore managed to get a 35-yard TD run. Afterwards, Arizona ended regulation with kicker [[Neil Rackers]] getting a 19-yard TD field goal. In overtime, the ball went back and forth between the Cardinals and the 49ers. When the Cardinals had the ball, [[Kurt Warner]] threw the ball to WR [[Sean Morey (American football)|Sean Morey]] who appeared to have a sure touchdown, but was run down by 49ers rookie [[linebacker]] [[Patrick Willis]]. Kicker [[Neil Rackers]] missed a field goal, and the 49ers got the ball back. After a three and out, punter [[Andy Lee (American football)|Andy Lee]] pinned the Cardinals close to their own endzone. San Francisco lifted their demons with stripping Warner in his endzone and LB [[Tully Banta-Cain]] landed on it for the touchdown and the win.

With the win, not only did the 49ers improve to 3-8, it also snapped their dreaded eight-game losing streak. It also gave them a season-sweep over the Cardinals. It would also improve their overtime record under head coach [[Mike Nolan]] to 3-0. With the victory, the 49ers improved to 2-0 against the Cardinals and 1-8 against everyone else this season.

Rolling with the momentum from the previous week's upset, the 49ers took on the playoff-bound [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] as their final home game of the season, and of perennial pro-bowler [[Bryant Young]]'s career.  

With the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] clinching their division in Week 15, and no improvement in their seed in sight, they treated it as a glorified exhibition game by resting the majority of their starters after the first few drives. Although it wasn't an important game in the standings for either team, the 49ers had their pride - and maybe their head coach [[Mike Nolan]]'s job - on the line, and the Bucs wanted to make sure that their momentum and edge keeps up as they enter the playoffs.  

The game came down to a matter of inches, as the Buccaneers final touchdown with 80 seconds remaining led to a failed 2-point attempt that would have been a tying score; receiver [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]] caught the pass in the back of the end zone but half of his foot came down out of bounds.

===Week 17: at Cleveland Browns===

The 49ers finished the season with a loss, dropping to a final standings of 5-11. The Browns became just the fifth team in history to miss the playoffs after coming away with 10 victories in the regular season. The loss gave the 49ers the seventh pick in the 2008 NFL Draft, which they owed to the [[New England Patriots]].
