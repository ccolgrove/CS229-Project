'''Android Market''' is an online software store developed by [[Google]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android OS]] devices. Its gateway is an application program (&quot;app&quot;) called &quot;Market&quot;, preinstalled on most Android devices, allows users to browse and download [[mobile apps]] published by third-party developers. Users can also search for and read detailed information about apps on the Android Market website.

==History==
[[File:Androidmarket3311.png|thumb|The Android Market as seen from an Android phone]]

===Introduction===
Google announced the Android Market on August 28, 2008, and made it available to users on 22 October 2008. They introduced support for paid applications on 13 February 2009 for US and UK developers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Android Market Update Support |url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/02/android-market-update-support-for.html |author=Chu, Eric |date=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional support for 29 countries on 30 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= More Countries More Sellers More Buyers|url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html |author=Bray, Tim |date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feature updates===
In December 2010 Google added content filtering to Android Market and reduced the purchase refund window from 24&amp;ndash;48 hours to 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/big-changes-in-store-for-android-market/2151 |title=Big changes in store for Android Market |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date= 11 December 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2011 Google introduced a web client that provides access to Android Market via PC. Apps requested through the Android Market web page are downloaded and installed on a registered Android device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/02/android-market-gets-a-web-store/ Android Market gets a web store with OTA installations, in-app purchases coming soon] on [[engadget.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 Google added new app lists to Android Market, including &quot;Top Grossing&quot; apps, &quot;Top Developers&quot;, &quot;Trending&quot; apps, and &quot;Editors Recommendations&quot;. Google's Eric Chu said the goal of this change was to expose users to as many apps as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.yahoo.com/s/zd/20110511/tc_zd/264342 |title=Google Revamps Android Market to Give App Recommendations|author=Mark Hachman|work=PC Magazine|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 Google introduced a redesigned interface with a focus on featured content, more search filters, and (in the US) book sales and movie rentals.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-android-market-for-phones-with.html |title=A new Android Market for phones, with books and movies - Official Google Mobile Blog |author=Paul Montoy-Wilson|work=Google Mobile blog|date=12 July 2011|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 the [[Motorola Xoom|Motorola XOOM]] [[tablet computer|tablet]] received an update that brought the redesigned Android Market to a [[Honeycomb (operating system)|Honeycomb]]-powered device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slashgear.com/android-market-update-released-for-honeycomb-tablets-29184161/ |title=Android Market update released for Honeycomb tablets|author=Chris Burns|work=SlashGear|date=29 September 2011|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011 Google added a music store to the Android Market.

===Applications and downloads===
On 17 March 2009, about 2,300 applications were available in the Android Market, according to [[T-Mobile]] [[chief technical officer]] Cole Brodman.&lt;ref name=&quot;apps2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/161410/android_market_needs_more_filters_tmobile_says.html |title=Android Market Needs More Filters, T-Mobile Says |work=PC World |date=17 March 2009 |author=Lawson, Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 2011, during the [[Google I/O]], Google announced that Android Market listed 200,000 apps, and had clocked 4.5 billion apps installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;200.000 apps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/android-momentum-mobile-and-more-at.html |title=Android: momentum, mobile and more at Google I/O |first=Hugo |last=Barra |work=The Official Google Blog |date=10 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 2011, Google announced that the number of apps on Android Market increased by 28,000 in April 2011, making a total of 200,000 apps; by contrast, in April 2011 the listings on Apple App Store grew by 11,000 new apps, a total of 381,062 apps. Distimo and Germany-based [[research2guidance]] forecast that the number of apps on Android Market would surpass Apple by the third quarter of 2011, with some 425,000 apps.&lt;ref name=&quot;294,000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/05/android-to-surpass-apples-app-store-in-size-in-august-2011-report-exclusive/|title=Android To Surpass Appleâs App Store In Size By August 2011|author=Robin Wauters|date=5 May 2011|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==App use and pricing structure==
[[File:Android Market.jpg|thumb|Android Market on a Samsung Galaxy S.]]
===Availability for users===
Android Market filters the list of applications to those compatible with the user's device. In addition, users may face further restrictions to choice of apps where developers have tied-in their applications to particular carriers or countries for business reasons.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url= http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/compatibility.html
 |title=Android Compatibility
 |work=Android Developers
 |accessdate=31 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers can also ban certain applications, for example [[tethering]] apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/02/carriers-crack-down-on-android-tethering-apps-rain-on-our-mobil/ |title=Carriers crack down on Android tethering apps, rain on our mobile hotspot parade |author=Terrence O'Brien|work=[[Engadget]]|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2011, users in 131 countries can purchase paid applications from Android Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=143779|title=Paid App Availability|publisher=Android Market Help}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for Android Market app purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/04/new-carrier-billing-options-on-android.html |title=Android Developers Blog: New Carrier Billing Options on Android Market |author=Eric Chu|work=android-developers.blogspot.com |date=13 April 2011|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no requirement that Android applications be acquired from Android Market. Users may download Android applications from a developer's website or through a third party alternative to Android Market.

===Availability for developers===
The Android Market application is not [[open source]]. Only Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements may install and access Google's closed-source Android Market app, subject to entering into a licensing agreement with Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Developers in 29 countries may sell applications on the Android Market.&lt;ref name=&quot;android1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=150324|title=Supported locations for merchants|publisher=Android Market Help}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application developers receive 70% of the application price, with the remaining 30% distributed among carriers and payment processors. Google itself does not take a percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/10/android-market-now-available-for-users.html |title=Android Developers Blog: Android Market: Now available for users |author=Eric Chu|work=Android Developers Blog|date=22 October 2008|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue earned from the Android Market is paid to developers via [[Google Checkout]] merchant accounts, or via Google [[AdSense]] accounts in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/developer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=137997 |title=Processing orders and receiving payouts|work=Android Market for Developer Help|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==Banned applications==
On 31 March 2009, Google removed all [[tethering]] applications from Android Market because they supposedly violated terms of service of certain carriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;
Banned from the Market... ok.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falsedichotomies.org/node/73 |title=Banned from the Market... ok. |publisher=False Dichotomies |accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google later restored tethering applications to Android Market, except those for the [[T-Mobile USA]] network, which was specifically the subject of the violation:&lt;ref name=&quot;Google restores tethering app for Android users outside U.S.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Krazit |first=Tom |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10210515-94.html |title=Google restores tethering app for Android users outside U.S. &amp;#124; Wireless â CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|On Monday, several applications that enable tethering were removed from Android Market catalog because they were in violation of T-Mobile's terms of service in the US.

We inadvertently unpublished the applications for all carriers, and today we have corrected the problem so that all Android Market users outside the T-Mobile US network will now have access to the applications. We have notified the affected developers.|30px|30px|Google, April 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;Google restores tethering app for Android users outside U.S.&quot;/&gt;}}

As of 20 May 2010, PDAnet, Easy Tether and Proxoid were all available in the U.S. market for T-mobile users. On 5 April 2011, Google withdrew the [[Grooveshark]] app from Android Market due to unspecified policy violations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google boots Grooveshark from Android Market&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20051156-261.html |title=Google boots Grooveshark from Android Market |publisher=CNET |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the app is still available for direct download via Grooveshark's website for those users who have enabled non-market application downloads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grooveshark Mobile Music: Android&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.grooveshark.com/phones/android |title=Grooveshark Mobile Music: Android |publisher=Grooveshark |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first quarter of 2011, at the request of the carrier, Android Market began blocking Easy Tether, and other tethering applications that do not require root access, from download to Verizon Wireless Android phones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On 27 May 2011, Google banned SpoofApp, a Caller ID spoofing application typically used for prank calling which had been available in Android Market since 18 December 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpoofApp Banned From Android Market&quot;&gt;[http://www.spoofcard.com/blog/2011/07/11/spoofapp-banned-from-the-android-market/ SpoofApp Banned From Android Market], Google bans SpoofApp.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2011, Google banned the account of the developer of several video game emulators, including Nesoid, Snesoid, and N64oid, but did not specify a reason for the ban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Pulls Yongzh's Emulator Apps Off Android Market&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2386126,00.asp | title=Google Pulls Yongzh's Emulator Apps Off Android Market |work=PC Magazine |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation details==
Android Market applications are self-contained [[APK (file format)|Android Package files]]. The Android Market does not install applications; it asks the devices's PackageManagerService to install them. The package manager is visible if the user downloads an [[APK (file format)|APK]] file direct to their device. Applications are installed to the phone's internal storage, and under certain conditions may be installed to the devices's external storage card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html |title=App Install Location &amp;#124; Android Developers |publisher=Developer.android.com |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application security ==
[[File:AndroidMarketPermissions.png|thumb|An example of app permissions in Android Market.]]
Android devices can run applications written by third-party developers and distributed through Android Market and third-party application stores. Once enrolled, developers may publish their applications immediately.

Before installing an application, Android Market displays all required permissions.  A game may need to enable vibration, for example, but should not need to read messages or access the phonebook.  After reviewing these permissions, the user can decide whether to install the application.

Possible app permissions include functionality like:
* Accessing the Internet
* Making phone calls
* Sending SMS messages
* Reading from and writing to the installed memory card
* Accessing a user's address book data

Security software companies have been developing applications to ensure the security of Android devices. SMobile Systems, one such manufacturer, claims that 20% of apps in Android Market request permissions that could be used for malicious purposes, and 5% of apps can make phone calls without the user's intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smobile-systems-analysis-of-android-app-store-reveals-massive-potential-for-malware-and-viruses-96896999.html |publisher=prnewswire.com | title=SMobile Systems Analysis of Android App Store Reveals Massive Potential for Malware and Viruses |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://threatcenter.smobilesystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Android-Market-Threat-Analysis-6-22-10-v1.pdf |publisher=smobilesystems.com | title=Threat Analysis of the Android  Market  |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2010/06/23/20-des-applications-de-l-android-market-demandent-l-acces-a-des-donnees-personnelles_1377745_651865.html |work=Le Monde |location=France | title=20 % des applications de l'Android Market demandent l'accÃ¨s Ã  des donnÃ©es personnelles  |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not a claim that the apps are actually malicious, but rather highlight the potential for malicious activity.

=== Security issues ===
In early March 2011, DroidDream, a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] [[rootkit]] exploit, was released to the Android Market in the form of several free applications that were, in many cases, pirated versions of existing priced apps.  This exploit allowed hackers to steal information such as [[IMEI]] and [[IMSI]] numbers, phone model, user ID, and service provider.  The exploit also installed a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] that allowed the hackers to download more code to the infected device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/01/the-mother-of-all-android-malware-has-arrived-stolen-apps-released-to-the-market-that-root-your-phone-steal-your-data-and-open-backdoor/ |title=The Mother Of All Android Malware Has Arrived: Stolen Apps Released To The Market That Root Your Phone, Steal Your Data, And Open Backdoor &amp;#124; Android News, Reviews, Apps, Games, Phones, Tablets, Tips, Mods, Videos, Tutorials |publisher=Android Police |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These apps were downloaded more than 50,000 times before Google took action and removed them from the Market.  The exploit only affected devices running AndroidOS versions earlier than 2.3 &quot;Gingerbread&quot;.  In many cases, the only guaranteed method of removing the exploit from an infected device was to reset it to factory state, although community-developed solutions for blocking some aspects of the exploit were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/02/update-on-the-malware-monster-droiddream-is-an-android-nightmare-and-weve-got-more-details/ |title=[Update: Plug The Hole Yourself&amp;#93; Malware Monster: DroidDream Is An Android Nightmare, And Weâve Got More Details &amp;#124; Android News, Reviews, Apps, Games, Phones, Tablets, Tips, Mods, Videos, Tutorials |publisher=Android Police |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google started remotely removing the malicious apps from infected devices on March 5th, and also released its own app, the &quot;Android Market Security Tool March 2011&quot;, which automatically removed the exploit.  This app was automatically installed to all infected devices, and users with infected devices were notified via e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2011/03/update-on-android-market-security.html |title=An Update on Android Market Security â Official Google Mobile Blog |publisher=Googlemobile.blogspot.com |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
