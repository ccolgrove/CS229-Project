'''Rutgers School of LawâNewark''' is the oldest of three [[law school]]s in the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]].  It is located at the S.I. Newhouse Center for Law and Justice, at 123 Washington Street, in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].  Founded in 1908 as the New Jersey Law School, it merged with the [[University of Newark]] in 1936, which later became part of [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2006-08-15.4134216574/article.2006-09-11.3775816476 Newark marks anniversary with opening of modern residential, research buildings â Rutgers News Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The school is accredited by the [[American Bar Association]]; is a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]]; and is registered with the Board of Regents of the State of New York.  On September 9, 2008, the law school celebrated its centennial.

==Academics==
The [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] program at Rutgers requires a total of 84 credits to graduate.  The 1L curriculum requires traditional courses in Torts, Contracts, Property, Criminal Law, Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Legal Research &amp; Writing.  Second semester 1Ls are also required to choose an elective.  All required 1L courses are graded on a standard B-curve.  Rutgers ensures that students have a 'small section' class as 1Ls, taking one core class taught by a tenured faculty member and limited to the roughly 30 people in a student's track (with whom they also take all other first year courses). Admitted students may choose to attend Rutgers law classes on either a full-time or part-time basis.  The 2008 edition of the ABA-LSAC Official Guide to ABA-Approved Law Schools notes that 251 1L's began at Rutgers last year, with 73% entering on a full-time basis.

Rutgers law students may choose to pursue a number of joint degrees.  These include:

- J.D./M.B.A. with [[Rutgers Business School]]. &lt;br&gt;
- J.D./M.A. in Criminal Justice with the School of Criminal Justice.&lt;br&gt;
- J.D./M.C.R.P. in City and Regional Planning with the [[Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy]].&lt;br&gt;
- J.D./M.S.W. with the Rutgers School of Social Work.&lt;br&gt;
- J.D./M.D. in conjunction with the  [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey|UMDNJ]]-[[New Jersey Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;http://law.newark.rutgers.edu/joint_degree.html Joint Degree Programs Retrieved on 07-28-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==
Rutgers' selective admissions are administered with a process that offers applicants a choice between competing for admission based primarily on traditional measures such as LSAT scores and college GPAs, or, alternatively, on the basis of an applicant's life experience, with a lesser (though still significant) emphasis placed on traditional factors.  Factors that may be considered in the Rutgers admissions process include, but are not limited to, work experience, personal accomplishments, and other aspects of the applicant's personal background.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.newark.rutgers.edu/rutapp2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.newark.rutgers.edu/admissions_process.html Rutgers School of Law - Newark - Admissions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutgers' unique admissions process is particularly significant when contrasted with the efforts of other law schools to maximize the undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores of their incoming classes in order to improve their standing in popular law school ranking publications.&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB121971712700771731-lMyQjAxMDI4MTI5NjcyMTY3Wj.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking==
The Law School is ranked as a &quot;Tier 1&quot; school by the 2011 edition of ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'''s &quot;Best Grad Schools.&quot; Rutgers LawâNewark is ranked 84th overall in the 2011 U.S. News Law rankings, tied with nine additional schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings/page+3 Best Law Schools 2011], ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', accessed September 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Law School is ranked 54th in Super Lawyers' 2010 U.S. Law School Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superlawyers.com/toplists/lawschools/united-states/2009/], ''[[Super Lawyers 2010 Law School Rankings]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
