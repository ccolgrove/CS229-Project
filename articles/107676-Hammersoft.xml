'''San Dimas''' is a city located in the [[San Gabriel Valley]], in [[Los Angeles County, California]].  As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 33,371. The city historically took its name from San Dismas Canyon in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] above the northern section of present day San Dimas. San Dimas is named in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] after [[Saint Dismas]], the repentant and crucified thief&lt;ref&gt;http://www.route66ca.org/traveler/towns/27sandim/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The  [[Tongva people|Tongva]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] lived in the area, and along with other tribes, in the region for over 8,000 years. These earliest residents, also referred to as the Tongva-GabrieliÃ±o Tribe, of what is now known as San Dimas became part of the [[Mission Indians]] after Spanish colonization from the [[Mission San Gabriel]] occupied their lands in the late 18th century.
[[Image:SanDimas-1915.jpg|left|thumb|250px|San Dimas, in 1915]]  
The first known European exploration of the area was in 1774, when [[Juan Bautista De Anza]] passed through on the first overland expedition of [[Las Californias]], from [[New Spain]]-Mexico towards [[Monterey Bay]].  The area was originally developed in 1837 with the [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] from Governor [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]] to [[Ygnacio Palomares]] and [[Ricardo Vejar]] for the [[Rancho San Jose (Palomares)|Rancho San Jose]], then in [[Alta California]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogden Hoffman, 1862, ''Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California'', Numa Hubert, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; It later became known as La Cienega Mud Springs, so named because of local mud [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s that created a [[riparian]] [[marsh]] and healing place.  Palomares and Vejar conducted sheep and cattle operations on Rancho San Jose, also growing crops for consumption by the residents of the rancho.  In the early 1860s, a severe drought decimated the ranch's population of sheep and cattle.  Ygancio Palomares died in 1864, and his widow began selling the ranch land in 1865.  Vejar lost his share by  [[foreclosure]] to two Los Angeles merchants, Isaac Schlesinger and Hyman Tischler, in 1864.  In 1866, Schlesinger and Tischler sold the ranch to [[Louis Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;James Miller Guinn, 1915,''A history of California and an extended history of Los Angeles and environs''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the arrival of the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] in 1887 that La Cienega Mud Springs was first mapped.  The resulting land boom resulted in the formation of the San Jose Ranch Company, which first laid out streets.  Small businesses began to open soon thereafter, and the city took on a new name:  San Dimas.   Growth was rapid, and San Dimas soon became an agricultural community, [[wheat]] and other [[Midwestern United States]] crops were planted first, then [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[lemon]] [[orchard|grove]]s covered the town and the San Gabriel Valley. At one time, four citrus [[packing house]]s and a [[marmalade]] factory were located in San Dimas. The [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]] name originated here, first spelled &quot;Sunkissed.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.route66ca.org/traveler/towns/27sandim/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Oranges were the major crop and business in San Dimas until the mid-20th century. 

San Dimas incorporated as a city in 1960, and is now known for its small town and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] qualities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colapublib.org/history/sandimas/ Community History in Words and Pictures: San Dimas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glauthier, Martha. The History of San Dimas, California. San Dimas, CA: The San Dimas Historical Society, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*In 1971, the San Dimas Golf Course was purchased.

*In 1972, San Dimas Community Hospital opened its 92-bed facility.

*In 1981, the San Dimas Swim and Racket Club was built next to [[San Dimas High School]], according to the San Dimas Historical Society.

*In 1989 San Dimas played a role in the movie &quot;[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]].&quot;

Other major arteries include Arrow Highway (eastâwest) and San Dimas Avenue (northâsouth).
