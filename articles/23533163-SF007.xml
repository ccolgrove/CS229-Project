'''Google Chrome OS''' is a [[Linux]]-based [[operating system]] designed by [[Google]] to work exclusively with [[web application]]s. Google announced the operating system on July 7, 2009 and made it an [[open source]] project, called [[Chromium OS]], that November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google 11-09&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PC World&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/168028/google_announces_chrome_os.html|title=Google Announces Chrome OS|last=Mediati|first=Nick|publisher=PC World|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Chromium OS, which can be [[compiled]] from the downloaded [[source code]], Chrome OS only ships on specific hardware from Google's manufacturing partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tweney, Wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/11/google-chrome-os-ditch-your-hard-drives-the-future-is-the-web/|title=Gadget Lab Hardware News and Reviews Google Chrome OS: Ditch Your Hard Drives, the Future Is the Web|date=November 19, 2009|author=Dylan F. Tweney|publisher=Wired|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user interface takes a [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalist approach]], resembling that of the [[Google Chrome|Chrome web browser]]. Since Google Chrome OS is aimed at users who spend most of their computer time on the Internet, the only application on the device is a browser incorporating a media player and a [[file manager]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Google 11-09&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ars Technica: Google Talks&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times Hansell&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hansell|first=Saul|work=New York Times |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/would-you-miss-windows-with-a-google-operating-system/|date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2009|title=Would you miss Windows with a Google operating system?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html|title=Introducing the Google Chrome OS|last=Pichai|first=Sundar|date=July 7, 2009|work=Official Google Blog|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expected launch date for retail hardware featuring Chrome OS slipped after Google first announced the operating system: from an initial forecast date in late 2010 to June 15, 2011, when &quot;[[Chromebook]]s&quot; from Samsung (and then Acer in July) actually shipped.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65112220100602|date=June 2, 2010|title=Google sets &quot;late fall&quot; release for Chrome|agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|last=Ahmed|first=Murad|date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2009|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6665703.ece|work=The Times |location=UK |title=Google takes on Microsoft with Chrome operating system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boulton16Nov10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://googlewatch.eweek.com/content/google_strategy/googles_schmidt_on_google_tv_chrome_os_nfc_chip_concept.html |title = Google CEO Schmidt on Google TV, Chrome OS, NFC Chip|accessdate =November 19, 2010|last = Boulton|first = Clint|year = 2010|month = November|publisher=Google Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul08Dec10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2010/12/google-demos-chrome-os-launches-pilot-program.ars|title = Google demos Chrome OS, launches pilot program|accessdate =December 8, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|year = 2010|month = December| work=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ: Google to Launch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherr|first=Ian|title=Google to launch Chrome Laptops in June|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730804576317361801753874.html|accessdate=11 May 2011|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Google developers began coding the operating system in 2009, inspired by the growing popularity and lower power consumption of [[netbook]]s and the focus of these small laptops on Internet access. To ascertain marketing requirements for an operating system focused on netbook Web transactions, the company did not do the usual demographic research generally associated with a large software development project. Instead, engineers relied on more informal metrics, including monitoring the usage patterns of some 200 Chrome OS machines used by Google employees. Developers also noted their own usage patterns. Matthew Papakipos, former&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|title=Google Chrome OS creator takes job at Facebook, announces switch on Twitter|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/062810-google-chrome-creator-facebook.html|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=Business Week|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; engineering director for the Chrome OS project, put three machines in his house and found himself logging in for brief sessions: to make a single search query or send a short email.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ars Technica: Google Talks&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/01/chrome-os-interview-1.ars|title=Google talks Chrome OS, HTML5, and the future of software|last=Stokes|first=Jon|date=January 19, 2010|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2009, Google released Chrome OS's [[source code]] as the [[Chromium OS]] project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google 11-09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/releasing-chromium-os-open-source.html|title=Releasing the Chromium OS open source project|last=Sengupta|first=Caesar|date=November 19, 2009|work=Official Google Blog|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other open source projects, developers are modifying code from Chromium OS and building their own versions, whereas Google Chrome OS code will only be supported by Google and its partners, and will only run on hardware designed for the purpose. Unlike Chromium OS, Chrome OS will be automatically updated to the latest version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chromium Developer FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/how-tos-and-troubleshooting/developer-faq|title=Developer FAQ|publisher=Google|accessdate=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[InformationWeek]] reviewer Serdar Yegulalp wrote that Chrome OS will be a product, developed to &quot;a level of polish and a degree of integration with its host hardware that Chromium OS does not have by default,&quot; whereas Chromium OS is a project, &quot;a common baseline from which the finished work is derived&quot; as well as a pool for derivative works. The product and project will be developed in parallel and borrow from each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yegulalp&quot; /&gt;

At a November 19, 2009 news conference, [[Sundar Pichai]], the Google vice president overseeing Chrome, demonstrated an early version of the operating system. He previewed a desktop which looked very similar to the Chrome browser, and in addition to the regular browser tabs also had application tabs, which take less space and can be pinned for easier access. At the conference, the operating system [[booting|booted]] up in seven seconds, a time Google said it would work to reduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chromium Developer FAQ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-11/19&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/technology/n |title=Linux commands | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yegulalp &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/operatingsystems/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222000239|title=Google Chrome OS Previewed|last=Yegulalp |first=Serdar|date=December 5, 2009 |work=InformationWeek|accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eWeek first-look review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/REVIEW-Google-Chrome-OS-Developer-Edition-Provides-Intriguing-Look-at-WebOnly-Computing-446612/|title=REVIEW: Google Chrome OS Developer Edition Provides Intriguing Look at Web-Only Computing |last=Rapoza|first=Jim|date=December 3, 2009|publisher=eWeek.com|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on November 19, 2009, Chris Kenyon, vice president of OEM services at [[Canonical Ltd]] announced that Canonical &quot;is contributing engineering to Google [Chrome OS] under contract. In our discussions, Sundar Pichai and Linus Upson made it clear that they want, wherever feasible, to build on existing components and tools from the open source community without unnecessary re-invention. This clear focus should benefit a wide variety of existing projects and we welcome it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon19Nov09&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blog.canonical.com/?p=294|title = Google Chrome OS and Canonical|accessdate =December 14, 2010|last = Kenyon|first = Chris|year = 2009|month = November| work=[[Canonical Ltd|Canonical Blog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2010, Google posted notes, images and a video of a conceptual design showing how a Chrome OS user interface might look on a [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]] with a 5â10&amp;nbsp;inch screen. The design would include the same basic layout as on netbooks, but with a touch interface; an onscreen [[qwerty]] keyboard in different layouts; large, square icons placed above the tabs; and panels placed along the bottom edge that could be opened with an upward dragging motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience/form-factors|title=Form Factors Exploration|work=The Chromium Projects|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Google tablet concept&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience/form-factors/tablet|title=Form Factor Exploration: Tablet|date=January 25, 2010|work=The Chromium Projects|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posting was made two days before [[Apple Computer|Apple]] announced the [[iPad]] tablet.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNMoney: Google vs. Apple&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/04/technology/apple_ipad_google_chrome/|title=Tablet wars: Google looks to take on Apple iPad|last=Goldman|first=David|date=February 4, 2010|publisher=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2011, several changes to Chromium OS were made which indicate the development of a tablet version of Google Chrome OS.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET News: DeepTech&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20051228-264.html|title=Google begins tablet version of Chrome OS|date=April 4, 2011|work=CNET News|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Google indicated that consideration is being given to developing two versions of the operating system, a consumer version and an enterprise version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messmer06Mar10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.itworld.com/security/99227/google-sheds-light-chrome-os-netbook-security?source=smlynch|title = Google sheds light on Chrome OS Netbook security|accessdate =March 8, 2010|last = Messmer|first = Ellen|year = 2010|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cr-48 prototype hardware===
[[File:Cr-48_Chromebook_cropped.jpg|thumb|The Cr-48 showing the setup screen seen when first booting up a Chromebook]]
At a December 7, 2010 press briefing, Google announced the Cr-48 laptop, a [[reference design|reference hardware design]] to test the Chrome OS operating system. [[Isotopes of chromium|Chromium-48]]  is one of the most [[Unstable isotope|unstable isotopes]] of the metallic element chromium. The laptop's design broke convention by replacing the [[Caps lock]] key with a dedicated search key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gizmodo.com/5708638/ |title=Google wants to take your Caps Lock key away |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |first=Jesus |last=Diaz |date=December 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cr-48 was intended for testing only, not retail sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET hardware pilot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackerman|first=Dan|title=Google Cr-48 Chrome hardware pilot program: &quot;Not for the faint of heart&quot;  |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20024897-1.html|accessdate=December 8, 2010|newspaper=[[CNET News]]|date=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired09Dec10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/12/cr-48-chrome-os-first-look/?pid=888&amp;viewall=true|title = First Look: Google's Netbook Has Its Head in the Cloud|accessdate =December 10, 2010|last = Calore|first = Michael|year = 2010|month = December| work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleCR48Home&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html|title = Cr-48 Chrome Notebook|accessdate =December 13, 2010|last = [[Google]]|year = 2010|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the Internet. The company demonstrated an offline version of [[Google Docs]] running on Chrome OS and announced a [[3G]] plan that would give Chrome OS users 100 MB of free data each month, with additional paid plans available from Verizon.&lt;ref name=Paul08Dec10 /&gt;

About 60,000 Cr-48s were distributed to testers and reviewers in early December 2010. Reviews of Chrome OS running on the Cr-48 in mid-December 2010 indicated that while the project held promise, it still had some distance to go before being ready for market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul15Dec10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2010/12/nothing-but-net-hands-on-test-of-the-cr-48-chrome-os-laptop.ars|title = Nothing but 'Net: hands-on with the Cr-48 Chrome OS laptop|accessdate =December 16, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|year = 2010|month = December| work=

On March 8, 2011, Google Product Management vice president Sundar Pichai stated that the last of the 60,000 Cr-48s had been shipped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pichai8March11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.twitter.com/sundarpichai#|title = sundarpichai|accessdate =March 20, 2011|last = Pichai|first = Sundar|year = 2011|month = March| work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cr-48 notebooks have additional unused hardware components for implementation at a future date, including a [[Bluetooth#Bluetooth_v2.1_.2B_HS|Bluetooth 2.1]] controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chromeoslounge.com/cr-48-chrome-notebook/207-google-cr-48-notebook-*full*-hardware-specs.html | title=CR48 Prototype Hardware Specs â Chrome OS Lounge | accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Serial Bus|USB port]] only acts as a [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[Network interface controller|ethernet adapter]], or [[USB mass-storage device class|USB storage]] port and will not work as a [[printer (computing)|printer]] port as there is no [[Device driver|print stack]] on the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/support/chromeos/bin/answer.py?answer=1069693 | title=Google Cloud Print Help | accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding further hardware outside of the previously mentioned items will likely cause problems with the operating system's &quot;self knowing&quot; security model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9WVmNfgjtQ | title=YouTube - Chrome OS Security | accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users are encouraged to use a secure service called [[Google Cloud Print]] to print to legacy printers connected to their desktop computers, or connect an [[HP ePrint]] printer to the Google Cloud Print service for a &quot;cloud aware&quot; printer connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/landing/cloudprint/index.html | title=Google Cloud Print | accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google initially named several development partners working on hardware for the operating system, with others named in the press, including [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Asustek|Asus]], [[Freescale]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Lenovo]], [[Qualcomm]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Toshiba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-chrome-os-faq.html|title=Google Chrome OS FAQ|last=Pichai|first=Sundar|date=July 8, 2009|work=Official Google Blog|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/21812|title=Intel Cozying up to Google Chrome OS|last=Myslewski|first=Rik|date=July 10, 2009|work=The RegisterOSnews|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samsung]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Channel News Aust&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnews.com.au/Hardware/Mobility/T3H4L5C6|title= Samsung Confirms Chrome Based Netbook|last=Richards|first=David|date=February 11, 2010|work=Channel News Australia|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;engadget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/07/google-chrome-os-gets-detailed/|title= Google Chrome OS gets detailed, first laptops from Acer and Samsung coming mid-2011|date=December 7, 2010|work=engadget|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dell Inc.|Dell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dell Tests Google's Chrome Operating System on Some Computers |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/06/25/bloomberg1376-L4LAAQ0UQVI901-3I6NGD88A5LDLL0A9NJ3QIR93R.DTL|accessdate=June 28, 2010|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=June 25, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=May 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2011 at its [[Google I/O]] developer conference, Google announced that the first two commercially available laptops incorporating Chrome OS would be manufactured by  Acer Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., with a retail price beginning at $349.  The ship date was June 15 for the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Spain. The [[Chromebook]]s are sold in the United States through Amazon and Best Buy; internationally through &quot;leading retailers&quot;. Google claimed an eight-second bootup time and eight-hour operation on one battery charge, and said that the chromebooks would require no virus protection.  Models equipped with 3G connectivity receive 100 megabytes of wireless data per month, free for two years, with an additional gigabyte at $20 per month. Google is also working on a Chrome OS desktop machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ: Google to Launch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBlog:Chromebooks announced&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A new kind of computer: Chromebook|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-kind-of-computer-chromebook.html|work=The Official Google Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Scott|title=First Take: Samsung Series 5 Chromebook, the future of Netbooks?|url=http://news.cnet.com/first-take-samsung-series-5-chromebook-the-future-of-netbooks-hands-on-video/8301-17938_105-20061890-1.html|accessdate=14 May 2011|newspaper=CNET News|date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

Google also announced a monthly payment scheme for business and education customers at $28 and $20 per user, per month, respectively for a three-year contract, including replacements and upgrades.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ: Google to Launch&quot; /&gt;

==Reception==
Early on, Chrome OS was viewed as a competitor to [[Microsoft]], both directly to [[Microsoft Windows]] and indirectly the company's [[word processing]] and [[spreadsheet]] applicationsâthe latter through Chrome OS's reliance on [[cloud computing]].&lt;ref name=guardian100709&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK | first=Victor| last=Keegan|date=July 10, 2009| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/10/google-chrome-microsoft|title=Can Chrome steal Microsoft's shine?| accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcworld&gt;{{cite web| first=Jeff| last=Bertolucci| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/168246/google_microsoft_invade_enemy_territory_who_wins.html| date=July 10, 2009| accessdate=July 11, 2009| title=Google, Microsoft Invade Enemy Territory: Who Wins?| publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Chrome OS engineering director Matthew Papakipos argued that the two operating systems would not fully overlap in functionality because Chrome OS hosted is intended for netbooks, which lack the computational power to run a resource-intensive program like [[Photoshop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ars Technica: Google Talks&quot; /&gt;

Some observers claimed that other operating systems already fill the niche that Chrome OS is aiming for, with the added advantage of supporting native applications in addition to a browser. Tony Bradley of [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] wrote in November 2009: &quot;We can already do most, if not all, of what Chrome OS promises to deliver. Using a Windows 7 or Linux-based netbook, users can simply not install anything but a web browser and connect to the vast array of Google products and other web-based services and applications. Netbooks have been successful at capturing the low-end PC market, and they provide a web-centric computing experience today. I am not sure why we should get excited that a year from now we'll be able to do the same thing, but locked into doing it from the fourth-place web browser.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradley20Nov09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/182739/Five_Reasons_the_Google_Chrome_OS_will_Flop.html|title = Five Reasons the Google Chrome OS will Flop|accessdate =April 21, 2010|last = Bradley|first = Tony|year = 2010|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Ryan Paul of [[Ars Technica]] came to similar conclusions. He wrote that Google's Cr-48 prototype &quot;met the basic requirements for Web surfing, gaming, and personal productivity, but falls short for more intensive tasks.&quot; He praised Google's approach to security, but wondered whether mainstream computer users would accept an operating system whose only application is a browser.  &quot;In its current form, I think that the operating system could appeal to some niche audiences, like regular consumers users who really just need browsing or office productivity workers at companies that have gone Google or only use intranet apps. It's decidedly not a full-fledged alternative to the general purpose computing environments that currently ship on netbooks.&quot; Paul wrote that most of Chrome OS's advantages &quot;can be found in other software environments without having to sacrifice native applications.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul15Dec10&quot; /&gt;

In reviewing the Cr-48 on December 29, 2010, Kurt Bakke of ''Conceivably Tech'' said: &quot;in my household the Chromebook has turned into a family appliance and the most frequented computer in our household. Its 15 second startup time and dedicated Google user accounts made it the go-to device for quick searches, email as well as YouTube and Facebook activities. It has not turned into a device that can rival the appeal of any of our other notebooks â we have one gaming laptop, two mainstream notebooks and two netbooks in our household with five kids. The biggest complaint I heard was its lack of performance in Flash applications.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakke29Dec10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/4803/products/where-did-all-those-chromebooks-go-to/|title = Where Did All Those Chromebooks Go To?|accessdate =December 30, 2010|last = Bakke|first = Kurt|year = 2010|month = December| work=Conceivably Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ongoing testing, Wolfgang Gruener, also writing in ''Conceivably Tech'', said that cloud computing at cellular data speeds is unacceptable and that the lack of offline capability turns the Cr-48 &quot;into a useless brick&quot; when not connected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruener18Jan11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/5243/products/when-google%E2%80%99s-cr-48-truly-sucks|title = When Google's Cr-48 Truly Sucks|accessdate =March 2, 2011|last = Gruener|first = Wolfgang|year = 2011|month = January| work=Conceivably Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;It's difficult to use the Chromebook as an everyday device and give up what you are used to on a Mac/Windows PC, while you surely enjoy the dedicated cloud computing capabilities occasionally.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruener27Feb11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/5863/business/cr-48-and-chrome-os-when-you-really-hate-netflix|title = Cr-48 and Chrome OS: When You Really Hate Netflix|accessdate =March 2, 2011|last = Gruener|first = Wolfgang|year = 2011|month = February| work=Conceivably Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He praised a March 2011 update that included new trackpad control features, scrolling support, power improvements and a large number of bug fixes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruener04Mar11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/5986/products/google-releases-first-big-chrome-os-update|title = Google Releases First Big Chrome OS Update|accessdate =March 4, 2011|last = Gruener|first = Wolfgang|year = 2011|month = March| work=Conceivably Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Android===
Google's successive introduction of the popular [[Android (operating system)|Android]]&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnet-Admob&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=27711|title=Admob: Droid and Android army make big browsing splash|last=Dignan|first=Larry |date=November 23, 2009|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Google Chrome OS has put the company behind two open source, client-based operating systems. [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] accused Google of not being able to make up its mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/steve-ballmer-calls-chrome-os-highly-interesting-says-google/ | title= Steve Ballmer calls Chrome OS &quot;highly interesting,&quot; says Google &quot;can't make up their mind&quot; | first= Nilay | last= Patel | date= July 14, 2009 | publisher=AOL (Engadget) | accessdate=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google has suggested that the two operating systems address different markets, mobile and personal computing, which remain distinct despite the growing convergence of the devices. Co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] suggested that the two systems &quot;will likely converge over time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10402653-265.html | title=Brin: Google's OSes likely to converge | first=Tom | last=Krazit | date=November 20, 2009 | publisher=CNET News | accessdate=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Steven Levy]] wrote that &quot;the dissonance between the two systems was apparent&quot; at the 2011 Google I/O developer conference. &quot;Each day of the event featured a keynote devoted to one system followed by a press briefing where each team leader (Android's Andy Rubin and Chrome's Sundar Pichai) unconvincingly tried to explain why the systems weren't competitive. Co-founder Sergey Brin addressed the question by saying that owning two promising OS's was a problem that most companies would love to face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy: You're Busted&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Steven|title=Jobs to PC: 'You're Busted!' And Other Notes From The OS Wars|url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/06/apple-jobs-os-wars/|accessdate=7 June 2011|newspaper=Wired|date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design goals and direction==
Early in the project, Google put online many details of Chrome OS's design goals and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chromium Projects: Chrome OS|url=http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   But the company has not followed up with a technical description of the completed operating system.

===User interface===
[[File:Chromium OS Logon Screen.png|thumb|right|Old Chrome / Chromium OS Login Screen]]
Design goals for Google Chrome OS's user interface included using minimal screen space by combining applications and standard Web pages into a single tab strip, rather than separating the two. Designers considered a reduced window management scheme that would operate only in full-screen mode. Secondary tasks would be handled with &quot;panels&quot;: floating windows that dock to the bottom of the screen for tasks like chat and music players. Split screens were also under consideration for viewing two pieces of content side-by-side. Google Chrome OS would follow the Chrome browser's practice of leveraging [[HTML5]]'s offline modes, background processing, and notifications. Designers proposed using search and pinned tabs as a way to quickly locate and access applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;UX&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience|title=The Chromium Projects: User Experience|publisher=Google|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
In preliminary design documents for the Chromium OS open source project, Google described a three-tier architecture: firmware, browser and window manager, and system-level software and [[User space|userland]] services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Security overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/security-overview|title=Security Overview: Chromium OS design documents|publisher=Google|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The firmware contributes to fast boot time by not probing for hardware, such as floppy disk drives, that are no longer common on computers, especially netbooks. The firmware also contributes to security by verifying each step in the boot process and incorporating system recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Security overview&quot; /&gt;
* System-level software includes the Linux kernel that has been patched to improve boot performance. Userland software has been trimmed to essentials, with management by [[Upstart]], which can launch services in parallel, re-spawn crashed jobs, and defer services in the interest of faster booting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Security overview&quot; /&gt;
* The window manager handles user interaction with multiple client windows much like other [[X window]] managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Security overview&quot; /&gt;

===Remote application access and virtual desktop access===
In June 2010, Google software engineer Gary KaÄmarÄÃ­k wrote that Chrome OS will access remote applications through a technology unofficially called &quot;Chromoting,&quot; which would resemble Microsoft's [[Remote Desktop Connection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Metz&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Metz|first=Cade|title=Google morphs Chrome OS into netbook thin client|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/09/google_to_include_remote_access_in_chrome_os/|accessdate=June 14, 2010|newspaper=[[The Register]]|date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name has since been changed to &quot;remoting,&quot; and is &quot;probably closer to running an application via [[Terminal Services]] or by first connecting to a host machine by using RDP or VNC.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mathews|first=Lee|title=Google Chrome's Remoting feature shows up in Chromium with enterprise implications|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/08/13/google-chrome-os-remoting/|accessdate=August 22, 2010|date=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial roll-outs of Chrome-OS laptops ([[Chromebooks]]) indicate an interest in enabling users to access virtual desktops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/google/230800190/|title=Google Pleased With Chromebook Sales|work=InformationWeek|last =Claburn|first =Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217920/Orlando_tries_out_600_Chromebooks?taxonomyId=77|title = Orlando tries out 600 Chromebooks, The Chrome OS-based laptops may fit into city's cloud strategy|last =Thibodeau|first = Patrick| work =Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware support===
Google Chrome OS is initially intended for secondary devices like netbooks, not as a user's primary PC,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-11/19&quot; /&gt; and will run on hardware incorporating an [[x86]] or [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based processor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Womack|first=Brian|date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2009|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aTd2k.YdQZ.Y|title=Google to Challenge Microsoft With Operating System|publisher=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Chrome OS will support [[hard disk drive]]s, Google has requested that its hardware partners use [[solid-state drives]] &quot;for performance and reliability reasons&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chromium Developer FAQ&quot; /&gt; as well as the lower capacity requirements inherent in an operating system that accesses applications and most user data on remote servers. In November 2009 Matthew Papakipos, engineering director for the Google Chrome OS claimed that the Chrome OS consumes one-sixtieth as much drive space as [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9141191/Google_Chrome_OS_will_not_support_hard_disk_drives|title=Google Chrome OS will not support hard-disk drives|last=Mearian|first=Lucas |date=November 19, 2009 |work=Computerworld|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated media player, file manager===
Google integrates a [[media player (application software)|media player]] into both Chrome OS and the Chrome browser, enabling users to play back MP3s, view JPEGs, and handle other multimedia files while offline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metz&quot;/&gt;

Chrome OS also includes an integrated [[file manager]] resembling those found on other operating systems, with the ability to display folders and their associated files, as well as preview and manage file contents using a variety of Web applications, including [[Google Docs]] and [[Box.net]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET integ filemanager&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=Chrome OS goes offline, gets file manager|url=http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20062001-12.html|accessdate=11 August 2011|newspaper=CNET download.com|date=August 10, 1011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printing===
[[Google Cloud Print]] is Google's proposed solution to help any application on any device to print on any printer. While the cloud provides virtually any connected device with information access, the task of &quot;developing and maintaining print subsystems for every combination of hardware and operating system â from desktops to netbooks to mobile devices â simply isn't feasible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Cloud Print&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2010/04/new-approach-to-printing.html|title=A New Approach to Printing|last=Jazayeri|first=Mike|date=April 15, 2010|work=The Chromium Blog|publisher=Google Inc.|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appscout.com/2010/04/google_talks_up_cloud-based_pr.php|title=Google Talks Cloud-Based Printing for Chrome OS|last=Heater|first=Brian|date=April 16, 2010|work=App Scout|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cloud service would entail installing a piece of software, called a [[Proxy server|proxy]], as part of Chrome OS. The proxy would register the printer with the service, manage the print jobs, provide the printer driver functionality, and give status alerts for each job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Google moving closer to Chrome OS printing|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20002680-93.html|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Link handling===
{{original research|section|date=September 2011}}

Chrome OS was designed with the intention of having user documents and files stored on online servers.  However, both Chrome OS and the Chrome browser have unresolved decisions regarding handling specific file types offline. For example, if a JPEG is opened from a local storage device, should a specific Web application be automatically opened to view it, and if so, which one? Similarly, if a user clicks on a .doc file, which website should open: [[Microsoft Office Live]], Gview, or a previewing utility? The project director at that time, Matthew Papakipos, noted that Windows developers have faced the same fundamental problem: &quot;[[Quicktime]] is fighting with [[Windows Media Player]], which is fighting with Chrome.&quot; As the number of Web applications increases, the same problem arises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ars Technica: Google Talks&quot; /&gt;

===Security===
In March 2010, Google software security engineer Will Drewry discussed Chrome OS security. Drewry described Chrome OS as a &quot;hardened&quot; operating system featuring auto-updating and [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] features that will reduce malware exposure. He said that Chrome OS netbooks will be shipped with [[Trusted Platform Module]], and include both a &quot;trusted bootpath&quot; and a physical switch under the battery compartment that actuates a developer mode. That mode drops some specialized security functions but increases developer flexibility. Drewry also emphasized that the open source nature of the operating system will contribute greatly to its security by allowing constant developer feedback.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messmer06Mar10&quot; /&gt;

At a December 2010 press conference, Google claimed that Chrome OS would be the most secure consumer operating system due in part to a verified boot capability, in which the initial boot code, stored in [[read-only memory]], checks for system compromises.&lt;ref name=Paul08Dec10 /&gt;

===Shell access===

Chrome OS includes the Chrome Shell, or &quot;crosh&quot;, which offers minimal functionality such as ping and ssh, but no [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]-like [[Shell (computing)|shell]] capabilities. In developer mode, a full-featured Bash shell can be opened via [[Virtual terminal|VT]]-2, and is also accessible via the crosh command &lt;code&gt;shell&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChromiumProj:PokingNotebooks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Poking around your Chrome OS Notebook|url=http://www.chromium.org/poking-around-your-chrome-os-device|work=The Chromium Projects|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
