'''Jeffrey Rotter''' is a writer. He has written for numerous publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Spin magazine]]'', [[ESPN]], ''McSweeneyâs'', ''[[The Literary Review]]'' and ''[[The New York Observer]]''. In 2006 he completed his MFA in fiction at [[Hunter College]], where he studied under Peter Carey, Colson Whitehead, Colum McCann, and Andrew Sean Greer. At Hunter he was awarded a Hertog Fellowship to perform research for Jennifer Egan. A longtime [[Brooklyn]] resident, he lives with his wife and their small boy, Felix.

His first novel, ''The Unknown Knowns'', was published by Scribner on March 17, 2009. The book is about a guy called Jim Rath who dreams of building a museum based on [[The Aquatic Ape Theory]] of human evolution while being chased by an agent from The Department of Homeland Security. Jim thinks the agent is an emissary from a lost aquatic race called Nautikons; the agent thinks Jim is a terrorist. They are both wrong.

Douglas Coupland calls ''The Unknown Knowns'' a âwonderful book - smart, tight, and funny - Confederacy of Dunces meets Linus waiting for the Great Pumpkin.&quot;&lt;ref name=marsh&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unknown Knowns|url=http://www.marsh-agency.co.uk/titles/?id=6909|publisher=The Marsh Agency|accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And Booklist has called the novel a âVonnegut-esque tale of delusion, violence and homeland security â¦ a hyperintelligent, surrealistic tale with a wackiness factor worthy of Kilgore Trout.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Booklist'', November 15, 2008; http://www.booklistonline.com/default.aspx?page=show_product&amp;pid=3071483.&lt;/ref&gt;
