'''Freeware''' (from &quot;free&quot; and &quot;software&quot;) is [[computer software]] that is available for use at no cost or for an optional fee,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freeware Freeware]&quot; (2010). ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''. Accessed January 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but usually with one or more restricted usage rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;linfo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lawrence&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu&quot; /&gt; Freeware is in contrast to [[commercial software]], which is typically sold for profit, but might be distributed for a business or commercial purpose in the aim to expand the [[marketshare]] of a &quot;premium&quot; product. Freeware is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu&quot; /&gt; The term &quot;freeware&quot; is commonly used for [[closed source]] or [[proprietary software]], but since the term is related to price (and not clearly to issues like license terms, availability of the source code or copyright status) it is sometimes also applied to [[free software]]/[[open-source software]]. Popular examples of freeware include [[Google Chrome]] or [[Adobe Flash Player]]. Popular examples of free/open source software which is sometimes referred to as freeware, include [[Firefox]] or [[7-Zip]].

==History==
The term ''freeware'' was coined by [[Andrew Fluegelman]] when he wanted to sell a communications program named [[PC-Talk]] that he had created but for which he did not wish to use traditional methods of distribution because of their cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://textfiles.fisher.hu/news/freeware.txt Fisher.hu]&lt;/ref&gt; Fluegelman actually distributed PC-Talk via a process now referred to as [[shareware]]. Current use of the term freeware does not necessarily match the original concept by Andrew Fluegelman.

The term ''freeware'' was used often in the 1980s for programs released only as executables, with source code not available.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/words-to-avoid.html#Freeware |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |author=Free Software Foundation, Inc. |quote=Please don't use the term âfreewareâ as a synonym for âfree software.â The term âfreewareâ was used often in the 1980s for programs released only as executables, with source code not available. Today it has no particular agreed-on definition. |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html |title=Categories of free and nonfree software |quote=The term âfreewareâ has no clear accepted definition, but it is commonly used for packages which permit redistribution but not modification (and their source code is not available).

==Criteria==
===Software license===
Software classified as freeware is licensed at no cost and is either fully functional for an unlimited time; or has only basic functions enabled with a fully functional version available commercially or as shareware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Distinctions from other software licenses===
The [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) has formally defined the term &quot;Free software&quot; in 1986 and requested that people avoid referring to &quot;Free Software&quot; as &quot;freeware&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu&quot; /&gt; Members of FOSS community believe that &quot;freedom to use&quot; implies that the end user is free to run, study, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=The Free Software Definition |quote=âFree softwareâ is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of âfreeâ as in âfree speech,â not as in âfree beer.â ... Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freeware is also distinct from [[shareware]]; the latter obliges the user to pay after some trial period or to gain additional functionality.&lt;ref name=&quot;linfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Sometimes, the class of shareware produced without a time limit, but with intentionally-limited functionality is erroneously referred to as freeware. This &quot;freeware&quot; is easily identified by an option to upgrade for a more enhanced version, e.g: basic version upgrades to &quot;Pro&quot; version.

Many freeware products are developed by commercial developers alongside an expanded product with more features which is sold for profit. This type of freeware is released as a type of promotion for the other product, which is often based on the same code base with only a [[compiler flag]] required to produce the free version. The [[BBEdit]], [[BBEdit Lite]] and [[TextWrangler]] text editors for the [[Macintosh]] are an example of this model of freeware.

== Method of distribution ==
Freeware cannot economically rely on commercial promotion. Thus the internet is the primary resource for information on which freeware is available, useful, and is not [[malware]]. However, there are also many [[List of computer magazines|computer magazines]] or newspapers that provide ratings for freeware and include compact discs or other [[storage media]] containing freeware.

== Criticism ==
The pure freeware model of software development has been criticized as &quot;unsustainable&quot; because it requires a single entity to be responsible for updating and enhancing the product, which is then given away for free. Most successful freeware products have been ad-supported or &quot;[[freemium]]&quot; in which the free product serves to promote a commercial offering.[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/saas/free-is-not-a-business-model/807] Other freeware projects are simply released as [[one off]] programs with no promise or expectation of further development. These may include [[source code]], in the case of [[open source software]], so that a user can make any required or desired changes themselves.
