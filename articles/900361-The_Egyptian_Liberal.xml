Fiore lives in [[San Francisco, California]], and his cartoons have appeared in numerous American papers and a number of websites. He studied [[political science]] at [[Colorado College]] and was a staff cartoonist for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''. He left newspapers for animated online comics in 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;&gt;Summers, Nick (December 18, 2006). &quot;Satire: Singing a Different 'Toon'&quot;.

In some of his Flash cartoons, Fiore makes use of several characters more than once. Some of the characters include:

* Dogboy &amp; Mr. DanâAn anthropomorphic dog chats with his friend Mr. Dan, who is rabidly conservative.

* Flamey McGassy
* Ouchieâa talking [[Band-aid|bandaid]]
* Captain Killmore
* Snuggly the Security Bearâa rather sadistic teddy bear who puts a positive spin on domestic [[spying]] and [[wiretap]]s
* Right-wing Ralphieâa squat lawyer with pixie wings who fights for homosexuals to gain restitution for being &quot;forced&quot; into marriage. After the passage of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], he celebrates the &quot;protection of heterosexual marriage&quot;. He is a caricature of [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]], the former Religious Right leader.
* Buzzie the Flyâa [[Cajun]] fly who updates the nation on the [[New Orleans]] reconstruction, especially the living conditions of [[Hurricane Katrina]] refugees
