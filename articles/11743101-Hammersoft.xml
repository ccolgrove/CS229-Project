The '''2007 UCF Knights football team''' represented the [[University of Central Florida]] in the [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season]].  Their head coach is [[George O'Leary]]. 2007 was the first year the [[UCF Knights football|UCF Knights]] played all of their home games at [[Bright House Networks Stadium]], which they had just opened on the main campus of UCF in [[Orlando, Florida]].

The Knights were led on offense by [[quarterback]] [[Kyle Israel]] and Consensus All-American [[running back]] [[Kevin Smith (running back)|Kevin Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157896 | title=#7 Kyle Israel | QB | work=ESPN.com | publisher=The Disney Company | accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/college/knights/orl-fbcucffolo0307sep03,0,7398981.story | title=UCF upbeat as date with Texas looms  | work=OrlandoSentinel.com | publisher=Tribune Company |author=Hightower, Kyle | date=September 3, 2007 | accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCF ESPN box&quot;/&gt;  UCF sought to prove they belonged on the big stage, and got their first chance by hosting the [[2007 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas Longhorns]], ultimately losing by only a field goal.

UCF ultimately went 9-3 in the regular season and 7-1 in C-USA, with their only conference loss being at [[2007 East Carolina Pirates football team|East Carolina]], and won the Eastern Division. They would go on to host their second [[2007 Conference USA Football Championship Game|Conference USA Championship]]. Taking revenge on [[2007 Tulsa Golden Hurricane football team|Tulsa]] for beating them two years before, UCF won the game, 44-25, to take their first Conference USA title.

They would go on to their first [[2007 Liberty Bowl|Liberty Bowl]] berth against [[2007 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. Their defense held it close, but the offense was unable to re-fire, and UCF lost the game, 10-3.

Kevin Smith would ultimately forego his senior year and go to the [[2008 NFL Draft]], where he was selected with the first pick of the third round by the [[Detroit Lions]], the highest Knight to go in the draft since [[Daunte Culpepper]] in 1999.

The game was a back-and-forth contest.  Texas took an early three&amp;nbsp;point lead and then UCF made a touchdown to go ahead 7&amp;nbsp;3.  The Longhorns led 20&amp;nbsp;10 at half-time, but the Knights came back to take a 24&amp;nbsp;23 lead early in the fourth&amp;nbsp;quarter.  Texas then scored two&amp;nbsp;field goals and a touchdown and appeared to be on the way to running out the clock before a [[Jamaal Charles]] fumble gave the Knights the ball back with about two&amp;nbsp;minutes left in the game.  UCF made a touchdown and a two-point conversion to cut Texas' lead to 35&amp;ndash;32 with 35 seconds remaining.  When the Knights were unable to recover their onside kick attempt, Texas was able to run out the clock and preserve their three-point victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN Texas at UCF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCF ESPN play-by-play&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=272582116&amp;period=0 | title=(6) Texas 35, UCF 32 Play-by-play | work=ESPNU.com | publisher=The Disney Company | date=September 15, 2007 | accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCF ESPN Drive chart&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/drivechart?gameId=272582116 | title=(6) Texas 35, UCF 32 Drive chart | work=ESPNU.com | publisher=The Disney Company | date=September 15, 2007 | accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first [[Conference USA]] game for both teams. UCF took a strong lead early in the game, with the halftime score at 42-0, and a lead at one point of 49-0. The UCF Knights have beaten Memphis every time they have played them since joining Conference USA three years ago.  During the game Kyle Israel and freshman Michael Greco were used in tandem at quarterback, and their success in the game drew immediate comparisons to [[Chris Leak]] and [[Tim Tebow]] at [[2007 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] the previous year.

UCF again took a command lead of 30-6 into halftime, but this time permitting the winless Louisiana-Lafayette team within 20 was more concerning.  After the game, Coach O'Leary resolved to remind his team of the importance of playing hard all four quarters of the game, which would be important especially with two road games coming up.

After going into the half up 28-17, UCF took a surprising downturn with five turnovers in the third quarter: 2 Kyle Israel interceptions, one Michael Greco interception, and two lost fumbles between Israel and running back Kevin Smith.  ECU outscored UCF 28-3 in the third to take the win.

South Florida came into the game ranked #5 in both the [[AP Poll|AP]] and [[Coaches Poll]]s going into the game, but UCF would not hold the game as close as they did when they faced then-#6 Texas.  UCF scored their only offensive pointsâa Kyle Israel rush for a touchdown, and a field goalâin the first half.  UCF and USF would also exchange [[safety (American football score)|safeties]], but South Florida held a commanding lead at halftime and proceeded to rout the Knights in the second half, with USF's second- and third-string QBs throwing long touchdown passes against a demoralized UCF defense enroute to a 64-12 thrashing of the Knights.  UCF was held to just 145 yards total offense, while South Florida used several big plays to dominate the UCF defense, advancing 543 total yards even though UCF controlled the ball for three minutes longer than South Florida.

South Florida emerged #2 in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] and [[AP Poll]]s, and #3 in the [[Coaches Poll|Coaches]] and [[Harris Interactive College Football Poll|Harris Poll]]s.

UCF broke free of the two-game losing streak at home against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane, taking the lead in the 2nd quarter and never looking back.  Kyle Israel completed 21 of 29 for 229 yards, passing and running for touchdowns, and Kevin Smith rushed for 178 yards with three running touchdowns, catching another.  Michael Torres kicked three field goals.

UCF's defense intercepted Southern Miss QB [[Stephen Reaves]] three times, and Kevin Smith ran the ball a UCF-record 43 times for 175 yards and two touchdowns.  Smith reasserted himself as the nation's #2 rusher, and the Junior tailback took the school's career rushing yards record (3,372).  UCF minimized its mistakes, getting through the game without turning the ball over for the first time since their first game against NC State.

UCF traveled to Birmingham and went on to defeat UAB in a hard fought game. The 2-8 Blazers proved troublesome for the Knights, but UCF finished them off towards the end of the fourth quarter. Earlier in the day, Marshall defeated ECU giving UCF the lead in the C-USA East Division, and due to a blowout win over Houston by Tulsa, the Knights are set to host the Conference Championship at their new on-campus stadium. Kevin Smith broke more records this game. He had 320 yards, 41 carries, and 4 touchdowns. He became the state of Florida's all-time single season rushing yards leader. He won the ESPN All-America Player of the Week for his effort.

Tulsa and UCF met at the C-USA Championship for the second time; Tulsa beat UCF at the [[Florida Citrus Bowl]] in Downtown Orlando in 2005.

Kevin Smith continued his dominance, running for 284 yards with 4 touchdowns.  Tulsa kept it close in the first half as UCF's defense seemed slow to get started.  In the second half, however, they only scored on a safety.  Paul Smith, the Tulsa quarterback, threw for 426 yards and three touchdowns, but also gave up three interceptions.  UCF won their first ever conference title in football.

Kevin Smith finished the game with 2,448 rushing yards on the season, second all-time for single-season rushing yards in FBS history. Only [[Barry Sanders]], who rushed for 2,628 yards in 1989 for Oklahoma State, has rushed for more yards in a single season.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Walt Disney Company&quot;/&gt;
