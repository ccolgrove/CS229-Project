'''SimPy''' is a process-based, [[object-oriented]] discrete-event [[simulation language]]. It is implemented in standard [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and released as [[open source]] software under the [[ GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL). It provides the modeller with components for building a [[simulation]] model including ''Processes'', for active entities like customers, messages, and vehicles, and ''Resources'', for passive components that form limited capacity congestion points like servers, checkout counters, and tunnels. There are two varieties of ''Buffer'' classes, ''Level''s to hold stored quantities and ''Store''s to hold sets of objects. It has commands to aid interaction between entities. It provides ''Monitor'' and ''Tally'' objects to aid in gathering statistics and uses the standard Python random module to generate random variates. 

Because it is implemented in Python, SimPy is platform-independent. It simulates parallel processes by an efficient implementation of [[coroutines]] using Python's generators capability. It is based on ideas from [[Simula]] and [[SIMSCRIPT II.5]]. 

The first version  was released in December 2002.
