'''The Brian Jonestown Massacre''' is an [[United States|American]] eclectic musical group led by [[Anton Newcombe]], whose music spans multiple genres including [[psychedelic|psychedelia]], [[electronica]], [[folk music]], blues, experimental music, and many others.

The group was founded by [[Anton Newcombe|Newcombe]], [[Matt Hollywood]], [[Ricky Maymi|Ricky Rene Maymi]], Patrick Straczek and Travis Threlkel in the early 1990s in [[San Francisco]].

The name &quot;Brian Jonestown Massacre&quot; is a [[portmanteau]] of [[The Rolling Stones]]' founder and guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and  the infamous mass [[cult]] suicide in [[Jonestown, Guyana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A timeless sound keeps psych-rockers BJM relevant|first=Kevin |last=Hopper |work=Albuquerque Journal|date=January 2, 2004|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Town Without Pity; 30 Years Later, Memories of Jonestown Evoke Guilt, Anger and Mistrust|first=Charles A |last=Krause|work=The Washington Post|date=November 19, 2008|page=C.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Anton Newcombe has been the band's only constant member; other key members have been Matt Hollywood, Joel Gion, Ricky Maymi and Jeff Davies. Newcombe and Hollywood have served as the group's primary songwriters.

1995's ''[[Methodrone]]'' approximates the UK [[shoegazing]] sound of the time. ''[[Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request]]'', one of three new albums released by the group in 1996, reflects a pastiche of '60s psychedelia that continues to characterize the BJM sound to the present day. Newcombe defines the term 'psychedelic' as &quot;mind-expanding,&quot; and BJM's output is generally referred to as such because of the revivalist nature of the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://soundsxp.com/artman2/publish/oldalbums/Brian_Jonestown_Massacre_2191.shtml |title= The Brian Jonestown Massacre, ''Tepid Peppermint Wonderland: A Retrospective'' album review |publisher= SoundsXP |author= Ged M |date= July 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.caughtinthecrossfire.com/music/interviews/1792 |title= Brian Jonestown Massacre Interview |publisher= Caught in the Crossfire |first= Rachel |last= Clegg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of Middle Eastern and Brazilian music are also apparent, along with influences by 1960s artists such as [[The Beatles]], [[Os Mutantes]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Donovan]], [[The Byrds]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[The Rolling Stones]]. In fact, ''Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request'' is an ''[[homage]]'' to the Rolling Stones' [[1967 in music|1967]] album,  ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=''Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request''|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/their-satanic-majesties-second-request-r282345|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second album they released in 1996, ''[[Take It from the Man!]]'', was recorded in the Rolling Stones' mid-1960s style of rock rooted in [[rhythm and blues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=''Take It from the Man!''|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/take-it-from-the-man-r255357|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Thank God for Mental Illness]]'', their third record released in 1996, displays a country and [[rhythm and blues]] ''[[oeuvre]]'' with voice and acoustic guitar dominating the overall sound. This is a format that Newcombe occasionally resorts to when presenting live material during times of transition in the band. A further [[country music|country]]/[[Folk music|folk]] approach was applied to the ''[[Bringing It All Back Home - Again]]'', the title itself an ''[[homage]]'' to [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''.

Electronic music crept into [[2003 in music|2003]]'s ''[[And This Is Our Music]]'', evidencing more contemporary influences as well as name-checking the identically-titled albums ''[[This Is Our Music (disambiguation)|This Is Our Music]]'', each by the artists [[Galaxie 500]] and [[Ornette Coleman]]. In [[2005 in music|2005]] the band released the EP ''[[We Are the Radio]]'' on Newcombe's label [[Anton Newcombe|The Committee to Keep Music Evil]], which featured a close collaboration with [[Independent music|indie]] [[singer-songwriter]] Sara Beth Tuceck.

''[[My Bloody Underground]]'' was released on Cargo Records in [[2008 in music|2008]], and demos were available since September 2007 from the band's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brianjonestownmassacre.com/bandinfo.html|title=The Brian Jonestown Massacre official website|publisher =The Brian Jonestown Massacre|accessdate=2008-01-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071022153929/http://www.brianjonestownmassacre.com/bandinfo.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title has been interpreted{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to be a name-check to the bands [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and [[The Velvet Underground]] as well as referencing BJM's endless procession of bandmates and the &quot;scene&quot; they collectively created.{{Or|date=March 2010}} Newcombe has down-played such interpretations, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/2984902 |title= The Brian Jonestown Massacre: enraging Anton, unintentionally |first= Dom |last= Gourlay |publisher= Drowned in Sound |date= March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos of the songs on the album have also been released, including a music video compilation DVD entitled 'Book of Days'.

As of 2008, Newcombe has become increasingly interested in ''[[pastiche]]s''. The percussion featured in the song &quot;Amazing Electronic Talking Cave&quot; from the ''[[Just Like Kicking Jesus]]'' EP for example, was derived from [[The Rolling Stones]]' &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot;. &quot;Ãungur HnÃ­fur&quot; was adapted from [[Goldfrapp]]'s &quot;[[Ooh La La (Goldfrapp song)|Ooh La La]]&quot;. The percussion for &quot;Feel It&quot; was based on that of [[Anita Ward]]'s song &quot;[[Ring My Bell]]&quot;. &quot;This Is the One Thing We Did Not Want to Have Happen&quot; draws elements from [[Joy Division]], combining the percussion on &quot;She's Lost Control&quot; with the lyrics to &quot;I Remember Nothing&quot; (both of which are featured on [[Joy Division]]'s [[1979 in music|1979]] album ''[[Unknown Pleasures]]''), as well as fashioning grating guitar-effects reminiscent of the anarchist-[[punk rock|punk]] band [[Crass]], which, for example, are found on the latter's &quot;Mother-Earth&quot; (from their [[1979 in music|1979]] album ''[[Stations of the Crass]]''). &quot;This Is the First of Your Last Warning&quot; loosely derives its percussion from [[Michael Jackson]]'s &quot;[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock With You]]&quot; (or [[Public Image Ltd.]]'s &quot;Albatross&quot; from their [[1979 in music|1979]] album [[Metal Box]]).

The Brian Jonestown Massacre recorded both ''One EP'' and ''[[Who Killed Sgt. Pepper?]]'' in Iceland and Berlin in 2009. The ''One'' EP was released in November 2009. It features the songs &quot;One&quot; and &quot;This Is the First of Your Last Warning&quot; (which would also appear on ''Sgt. Pepper''), an English version of &quot;This Is The First Of Your Last Warning&quot;, and an exclusive track &quot;Bruttermania&quot;. ''Who Killed Sgt. Pepper?'' was released in February 2010. The album features musicians such as Unnur Andrea Einarsdottir (who recorded vocals on the previous BJM album) and Felix Bondareff from the Russian band Amazing Electronic Talking Cave, as well as other musicians from France, Germany, and Iceland. [[Will Carruthers]] also appeared on the album. Soon after the album's release, it was confirmed that [[Matt Hollywood]] had returned to the band after an eleven year absence. According to Anton Newcombe, he will feature on their next album and is currently touring with the band. The group played the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP New York 2010]] music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010, in support of the album.

Newcombe's interest in cults like that of [[Jim Jones]] and [[Charles Manson]] is well known{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} (and made apparent by the band's name), and songs such as &quot;The Ballad of Jim Jones&quot; (from ''[[Thank God for Mental Illness]]'') and &quot;Arkansas Revisited&quot; (from ''[[Bringing It All Back Home â Again]]''), which is a rework of [[Charles Manson]]'s song &quot;Arkansas&quot; (which appeared on the album ''[[Lie: The Love &amp; Terror Cult]]''). Similar interests include a fascination with the [[Freemasons]], [[Aleister Crowley]], and [[Sufi]] mysticism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
