The '''2008-09 Celtic League''' (known as the '''2008â09 Magners League''' for sponsorship reasons) was the eighth [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Celtic League]] season and the third with [[Magners]] as title sponsor. The season began in September 2008 and ended in May 2009. Ten teams played each other on a home-and-away basis, with teams earning four points for a win, and a bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match. Losing teams also earned a bonus point if they lost by seven points or less.

The ten competing teams consisted of the four Irish provinces, [[Munster Rugby|Munster]], [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]] and [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]]; two Scottish regions, [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and [[Glasgow Warriors]]; and four Welsh regions, [[Cardiff Blues]], [[Newport Gwent Dragons]], [[Ospreys (rugby team)|Ospreys]] and [[Scarlets]]. The Scarlets were originally known as the &quot;Llanelli Scarlets&quot;, but renamed themselves at the start of the season, in order to reflect their regional identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scarlets drop Llanelli from name |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/llanelli_scarlets/7610188.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=11 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Munster Rugby|Munster]] were crowned champions on 30 April 2009 after the [[Ospreys (rugby team)|Ospreys]] beat the [[Newport Gwent Dragons]] 27-18 but failed to claim a bonus point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/welsh/8023379.stm|title=Ospreys 27-18 Dragons |date=2009-04-30|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
