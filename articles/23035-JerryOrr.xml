After graduating from [[Ãcole Highland Secondary School|Highland Secondary School]] in 1985, Anderson moved to Vancouver and worked as a fitness instructor. During the summer of 1989, Anderson went with her friends to a [[BC Lions]] game at [[BC Place Stadium|BC Place]], and during the game she was shown on the stadium screen wearing a [[Labatt]]'s t-shirt, causing the crowd to cheer for the 21-year-old Anderson. She was taken down to the field to receive an ovation from the crowd.  Photographer and boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced the Blue Zone Girl poster on his own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo Movies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Pamela Anderson Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800332320/bio|publisher=Yahoo! Movies|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1989 she appeared as the cover girl on ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. At this stage in her modelling career, she had decided to live in Los Angeles to further pursue her career ambitions. She became a centrefold for ''Playboy'' when the magazine chose her to be their Playmate of the Month for their February 1990 issue. She then chose to get [[breast implants]]. Anderson has since appeared in ''Playboy'' several times [[List of people in Playboy 1990â1999|in the 1990s]] and [[List of people in Playboy 2000â2009|2000s]].

===Acting and modeling===
{{Prose|date=August 2011}}
After her move to Los Angeles, she won a minor role as the original &quot;Tool Time girl&quot; on the hit television [[sitcom]], ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''. She left the show after two seasons and won the role of [[C. J. Parker]] on ''[[Baywatch]]'', a role she played between 1992 and 1997. Anderson was still modelling for ''Outdoor Life'' and appearing on the cover of the magazine each year. In 1993 Pam appeared in a music video &quot;Can't Have Your Cake&quot; by Vince Neil to promote his first solo album &quot;Exposed&quot; in which Steve Stevens played all guitars for the recording of that project.

In 1994, she was cast in her first starring role in [[Raw Justice]] also known as Good Cop, Bad Cop, a film in which she costarred with [[Stacy Keach]], [[David Keith]] and [[Airplane!]] star [[Robert Hays]]. The film won the Bronze Award at the Worldfest-Charleston in the category for dramatic theatrical films under the title Good Cop, Bad Cop. The notable cast was the focus of many reviewers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0110948/ |title=IMDb Pro : Raw Justice Business Details |publisher=Pro.imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000097/ |title=IMDb Pro : Pamela Anderson Business Details |publisher=Pro.imdb.com |date=1967-07-01 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, she acted in the film ''[[Barb Wire (film)|Barb Wire]]'' playing Barbara Rose Kopetski, which was thought by some to be Anderson's real name. The movie, a thinly veiled futuristic remake of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', was not a commercial success. In April 1997, she guest-hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]].'' She also appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of ''Playboy''.

In September 1998, Anderson starred as Vallery Irons in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] hit syndicated show ''[[V.I.P. (TV series)|V.I.P.]]'' created by [[J. F. Lawton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,33431-1,00.html|author=Joel Stein (10-31-1999)|title=Babe Tube|publisher=TIME Magazine|date=October 31, 1999|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blending action and humor in a fast-paced adventure series, with Anderson often poking fun at her tabloid image,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nytimes.com/2000/10/08/arts/television-radio-a-show-so-dumb-it-s-smart.html?scp=2&amp;sq=pamela%20anderson%20VIP%20SHOW&amp;st=Search|author=Rick Marin (10-08-2000)|title=Television, Radio|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 8, 2000|accessdate=May 21, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show explored the exciting and sometimes treacherous lives of the rich and famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/show/32003/V-I-P-/overview?scp=3&amp;sq=pamela%20anderson%20VIP%20SHOW&amp;st=Search |title=V.I.P.|publisher=The New York Times|date=Retrieved on 12-01-2007|first=Ned|last=Martel|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series lasted through a successful four year run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/ew/article/0,,275615,00.html|author=Benjamin Svetkey (03-10-2000)|title=The Squad|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, she appeared as a giantess in the music video for &quot;[[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]&quot; by California alternative rock band [[Lit (band)|Lit]].

Her role as C.J. Parker gave her more popularity and gained her attention from international viewers. She returned to ''Baywatch'' for the 2003 reunion movie, ''[[Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding]]''. She also appeared on ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'' as Fran's rival, Heather Biblow.

In early 2004, Anderson returned to the spotlight. In May, she appeared naked on the cover of ''Playboy'' magazine. It was the first time she had appeared naked on any magazine cover. Later, she posed naked for ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' and ''[[GQ]]'' magazines.

Anderson became a [[naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States on May 12, 2004, while retaining her Canadian citizenship. She has lived in Southern California since 1989.

In 2004, she released the book ''Star'', co-written by Eric Shaw Quinn, about a teenager trying to become famous. After this, she began touring the United States, signing autographs for fans at [[Wal-Mart]] stores nationwide. Her second book, the sequel ''Star Struck'', released in 2005, is a thinly veiled look at her life with Tommy Lee and the trials of celebrity life.

In April 2005, Anderson starred in a new [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Stacked]]'' as Skyler Dayton, a party girl who goes to work at a bookstore. It was cancelled on May 18, 2006, after two seasons, although some episodes had not been aired. On August 14, 2005, [[Comedy Central]] created the ''[[Comedy Central Roast#Pamela Anderson|Roast of Pamela Anderson]]'' to honour the [[sex symbol]] for the past decade. During her final speech at the Roast, Anderson referred to her breasts as &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot;.

In December 2005, [[NBC]] cut off a video of Anderson pole dancing on [[Elton John]]'s &quot;The Red Piano.&quot; NBC said that the footage was inappropriate for prime time. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp_SQcVr-7U The video] was shown on huge screens during the event, while John played &quot;The Bitch is Back&quot;.

In March 2006, it was announced that Anderson would receive a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] thanks to her many years as a model and actress. She is only the second model to receive a star. In April 2006, Anderson hosted Canada's [[Juno Award]]s, becoming the first non-singer and model to do so.

Anderson was repeatedly referenced in the 2006 mockumentary ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'' as the title character seeks to kidnap and marry her. Anderson appears in person at the end of the film confronted by Borat in a staged botched abduction.&lt;ref&gt;Marchese, David; and Willa Paskin.

She performed on February 13â14, 2008 in a Valentine's Day striptease act at the [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Crazy Horse]] cabaret in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSL0177816020080201 &quot;Pamela Anderson to perform at nude revue&quot;], ''[[Reuters]]'', 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson then starred in ''[[E!'s Pam: Girl on the Loose!|Pam: Girl on the Loose]]'', which debuted on August 3, 2008 on [[E!]] in the United States.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
In addition to her fame from modelling and acting, Anderson has received a great deal of press attention for her well-publicized personal life. Her relationships have made headlines in gossip magazines for years. Anderson married [[Tommy Lee]], drummer of [[MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e]], on February 19, 1995, after knowing him for only 96 hours and the couple eventually had two sons, Brandon Thomas Lee (b. June 6, 1996) and Dylan Jagger Lee (b. December 29, 1997), named after Pamela's great grandfather Dale Jagger Grosco who fought in World War II. During this time, she was known professionally as '''Pamela Anderson Lee'''. Anderson filed for divorce from Lee twice and reconciled with him twice, before the couple finally broke up for good, however, she admitted to newspapers that she still often had sex with him since their divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divertissement.sympatico.msn.ca/Nouvelles/NouvellesCelebrites/ContentPosting.htm?newsitemid=2635&amp;feedname=TQS_FR&amp;show=true&amp;number=3&amp;showbyline=false&amp;abc=abc|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070419055944/http://divertissement.sympatico.msn.ca/Nouvelles/NouvellesCelebrites/ContentPosting.htm?newsitemid=2635&amp;feedname=TQS_FR&amp;show=true&amp;number=3&amp;showbyline=false&amp;abc=abc|archivedate=2007-04-19|title=Pamela and Tommy together again? |accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002, Anderson publicly stated that she had contracted the [[Hepatitis C]] virus from Lee (supposedly from sharing tattoo needles), and began writing a regular column for ''[[Jane (magazine)|Jane]]'' magazine. In October 2003, Anderson jokingly said on [[Howard Stern]]'s radio show that she does not expect to live more than 10 or 15 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pamelaanderson.com/news/news.asp?item=2056 |title=Pamela Anderson Official Site and Fan Club â News Headlines Television Tabloids Magazines |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041029141238/www.pamelaanderson.com/news/news.asp?item=2056 |archivedate=2004-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was misconstrued and taken seriously by many websites and tabloids.

[[File:Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock.jpg|thumb|left|Anderson and [[Kid Rock]] in 2003]]
Since her divorce, she has been engaged to the model [[Marcus Schenkenberg]] and to the singer [[Kid Rock]] (Robert J. Ritchie). She broke up with Schenkenberg in 2001 and with Kid Rock in 2003. It was announced on July 18, 2006 that she would marry Kid Rock on July 29, 2006, on a yacht near [[St Tropez]], France. &quot;Feels like I've been stuck in a time warp,&quot; said Anderson in her [[blog]] entry. &quot;Not able to let go of MY family picture&amp;nbsp;... it's been sad and lonely and frustrating&amp;nbsp;... I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle. Well my miracle came and went. And came back and back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing.&quot; &quot;I'm moving on,&quot; she declared. &quot;I feel like I'm finally free&amp;nbsp;... I'm in love.&quot; There was extensive unconfirmed media speculation that the marriage was pregnancy-related, but the theory was based only on Anderson's representative's refusal to comment on the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pattayadailynews.com/shownews.php?IDNEWS=0000000731|title=Pattayadailynews.com|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2006, it was announced that Anderson had miscarried while in Vancouver shooting a new film, ''[[Blonde and Blonder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pamela Anderson Suffers a Miscarriage|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1557773,00.html|work=People.com|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2 August 2010|date=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen days later, on November 27, 2006, Anderson filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court from [[Kid Rock]], citing irreconcilable differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah2832.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070712233524/http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah2832.shtml|archivedate=2007-07-12|title=Access Hollywood|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some news reports have suggested that Kid Rock's outrage during a screening of ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|Borat]]'', in which she plays a cameo role, led to the filing for divorce two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/features/news/2006/11/061128_pamkidrock/|title=Spin.com|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson told talk show host [[Ellen DeGeneres]] in September 2007 that she was engaged. On September 29, Anderson and [[Rick Salomon]], applied for a marriage license in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7021566.stm Anderson to marry Paris Hilton ex] BBC News&amp;nbsp;â October 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson married Salomon between her two nightly appearances at the [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino]] in [[Hans Klok]]'s magic show in a small wedding ceremony at [[The Mirage]] on October 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Mark |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20151049,00.html |title=Pamela Anderson Weds Rick Salomon&amp;nbsp;â Weddings, Pamela Anderson, Rick Salomon |publisher=People.com |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the couple separated on December 13, and on February 22, 2008, Anderson requested through the courts that the marriage be annulled citing fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anderson seeks annulment of marriage to Salomon|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-02-26-pamela-anderson_N.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=2 August 2010|date=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex tapes===
A [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] of Anderson and Tommy Lee on their honeymoon was stolen from their home, and made a huge stir on the [[Internet]]. Anderson sued the video distribution company, [[Seth Warshavsky|Internet Entertainment Group]]. Ultimately, the Lees entered into a confidential settlement agreement with IEG. Thereafter, the company began making the tape available to subscribers to its Web sites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelline|first=Jeff|title=Pamela Lee drops video case|url=http://news.cnet.com/Pamela-Lee-drops-video-case/2100-1023_3-205848.html?tag=mncol|work=CNET News|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=2 August 2010|date=1 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second tape, which was made before the Tommy Lee tape, involving Anderson and musician [[Bret Michaels]] from [[Poison (band)|Poison]] was later announced, and an abridged version of less than 60&amp;nbsp;seconds appeared on the internet. Frames of the video first appeared in [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'']] magazine in March 1998. The tape was successfully blocked by Michaels, but a four-minute sex tape is still available on the Internet.

==Charitable work and activism==
[[File:Pamela Anderson 2.jpg|thumb|Anderson promoting vegetarianism]]
Anderson is a [[veganism|vegan]], an advocate for [[animal rights]], and an active member of the animal protection organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), taking part in several campaigns for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegnews.com/web/articles/page.do?pageId=2549&amp;catId=8 |title=Pamela AndersonÂs Vegan Diet |publisher=Vegnews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/ecofeminism/Id-Rather-Go-Naked-Than-Wear-Fur.html I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur], retrieved on May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She became a vegetarian in her early teens when she saw her father cleaning an animal he had hunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapefit.com/pamela-anderson-diet-secrets.html|title=Shapefit.com|accessdate=2007-02-26| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5ppKBfXyr | archivedate = 2010-05-18| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Anderson's campaigns as a member of PETA has been against the use of [[fur]]. In 1999, Anderson received the first [[Linda McCartney]] Memorial Award for animal rights protectors, in recognition of her campaign. In 2003, Anderson stripped down for PETA's &quot;I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur&quot; advertising campaign. On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the [[Stella McCartney]] boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did.

She has also campaigned against [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating &quot;What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable.&quot; She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.KentuckyFriedCruelty.com|title=Kentuckey Fried Cruelty|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Anderson requested that the [[Governor of Kentucky]] remove a bust of [[Colonel Sanders]], the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange. In February 2006, Anderson decided to [[boycott]] the [[Kentucky Derby]] because of its support for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

She has also campaigned against [[seal hunting]] in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] about the [[Seal hunting#Canada|annual seal hunt]] but she was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned random individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December, 2009, Anderson, photographed in a t-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA. She appears next to the headline &quot;Save the Seals&quot; in the ad and urges the public to help end &quot;Canada's annual seal slaughter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Anderson+leads+PETA+campaign+against+seal+hunt/2393089/story.html &quot;Pam Anderson leads PETA campaign against seal hunt&quot;] ''Victoria Times Colonist'' via [[Canwest News Service]] in the ''Calgary Herald'', December 30, 2009. Retrieved 2009-12-31. {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson joined forces with PETA in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker [[POM Wonderful|POM]]. The &quot;Pom Horrible Campaign&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/pam_vs_pom?qp_source=pamvspomgen?c=pvpwiki|title=PETA|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in the company halting [[animal testing|animal tests]].

In March 2005, Anderson became a spokesmodel for [[Make-up Art Cosmetics|MAC Cosmetics]]'s MAC AIDS Fund, which helped people affected by [[AIDS]] and [[HIV]]. After becoming the official spokesmodel, Anderson raised money during events in Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, and Athens.

Anderson became the celebrity spokesperson for the [[American Liver Foundation]], and served as the Grand Marshal of the SOS motorcycle ride fundraiser.

She wrote an open letter to President [[Barack Obama]] urging the legalization of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Playboy]]'' magazine; February 2009; Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in Montreal, Canada on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, &quot;In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with [[burqa]]s â is that next? I didn't think that Canada would be so puritanical.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/healthylifestyle/news/pamela-anderson-blocked-from-montreal-event-for-sexist-ad-2010157|title=Pamela Anderson's Nearly Naked PETA Ad Banned in Canada|publisher=UsMagazine.com|accessdate=2010-07-18|date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newman House'' is a [[novelty architecture|pop architecture]] building constructed in 2003 in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], Victoria, Australia, which features a large image of Anderson's face. [[Sam Newman]] commissioned local architect Cassandra Fahey to design the building, and used the image with Anderson's permission. Permits were issued retroactively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the [[Australian Institute of Architects|RAIA]] [[Victorian Architecture Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monash.edu.au/muma/exhibitions/past/2005/pavilions.html |title=Pavilions for New Architecture, Monash University Museum of Art |publisher=Monash.edu.au |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
