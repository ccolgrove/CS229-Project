Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Jaguars, the Texans finally got to play their home opener as they played a Week 5 AFC South duel with the [[Indianapolis Colts]].  Due to an illness, QB [[Matt Schaub]] was unable to play, allowing backup QB [[Sage Rosenfels]] to get the start.

In the first quarter, Houston trailed early as Colts kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] got a 46-yard field goal, along with RB [[Joseph Addai]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Texans responded with rookie RB [[Steve Slaton]] getting a 1-yard TD run, kicker [[Kris Brown]] getting a 37-yard field goal, and Rosenfels completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR [[Andre Johnson]].  In the third quarter, Houston increased its lead with Brown nailing a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans continued its run with Slaton getting a 1-yard TD run, expanding their lead to 17 points.  What followed would go down into NFL history books, as Sage Rosenfels fumbled twice and threw two interceptions to blow the biggest lead inside of 5 minutes in NFL history. The key play was known as the 'Rosencopter' play, when on third-and-eight, Rosenfels opted to try to hurdle a defender rather than sliding short of the first down. [[Gary Brackett]] recovered the fumble for a 58 yard touchdown, and Rosenfels was never the same afterwards, turning the ball over twice more. With the loss, Houston fell to 0â4.

The Texans would respond with kicker [[Kris Brown]] getting a 27-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Miami added on to its lead as Pennington completed an 80-yard TD pass to Cobbs.
