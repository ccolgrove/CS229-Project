'''Scott Scovell Hamilton''' (born August 28, 1958) is an [[United States|American]] [[Figure skating|figure skater]] and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist. He won four consecutive U.S. championships (1981â1984), four consecutive World Championships (1981â1984) and a gold medal in the [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984 Olympics]].
His &quot;signature move&quot; was a backflip, a feat that few other figure skaters could perform. Even though it generally earned him no extra points, he would make sure to include it in his routine in order to please his fans.

==Childhood==
Hamilton was born in [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253417/Scott-Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[adopted]] at the age of six weeks by Dorothy (nÃ©e McIntosh), a professor and Ernest S. Hamilton, a professor of biology,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmreference.com/film/80/Scott-Hamilton.html&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Bowling Green, Ohio]]. He has two siblings, older sister Susan (his parents' biological daughter) and younger brother Steven (who was also adopted).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/ham0int-1&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended Kenwood Elementary School.
When Scott was two years old he contracted a mysterious illness that caused him to stop growing.  After numerous tests and several wrong diagnoses (including a diagnosis of [[cystic fibrosis]] that gave him just six months to live), the disease began to correct itself. His family physician sent him to Boston Children's hospital to see a Dr. Shwachman.  Sources are unable to verify if he was actually diagnosed by Dr. Shwachman as having [[Shwachman-Diamond syndrome]]. It is said that a special diet and exercise cured the problem. However, he grew to only 5-foot-2Â½ and he weighed only 108 pounds during his peak skating years. Scott attended Bowling Green State University in Ohio. 

At age 13 he began training with [[Pierre Brunet (figure skater)|Pierre Brunet]], a former Olympic champion. In 1976 however, he was almost forced to quit skating because the cost of training was too high, and he enrolled in college. However, [[Helen M. McLoraine|Helen and Frank McLoraine]] stepped in to provide financial support for Hamilton to continue his training. Hamilton would later work with the McLoraines in continuing philanthropic support for figure skating.

==Skating career==
In 1980, Hamilton finished third in the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], earning him a place on the U.S. Olympic team.  He finished in fifth place at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]], where he also had the honor of carrying the American flag in the opening ceremony. His breakthrough performance was in the 1981 U.S. Championships.  He performed flawlessly and the audience was at a standing ovation several seconds before the end of the performance.  He never lost a competition again.  In 1981 he won gold in the [[World Figure Skating Championships]]. He won gold again in 1982 and 1983 at the U.S. and World Championships, and won the gold medal at the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. He won that year's World Championships and then turned professional in April 1984. 
[[Image:Scott-Hamilton-Stars-on-Ice.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hamilton's final performance on the [[Stars on Ice]] tour]]
After turning professional, Hamilton toured with [[Ice Capades]] for two years, and then created &quot;Scott Hamilton's American Tour,&quot; which later was renamed [[Stars on Ice]].  He co-founded, co-produced and performed in Stars on Ice for fifteen years before retiring from the tour in 2001 (though he still returns for occasional guest performances). 

He has been awarded numerous skating honors, including being the first solo male figure skater to be awarded the [[Jacques Favart Award]] (in 1988). In 1990 he was inducted into the [[United States Olympic Hall of Fame]].

Hamilton was a skating commentator for [[CBS]] television for many years, beginning in 1985.  He has also worked for [[NBC]] television.  In 2006 he was the host of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] television program &quot;[[Skating with Celebrities]].&quot; He currently serves on the Board of Directors for Special Olympics International.

==Television appearances==
Hamilton voiced the dog dancing commentator on the [[King of the Hill]] episode &quot;Dances with Dogs&quot;.
He was also seen in [[The Fairly OddParents]] episode ''The Fairy World Games&quot; as [[Timmy Turner]]'s cohost

He appeared on the August 26, 2008 episode of [[Wanna Bet?]], where he finished 2nd, losing to [[Bill Engvall]]. In 2009, he appeared in the second season of [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 8)|Celebrity Apprentice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/01/08/arts/AP-TV-Celebrity-Apprentice.html?_r=1 Trump Rounds Up Celebs for New Season of the Apprentice] NY Times, January 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He made a small appearance on [[Roseanne]] as himself, participating in a mock linoleum skating competition credit sequence.

He also made a brief appearance in &quot;Blades of Glory.&quot;

On March 8, 2010, ''Scott Hamilton: Return to the Ice'' premiered on the Bio Channel.  The two-hour television special chronicled Scott's return to skating after battling cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvbythenumbers&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Personal life==
In 1990, as the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] honored its 10th birthday, Scott Hamilton was recognized as the Foundation's first ever &quot;Celebrity Wish Granter of the Year.&quot;

In 1993, the [[Associated Press]] released results of a national sports study in which Hamilton ranked as one of the top eight most popular athletes in America, ranking far ahead of big-name sports stars such as [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Troy Aikman]], [[Dan Marino]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Joe Montana]], and [[Nolan Ryan]].&lt;ref&gt;STEVE WILSTEIN; 17 June 1994; The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Hamilton had a much-publicized battle with [[testicular cancer]].  He made a return to skating after his treatment and his story was featured in magazines and on television.

On November 14, 2002, he married Tracie Robinson, a nutritionist. The couple have two sons, Aidan McIntosh Hamilton (born September 13, 2003) and Maxx Hamilton (born January 21, 2008),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20172901,00.html Ice Skater Scott Hamilton &amp; His Wife Have a Boy â Babies, Scott Hamilton : People.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and a dog named Boogie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theloveddog.com/ âThe Loved Dogâ DVD, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  The family resides in [[Franklin, Tennessee]].

It was announced on November 12, 2004, that Hamilton had a benign brain tumor, which was treated at the [[Cleveland Clinic]].  He has also helped benefit [[St. Jude's Children's Hospital]] and the [[Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation]] where he is an honorary board member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multiplemyeloma.org/foundation/1.05.php MMRF Honorary Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hamilton wrote the book, ''[[The Great Eight]]'', which shared the secrets to his happiness and how he overcame numerous challenges and disappointments throughout his life.

On June 23, 2010, Hamilton went into brain surgery to prevent the recurrence of the benign tumor discovered in 2004.  Called [[craniopharyngioma]], the tumor could have caused blindness if left untreated.  On June 25, 2010 it was reported that Hamilton was resting comfortably in the hospital and was &quot;Doing great&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20396952,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 Scott was in the hospital again, reported &quot;People Magazine&quot;. Apparently in the removal of the benign tumor in June, an artery in the brain was &quot;nicked&quot;.  They stopped the bleeding but an aneurysm formed days later. Scott came through the surgery well, reported the article.
