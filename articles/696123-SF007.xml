==Personal life==
For many years Hayes declined to discuss his [[sexual orientation]], saying he believed that audiences would therefore be more open-minded about his characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | subject=Sean Hayes | interviewer=Terry Gross | title=Will And Grace' Star Sean Hayes Steps To Broadway | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126219932 | format=audio/transcript | program=''Fresh Air'' | callsign=NPR / WHYY | date=29 April 2010 | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2010 interview with ''[[The Advocate]]'' magazine, he discussed his sexuality and appeared to imply that he is gay: &quot;'Really? Youâre gonna shoot the gay guy down? I never have had a problem saying who I am,' he states....'I am who I am. I was never in, as they say. Never,' he insists.&quot; He indicated that he was in a relationship. Answering the charge that he had skirted the issue of his sexuality for too long, Hayes commented, &quot;I feel like Iâve contributed monumentally to the success of the gay movement in America, and if anyone wants to argue that, Iâm open to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ari Karpel | title=Sean Hayes: I Am Who I Am | url=http://www.advocate.com/Print_Issue/Cover_Stories/Sean_Hayes_I_Am_Who_I_Am/ | work=The Advocate | date=April 2010 | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
