'''Highway 5A''', the ''[[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]]-[[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]] Highway'', is [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]]'s pre-[[1986]] alignment south of Kamloops.  Unlike the four-lane Highway 5 freeway, the 182 km (113&amp;nbsp;mi) long Highway 5A is only two lanes.

==Route details==

Starting in Princeton, Highway 5A goes through 63&amp;nbsp;km (39&amp;nbsp;mi) of undeveloped land north to its junction with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] eastbound at Aspen Grove.  Highway 97C westbound from Aspen Grove follows Highway 5A northwest for 23&amp;nbsp;km (14&amp;nbsp;mi) to its first crossover of Highway 5 at [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]].  Highway 5A circles around Merritt for 7 km (4&amp;nbsp;mi) to its second crossover of Highway 5 in the north area of Merritt.  Back to the east of Highway 5, Highway 5A goes north northeast for 89 km (55&amp;nbsp;mi), passing through the community of [[Quilchena, British Columbia|Quilchena]] en route, before terminating within Kamloops at its junction with Highways 5, [[Trans-Canada Highway|1]] and [[British Columbia Highway 97|97]] (which are overlapped at the point where 5A terminates).
