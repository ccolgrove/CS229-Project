In [[baseball]], an '''extra base hit''' ('''EB''', '''EBH''' or '''XBH'''), also known as a '''long hit''', is any [[hit (baseball)|base hit]] on which the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] is able to advance past first base without the benefit of a fielder either committing an [[error (baseball)|error]] or opting to make a throw to retire another [[baserunning|base runner]] (see [[fielder's choice]]). Extra base hits are often not listed separately in tables of [[baseball statistics]], but are easily determined by calculating the sum total of a batter's [[double (baseball)|double]]s, [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s, and [[home run]]s. 

The record for most extra-base hits by one batter, in one game, is five, held by several different players, including [[Joe Adcock]] and [[Lou Boudreau]]. The record for most career extra-base hits is 1,477, held by [[Hank Aaron]].

Another related statistic of interest that can be calculated is &quot;extra bases on long hits&quot;. A batter gets three of these for each home run, two for each triple, and one for
each double. Thus, leading the league in &quot;Most extra bases in long hits&quot; is a significant accomplishment in power hitting.
