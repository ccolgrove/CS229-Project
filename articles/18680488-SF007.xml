'''''Yo Frankie!''''' (code-named '''Apricot''') is an open [[video game]] made by the Blender Institute, part of the [[Blender Foundation]], originally scheduled for release in August 2008&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yofrankie.org/?page_id=8|title=Yo Frankie! - About|work=Apricot Open Game|publisher=Blender Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is based on the universe and characters of the free film produced earlier in 2008 by the Blender Institute, ''[[Big Buck Bunny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/|title=Big Buck Bunny|work=Peach Open Movie|publisher=Blender Foundation|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Blender Institute's previous open film projects, the game is made using [[free software]]. ''Yo Frankie!'' runs on any platform which runs [[Blender (software)|Blender]] and [[Crystal Space]], including [[GNU/Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].

The project started February 1, 2008, and development was completed at the end of July 2008. Due to technical delays, the actual DVD release date was postponed to the 14th of November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DVD goldmaster ready | url = http://www.yofrankie.org/?p=593 | accessdate = 2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Linux Magazine:  Sheep-Throwing Marsupial in the &quot;Yo Frankie&quot; Game | url = http://www.linux-magazine.com/online/news/sheep_throwing_marsupial_in_the_yo_frankie_game | accessdate = 2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since December 9, the game is available to download&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Linux Magazine: Everyman's Game: &quot;Yo Frankie&quot; | url = http://www.linux-magazine.com/online/news/everyman_s_game_yo_frankie | accessdate = 2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The name &quot;Yo Frankie!&quot; refers to the game's protagonist, Frank. It was suggested by [[Ton Roosendaal]], and selected by a community vote.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yofrankie.org/?p=259|title=Name Announcement|work=Apricot Open Game|publisher=Blender Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with previous &quot;open&quot; movie projects, the game is partly designed to promote the open source modeling and animation tool Blender. The modeling, animation and level design were done in Blender. The game itself is rendered with both Blender's internal game engine and the Crystal Space 3D engine, using Python as a scripting language.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The initial decision to use Crystal Space over Blender's own in-built Game Engine was due to the perceived need to create a more &quot;serious&quot; game platform. The development team later partly reversed this decision, by making a new version of the game playable on the Blender Game Engine.&lt;ref name=engine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yofrankie.org/?p=194|title=Last 6 weeks: Crystal Space 3D &amp; Blender focus|work=Game Engine Discussion|publisher=Blender Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows artists and level designers a more rapid workflow than rebuilding for the Crystal Space engine on every change (what in Blender Game Engine can take 2â5 seconds to export, in Crystal Space can take up to a minute).

There are two versions of the game on the DVD, one with the Blender Game Engine, and a version with Crystal Space. The Blender Game Engine version of the game is titled &quot;A Furry Vendetta&quot;,&lt;ref name=name/&gt; while the Crystal Space version is titled &quot;Furry Funny Frankie&quot;. Though some of the assets for making the levels and the characters are shared, the gameplay differs between versions.

==Plot==
In the game, players assume the role of Frank, the [[sugar glider]] who was the [[antagonist]] of the film ''Big Buck Bunny'', or Momo, a monkey created especially for this game.
