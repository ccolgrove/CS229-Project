Swire and McGrillen were members of the rock band known as Xygen. After hearing [[Konflict]]'s &quot;Messiah&quot; at a [[nightclub|club]], they were inspired to enter into the drum and bass genre.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kmag (magazine)|Knowledge Magazine]]'' (July 2005, vol. 2 issue 58). [http://publishing.yudu.com/Freedom/Ak3uh/Kmag073/resources/16.htm Pendulum]. ''publishing.yudu.com''. Retrieved on 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They founded Pendulum with Harding, who was a veteran DJ into the drum and bass scene. In 2003 the band relocated to the United Kingdom.

While ''[[Hold Your Colour]]'' holds true to the drum and bass genre, Pendulum have since experimented with mixing other genres into their work, as can be heard on ''[[In Silico (Pendulum album)|In Silico]]'' and ''[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]''. Their newer releases incorporate styles from genres such as [[alternative rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],&lt;ref&gt;Ron Slomowicz (22 September 2008).

==History==
===Formation and early years (2002â2004)===
Pendulum formed in Perth, Australia and released their first song, &quot;Vault&quot;, as the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] of the ''Kingz of the Rollers EP'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pendulum.com/about/discography.htm The full Pendulum discography]. ''Pendulum.com''. [http://www.webcitation.org/5bB6dVGM4 Archived] on 28 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hold Your Colour (2004â2007)===
After releasing several singles such as &quot;[[Spiral / Ulterior Motive|Spiral&quot; / &quot;Ulterior Motive]]&quot; and many tracks to be included in their forthcoming release, Pendulum released their debut album, ''[[Hold Your Colour]]'' in 2005. Notably, the album has successfully become one of the most popular drum and bass albums ever sold. The album has sold 225,000 copies in the UK alone. It entered the top 40 of the [[UK Albums Chart]] for the first time on 25 May 2008, peaking at No.29 by 16 August. 

The coverdesign of the album was done by Vince Peersman of www.foldesign.com, one fo the most the most prominent graphic artists for drum 'n bass music covers. 

The album was re-issued in 2007, and had a slightly different track listing. The final two songs, &quot;[[Another Planet / Voyager|Another Planet]]&quot; and &quot;[[Back 2 You / Still Grey|Still Grey]]&quot; were replaced by &quot;[[Blood Sugar / Axle Grinder|Blood Sugar]]&quot; and &quot;[[Blood Sugar / Axle Grinder|Axle Grinder]]&quot;. As well as this, the re-issued version also erroneously contains gaps at the end of each track, causing the album to lose its original sense of flow.

===In Silico (2007â2009)===
Their second album, ''[[In Silico (Pendulum album)|In Silico]]'', was released in May 2008. This release saw the band's first deviation from the drum and bass genre and incorporated more rock sounds. The second single from the album, &quot;[[Propane Nightmares]]&quot;, peaked at No.9 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and brought the band mainstream success in addition to becoming a meme on YouTube. In 2008 in support of the album, Pendulum played at numerous European [[music festival]]s and undertook their first tour of North America. At the end of the year the band filmed a [[Live at Brixton Academy (Pendulum album)|live DVD]] on 4 and 5 December 2008, at the [[Brixton Academy]]. This was later released in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/8904555/Live-At-Brixton/Product.html|title=Live at Brixton at Play.com}} ''Play.com''. Retrieved on 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immersion (2009â2011)===
Pendulum once again toured Europe in 2009. During this tour they announced that they were working on their third studio album, ''[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]''. It was announced in December that Pendulum will be touring for their new album in May 2010. The release date of the album was announced to be sometime &quot;in May&quot; during the live preview party at ''[[Matter (venue)|Matter]]'', and was then announced to be released on 24 May.

Pendulum previewed their album ''Immersion'' at the Ear Storm night at Londonâs Matter nightclub on Friday 22 January, as well as streaming the material on their official website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gigwise.com/news/54051/Pendulum-To-Showcase-New-Album-Immersion-In-London-This-Month &quot;Pendulum to showcase new album 'Immersion' in London this month&quot;].

Retrieved on 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Salt In The Wounds&quot;, a track from their new album, was Zane Lowe's Hottest Record In The World on BBC Radio 1 on 25 January 2010. It was stated however that it was a street-level release and was not an official single. On Zane Lowe's show, it was also announced that he wanted to join the band and the first single from the new album would be called &quot;[[Watercolour (Pendulum song)|Watercolour]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=75424283&amp;blogId=527221425 Pendulum MySpace blog entry about &quot;Salt in the Wounds&quot;]. MySpace (26 January 2010). Retrieved 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Watercolour&quot; also received its first play on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 8 March 2010, and was his Single Of The Week for that week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pendulum.com/news,first-play-of-watercolour-tonight_67.htm &quot;First play of 'Watercolour' tonight!&quot;]. ''Pendulum.com'' (8 March 2010). Retrieved on 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for &quot;Watercolour&quot; was released on 31 March and premiered on their MySpace page, and also in the members area of their official website, The Other Side. A day later, on 1 April, another music video was released, this time for &quot;Salt In The Wounds&quot;. The video is unique in that it is, according to the band's website, &quot;...the worldâs first 360Â° interactive music video.&quot; Viewers can move the camera around in the video. Six letters are hidden throughout the video. Once these letters are found, the viewer can enter them as a code and claim a free download of &quot;Salt In The Wounds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pendulum.com/news,360-video-and-free-download-of-salt-in-the-wounds_75.htm &quot;360Â° video and free download of 'Salt in the Wounds'&quot;]. ''Pendulum.com'' (1 April 2010). Retrieved on 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, &quot;Watercolour&quot; claimed the No.4 spot in the UK Single Chart, making it their biggest hit to date.

On 30 February 2010, the band headlined the annual [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]] festival which was held at the [[Vaynol]] Estate, [[Bangor, Gwynedd]].

The second single from the album, &quot;[[Witchcraft (Pendulum song)|Witchcraft]]&quot;, was released on 18 July and charted at No.29 in the UK Singles chart, making it their third highest charted single in the UK. The third single from ''Immersion'' was &quot;[[The Island (Pendulum song)|The Island]]&quot;, and just missed the UK Top 40 at #41. Rob Swire had stated that if it had achieved greater success than &quot;Witchcraft&quot;, he would have released a song entitled &quot;Ransom&quot;, which was taken off ''Immersion'' before the album's release. &quot;Ransom&quot; was previewed however and became a fan favourite. As it did not do better, Swire revealed the original files for &quot;Ransom&quot; were corrupted, and that he has no plans to recreate them, therefore it will not be released. However, on 6 April 2011, Pendulum released &quot;Ransom&quot; as a single via their website with all proceeds going to the Help for Japan fund post the tsunami. &quot;[[Crush (Pendulum song)|Crush]]&quot; was released as the fourth single in January 2011.

In January 2011, Pendulum released a Deluxe Edition of ''Immersion'' via [[iTunes]] which contained the album's original 15 tracks and a collection of remixes of &quot;Watercolour&quot;, &quot;Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;The Island&quot; by other artists including [[deadmau5]], [[TiÃ«sto]] and [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]]. Both the UK and US store were also given the music videos of those three tracks in the release. However, more remixes were released in the UK store along with extra videos, including a trailer of footage from their live show at [[Wembley Arena]] that took place on 28 May 2010.

===Current events (2011âpresent)===
On 26 October 2010, Swire announced via Twitter that a new record is in the works. This new record is set to be heavily [[punk subculture|punk]] influenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.com/rob_swire/status/28776307579 Rob Swire's Twitter feed]. Twitter (26 October 2010). Retrieved on 27 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The next album is expected to be a significant departure from usage of drum and bass tempo, for a faster tempo in the form of [[punk rock|punk]], and a slower tempo in the form of dubstep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novafm.com.au/video_pendulum-start-work-on-their-new-album_107944 Pendulum start work on their new album].

On 29 March 2011 via Twitter, Swire revealed that there would be no &quot;new album&quot; for a while. He added that there would be &quot;def new material&quot; later in the year.

Pendulum opened for Linkin Park on several selected dates during the band's 2011 &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; North American tour.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pendulum.com/news,pendulum-to-support-linkin-park-on-north-american-tour-2011_148.htm |title=Linkin Park news release (15 November 2010).

Pendulum is part of major Headliners on Main Stage lineup at LovEvolution 2011 Dance Festival &amp; Parade in Oakland, California, which has over 50 DJs and 15 or more parade floats.

===Knife Party===
{{main|Knife Party}}
Rob Swire and fellow member Gareth McGrillen announced in various interviews and on Rob Swire's Twitter that a side project called Knife Party has been created. The side project will not be linked in any means to Pendulum and will consist of [[House music|Electro House]], [[Dubstep]] and other club genres.

==Musical style==
[[Image:Gareth McGrillen Pendulum 2007.jpg|thumb|170px|Bassist Gareth McGrillen at Blue Oyster in 2007]]
When Pendulum was formed, their musical style was considerably more drum and bass sounding than the work they are known for today.
Signature tunes such as &quot;Masochist&quot;, &quot;Vault&quot;, &quot;[[Back 2 You / Still Grey|Back 2 You]]&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;, which were released on labels such as [[Uprising Records (NZ)|Uprising Records]], 31 Records, [[Renegade Hardware]] and Low Profile Records, have a darker, more amelodic air to them which is substantially absent from their later productions. The band's newer work is regarded as generally leaning heavily towards a mainstream, dance-driven sound. Early work such as &quot;Another Planet&quot; seems to indicate an early affinity with a more global sound, similar to other [[Breakbeat Kaos]] artists such as DJ Fresh and [[Adam F]].

The group has produced various remixes of other artists also; the best-known being the remix of &quot;[[Voodoo People / Out of Space|Voodoo People]]&quot;, originally by [[The Prodigy]]. In 2008â2010, they covered/remixed songs including [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Immigrant Song]]&quot;, [[Linkin Park]]'s &quot;[[The Catalyst]]&quot;, [[Calvin Harris]]'s &quot;[[I'm Not Alone (song)|I'm Not Alone]]&quot;, [[Coldplay]]'s &quot;[[Violet Hill (song)|Violet Hill]]&quot;, and [[Metallica]]'s &quot;[[Master of Puppets (song)|Master of Puppets]]&quot;. Pendulum's versions of &quot;I'm Not Alone&quot; and &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; both exist as studio recordings but have not been officially released, and are only previewed during DJ sets. The original live version of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; was played as an instrumental introduction for &quot;[[Slam / Out Here|Slam]]&quot;, and was featured on their first live album/DVD. During their American tour as the supporting band for Linkin Park, the song was played in its entirety, with Rob doing vocals. Pendulum have also remixed their own music and, on occasion, television theme songs, such as Australian television's &quot;ABC News Theme&quot; in May 2010. The remix proved to be immensely popular with listeners of Australian youth radio station [[triple j]], polling at number 11 in the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2010|2010 Triple J Hottest 100]] countdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/10/countdown/cd_11.htm www.abc.net.au/triplej: Hottest 100 2010: No.11 Pendulum â ABC News Theme]. ''triple j'' (26 January 2011). Retrieved on 2 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pendulum's current musical style consists of a fusion of [[Drum and Bass]] (along with other electronic genres), [[alternative rock]] and heavy metal, with the inclusion of acoustic instruments. This creates a sound reminiscent of [[industrial metal]], albeit with much more prominent drum and bass and, more recently, dubstep influences. Some songs, such as &quot;Slam&quot;, &quot;Propane Nightmares&quot; and &quot;Witchcraft&quot; are synth-led, whilst others, such as &quot;Showdown&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Comprachicos&quot;, are guitar-led. Bassist Gareth McGrillen stated in an interview on [[Channel 4]] that they use 13 computers during the live performances, all of which are mixing the sounds produced by the instruments in real time. Rob Swire stated in issues of TJECK magazine and [[Rock Sound|Rock Sound magazine]] that he would like to begin producing songs with a punk style to them, excluding the inclusion of electronic sounds in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BKuPlACK8U www.tjeck.dk: Pendulum Interview 2010: Wanna make a punk album]. ''tjeck.dk'' (25 August 2010). Retrieved on 12 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pendulum are known to be fans of [[progressive rock]] and [[progressive metal]] bands, which may have inspired them to fuse multiple genres of music together, which is standard practice in those genres.

==Controversy==
In 2006, Pendulum's old label [[Breakbeat Kaos]] released an album containing a 2-year-old Pendulum DJ mix without their permission, resulting in group member Rob Swire later denouncing the album on public internet forum [[Dogs On Acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=375398&amp;cache=2301 |title=Re: 'junglesound Gold'}} [[Dogs On Acid]] (1 March 2006). Retrieved on 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has since been resolved; DJ Fresh is included on the list of acknowledgements in the Immersion booklet, and Pendulum is now working with Breakbeat Kaos again, on the vinyl release of the singles &quot;Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;The Island&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatsfortheplanet.com/2010/09/25/preview-breakbeat-kaos-release-schedule-for-the-next-few-months-september-2010/ Breakbeat Kaos release schedule for the next few months].

Electronic musician [[Goldie]] has criticized Pendulum's single &quot;Granite&quot; for being what he calls a &quot;sh*t single&quot;, and accused the band of not acknowledging the drum and bass scene from which they came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRzGu3TJoY |title=interview goldie @ turbulence newcastle}} YouTube (4 April 2008).
