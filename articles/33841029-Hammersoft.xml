{{Politics of France}}
The '''government of the French Republic''' is  a [[semi-presidential system]] determined by the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] of the [[fifth French Republic|fifth Republic]]. The nation declares itself to be an &quot;indivisible, [[laÃ¯citÃ©|secular]], [[Democracy|democratic]], and [[social]] [[Republic]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp Official English translation of the Constitution] First sentence of Article I.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution provides for a [[separation of powers]] and proclaims France's &quot;attachment to the [[Human Rights|Rights of Man]] and the principles of [[national sovereignty]] as define aliens by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of 1789]].&quot; 

The national government of [[France]] is divided into an [[executive branch|executive]], a [[legislative branch|legislative]] and a [[judiciary|judicial branch]]. The [[President of France|President]] shares executive power with his or her appointee, the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]. The cabinet globally, including the Prime Minister, can be revoked by the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], the lower house of Parliament, through a &quot;censure motion&quot;; this ensures that the Prime Minister is always supported by a majority of the houses.

Parliament comprises the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and the [[French Senate|Senate]].  It passes statutes and votes on the budget; it controls the action of the executive through formal questioning on the floor of the houses of Parliament and by establishing commissions of enquiry. The constitutionality of the statutes is checked by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], members of which are appointed by the President of the Republic, the President of the National Assembly, and the President of the Senate.  Former Presidents of the Republic also are members of the Council. 

The independent judiciary is based on a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system which evolved from the [[Napoleonic code]]s.  It is divided into the judicial branch (dealing with [[civil law (private law)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]) and the administrative branch (dealing with appeals against executive decisions), each with their own independent supreme court of appeal: the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] for the judicial courts and the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'Etat]] for the administrative courts. The French government includes various bodies that check abuses of power and independent agencies.

France is a [[unitary state]]. However, the administrative subdivisionsâthe ''[[Regions of France|rÃ©gions]]'', ''[[Departments of France|dÃ©partements]]'' and ''[[Communes of France|communes]]''âhave various legal functions, and the national government is prohibited from intruding into their normal operations.

France was a founding member of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], later the [[European Union]].  As such, France has transferred part of its [[sovereignty]] to European institutions, as provided by its constitution. The French government therefore has to abide by [[Treaties of the European Union|European treaties]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] and [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]].

==Constitution==
{{Main|Constitution of France}}

A popular [[referendum]] approved the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958, greatly strengthening the authority of the presidency and the executive with respect to Parliament.

The constitution does contain a [[bill of rights]] in itself, but its preamble mentions that France should follow the principles of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'', as well as those of the preamble to the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. This has been judged to imply that the principles laid forth in those texts have constitutional value, and that legislation infringing on those principles should be found unconstitutional if a recourse is filed before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;See decisions [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1971/7144dc.htm 71-44 DC of 16 July 1971] and [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1973/7351dc.htm 73-51 DC of 27 December 1973] citing the preamble of the Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, recent modifications of the Constitution has added a reference in the preamble to an Environment charter that has full constitutional value, and a right for citizens to contest the constitutionality of a statute before the Constitutional Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0300069L Constitutional law 2005-205 of 1 March 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundational principles of the constitution include: the [[social equality|equality]] of all citizens before law, and the rejection of [[social class|special class privileges]] such as those that existed prior to the [[French Revolution]]; [[presumption of innocence]]; [[freedom of speech]]; [[freedom of opinion]] including [[freedom of religion]]; the guarantee of property against arbitrary seizure; the accountability of government agents to the citizenry.

[[File:French government.png|512px|center|thumb|The main processes of the French national government (most of the justice system excluded for clarity)]]

==Executive branch==
France has a [[semi-presidential system]] of government. This means that the presidential candidate is required to obtain a nationwide majority of non-blank votes at either the first or second round of balloting, which implies that the president is somewhat supported by at least half of the voting population.

As a consequence, the President is the pre-eminent figure in French politics. He appoints the Prime Minister;&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 8&lt;/ref&gt; though he may not ''de jure'' dismiss him, if the Prime Minister is from the same political side, he can, in practice, have him resign on demand (and it is known that Prime Ministers are asked to sign a non-dated dismissal letter before being nominated{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}). He appoints the ministers, ministers-delegate and secretaries. When the President's political party or supporters control parliament, the President is the ''dominant'' player in executive action, choosing whomever he wishes for the government, and having it follow ''his'' political agenda (parliamentary disagreements do occur, though, even within the same party).

However, when the President's political opponents control parliament, the President's dominance can be severely limited, as he must choose a Prime Minister and cabinet who reflect the majority in parliament, and who will implement the agenda of the parliamentary majority. When parties from opposite ends of the political spectrum control parliament and the presidency, the power-sharing arrangement is known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]. Before 2002, ''Cohabitation'' was more common, because the term of the President was seven years and the term of the National Assembly was five years. Now that the term of the President has been shortened to five years, and that the elections are separated by only a few months, this is less likely to happen.

[[Nicolas Sarkozy]] became President on May 16, 2007, succeeding [[Jacques Chirac]].

{{French presidential election, 2007}}

=== Government ===
The government is headed by the President.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 21&lt;/ref&gt; It has at its disposal the [[French Civil Service|civil service]], the government agencies, and the [[Military of France|armed forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution, article 20&quot;&gt;Constitution, article 20&lt;/ref&gt;  (The term &quot;[[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]&quot; is rarely used to describe the ''gouvernement'', even in translation, as it is used in French to mean a minister's private office, composed of politically-appointed aides. In French, the word ''gouvernement'' can refer to government in general, but generally refers to the group of ministers.)

The government is responsible to Parliament,&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution, article 20&quot;/&gt; and the National Assembly may pass a motion of censure,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 49&lt;/ref&gt; forcing the resignation of the cabinet. This, in practice, forces the government to be from the same political party or coalition as the majority in the Assembly. Ministers have to answer questions from members of Parliament, both written and oral; this is known as the ''questions au gouvernement'' (questions to the government).&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 48&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ministers attend meetings of the houses of Parliament when laws pertaining to their areas of responsibility are being discussed.

[[French government ministers|Government ministers]] cannot pass legislation without parliamentary approval, though the Prime Minister may issue autonomous regulations or subordinated regulations (''dÃ©crets d'application'') provided they do not infringe on the Parliament domain, as detailed in the constitution. Ministers, however, can propose legislation to Parliament; since the Assembly is usually politically allied to the ministers, such legislation is, in general, very likely to pass. However, this is not guaranteed, and, on occasion, the opinion of the majority parliamentarians may differ significantly from those of the executive, which often results in a large number of amendments.

The Prime Minister can engage the responsibility of his government on a law, under article 49-3 of the Constitution. The law is then considered adopted unless the National Assembly votes a motion of censure, in which case the law is refused and the government has to resign. As of 2006, the last time this article was invoked was for the &quot;[[First Employment Contract]]&quot; proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin,&lt;ref&gt;National Assembly, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060143.asp transcripts of the sitting of 9 February 2006]: appearance of Dominique de Villepin announcing the application of article 49-3; [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/ta/ta0534.asp adopted text]&lt;/ref&gt; a move that greatly backfired.&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;first employment contract&quot; was cancelled by a [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=SOCX0609236L law of 21 April 2006] following massive street protests; see ''[[First Employmenty Contract]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the government comprises members of three ranks. Ministers are the most senior members of the government; deputy ministers (''ministres dÃ©lÃ©guÃ©s'') assist ministers in particular areas of their portfolio; ministers of state (''secrÃ©taires d'Ãtat'') assist ministers in less important areas, and attend government meetings only occasionally. Before the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], some ministers of particular political importance were called &quot;secretaries of state&quot; (''ministres d'Ãtat''); the practice has continued under the Fifth Republic in a purely honorific fashion: ministers styled Secretary of State are supposed to be of a higher importance in the ''gouvernement''.

The number of ministries and the division of responsibilities and administrations between them varies from government to government. While the name and exact responsibility of each ministry may change, one generally finds at least: 
* [[Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment (France)|Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Employment]] (taxes, budget),
* [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]] (law enforcement, relationships with local governments),
* [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Ministry of Justice and Keeper of the Seals]] (prisons, running the court system, supervision of the prosecution service)
* [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]],
* [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]],
* [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]],
* [[Minister of Transport (France)|Ministry of Transportation]].

(For more on French ministries, see [[French government ministers]])

The government has a leading role in shaping the agenda of the houses of Parliament. It may propose laws to Parliament, as well as amendments during parliamentary meetings. It may make use of some procedures to speed up parliamentary deliberations.

The cabinet has weekly meetings (usually on Wednesday mornings), chaired by the President, at the [[ÃlysÃ©e Palace]].

Following the election of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as [[President of the French Republic]], [[FranÃ§ois Fillon]] replaced [[Dominique de Villepin]] as the French Prime Minister on 17 May 2007.

===Statutory instruments and delegated legislation===
The French executive has a limited power to establish regulation or legislation. (See [[#Statute law vs executive regulations|below]] for how such regulations or legislative items interact with statute law.)

====Decrees and other executive decisions====
Only the President and Prime Minister sign [[decree]]s (''dÃ©crets''), which are akin to US [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]]. Decrees can only be taken following certain procedures and with due respect to the constitution and statute law.

* The President signs decrees appointing and dismissing most senior civil and military servants, for positions listed in the Constitution or in statutes. He also signs decrees establishing some regulations (''dÃ©crets en conseil des ministres''). All such decrees must be countersigned by the Prime Minister and the ministers concerned.
* The Prime Minister signs decrees establishing [[regulation]]s, which the concerned ministers countersign. In some areas, they constitute [[primary legislation]], in some others they must be subordinate to an existing [[statute]]. In some cases, statutes impose a compulsory advisory review by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'Ãtat]]'' (''dÃ©crets en Conseil d'Ãtat''), as opposed to ''dÃ©crets simples''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/missio/index_mi_cg01.shtml#1 Le rÃ´le consultatif du Conseil d'Ãtat]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual ministers issue ministerial orders (''arrÃªtÃ©s'') in their fields of competence, subordinate to statutes and decrees.

Contrary to a sometimes used polemical ''[[clichÃ©]]'', that dates from the third republic, with its decrees-law (''dÃ©crets-lois''), neither the president nor the prime minister may [[rule by decree]] (outside of the narrow case of presidential emergency powers).

====Ordinances==== &lt;!-- There are links to this header --&gt;
{{Main|Ordonnance}}
The executive cannot issue decrees in areas that the Constitution puts under the responsibility of legislation, issued by Parliament. Still, Parliament may, through a habilitation law, authorize the executive to issue [[decree|ordinances]] (''ordonnances''), with legislative value, in precisely defined areas.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 38&lt;/ref&gt; Habilitation laws specify the scope of the ordinance. After the ordinance is issued, Parliament is asked whether it wants to ratify it. If Parliament votes no to ratification, the ordinance is cancelled. Most of the time, ratification is made implicitly or explicitly through a Parliament act that deals with the subject concerned, rather than by the ratification act itself.&lt;ref&gt;On the legal regime of ordinances and explicit and implicit ratification, see ''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance1.html Les ordonnances : bilan au 31 dÃ©cembre 2006]'' by the legal service of the [[French Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ordinances is normally reserved for urgent matters, or for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in [[French Franc]]s to [[Euro]]s in the various laws in force in France).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0000009L Law 2000-517] authorized the government to adopt ordinances to convert sums from Francs to Euros in various legislative texts.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a practice to use [[decree|ordinances]] to transpose [[European Directives]] into French law, to avoid late transposition of Directive, which is often happening and is criticized by the [[EU Commission]]. Ordinances are also used to codify law into codes, to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. They are also sometimes used to push controversial legislation through, such as when Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] created new forms of work contracts in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=SOCX0500188R Ordinance of 2 August 2005] regarding the &quot;new employment contract&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ordinances in such contexts is then criticized by the opposition as anti-democratic, and demeaning to Parliament. It must be said, however, that since the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] can dismiss the government through a motion of censure, the government necessarily relies on a majority in Parliament, and this majority would be likely to adopt the controversial law anyway.

===Internal limits of the executive branch; checks and balances===
The general rule is that government agencies and the civil service are at the disposal of the ''gouvernement'', or cabinet. However, various agencies&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/sites/sites_autorites.htm this list]&lt;/ref&gt; are independent agencies (''autoritÃ©s administratives indÃ©pendantes'')&lt;ref&gt;See bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; that have been statutorily excluded from the executive's authority, although they belong in the executive branch.

These independent agencies have some specialized regulatory power, some executive power, and some [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] power. They are also often consulted by the government or the French Parliament seeking advice before regulating by law. They can impose sanctions that are named &quot;administrative sanctions&quot; ''sanctions administratives''. However, their decisions can still be contested face to a judicial court or an administrative court.

Some examples of independent agencies:
* The ''[[Banque de France]]'', the central bank, is independent ([http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnCode?commun=&amp;code=CMONFINL.rcv financial and economic code, L141 and following]). This was a prerequisite for integrating the [[European System of Central Banks]].
* The Electronic Communications &amp; Posts Regulation Authority ([http://www.arcep.fr/ ''AutoritÃ© de rÃ©gulation des communications Ã©lectroniques et des postes (ARCEP)'']), which was previously named Telecommunication Regulation Authority (''AutoritÃ© de rÃ©gulation des tÃ©lÃ©communications (ART)''), is an ''independent administrative authority'' for the open markets of telecommunications and postal services.
* The Energy Regulation Commission ([http://www.cre.fr/ ''Commission de rÃ©gulation de l'Ã©nergie (CRE)'']) is an ''independent administrative authority'' for the open markets of gas and electricity.
* The [[AutoritÃ© des marchÃ©s financiers (France)|Financial Markets Authority]] ([http://www.amf-france.org ''AutoritÃ© des marchÃ©s financiers (AMF)'']) regulates securities markets.
* The Higher Council of the Audiovisual ([http://www.csa.fr/ ''Conseil supÃ©rieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA)'']) supervises the granting and withdrawing of emission frequencies for [[radio]] and [[Television|TV]], as well as [[public broadcasting]].
* The National Commission on Campaign Accounts and Political Financing ( [http://www.cnccfp.fr/index.php ''Commission Nationale des Comptes de Campagne et des Financements Politiques'']) regulates the financing and spending of political parties and political campaign.

Public media corporations should not be influenced in their news reporting by the executive in power, since they have the duty to supply the public with unbiased information. For instance, the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) is an independent public corporation. Its resources must come solely from its commercial sales. The majority of the seats in its board are held by representatives of the French [[Mass media|press]].

The government also provides for watchdogs over its own activities; these independent administrative authorities are headed by a commission typically composed of senior lawyers or members of the Parliament. Each of the two chambers of the Parliament often has its own commission, but sometimes they collaborate to create a single ''Commission nationale mixte paritaire''. For example:
* The National Commission for Computing &amp; Freedom ([http://www.cnil.fr/ ''Commission nationale informatique et libertÃ©s (CNIL)'']); public services must request authorization from it before establishing a file with personal information, and they must heed its recommendations; private bodies must only declare their files; citizens have recourse before the commission against abuses.
* The National Commission for the Control of Security Interceptions (''Commission nationale de contrÃ´le des interceptions de sÃ©curitÃ© (CNCIS)''); the executive, in a limited number of circumstances concerning national security, may request an authorization from the commission for wiretaps (in other circumstances, wiretaps may only be authorized within a judicially-administered criminal investigation).

In addition, the duties of public service limit the power that the executive has over the [[French Civil Service]]. For instance, appointments, except for the highest positions (the national directors of agencies and administrations), must be made solely on merit or time in office, typically in competitive exams. Certain civil servants have statuses that prohibit executive interference; for instance, [[judge]]s and [[prosecutor]]s may be named or moved only according to specific procedures. Public researchers and university professors enjoy [[academic freedom]]; by law, they enjoy complete freedom of speech within the ordinary constraints of academia.

===Some important directorates and establishments===
The government also provides specialized agencies for regulating critical markets or limited resources, and markets created by regulations. Although, as part of the ''administration'', they are subordinate to the ministers, they often act with high independence.

* The General Directorate of Competition, Consumption &amp; Repression of Frauds ([http://www.finances.gouv.fr/DGCCRF/  ''Direction gÃ©nÃ©rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la rÃ©pression des fraudes (DGCCRF)'']) regulates and controls the legality and safety of products and services available on the markets open to competition for all economical actors and private consumers, and can deliver administrative ''sanctions'' in case of abuses.
* The General Directorate of Civil Aviation ([http://www.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/ ''Direction gÃ©nÃ©rale de l'aviation civile (DGAC)'']) regulates the traffic in the national air space and delivers the authorizations for airways companies and other private or public organizations and people.
* The National Agency for Employment ([http://www.anpe.fr/ ''Agence nationale pour l'emploi (ANPE)'']) maintained a public registry for the allocation of social benefits to unemployed people (but now a single registry is shared with the independent ''ASSEDIC'' paying them, a joint association of employers and workers unions), assists them as well as employers seeking people, and controls them. The French State names its general director and the Parliament provides for its finances and personnel, but it only owns one third of the seats at its decision board of directors (the other seats are shared equally by unions of employers and workers).
* The National Agency of Frequencies ([http://www.anfr.fr/ ''Agence nationale des frÃ©quences (ANFR)'']), a public establishment of an administrative character,&lt;ref&gt;Code of postal services and electronic communications, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&amp;code=CPOSTESL.rcv&amp;art=L43 article L43]&lt;/ref&gt; regulates and maintains the allocation of spectral radio frequencies resources along with other international frequencies regulators and national regulators (the CSA and ARCEP) or public ministries, controls the operators on the national territory, and publishes compliance standards for manufacturers of radioelectric equipment.

===Organization of government services===
Each ministry has a central administration (''administration centrale''), generally divided into directorates. These directorates are usually subdivided into divisions or sub-directorates. Each direction is headed by a director, named by the President in Council. The central administration largely stays the same regardless of the political tendency of the executive in power.

In addition, each minister has a private office, which is composed of members whose nomination is politically determined, called the ''cabinet''. They are quite important and employ numbers of highly qualified staff to follow all the administrative and political affairs. They are powerful, and have been sometimes considered as a parallel administration, especially, but not only, in all matters that are politically sensitive. Each ''cabinet'' is led by a chief of staff named ''directeur de cabinet''.

The state also has distributive services spread throughout French territory, often reflecting divisions into ''[[rÃ©gion in France|rÃ©gions]]'' or ''[[dÃ©partement in France|dÃ©partements]]''. The [[prefect]], the representative of the national government in each ''rÃ©gion'' or ''dÃ©partement'', supervises the activities of the distributive services in his or her jurisdiction. Generally, the services of a certain administration in a ''rÃ©gion'' or ''dÃ©partement'' are managed by a high-level civil servant, often called director, but not always; for instance, the services of the ''[[TrÃ©sor public]]'' (Treasury) in each ''dÃ©partement'' are headed by a treasurer-paymaster general, appointed by the President of the Republic.  In the last several decades, the departmental ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'' (see &quot;Local Government&quot; below) has taken on new responsibilities and plays an important role in administrating government services at the local level.

The government also maintains public establishments. These have a relative administrative and financial autonomy, to accomplish a defined mission. They are attached to one or more supervising authorities. These are classified into several categories:
* public establishments of an administrative character, including, for instance:
** universities, and most public establishments of higher education;
** establishments of a research and technical character, such as [[CNRS]] or [[INRIA]];
* public establishments of an industrial and commercial character, including, for instance, [[Commissariat Ã  l'Ãnergie Atomique|CEA]] and [[Ifremer]].
One essential difference is that in administrations and public establishments of an administrative character operate under public law, while establishments of an industrial and commercial character operate mostly under private law. A consequence is that in the former, permanent personnel are civil servants, while normally in the latter, they are contract employees.

In addition, the government still owns and controls all, or the majority, of shares of some companies, like ''[[ElectricitÃ© de France]]'', ''[[SNCF]]'' or ''[[Areva]]''.

[[Social security]] organizations, though established by statute and controlled and supervised by the state, are not operated nor directly controlled by the national government. Instead, they are managed by the &quot;social partners&quot; (''partenaires sociaux'') â unions of employers such as the [[MEDEF]] and unions of employees. Their budget is separate from the national budget.

==Legislative branch==
{{Main|Parliament of France}}
The Parliament of France, making up the [[legislative branch]], consists of two houses: the National Assembly and the Senate; the Assembly is the pre-eminent body.

Parliament meets for one nine-month session each year: under special circumstances the president can call an additional session. Although parliamentary powers have diminished from those existing under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the National Assembly can still cause a government to fall if an absolute majority of the total Assembly membership votes to censure. It has never happened since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.

The cabinet has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament. The government also can link its term to a legislative text which it proposes, and unless a motion of censure is introduced (within 24 hours after the proposal) and passed (within 48 hours of introduction - thus full procedures last at most 72 hours), the text is considered adopted without a vote.

Members of Parliament enjoy [[parliamentary immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;This immunity is called for in article 26 of the Constitution, as defined by the [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9500101L Constitutional law of 5 August 1995]. See: National assembly, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/immunite.asp L'immunitÃ© parlementaire].&lt;/ref&gt; Both assemblies have committees that write reports on a variety of topics. If necessary, they can establish parliamentary enquiry commissions with broad investigative power.

===National Assembly===
[[File:Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg|thumb|right|The National Assembly sits in the ''[[Palais Bourbon]]'', by the [[Seine River|Seine]].]]
{{Main|French National Assembly}}

The [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] is the principal legislative body. Its 577 deputies are directly elected for five-year terms in local majority votes, and all seats are voted on in each election. 

The National Assembly may force the resignation of the executive cabinet by voting a motion of censure. For this reason, the [[prime minister]] and his cabinet are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president and assembly from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as ''[[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]''. While motions of censure are periodically proposed by the opposition following government actions that it deems highly inappropriate, they are purely rhetorical; party discipline ensures that, throughout a parliamentary term, the government is never overthrown by the Assembly.

====Latest election====
{{French legislative election, 2007}}

===Senate===
[[File:French Senate amphitheater 050917 162927.jpg|thumb|right|The Senate's amphitheater]]
{{Main|French Senate}}

Senators are chosen by an electoral college of about 145,000 local elected officials for five-year terms, and one third of the Senate is renewed every three years. Before the law of 30 July 2004, senators were elected for nine years, renewed by thirds every three years. There are currently 321 senators, but there will be 346 in 2010; 304 represent the metropolitan and overseas ''[[dÃ©partement in France|dÃ©partement]]''s, five the other dependencies and 12 the French established abroad.

The Senate's legislative powers are limited; on most matters of legislation, the National Assembly has the last word in the event of a disagreement between the two houses.

Since the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], the Senate has always had a right-wing majority. This is mostly due to the over-representation of small villages compared to big cities. This, and the indirect mode of election, prompted socialist [[Lionel Jospin]], who was prime minister at the time, to declare the Senate an &quot;anomaly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1998-04-21/1998-04-21-414447 L'HumanitÃ©]'', 21 April 1998; ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1998-04-23/1998-04-23-414616 L'HumanitÃ©]'', 23 April 1998; ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2002-08-13/2002-08-13-38435 L'HumanitÃ©]'', 13 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation adoption procedures===
Statute legislation may be proposed by the government (council of ministers), or by members of Parliament. In the first case, it is a ''projet de loi''; in the latter case, a ''proposition de loi''. 

All ''projets de loi'' must undergo compulsory advisory review by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'Ãtat]]'' before being submitted to parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution, article 39&quot;&gt;Constitution, article 39&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, the bill submitted to Parliament must also come with a study of the possible impact of the law: other possible options, interactions with [[European law]], economical, social, financial and environmental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Loi organique nÂ° 2009-403 du 15 avril 2009 relative Ã  l'application des articles 34-1, 39 et 44 de la Constitution, [http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000020522653&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000020522634 article 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Propositions de loi'' cannot increase the financial load of the state without providing for funding.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 40&lt;/ref&gt;

''Projets de loi'' start in the house of the government's choice (except in some narrow cases&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution, article 39&quot;/&gt;). ''Propositions de loi'' start in the house where they originated. After the house has amended and voted on the text, it is sent to the other house, which can also amend it. If the houses do not choose to adopt the text in identical terms, it is sent before a commission made of equal numbers of members of both houses, which tries to harmonize the text. If it does not manage to do so, the National Assembly can vote the text and have the final say on it (except for laws related to the organization of the Senate).&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is then sent to the [[President of France]] for signature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution, article 10&quot;&gt;Constitution, article 10&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the President of France, the speaker of either house or a delegation of 60 deputies or 60 senators can ask for the text to undergo constitutional review before being put into force;&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 61&lt;/ref&gt; it is then sent before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]. The President can also, only once per law and with the countersigning of the Prime minister, send the law back to parliament for another review.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution, article 10&quot;/&gt; Otherwise, the President must sign the law. After being countersigned by the Prime minister  and the concerned ministers,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 19&lt;/ref&gt; it is then sent to the ''[[Journal Officiel de la RÃ©publique FranÃ§aise|Journal Officiel]]'' for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&amp;code=CCIVILL0.rcv&amp;art=1 article 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budget===
{{See also|Taxation in France}}
Financing Acts (''lois de finances'') and the Social Security Financing Acts (''lois de financement de la sÃ©curitÃ© sociale'') are special Acts of Parliament voted and approved through specific procedures.

Because of the importance of allowing government and social security organizations to proceed with the payment of their suppliers, employees, and recipients, without risk of a being stopped by parliamentary discord, these bills are specially constrained. In the past, parliamentarians would often add unrelated amendments (''cavaliers budgÃ©taires'') to the finance bills, to get such amendments passed â because of the reduced time in which the budget is examined. However, these are nowadays considered unconstitutional. If Parliament cannot agree on a budget within some specified reasonable bounds, the government is entitled to adopt a budget through [[decree|ordinances]]: this threat prevents parliamentarians from threatening to bankrupt the executive.

The way the Finance Bill is organized, and the way the government has to execute the budget, were deeply reformed in 2001 by the ''Loi organique nÂ°2001-692 du 1er aoÃ»t 2001 relative aux lois de finances'', generally known as the LOLF. Because of the major changes involved, the application of the law was gradual, and the first budget to be fully passed under LOLF will be the 2006 budget, passed in late 2005.

The LOLF divides expenses according to identifiable &quot;missions&quot; (which can be subdivided into sub-missions etc.). The performance of the administration and public bodies will be evaluated with respect to these missions.

The budget of the national government was forecast to be 288.8 billion [[Euro]] in 2005. This includes neither Social Security, nor the budgets of local governments.

===Multiple offices===
:''See [[cumul des mandats]]''
It has long been customary for Parliament members to hold, in addition to the office of deputy or senator, another local office such as city mayor, hence titles like &quot;Deputy and Mayor&quot; (''dÃ©putÃ©-maire'') and &quot;Senator and Mayor&quot; (''sÃ©nateur-maire''). This is known as the ''cumul'' of electoral offices. Proponents of the ''cumul'' allege that having local responsibilities ensures that members of parliament stay in contact with the reality of their constituency; also, they are said to be able to defend the interest of their city etc. better by having a seat in parliament.

In recent years, the ''cumul'' has been increasingly criticized. Critics contend that lawmakers that also have some local mandate cannot be assiduous to both tasks; for instance, they may neglect their duties to attend parliamentary sittings and commission in order to attend to tasks in their constituency. The premise that holders of dual office can defend the interest of their city etc. in the National Parliament is criticized in that national lawmakers should have the national interest in their mind, not the advancement of the projects of the particular city they are from. Finally, this criticism is part of a wider criticism of the political class as a cozy, closed world in which the same people make a long career from multiple positions.

As a consequence, laws that restrict the possibilities of having multiple mandates have been enacted.

===Economic and Social Council===
{{Main|French Economic and Social Council}}

The Economic and Social Council is a [[consultative]] assembly. It does not play a role in the adoption of statutes and regulations, but advises the lawmaking bodies on questions of social and economic policies.

The executive may refer any question or proposal of social or economic importance to the Economic and Social Council.

The Economic and Social Council publishes reports, which are sent to the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], and the [[French Senate|Senate]]. They are published in the ''[[Journal Official of the RÃ©publique FranÃ§aise|Journal Official]]''.

==Judicial Branch==
{{Main|Judiciary of France}}

French law provides for a separate judicial branch with an independent judiciary which does not answer to or is directly controlled by the other two branches of government. France has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system, the basis of which is codified law; however, case law plays a significant role in the determination of the courts. The most distinctive feature of the French judicial system is that it is divided into judicial and administrative streams.

===Judicial courts===

The judicial stream of courts adjudicates civil and criminal cases. The judicial court stream consists of inferior courts, intermediate appellate courts, and the French [[Cour de cassation (France)|Supreme Court]].

Judges are government employees but are granted special statutory protection from the executive. Judges have security of tenure and may not be promoted (or demoted) without their consent. Their careers are overseen by the Judicial Council of France.

The public prosecutors, on the other hand, take orders from the Minister of Justice. In the past, this has bred suspiscion of undue political pressure to dismiss suits or claims against government officials charged with corruption, and the status of public prosecutors and their ties to government are frequently topics of debate.

Trial by [[jury]] is available only for severe criminal cases,which are the jurisdiction of the [[Court of Assises|Courts of Assizes]]. A full Court is made up of a 3-judge panel and a petty jury of 9 jurors (vs. 12 jurors on appeal), who, together, render verdicts, and if a conviction is handed down, also determine a sentence. Jurors are selected at random from eligible voters.

In most other courts, judges are professional, except that the criminal court for minors is composed of one professional and two lay judges. Also, several specialty courts of original jurisdiction are sat by judges who are elected into office. For instance, labor tribunals are staffed with an equal number of magistrates from employers' unions and employees' unions. The same applies to land estate tribunals.

Pre-trial proceedings are [[inquisitorial]] by nature, but open court proceedings are [[adversarial]]. The [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in criminal proceedings is on the [[prosecution]], and the accused is constitutionally presumed innocent until proven guilty.

===Administrative courts===
[[File:DSC00652 conseil etat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Conseil d'Ãtat sits in the ''Palais Royal'']]
Courts of administrative law adjudicate on claims and suits against government offices and agencies. The administrative stream is made up of administrative courts, courts of administrative appeal, and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] as the court of last resort.

The Council of State hears cases against executive branch decisions and has the power to quash or set aside executive-issued statutory instruments such as orders and regulations when they violate constitutional law, enacted legislation, or codified law.

Court proceedings mostly involve written hearings and are [[inquisitorial]], with judges having the parties submit written testimony or arguments.

Any jurisdictional dispute between the judicial and administrative streams are settled by a special court called ''Tribunal des conflits'', or &quot;Court of Jurisdictional Dispute&quot;, composed of an equal number of Supreme Court justices and councillors of State.

===Constitutional Council===
{{Main|Constitutional Council of France}}

Neither judicial nor administrative courts are empowered to rule on the [[constitutionality]] of acts of Parliament.  While technically not part of the judicial branch, the '''Constitutional Council''' examines legislation and decides whether or not it violates the [[Constitution]]. This applies, prior to their enactment, to all forms of organic laws, but only by referral from the French [[President of France|President]], President of the [[French Senate|Senate]], President of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], or any of the 60 senators or 60 assembly members of the other types of laws or treaties. After their enactment, laws can all be reviewed by referral from the highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, or by the highest judicial court, the Cour de Cassation. The Constitutional Council may declare acts to be unconstitutional, even if they contradict the principles of the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (cited in the Preamble of the Constitution).

Council members to the Constitutional Council are appointed for nine years (three every three years); three are appointed by the President, three by the President of the National Assembly, and three by the President of the Senate.

===Financial courts===
France's main Court of Audit (''[[Cour des Comptes]]'') and regional audit courts audit government finances, public institutions (including other courts), and public entities. The court publishes an annual report and can refer criminal matters to public prosecutors. It can also directly fine public accountants for mishandling funds, and refer civil servants who misused funds to the Court of Financial and Budgetary Discipline.

The main and regional audit courts do not judge the accountants of private organizations. However, in some circumstances, they may audit their accounting, especially when an organization has been awarded a government contract over a public utility or a service requiring the permanent use of the public domain or if an organization is a bidder on a government contract. The Court is often solicitated by various state agencies, parlementary commissions, and public regulators, but it can also petitioned to act by any French citizen or organization operating in France.

The Court's finances are overseen by financial commissions of the two Houses of the French Parliament which also set the Court's working budget in the annual Act of finances.

==Ombudsman==
In 1973 the position of ''mÃ©diateur de la RÃ©publique'' (the Republic's [[ombudsman]]) was created. The ombudsman is charged with solving, without the need to a recourse before the courts, the disagreements between citizens and the administrations and other entities charged with a mission of a public service; proposing reforms to the Government and the administrations to further these goals; and actively participating in the international promotion of [[human rights]].

The ombudsman is appointed for a period of 6 years by the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers. He cannot be removed from office and is protected for his official actions by an immunity similar to [[parliamentary immunity]]. He does not receive or accept orders from any authority. The current ombudsman is [[Jean-Paul Delevoye]].

==French law==
===Basic principles===
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]
France uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judge interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]).

Many fundamental principles of French Law were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]]s. Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the Napoleonic Code: laws can only address the future and not the past ([[ex post facto]] laws are prohibited); to be applicable, laws must have been officially published (see ''[[Journal Officiel de la RÃ©publique FranÃ§aise|Journal Officiel]]'').

In agreement with the principles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the general rule is that of freedom, and law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], said about what should be the rule in French law:&lt;ref&gt;Guy Canivet was saying how the rules governing prisons disregarded the basic rule of law that liberty is the general case and prohibition the exception. See Jacques Floch, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rap-enq/r2521-2.asp Report of the enquiry commission of the French national assembly on the situation in French prisons].&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.''
That is, law may lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.

France does not recognize [[religious law]], nor does it recognize religious beliefs as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1789).

===Statutory law versus executive regulations===
French law differentiates between legislative acts (''loi''), generally passed by the [[legislative branch]], and [[regulation]]s (''rÃ¨glement'', instituted by ''[[decree|dÃ©crets]]''), issued by the [[prime minister]]. There also exist secondary regulation called ''arrÃªtÃ©s'', issued by ministers, subordinates acting in their names, or local authorities; these may only be taken in areas of competency and within the scope delineated by primary legislation. There are also more and more regulations issued by independent agencies, especially relating to economic matters.

According to the [[Constitution of France]] (article 34):

Statutes shall concern:
* [[civil rights|Civic rights]] and the fundamental guarantees granted to citizens for the exercise of their [[public liberties]]; the obligations imposed for the purposes of [[defense (military)|national defence]] upon citizens in respect of their persons and their [[property]];
* Nationality, the status and legal capacity of persons, matrimonial regimes, [[inheritance]] and gifts;
* The determination of serious [[crime]]s and other major offences and the penalties applicable to them; [[criminal procedure]]; [[amnesty]]; the establishment of new classes of [[court]]s and tribunals and the regulations governing the members of the [[judiciary]];
* The base, rates and methods of collection of [[tax]]es of all types; the issue of [[currency]].

Statutes shall likewise determine the rules concerning:
* The [[electoral system|electoral]] systems of [[French Parliament|parliamentary assemblies]] and local assemblies;
* The creation of categories of public establishments;
* The fundamental guarantees granted to civil and military personnel employed by the State;
* The [[nationalization]] of enterprises and transfers of ownership in enterprises from the public to the private sector.

Statutes shall determine the fundamental principles of:
* The general organization of national defence;
* The self-government of territorial units, their powers and their resources;
* [[Education]];
* The regime governing ownership, rights in rem, and civil and commercial obligations;
* [[Labour law]], [[trade union|trade-union]] law and [[social security]].

Finance Acts shall determine the resources and obligations of the State in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act.
Social Security Finance Acts shall determine the general conditions for the financial balance of Social Security and, in light of their revenue forecasts, shall determine expenditure targets in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act.
Programme Acts shall determine the objectives of the economic and social action of the State.

The provisions of this article may be enlarged upon and complemented by an organic law.

Other areas are matters of [[regulation]]. This separation between law and regulation is enforced by the ''Conseil constitutionnel'': the government can, with the agreement of the ''Conseil constitutionnel'', modify by decrees the laws that infringe on the domain of regulations. At the same, the ''Conseil d'Ãtat'' nullifies decrees that infringe on the domain of the law.

===Order of authority for sources of the law===
When courts have to deal with incoherent texts, they apply a certain hierarchy: a text higher in the hierarchy will overrule a lower text. The general rule is that the Constitution is superior to laws which are superior to regulations. However, with the intervention of European law and international treaties, and the quasi-[[case law]] of the administrative courts, the hierarchy may become somewhat unclear. The following hierarchy of norms should thus be taken with due caution:

# French Constitution, including the basic core constitutional values recognized by the laws of the Republic as defined by the Constitutional Council
# European Union treaties and regulations
# International treaties and agreements
# organic laws
# ordinary laws
# executive orders (advised on by the Council of State)
# other executive orders
# rules and regulations
#* of multiple ministers
#* of a single minister
#* of local authorities
# regulations and decisions by independent agencies.

==Local government==
Traditionally, decision-making in France used to be highly centralized, with each of France's [[Departments of France|departments]] headed by a [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] appointed by the central government, in addition to the ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'', a locally elected council. However, in 1982, the national government passed legislation to [[Decentralisation|decentralize]] authority by giving a wide range of administrative and fiscal powers to local elected officials. In March 1986, regional councils were directly elected for the first time, and the process of decentralization has continued, albeit at a slow pace. In March 2003, a constitutional revision has changed very significantly the legal framework towards a more decentralized system and has increased the powers of local governments.

Administrative units with a local government in [[Metropolitan France]] (that is, the parts of France lying in Europe) consist of:
* about 36,000 ''[[commune in France|communes]]'', headed by a municipal council and a mayor, grouped in
* 96 ''[[dÃ©partement in France|dÃ©partements]]'', headed by a ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'' (general council) and its president, grouped in
* 22 ''[[rÃ©gion in France|rÃ©gions]]'', headed by a [[Conseil rÃ©gional|regional council]] and its [[President of the regional council|president]].

The ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'' is an institution created in 1790 by the French Revolution in each of the newly created departments (they were suppressed by the Vichy government from 1942 to 1944).  A ''conseiller gÃ©nÃ©ral'' (departmental councillor) must be at least 21 years old and either live or pay taxes in locality from which he or she is elected. (Sociologist Jean Viard noted [''Le Monde'', Feb. 22, 2006] that half of all ''conseillers gÃ©nÃ©raux'' were still ''fils de paysans'', i.e. sons of peasants, suggesting France's deep rural roots). Though the central government can theoretically dissolve a ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'' (in case of a dysfunctional ''conseil''), this has happened only once in the Fifth Republic.   	

The ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'' discusses and passes laws on matters that concern the department; it is administratively responsible for departmental employees and land, manages subsidized housing, public transportation, and school subsidies, and contributes to public facilities. It is not allowed to express &quot;political wishes.&quot; The ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'' meets at least three times a year and elects its president for a term of 3 years, who presides over its &quot;permanent commission,&quot; usually consisting of 5-10 other departmental councillors elected from among their number. The ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral'' has accrued new powers in the course of the political decentralization that has occurred past in France during the past thirty years. There are in all more than 4,000 ''conseillers gÃ©nÃ©raux'' in France. 	 
 		 
Different levels of administration have different duties, and shared responsibility is common; for instance, in the field of education, ''communes'' run public elementary schools, while ''dÃ©partements'' run public junior high schools and ''rÃ©gions'' run public high schools, but only for the building and upkeep of buildings; curricula and teaching personnel are supplied by the national Ministry of Education. 	

The 3 main cities, [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]] have a special statute. Paris is at the same time a ''commune'' and a ''dÃ©partement'' with an institution, the ''Conseil de Paris'', that is elected at the same time as the other ''conseil municipaux'', but that operates also as a ''conseil gÃ©nÃ©ral''. The 3 cities are also divided into ''arrondissement'' each having its ''conseil d'arrondissement'' and its mayor.
 		 
[[French overseas departments and territories|French overseas possessions]] are divided into two groups: 	 
* Four [[rÃ©gions d'outre-mer|overseas ''regions'']], with some strong similarity of organization to their metropolitan counterparts; in these overseas regions all laws of France are automatically applicable, except if a specific text provides otherwise or provides some adaptation. The four ''rÃ©gions'' are fully incorporated parts of the territory of the French Republic, and as such belong to the European Union, which means that European law is applicable;
* [[Territoires d'outre-mer|Territories]], generally having greater autonomy. In general, French laws are not applicable, except if a specific text provides otherwise. A new Territory was created in February 2007: [[Saint-BarthÃ©lemy]]. This Territory used to be part of the overseas ''dÃ©partement'' of Guadeloupe. The statute of Saint-BarthÃ©lemy provides the automatic application of French law, except mostly in the domain of taxes and immigration, which are left to the Territory. The Territories do not belong to the European Union. However, as &quot;overseas territories&quot; they have association agreements with the EU and may opt-in to some EU provisions. EU law applies to them only insofar is necessary to implement the association agreements.

All inhabited French territory is represented in both houses of Parliament and votes for the presidential election.
