=== Mohamed ElBaradei ===

{{Main|National Association for Change}}

In November 2009 and amidst the political controversy over the 2011  presidential elections and the constitutional impediments placed in the faces of candidates under the amended Article 76 in the 2007 constitution and amidst speculation about the escalation of President Hosni Mubarak's son Gamal Mubarak, Mohamed ElBaradei decided to respond to the continuous pressing from people who asked him to run for the 2011 elections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=204908 |title=Egyptian opposition wants ElBaradei to run for president |publisher=Tehran Times |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C10%5C07%5Cstory_7-10-2009_pg4_7 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |publisher=Daily Times |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Earth Times Staff |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/291035,arab-league-chief-refuses-to-rule-out-egypt-presidential-bid.html |title=Arab League chief refuses to rule out Egypt presidential bid |publisher=Earth Times News |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated the he might actually run for the upcoming presidential elections. However, he has underlined a condition for him to run for the elections, this condition is a &quot;written assurance&quot; about the integrity and freedom of the electoral process from the Government. ElBaradei said in a television interview conducted with [[CNN News]], &quot;I will study the possibility of running for presidential candidate in Egypt if there any written guarantees that the electoral process will be free and fair.&quot;

ElBaradei's declaration has elicited mixed reactions in the Egyptian political world, where some considered it an embarrassing message to the regime from a &quot;heavy weight&quot; international figure in an attempt to push the regime to review the process of devolution of power in Egypt; while others saw in this declaration that the [[United Nations]] nuclear watchdog shows promise in exerting real efforts that attempt to open new horizons for the &quot;strangulated&quot; Egyptian political life.

ElBaradei said in a statement sent from his office in Vienna to ''[[Al Shorouk (Egyptian newspaper)|Al-Shorouk]]'' newspaper that &quot;He did not announce willingness or unwillingness to participate in the upcoming presidential election... and that he will clear his position on the presidency after November&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElBaradei will clear his position on the presidency after November&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?id=136398 |title=ElBaradei will clear his position on the presidency after November |publisher=Shorouknews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His office manager added: {{Quotation|Dr. ElBaradei is the Director General of [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] until the end of November. Therefore, he is currently devoted to his work and to address the important issues and topics that need to be addressed by the IAEA. So he did not take any decision regarding his future which will be decided in light of developments of the next phase.}}

The [[New Wafd Party]] and other opposition political forces have announced that they are ready to support ElBaradei if he decided to run for the 2011 presidential elections. However, Mohamed ElBaradei stated that if he decides to run for the 2011 elections, he prefers to run as an Independent Candidate, rather than running as a candidate of any of the [[List of political parties in Egypt|existing political parties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ElBaradei exclude running in the presidential elections in Egypt as a candidate of any political party&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ara.reuters.com/article/topNews/idARACAE5B90J120091210 |title=ElBaradei excludes running in the presidential elections in Egypt as a candidate of any political party |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2011-01-31}} {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ElBaradei did not make any clear statements regarding his intentions to run for the office, however he has demanded that certain conditions have to be met to ensure fair elections accompanied by changes to the constitution that will allow more freedom for independent candidates before he would actually consider running for presidency. Several opposition groups and parties have endorsed him, considering him a neutral figure who could transition the country to greater [[democracy]].

On 24 February 2010, ElBaradei met with several opposition leaders and notable intellects at his home in [[Cairo]]. The meeting was concluded with an announcement for the formation of a new non-party-political movement called &quot;[[National Association for Change]]&quot;. The movement aims for general reforms in the political scene and mainly burke the Constitutional article#76 which places restrictions on true free presidential elections especially when it comes to independent candidates. Worth mentioning is that the banned political group the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] were represented by one of their key figures who attended the meeting however their stand in accepting a non-member of their group as a candidate is yet unclear. It is also unknown whether [[Amr Moussa]] the head of the [[Arab League]] who met with Elbaradei a day earlier will be part of the new movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElBaradei to form 'national association for change'&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8534365.stm |title=ElBaradei to form 'national association for change' |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ElBaradei stated on 12 February 2011 (after Mubarak stepped down) that he would not run in presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7285150.html |title=ElBaradei not to run for Egyptian presidential elections |publisher=People's Daily Online |date=2011-02-12 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 9 March 2011, he stated he would run in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aysor.am/en/news/2011/03/09/egyote-baradei/ |title=ElBaradei to run for president of Egypt |publisher=aysor.am |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;ElBaradei and U.S. Relations
Mohamed El-Baradei, leader of the National Coalition for Change, has been a major voice for democratic change in Egypt since 2009 and was a significant leader during the recent protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Nesera|first=Andre|url=http://www.voanews.com /english/news/middle-east/Former-Egyptian-Diplomat-ElBaradei-Face-of-Opposition-to-President-Mubarak-115126994.html|newspaper=Voice of America|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has a rocky history with the U.S. government and supports some policies that do not support current U.S. foreign policy towards stability in the Middle East.  El-Baradei was the Director General of the IAEA from 1997â2009. During his term, he repeatedly said that Iran's nuclear program was legal and for peaceful purposes despite U.S. rhetoric arguing the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleming |first=Sue |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/19/us-iran-usa-rice-idUSN1822732020070919 |title=Rice swipes at IAEA, urges bold action on Iran |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a July 3, 2003 article in Time Magazine, ElBaradei also maintained that Iraq was not harboring weapons of mass destruction after inspections of Iraqi facilities before and during the recent Iraq War, despite President Bush stating the opposite during that time period.  He stated to Speigel on July 12, 2010, a German news agency that he wanted to open the Gaza Strip â Egypt border and accused Israel of being the biggest threat to the Middle East because of their nuclear weapons. These policy perspectives have made El-Baradei not popular with the U.S. administration and Israel, a close U.S. ally in the region.

=== Amr Moussa ===

When asked about the rumors that he might run for the 2011 presidential elections, [[Amr Moussa]] refused to rule out the possibility of running for the office, leaving the door open to expectations. He argued that, &quot;It's the right of every citizen that has the capacity and efficiency to aspire to any political office that would allow him to contribute to the service of his nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amr Moussa opens the way for speculation about his candidacy for the presidency of Egypt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabic.cnn.com/2009/middle_east/10/20/Amro.Mousa/ |title=Amr Moussa opens the way for speculation about his candidacy for the presidency of Egypt |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}} {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated to the press that the qualities required of the President also apply to [[Gamal Mubarak]], arguing that the citizenship, rights and obligations which apply to himself can also be applied to [[Gamal Mubarak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amr Moussa did not rule out running for the presidency of Egypt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ara.reuters.com/article/topNews/idARACAE59I1E020091020 |title=Amr Moussa did not rule out running for the presidency of Egypt |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2011-01-31}} {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed appreciation for &quot;the confidence expressed by many people when they talk about his candidacy for the Egyptian presidency, and expressed that the message reached him.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amr Mousa to (Al-Shorouk): Every qualified citizen has the right to aspire to serve the country and become the president&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?id=143426 |title=Amr Mousa to (Al-Shorouk): Every qualified citizen has the right to aspire to serve the country and become the president |publisher=Shorouknews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27 he announced he would be running for president saying &quot;God willing, I will be one of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011227211420148237.html |title=Amr Moussa to contest Egyptian poll |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll conducted during the 2011 protests asking &quot;who do you think should be the next President of Egypt?&quot; showed Moussa in the lead, with 26% of respondents naming him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/Egypt-Poll/d/48662607 |title=Phone Survey of Cairo and Alexandria |publisher=Scribd Middle East Polls |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Amr Moussa and U.S. Relations
Amr Moussa has been heavily involved with Egypt's foreign policy since 1958.  Moussa has been Egypt's Ambassador to the United Nations, India, and Switzerland over a total period of 21 years.  After serving as Egypt's Foreign Minister from 1991â2001, he served as the Secretary General of the Arab League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=United|first=Nations|title=Biography of Amre Mahmoud Moussa|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/hlpanel/amre-moussa-bio.pdf|newspaper=United Nations|date=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moussa has been an extremely popular political figure in Egypt due to his criticism of Israeli policies towards Gaza and the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Amr Moussa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1766776.stm|newspaper=British Broadcasting Company|date=January 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Forum for New Diplomacy in February 2010, Moussa gave a speech in which he criticized the U.S. government's double standard supporting Israel's nuclear weapons policy but not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear energy.  He also criticized Western countries, including the U.S. for not recognizing the results of the 2006 Palestinian elections that brought Hamas into power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seale|first=Patrick|title=An Arab Voice|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/opinion/06iht-edseale.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=amrmoussa|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like El-Baradei and the Muslim Brotherhood, he supports opening the Gaza Strip/Egypt border (Seale, 2010).  His criticisms have made Moussa extremely popular despite his association with Mubarak's political organization, the National Democratic Party.  Many political commentators said the Mubarak sent him to work for the Arab League in 2001 so as not to compete as a presidential candidate in the 2005 Presidential elections because of his popularity.  Amr Moussa announced that he would be running as a presidential candidate on March 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Badawi|first=Rania|title=Moussa To Run For President, Will Announce Election Platform Soon|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/335453|newspaper=Al-Masry Al-Youm|date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh ===

[[Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh]], a [[Muslim Brotherhood]] figure popular with Egyptian youths, declared his candidacy in May 2011. He was expelled from the Brotherhood for this decision on 20 June of that year, as it contradicted an earlier [[Guidance Bureau]] decision that the Brotherhood would not put forward a candidate in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;almasryalyoum1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=El-Hennawy|first=Noha|title=Expelled Brotherhood leader clarifies his political position|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/470154|newspaper=Al-Masry Al-Youm|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mohammed Salim Al-Awa ===

[[Mohammad Salim Al-Awa]], an Islamic thinker, declared his candidacy on 14 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Islamic thinker decides to run for president|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/468110|newspaper=Al-Masry Al-Youm|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Al-Awa and Aboul Fotouh belong to the same school of thought have led to press speculation about [[vote-splitting]] and the possibility of their uniting behind a single candidate. Aboul Fotouh has recognized this possibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;almasryalyoum1&quot;/&gt;

== Opinion Polls ==
The first opinion poll conducted in Egypt post Mubarak, was conducted by [[YouGov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Egyptian Opinion Poll|url=https://surveyfiles.yougov.com/static/YouGov_Siraj_Al_Aan_Egypt_Revolution_Poll_Feb_20_2011.pdf|work=Conducted by YouGov|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the YouGov survey of 1871 Egyptians between 15-20 February, Almost half of all Egyptians (49%) believed that Amr Moussa,  the secretary general of the Arab 
League, was the man most capable of leading the next Egyptian Government. Other potential Presidents, Ahmed Zewill (13%) &amp; Ayman Nour, Mubarakâs 2005 Presidential rival (1%), trailed Moussa by a huge margin. Almost 1 in 10 (9%) believed former Vice President, Omar Sulieman, should be Egyptâs new leader. The majority  (81%)  of Egyptians believed that the army would facilitate free and fair elections.
 
According to a survey conducted for the [[International Peace Institute]] amongst 615 adult citizens of Egypt from 9 to 20 March, 37% would have voted for [[Amr Moussa]], 16% for Marshal [[Mohamed Tantawi]], 12% for [[Ahmed Zewail]], 7% for [[Essam Sharaf]], 5% for [[Omar Suleiman]], 2% for [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], and 1% for [[Ayman Nour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipinst.org/images/pdfs/egypt-poll-results-april2011.pdf International Peace Institute Poll], conducted by Charney Research, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An April, 2011 survey of 1,000 Egyptians by [[Pew Research Center]]âs Global Attitudes Project with a margin of error of four percentage points found that the most popular Egyptian politician was [[Amr Moussa]] with 41% of Egyptians viewing him as &quot;very favourable,&quot; followed by [[Ayman Nour]] with 32% and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] with 25%. Some 75% had a favourable view of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], but only 17% believed they should lead the next government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arabian Business]] [http://www.arabianbusiness.com/egyptians-back-sharia-law-end-of-israel-treaty-poll-shows-396178.html Egyptians back sharia law, end of Israel treaty, poll shows], 26 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2011 poll by IPI, former Arab League SecretaryGeneral Amr Moussa remains front runner for the November presidential election with 32 % of voting intentions. If they run, sitting Prime Minister Essam Sharaf would place second at 16 % and Marshall Mohammad Tantawi third at 8%. Opposition leaders Mohammad El Baradei and 
Ayman Nour get just 2 % and 3 % of vote intentions respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charneyresearch.com/pdf/2011June_IPI_Egypt_Poll_final_press_release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

An July, 2011 survey for [[Newsweek]]/[[The Daily Beast]] showed the following results: 16% Amr Moussa, 12% Mohamed ElBaradei, 12% [[Ahmed Shafik]], 6% Mohamed Selim El Awa, 5% Abdel ElMoneim Abu ElFottoh, 5% Field Marshal Tantawi, 4% Omar Suleiman, 4% Magdy Hatata, 4% Hisham El-Bastawesi, 4% Ayman Nour (al-Ghad), 2% [[Hamdeen Sabahi]] (al-Karama), 27% Donât know/Undecided.
