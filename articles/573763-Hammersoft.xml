'''Lafayette College''' is a [[private school|private]] [[coeducation]]al [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts and engineering college]] located in [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]].  The school, founded in 1826 by James Madison Porter,son of General Andrew Porter of Norristown and citizens of Easton, first began holding classes in 1832.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/community/history.html | title = History of Lafayette College | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founders voted to name the school after [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]], who [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|famously toured the country in 1824â25]], as &quot;a testimony of respect for [his] talents, virtues, and signal services...the great cause of freedom&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt;

The student body, consisting entirely of [[undergraduate]]s, comes from 37 [[U.S. state]]s and 57 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;intdevelop&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~intercultural/admissions.php | title = Intercultural Development | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its 2012 edition, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranked Lafayette 40th out of all liberal arts colleges in the nation,&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/lafayette-college-3284 | title = America's Best Colleges 2012 | publisher = ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' | accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]]'' ranked it among the top 65 &quot;Most Competitive&quot; colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ataglance&quot;/&gt; Lafayette is ranked 4th on [[Payscale]]'s list of Top Liberal Arts Colleges by Salary Potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salary&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.payscale.com/best-colleges/top-liberal-arts-colleges.asp | title = Payscale â Top Liberal Arts Colleges By Salary Potential | publisher = Payscale | accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lafayette is ranked 33rd out of 650 undergraduate schools in the 2011 [[Forbes]] list of &quot;America's Top Colleges.&quot;  &lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/ | title = Forbes - America's Top Colleges | publisher = Forbes | accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its 23 Division I sports teams participate in the [[Patriot League]], with its football team claiming the league championship from 2004â2006 and the [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]] in 1896, 1921, and 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;laffootball&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goleopards.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/lafa-m-footbl-body.html | title = Lafayette College Football | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A group of Easton citizens led by [[James Madison Porter]] met on December 27, 1824 at White's Tavern to explore the possibility of opening a college.&lt;ref name=&quot;inauguration&quot;/&gt;  The recent visit of the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]] to [[New York]] during his [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|grand tour of the US in 1824 and 1825]] prompted the founders to name the school after the [[France|French]] [[military officer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt;  The group also established the 35-member Board of Trustees, a system of governance that has remained at the College since its inception.&lt;ref name=&quot;inauguration&quot;/&gt;  In need of an education plan, the meeting gave the responsibility to Porter, lawyer Jacob Wagener, and [[Yale]] educated lawyer Joel Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;inauguration&quot;/&gt;  The charter gained approval and on March 9, 1826, [[Pennsylvania Governor]] [[John Andrew Shulze]]'s signature made the college official.&lt;ref name=&quot;inauguration&quot;/&gt;

The school did not open until six years later when the Rev. [[George Junkin]], a [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], took up the charter and moved the all-male Manual Labor Academy of Pennsylvania from Germantown to Easton.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt;  Classes began on May 9, 1832, with the instruction of 43 students on the south bank of the [[Lehigh River]] in a rented farmhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt;  Students had to earn money to support the program by laboring in the fields and workshops.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt;  Later that year, Lafayette purchased what is now known as &quot;College Hill&quot; â nine [[acre]]s of elevated land across [[Bushkill Creek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt;  The College's first building was constructed two years later on the current site of South College.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt;

===Church affiliation===
Lafayette became affiliated with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]] in 1854,&lt;ref name=&quot;missionstatement&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/academics/mission.html | title = Mission Statement and Accreditation | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although recently the ending of this official relationship has been discussed.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaplainposition&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://media.www.thelaf.com/media/storage/paper339/news/2004/02/20/News/Chaplain.Position.To.Be.Eliminated.Upon.Millers.Retirement.This.Spring-612945.shtml?sourcedomain=www.thelaf.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | title = Chaplain position to be eliminated upon Miller's retirement this spring | publisher = The Lafayette | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis March===
In 1857, [[Francis March]] became the first professor of [[English studies|English]] at an American college when Lafayette became the first college to implement the program of study.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyoflaf&quot;/&gt; His sons, Francis A. March Jr, was mayor of Easton and wrote ''Athletics at Lafayette College'', while [[Peyton C. March]], was the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] following [[World War I]].

===Newspaper===
''The Lafayette'', Lafayette's weekly student newspaper, was founded in 1870 and is the oldest college newspaper in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;thelafgeninfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thelaf.com/generalinfo | title = About ''The Lafayette'' | publisher = The Lafayette | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is available in both print and online form.

===Coeducational institution===
In 1970, the college increased total enrollment after changing from an all-male school to a coeducational institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;inauguration&quot;/&gt;

===Commemoration===
In 2007, the college commemorated the 250th birthday of General Lafayette through a series of lectures and campus dedications.&lt;ref name=&quot;marquis250&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/250/ | title = Marquis de Lafayette at 250 | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-09-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070827032644/http://www.lafayette.edu/250/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major festivities were held on September 6, 2007, Lafayette's birthday, and were kicked off the night before with a lecture by renowned historian [[David McCullough]].

Lafayette's student body consists of 2,382 undergraduate students hailing from 37 [[U.S. State]]s and 57 countries.  For the class of 2012, the acceptance rate was 42%, with 59% of those accepted ranking in the top 10% of their high school classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;classprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/admissions/requirements.html | title = Requirements and Class Profile | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The middle 50% of accepted students have [[SAT]] scores ranging from 570 - 670 Critical Reading and 600 - 710 Math, and [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] scores ranging from 26â30.&lt;ref name=&quot;classprofile&quot;/&gt;  The college has 199 full-time faculty members, giving it an 11:1 student to faculty ratio.  This ratio will decrease to 9:1 after the hiring of 35 new faculty members as part of the College's Strategic Planning Initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;ataglance&quot;/&gt;

Lafayette students have been honored in recent years with national and international scholarships,&lt;ref name=&quot;scholarships&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/news.php/view/5819 | title = Recent Lafayette Recipients of National and International Scholarships... | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-01-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including the most [[Goldwater Scholarship]]s obtained by a liberal arts college over the past six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldwater&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lafayette.edu/news.php/view/10044/ | title = Jaryd Freedman â08 Receives Goldwater Scholarship | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the class of 2012, Lafayette gave financial aid to 66% of the students, with the average package amounting to $26,850 for all students.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegecosts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/admissions/finaid/costs_awards.html| title = College Costs and Financial Aid Awards | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The college also offers a merit-based academic scholarship â the Marquis Scholarship, which provides $16,000 per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;academicscholarships&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/admissions/finaid/scholarships.html | title = Scholarships | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lafayette's [[financial endowment|endowment]] is more than $580 million, with total assets amounting to more than $1 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ataglance&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:OldLaf.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Lithograph of Lafayette College, circa 1875.]]

In its 2010 edition, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' ranked Lafayette 35th out of all liberal arts colleges in the nation,&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews&quot;/&gt; with its engineering program ranked 12th out of non-doctoral schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;kettering&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kettering.edu/visitors/storydetail.jsp?storynum=474 | title = America's Best Colleges 2007 | publisher = Kettering College | accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]]'' magazine, a study of the best valued schools ranked Lafayette 14th among liberal arts colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;kiplingerlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://content.kiplinger.com/tools/privatecolleges/privatecollege.php?schoollist=lib_arts&amp;sortby=RANK&amp;orderby=flip&amp;states%5B%5D=ALL&amp;myschool%5B%5D=none&amp;outputby=table | title = 50 Best Value Liberal Arts Colleges | publisher = Kiplinger.com | accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927172821/http://content.kiplinger.com/tools/privatecolleges/privatecollege.php?schoollist=lib_arts&amp;sortby=RANK&amp;orderby=flip&amp;states%5b%5d=ALL&amp;myschool%5b%5d=none&amp;outputby=table |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'' has ranked Lafayette as fifth among the nationâs 50 leading liberal arts colleges and universities in the percentage of full-time African American faculty members, and twelfth for first year black enrollment.&lt;ref name=&quot;jbhe&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jbhe.com/news_views/57_black_faculty_liberalarts.html | title = Ranking the Nationâs Leading Liberal Arts Colleges on Their Levels of Black Faculty | publisher = jbhe.com | accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College offers 45 different Majors across four academic divisions: natural sciences, humanities, engineering, and social sciences. Most departments offer minors, and twelve interdisciplinary minors are also available. A.B. requirements allow students to double major or create a coordinate major in two departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Majors&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/admissions/majors/index.html | title = 46 Majors across 4 Divisions | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students declare their major during the second semester of their sophomore year.

The Policy Studies program, established in 2006, is an interdisciplinary major that allows students to better understand the design, management, and evaluation of policies and institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Policy Studies&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/admissions/majors/policy.html | title = Policy Studies | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Policy Studies Program sponsors student events such as the Election Night Broadcast, where students reported the events of the 2006 mid-term election to the College, and also brings guest speakers to campus.  Also new to the College is a Chinese language program which will offer classes on Chinese language and culture.  Lafayette's Strategic Planning Initiative is also considering the possibility of introducing additional non-European language programs over time, including Arabic, Hindi, and Swahili.

===Participation in ''U.S. News'' rankings===
Starting in the 2006â2007 academic year, President Daniel Weiss agreed to boycott the controversial Peer Assessment in the ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' rankings, which accounts for 25% of a school's overall ranking.&lt;ref name=&quot;lafusnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/news.php/view/10296/ | title = President Weiss Joins Initiative to Boycott Key Element of U.S. News Rankings Survey | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-08-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lafayette and eleven other colleges, working with Lloyd Thacker of the [[Education Conservancy]], created a petition calling for a boycott of the reputational survey as well as a refusal to use the rankings to promote a college or to indicate its quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;petition&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educationconservancy.org/presidents_letter.html | title = Presidents' Letter | publisher = The Education Conservancy | accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 63 college and university presidents have signed the letter. Predictably, Lafayette College's ranking fell from #30 in 2007 to #34 in 2008.

==Campus overview==
[[Image:LafayetteCollegeTheQuad.JPG|thumb|left|260px|The Quad, captured here on an overcast day, is at the center of Lafayette's {{convert|110|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus.]]
Pardee Hall, the largest academic building on campus, was devastated by fire twice in the 19th century.  One fire began when a science experiment was carelessly left in a lab drawer.  The other fire was arson, deliberately set by a professor of moral philosophy and ethics, who reportedly enjoyed watching the building burn from across the [[Delaware River]] in [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey]].  Although Pardee Hall is truly oriented southward, with the gently sloping hill leading to its front entrance, the students refer to this as the &quot;back&quot; of Pardee because the other side (the true back) faces the Quad.  During the winter, or after a drenching spring rain, sledding is popular on the hill &quot;behind&quot; Pardee Hall.

Kirby Hall of Civil Rights, the interior of which is constructed of [[travertine]] marble, was rumored to have been the most expensive collegiate building, per square foot, built at its time. The building was designed by the same architectural firm that designed [[New York City]]'s [[Grand Central Terminal]].

[[Image:South College at Lafayette College.jpg|thumb|right|230px|South College is one of Lafayette's largest residence halls, housing approximately 220 students in a coeducational setting.]]

Farinon College Center, the student union, was architecturally inspired by the McKelvy House, a college-owned mansion just off campus.  It is located in the original location of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and the fireplace in the lobby is the original fireplace from the fraternity.  While the top floor of Farinon is an &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; style buffet paid for in blocks from a meal plan, the downstairs is a station-based food court in which students pay itemized fees for food. The dining area for the downstairs area also serves as the stage for comedy acts brought in by the Lafayette Activities Forum, the College's student-run activities committee.

Markle Hall, now the main administrative building, housing the Offices of Admissions and Financial Aid, originally was designated the Hall of Mining Engineering.  An online historical survey of campus buildings is maintained by the College's Special Collections.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialcollections&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~library/special/CollegeHistory.html | title = Lafayette College Special Collections | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's Cafe, a coffeehouse located on the ground floor of Kirby House, was opened in 1999 to provide a late-night hangout for students.  Its name was the subject of a contest, and the winning student selected one of General Lafayette's middle names: Gilbert. In the fall of 2006, a sinkhole was discovered underneath Kirby House, and the much-beloved coffeehouse had to be closed during the spring semester. However, it was reopened for the subsequent fall semester. Gilbert's Cafe is the site of many open mic nights where student bands can perform for their fellow classmates.

Skillman Library underwent an extensive renovation from 2003 to 2005, and the building has won several awards, including the 2006 national honor award for interior architecture from the [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;skillmanrenovation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2006/0125/design_1-2.html | title = Library Enlightened | publisher = Architecture Week | accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the fall of 2006, Lafayette signed a deal with [[MTV]] to designate the campus as an MTVu campus. As a result, Lafayette hosted an [[MTVu]] concert in the spring of 2006, as opposed to the regular concert chosen by the student government.   This was led by the Student Activities Planning Board, called the Lafayette Activities Forum (LAF), the organization that continues to plan and produce Lafayette's major Spring Concerts.  In the spring of 2007, [[Third Eye Blind]] was selected to perform in Kirby Gymnasium, followed by the musical artist [[Ben Folds]] in the spring of 2008 and a triple feature with headliner Girl Talk in 2009.  The show in 2010 featured [[Kid Cudi]] with RJD2 and Chiddy Bang. The Spring Concert in 2011 featured rappers [[K'Naan]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]] and Sam Adams.

Lafayette offers students an array of athletic opportunities, which includes 23 Division I sports, 18 club sports, and over 30 intramural sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recreation Services&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~recsvcs/kirby_sports_center/index.php | title = Recreation Services | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The football team has made three consecutive appearances in the NCAA Division I-AA football tournament.

These seasons were documented by [[John Feinstein]] in his book, ''[[The Last Amateurs]]''.

==Student life==
===Fraternities and sororities===
Lafayette has four fraternities including chapters of [[Delta Upsilon]], [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], and [[Zeta Psi]]. They also have six sororities including [[Alpha Phi]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], and [[Alpha Gamma Delta]].  All but two of those Greek organizations are located on campus.  Approximately 25% of students participate in Greek Life at Lafayette, making it a viable living option.  Members of each house commit themselves to various philanthropic ventures throughout the academic year.

[[Alpha Phi Omega]] National Service Fraternity was founded in 1925 at Lafayette College by [[Frank Reed Horton]] in Hogg Hall (formerly Brainerd Hall). The organization still exists and continues what Frank Reed Horton started.

The Rho Chapter of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity is the oldest fraternity and the oldest student organization at Lafayette College, having been chartered on October 15, 1855.  Among the chapter's alumni are [[Peyton C. March]], U.S. Army Chief of Staff during World War I, and [[William E. Simon]], former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.

The [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity house was in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' for a number of years as the largest free standing structure to undergo transportation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The &quot;Old Grey Barn&quot;, as it is often called, is now located along March Field. It underwent a major interior renovation during the 2006â2007 academic year.

The [[Zeta Psi Fraternity House]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineers Without Borders===
The club was founded in 2003 and is a member of EWB-USA.  Members of the club represent many disciplines in engineering and the liberal arts.  The club is linked with rural villages in the [[Yoro]] region of [[Honduras]].  EWB's mission is to design and implement projects in these villages that help promote better life.  The club has focused its efforts on water treatment systems.

El Convento, which is located in the Yoro district of central Honduras, will be the third sustainable water project EWB-LC students have worked on in the country since 2003 when the club was founded. The group has implemented gravity-fed water systems in neighboring Lagunitas and La Fortuna.  In La Fortuna, the group utilized a [[slow sand filter]] in its system. The groupâs previous work garnered national media exposure for being one of six national institutions to receive a $75,000 grant from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].

===WJRH 104.9FM===
The campus radio station, [[WJRH]] 104.9FM, first established licensure with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in 1946, broadcasting under a Class D educational license on 90.5 FM.  As [[FM broadcasting|FM]] frequencies grew in demand, the FCC mandated that stations operating in the frequency range currently provided to WJRH increase their power to serve larger audiences.  Since WJRH was only to serve the Lafayette community, it was decided to give the frequency to another facility and relocate to its current home frequency, 104.9.

The station is regularly being upgraded with the latest broadcasting technology. Several additions have included the relaunch of WJRH Broadband (a live [[Windows Media Player]] stream available to Lafayette students) and ''WJRH PC'' (an online database of MP3 [[Podcasts]] of select shows as part of an overall website renovation). WJRH has been housed for over 30 years in its current location, Hogg Hall.
