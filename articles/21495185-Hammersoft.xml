The '''2009 Dr. Pepper Big 12 Championship Game''' was held on December 5, 2009 at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]]. The divisional winners from the [[Big 12 Conference]] squared off in the 14th edition of the game. The [[2009 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas Longhorns]] represented the South Division and the [[2009 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] represented the North Division. Texas won the contest 13-12 on a last second [[field goal (football)|field goal]] by [[placekicker]] [[Hunter Lawrence]].

On the play immediately prior to Lawrence's field goal, as the game clock ticked down Texas quarterback [[Colt McCoy]] rolled far to the right, with Nebraska's [[Ndamukong Suh]] in pursuit, and threw a pass well down field and out of bounds. The game clock ran out, which would have ended the fourth quarter, with Nebraska appearing to win 12-10.  However, pursuant to Rule 12-3-6, the video replay official determined that an &quot;egregious,&quot; and therefore reviewable, error concerning the game clock had occurred and ordered the errantly elapsed one second be returned to the clock.  The ESPN/ABC video feed showed that McCoy's pass hit a stadium railing, out of bounds, with :01 remaining, allowing Texas to kick the winning field goal to advance to the BCS title game.

The game was the third championship tilt between the Cornhuskers and Longhorns. The unranked Longhorns upset #3 Nebraska 37-27 in the 1996 game in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], while the #2 Cornhuskers beat #12 Texas 22-6 in 1999 in [[San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/championship_games.php&lt;/ref&gt; Texas is now 3-2 in the conference championship game; Nebraska fell to 2-3. Texas is second in Big 12 Championship titles to Oklahoma, who claims 6 conference titles. 

Per Big 12 policy, Nebraska was declared the home team because the game took place in a home state of four Big 12 South teams. Designated &quot;home&quot; teams are 9&amp;ndash;5 in [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]]s. The South Division has won 6 years in a row and is 10-4 overall.

==Selection process==
The [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]] matches up the winner of the ''North'' and ''South'' divisions of the [[Big 12 Conference]].  The game was first played in [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|1996]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E3D7153FF934A35751C1A960958260 Historical note]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009225/index.htm Historical note 2]&lt;/ref&gt; when the conference was assembled to include all of the teams from the [[Big Eight Conference]] as well as four teams that had formerly been members of the [[Southwest Conference]].  The championship game was modeled on the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] format, which was the first conference in college football to have a conference championship game.  Today, five additional conferences also now hold conference championship games: the [[ACC Championship Game|ACC]], [[Conference USA Football Championship|C-USA]], the [[MAC Championship Game|MAC]], the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], and the [[Pacific-12 Conference|Pac-12]].
