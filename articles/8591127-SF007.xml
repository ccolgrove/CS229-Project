'''Kaspersky Anti-Virus''' ({{lang-ru|ÐÐ½ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð¸ÑÑÑ ÐÐ°ÑÐ¿ÐµÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾}}; formerly known as ''AntiViral Toolkit Pro''; often referred to as '''KAV''') is an [[antivirus software|antivirus]] program developed by [[Kaspersky Lab]]. It is designed to protect users from [[malware]] and is primarily designed for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]], though a version for [[Linux]] is available for business consumers.

==Features==
Kaspersky Anti-Virus features include real-time protection, detection and removal of [[computer virus|viruses]], [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]], [[computer worm|worms]], [[spyware]], [[adware]], [[keyloggers]] malicious tools and auto-dialers, as well as detection and removal of [[rootkits]]. It also includes instantaneous automatic updates via the &quot;Kaspersky Security Network&quot; service.

According to Kaspersky, &quot;Kaspersky Security Network service allows users of Kaspersky Lab security products from around the world to help facilitate [[malware]] identification and reduce the time it takes to provide protection against new (âin the wildâ) security risks targeting your computer.&quot; [[Kaspersky Lab]] maintains a strict privacy policy for use of this service and asserts that volunteering to use this service by sending certain information &quot;contains no personally identifiable information about the user and is utilized by Kaspersky Lab for no other purposes but to enhance its security products and to further advance solutions against malicious threats and viruses.&quot;

[[Microsoft Windows]] users may download an [[Anti-Virus]] Rescue Disk that scans the host computer during [[booting]] inside an isolated [[Linux]] environment. In addition, Kaspersky Anti-Virus prevents itself from being disabled by malware without user permission via password access prompts upon disabling protection elements and changing internal settings. It also scans incoming [[instant messenger]] traffic, automatically disables links to known [[malware]] hosting sites while using [[Internet Explorer]] or [[Firefox]] and includes free Technical Support and free product upgrades within paid-subcription periods.  [[Kaspersky Lab]] currently offers 1 year, 2 year and 3 year subscriptions.

==Awards==
According to AV-Comparatives, Kaspersky Anti-Virus rates highly amongst virus scanners in terms of detection rates, even despite the fact that the program has failed two [[Virus Bulletin]] tests in 2007 and another two in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/results?vendor=VE15&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] awarded Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6 the Editor's Choice in its 2007 anti-virus comparative&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/130869/top_antivirus_performers.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  The well-known and highly regarded [[Ars Technica]] lists Kaspersky as one of the best choices for [[Anti-Virus]] on the [[Windows]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2008/04/five-security-apps-linux-osx-windows.ars Five important security apps for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaspersky Anti-Virus was &quot;A-listed&quot; by the UK PC journal [[PC Pro]] in late 2007, where it scored very highly for detection and removal of malware&lt;ref name=&quot;pcpro.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.pcpro.co.uk/labs/120448/kaspersky-antivirus-7.html&lt;/ref&gt;. PC Pro attributes this to âa combination of the softwareâs heuristic scanning and uncompromising approach to database updates&lt;ref name=&quot;pcpro.co.uk&quot;/&gt;. While many packages check for new virus signatures on a daily basis, Kaspersky runs to an hourly schedule, improving your chances of being immunized before an infection reaches it.â &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaspersky.co.uk/news?id=207575542 Kaspersky Anti-Virus 7.0 wins top awards from PC Pro&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaspersky Anti-Virus was tested by PassMark in June 2008 and was accoladed as having &quot;the industry's fastest scan times&quot; on [[Windows Vista]].

==Limits==
Kaspersky Anti-Virus lacks certain features found in [[Kaspersky Internet Security]]. These missing features include a [[personal firewall]], [[Intrusion-prevention system|HIPS]], Anti[[Spam (electronic)|Spam]], AntiBanner and [[parental control]] tools.

Also, Kaspersky, like the majority of its competitors, is incompatible with many other [[anti-virus]] and [[anti-spyware]] software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.kaspersky.com/faq/?qid=208279751 Applications which are not compatible with Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009\Kaspersky Internet Security 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macintosh==
The newly released [[Macintosh]] capable edition of Kaspersky Anti-Virus is compatible on ([[Intel]] Processor Based) [[Mac OS X v.10.4]] and higher to include the brand new version [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard]], released in August 2009.  [[Kaspersky Labs]] internal testing concludes consuming only 1% [[CPU]] impact on performance and is designed to maintain a user friendly Mac-like interface that Mac users are familiar with.  Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Mac contains definitions to detect and block malware affecting [[Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] alike.  Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Mac also scans shared folders of users running [[Windows]] using [[Virtual PC]] on capable [[Apple Macintosh]] personal computers.&lt;ref&gt;http://usa.kaspersky.com/products_services/anti-virus-for-mac.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linux editions==
An edition of Kaspersky's anti-virus solution for [[Linux]] workstations is available to business consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaspersky.com/anti-virus_linux_workstation Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux Workstation]&lt;/ref&gt; It offers many of the features included in the mainstream version for Windows, including on-access and on-demand scanners.

Specialized editions of Kaspersky Anti-Virus are also available for a variety of Linux servers and offer protection from most forms of malware.
