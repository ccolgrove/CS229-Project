'''''Shark Attack''''' is a 1999 television film directed by [[Bob Misiorowski]] starring [[Casper Van Dien]], [[Jenny Mcshane]], and [[Ernie Hudson]].

==Plot==
Steven McKray ([[Casper Van Dien]]), a marine biologist, travels to a small African fishing village to investigate a series of violent shark attacks, only to discover that sharks are not the only problem.

This movie features very few on-screen shark attacks.  However, an attack on a tourist dangling her leg in the water is very realistic and in line with documented shark attacks.  Instead of the shark taking off her whole leg, it takes out a large chunk of flesh, which later required surgical amputation.

==Cast==
*[[Casper Van Dien]]

==Sequels==
Three [[direct-to-video]] sequels followed.  ''Shark Attack 2'' was released in 2001, and ''[[Shark Attack 3: Megalodon]]'' was released in 2002.  ''Shark Attack 2'' briefly mentions the events of the first film while ''Shark Attack 3: Megalodon'' ignores the first two movies entirely.
