'''Fordham University School of Law''' (commonly known as '''Fordham Law''' or '''Fordham Law School''') is a part of [[Fordham University]] in the [[United States]]. The School is located in the [[Borough (New York City)|Borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], and is one of eight [[American Bar Association|ABA]]-approved [[law school]]s in that city.

According to the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]], 1,516 [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] students attend Fordham Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/webextras/brief/sb_law_size_brief.php Largest law schools]&lt;/ref&gt; There are 1,170 students in the Day Division; the rest attend the Evening Division. Fordham Law also offers Master of Laws ([[LL.M.]]) degrees in the following specializations: [[Banking]], [[Corporate]], &amp; [[Finance]] Law; International Business &amp; Trade Law; Intellectual Property &amp; Information Technology Law; and International Law &amp; Justice. Joint degrees are also offered in conjunction with Fordham's other graduate schools, including J.D./[[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in [[International Political Economy]] and [[International development|Development]]; J.D./[[M.B.A.]]; and J.D./[[Master of Social Work|M.S.W.]].

Founded in 1905, Fordham Law commemorated its Centennial during the 2005-2006 academic year, and capped the year-long celebration with an alumni gala on [[Ellis Island]] on September 28, the school's official birthday. The school used the occasion of its Centennial to launch a new fundraising drive in 2005, and in just one year had raised more than $10 million thanks in large part to the more than 100 &quot;Centennial Founders&quot; who each contributed $100,000 or more. As of February 2006, Fordham has met 71% of its Centennial goal of 100,000 hours of collective community service from students, faculty, administrators, and alumni.
