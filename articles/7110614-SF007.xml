<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="7110614" ns="0" title="Speedyclick.com"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''SpeedyClick.com''' was an entertainment-based website operating out of [[Glendale, CA]] circa 1998 â 2001. The site featured contests, original content, and free web-style games such as [[blackjack]], [[Online bingo|bingo]], and virtual [[slot machines]]. By spending time on the site, registered users accumulated [[virtual currency]] known as âSpeedyBucksâ that they could then redeem for prizes such as clothing or mousepads, or trade with other users in an [[eBay]]-style bartering area. SpeedyClick had a [[banner ad]]-style revenue model and also developed custom [[product placement]] games for various corporate sponsors.

At its peak, SpeedyClick had more than 3 million monthly visitors, with a 7.3 percent reach of women on the Internet, and more than 1 million registered users &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In November 1999, Seattle-based [[ShopNow]] (later [[Network Commerce]] Inc.) acquired SpeedyClick for $47 million in ShopNow stock and $3 million in cash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

SpeedyClick succumbed to the [[dot com bust]] in a fashion typical to many web-centric companies of their time. By late 2001, floundering Network Commerce Inc., delisted from [[NASDAQ]] and pursued by investors &lt;ref&gt;[http://securities.stanford.edu/1018/NWKC01/index.html Network Commerce, Inc. - Company and Case Information], [[Stanford Law School]], Securities Class Action Clearinghouse in Cooperation with Cornerstone Research., 2006., retrieved 13-05-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;, closed the doors of its various offices, including SpeedyClick. Its former [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] now routes to one of the ubiquitous [[type-in traffic]] harvest search pages.
