'''O'Shea Jackson''' (born June 15, 1969), better known by his stage name  '''Ice Cube''', is an American [[rapper]] and [[actor]]. He began his career as a member of the hip-hop group [[C.I.A. (group)|C.I.A.]] and later joined the rap group [[N.W.A]]. After leaving N.W.A in December 1989&lt;!-- Before changing the date, please see [[Talk:Ice Cube#Date of Cube's departure from N.W.A.]]. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/N.W.A.

==Early life==
Jackson was born on June 15, 1969 in [[Los Angeles]], in the [[South Central Los Angeles|South Central]] area, the son of Doris Jackson (nÃ©e Benjamin), a hospital clerk and custodian, and Hosea Jackson, who worked as a groundskeeper at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hiphop.sh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiphop.sh/cube|title=Ice Cube|accessdate=August 9, 2007|date=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,388411,00.html |title=They Call Him Mister Cube , News |work=Entertainment Weekly  |date=November 15, 2002 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 interview with Teenink, O'Shea's half-sister was murdered by her boyfriend in a [[murder-suicide]] when he was 12 years old &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teenink.com/nonfiction/interviews/article/5368/Ice-Cube-Actor-Musician]&lt;/ref&gt;.

(group)|C.I.A.]], and they performed at parties hosted by [[Dr. Dre]]. Young Cube was fourteen years old when he met Dre, nineteen. Dre soon entered the recording industry involved with the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] recording records. Dre saw Cube's potential as a writer and had him helping Dre in writing Wreckin Cru's big L.A. hit track, &quot;Cabbage Patch&quot; as well as joining Cube on a side partnership the duo called Stereo Crew by which they produced a twelve-inch record, &quot;She's a Skag&quot; released on [[Epic Records]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johson|first=Bill|title=Ice Cube Reminisces On His Very First Gig And Single|url=http://theurbandaily.com/music/first-things-first-music/billjohnson/ice-cube-reminisces-on-his-very-first-gig-and-single/|work=The Urban Daily |date=May 31, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
===N.W.A===
{{Main|N.W.A}}
In 1987, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre released the single ''[[My Posse]]'', under the alias CIA. After the collaboration, Ice Cube showed [[Eazy-E]] the lyrics to &quot;[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Ice Cube â Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p48/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2007|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eazy-E, although initially rejecting the lyrics, eventually recorded the song for ''[[N.W.A. and the Posse]]'', the debut album for the group [[N.W.A]] that included him, Dre, and other rappers [[MC Ren]] and [[DJ Yella]].

By this point Ice Cube was a full-time member of N.W.A along with Dr. Dre, and [[MC Ren]]. Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, as 1990 approached, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Ice Cube: Attitude'' (McIver, 2002) ISBN 1-86074-428-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Since  Ice Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', he was advised of the amounts he was truly owed by Heller, and took legal action soon after leaving the group and the label. In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'' and on their next and final album, ''[[Efil4zaggin]]'' (''Niggaz4life'' spelled backwards).

===Solo career===
In late 1989, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album in Los Angeles with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed the female rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''Make Way for the Motherlode''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as 'Doughboy' in [[John Singleton]]'s hood-based drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go both [[Gold album|Gold]] and [[Platinum album|Platinum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt;

His 1991 follow-up, ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into the 'Death Side' (&quot;a vision of where we are today&quot;) and the 'Life Side' (&quot;a vision of where we need to go&quot;). It features &quot;[[No Vaseline]]&quot;, a scathing response to N.W.A's attacks and &quot;Black Korea,&quot; a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many; it was still being cited years after its release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;

Ice Cube released ''[[The Predator]]'' in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's Los Angeles riots, in the first single, &quot;[[Wicked (song)|Wicked]]&quot;, he rapped &quot;April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel&quot;. ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&amp;B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included &quot;[[It Was a Good Day]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Check Yo Self]]&quot; remix, and the songs had a two-part music video from ''[[Sabrina: The Animated Series]]''. The album remains his most successful release, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'' which was released in the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including &quot;[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]&quot;, &quot;[[You Know How We Do It]]&quot; &amp; &quot;What Can I Do?&quot;. After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt;

In 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet &quot;Natural Born Killaz&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; In 1998, he released his long-awaited solo album, ''[[War &amp; Peace - Volume 1 (The War Disc)|War &amp; Peace Volume 1]]''. The delayed ''[[War &amp; Peace - Volume 2 (The Peace Disc)|Volume 2]]'', was released in 2000. The albums featured appearances from [[Westside Connection]] as well as a reunion with fellow N.W.A members, Dr. Dre and MC Ren, though many fans maintained that the two albums were not on par with his past work, especially the second volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title=&quot;War &amp; Peace, Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)&quot; â Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r465652|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Ice Cube also joined Dr. Dre, [[Eminem]] &amp; [[Snoop Dogg]] on the [[Up In Smoke Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Four Hours of Swagger from Dr. Dre and Friends|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DE123BF934A25754C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times |date=July 17, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Ice Cube released his seventh solo album, ''[[Laugh Now, Cry Later]]'', on his [[Lench Mob Records]] label, debuting at number four on the [[Billboard Charts]] and selling 144,000 units in the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Cube â Billboard Albums|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p48/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2007|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured production from [[Lil Jon]] and [[Scott Storch]], who produced the lead single &quot;[[Why We Thugs]]&quot;. He released his eighth studio album, [[Raw Footage]], on August 19, 2008, featuring the controversial single &quot;[[Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It]]&quot;.

On October 12, 2009 he released a non-album track called 'Raider Nation' in tribute to the Oakland Raiders' football team he supports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by jennie(ctrl) |url=http://icecube.com/news/5743/ |title=Raider Nation! |publisher=Ice Cube |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2010, Ice Cube released a [[30 for 30]] documentary, &quot;Straight Outta L.A.&quot;, for [[ESPN]] on the relationship between the gangster rap scene in Los Angeles and the tenure of the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsradiointerviews.com/2009/11/12/ice-cube-%e2%80%9craiders-fans-were-gangster%e2%80%99s-way-before-we-came-into-the-picture%e2%80%9d/ |title=Blog Archive Â» Ice Cube: âRaiders fans were gangsterâs way before we came into the pictureâ |publisher=Sports Radio Interviews |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://30for30.espn.com/film/straight-outta-la.html |title=ESPN 30 for 30 |publisher=ESPN  |date=June 17, 1994 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been voted as eighth of MTV's &quot;greatest emcees of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eighth&quot;&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index4.jhtml &quot;Ice Cube: Rank 8&quot;], MTV.com. Accessed February 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westside Connection===
In 1996, Ice Cube formed [[Westside Connection]] with [[Mack 10]] and [[WC (rapper)|WC]], and together they released an album called ''[[Bow Down]]''. Most of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 90s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast rap fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like &quot;Bow Down&quot; and &quot;Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round&quot; make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before the latter's death in 1995.

After a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its commercial reception was less than that of ''Bow Down''. &quot;Gangsta Nation&quot; was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded. WC, however, did release a new solo album on Lench Mob Records entitled ''[[Guilty by Affiliation]]'' on August 14, 2007.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Collaborations===
In 1992 Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funkee Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.

In 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] and Brendan Dedal on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track &quot;Last Wordz&quot; with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: &quot;[[Natural Born Killaz]]&quot;, for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song &quot;Two To The Head&quot; from the Kool G Rap &amp; DJ Polo album &quot;Live And Let Die&quot;. Ice Cube appeared on the song &quot;[[Children of the Korn]]&quot; by the band [[Korn]], as well as assisting in recording a Korn cover of Wicked, and lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track &quot;Get Em Up&quot;. Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like &quot;Keep it 100&quot;, &quot;80's babies&quot; and &quot;Jack and the bean stalk&quot;. Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.]] in the song &quot;Iz You Ready to die&quot; and in [[DJ Quik]] in the song &quot;Boogie Till You Conk Out&quot; in 2011.

===2004â2010===
[[File:Ice cube c.jpg|thumb|right|Ice Cube live in Metro City Concert Club, on 29 October, 2010.]]

In 2004, his hit singles &quot;Check Yo Self&quot;, &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot; and affiliated song &quot;Guerrillas in tha Mist&quot; with Da Lench Mob appeared on popular video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' on fictional radio station Radio Los Santos.

In late 2005, Ice Cube and [[R. J. Cutler]] teamed up to create the six-part documentary series titled ''[[Black. White.]]'', which was broadcast on cable network [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]. In May 2006 Ice Cube complained that [[Oprah Winfrey]] would not welcome him and other rappers on her show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ice Cube: Oprah has 'a problem with hip-hop'|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12991185/|publisher=MSNBC|agency=Associated Press|date=May 26, 2006|accessdate=May 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice Cube's other movie projects include ''Teacher of the Year'', released in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://movies.msn.com/celebs/celeb.aspx?c=59868, Retrieved on 2008/06/13.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Extractors'', released in 2008.

He has signed on to star in and produce ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', a big-screen adaptation of the 1970s television series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr-inside.com/ice-cube-cautious-about-welcoming-back-kotter-r7477.htm Ice Cube cautious about welcoming back Kotter], Pr-inside.com; accessed October 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ice Cube will play the title character, originally portrayed by [[Gabe Kaplan]] and his film company, Cube Vision Productions, has sealed a deal with [[Dimension Films]] to bring the show to the big screen.

In a London interview he revealed he is in talks of a collaboration with [[Gorillaz]] after speaking to frontman [[Damon Albarn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Friday, July 21, 2006, 10:48 BST |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds35077.html |title=Music â News â Gorillaz and Ice Cube to collaborate? |publisher=Digital Spy |date=July 21, 2006 |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006 [[Xzibit]], [[Lil Jon]] and WC from the Westside Connection honoured Ice Cube at VH1's Annual Hip Hop Honors, performing some classic Ice Cube tracks, and Ice Cube also performed &quot;Why We Thugs&quot; and &quot;Go To Church&quot; from his album ''Laugh Now, Cry Later'', where the New York crowd were greeted with Cube's vintage Cali sound. After launching that comeback album, Ice Cube toured across the world to promote it. The tour is known as &quot;Straight Outta Compton Tour&quot;, and accompanying him is his friend and fellow rapper WC from the Westside Connection. Some places he has recently performed include the Paradiso in [[Amsterdam]] and various venues in England. After touring the U.S. and Europe, he performed all around Australia, from Sydney's [[Enmore Theatre]] to The Forum Arena in Melbourne, before heading to Japan.

Ice Cube collaborated with [[Tech N9ne]] on the song &quot;Blackboy&quot; that appears on Tech N9ne's July 2008 album ''[[Killer (Tech N9ne album)|Killer]]''. The eighth Ice Cube studio LP, titled ''[[Raw Footage]]'', was released on August 19, 2008, and featured the singles [[Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It]] and [[Do Ya Thang]]. Ice Cube appeared on a song by rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] titled &quot;State of Emergency&quot; off The Game's Album, [[LAX (album)|L.A.X.]] In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]], and will return to perform at the 2011 festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|5gKE67L97SA|2011 Gathering Of The Juggalos Infomercial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumors of conflicts with other rappers in 2010, Ice Cube stated in an interview with [[DJ Whoo Kid]] on Sirius Shade 45 that he has &quot;no beef.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[DJ Whoo Kid]]|url=http://www.radioplanet.tv/ice-cube-shade-45-interview|title=Ice Cube New Friday?! Beef With Who?! Mike Epps On-Set Smoke Out?! Lottery Ticket Fun! VIDEO!|work=RadioPlanet.tv|date=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ice Cube's ninth studio album [[I Am the West]] was released on September 28, 2010. Ice Cube has stated this album has a different direction than any one of his other albums. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and [[Sir Jinx]], not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label [[Lench Mob Records|Lench Mob]]. Ice Cube has stated that &quot;being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box' that record companies would usually frown at. Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me.&quot;

In November 2011 Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was 7 songs into the current album he's recording. He also stated he &quot;always got an album coming out&quot; which suggests that he isn't thinking of rap retirement to focus on acting in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/#!/icecube/status/138576007253852161&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/#!/icecube/status/137728181833699329&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ventures==
===Film and television career===
Following his role as 'Doughboy' in ''[[Boyz N The Hood]]'', in 1992 he starred alongside Ice-T, and [[Bill Paxton]] in [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s action film, ''[[Trespass (1992 film)|Trespass]]'', and then in ''[[The Glass Shield]]''.

Ice Cube  was offered a co-star role with [[Janet Jackson]] in the 1993 romantic film [[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]], but he refused the role, which was given to [[Tupac Shakur]] instead.

John Singleton had encouraged Ice Cube to try his hand at screenwriting, telling him, &quot;If you can write a record, you can write a movie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Cube â Brief Article|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-60041449.html|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=February 28, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this encouragement, Ice Cube  wrote the screenplay for what became the 1995 comedy ''[[Friday (film)|Friday]]'', in which he also starred, alongside then up-and-coming comedian [[Chris Tucker]]. ''Friday'' earned $28&amp;nbsp;million worldwide on a $3.5&amp;nbsp;million budget, and spawned two sequels, ''[[Next Friday]]'' and ''[[Friday After Next]]''. (On March 9, 2011 he announced that he was making the final sequel called Last Friday). That year, he also starred in his second collaboration with John Singleton, ''[[Higher Learning]]'', as world-weary university student &quot;Fudge&quot;; a role for which he earned award nominations.

In 1997 Ice Cube starred in the action thriller [[Dangerous Ground]] as a South African exiled to America who returns 15 years later. He also had a supporting role in the film ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' that same year. He wrote, executive produced, and made his directorial debut in ''[[The Players Club]]'' in 1998, and in 1999 starred alongside [[George Clooney]] and [[Mark Wahlberg]] in the critically acclaimed ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]''. In 2000, he wrote and appeared in the ''Friday'' sequel ''[[Next Friday]]''. In 2002, Ice Cube starred in the commercially successful movie ''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'', as well as ''[[All About the Benjamins]]'' and the third film in the ''Friday'' trilogy, ''[[Friday after Next]]'' (which he again wrote). In 2004, he appeared in ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]'', and ''[[Torque (film)|Torque]]''; in 2005 he starred in the action movie ''[[XXX: State of the Union]]'', as well as the comedies ''[[Are We There Yet?]]'' and ''[[Are We Done Yet?]]'', co-starring [[Nia Long]].

In early April 2007 Ice Cube was a guest on Angie Martinez' Hot97 radio show and stated that he was interested in bringing back Chris Tucker as Smokey in a possible ''Friday'' sequel, but that was only possible &quot;if New Line cuts the cheque.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT97&quot;&gt;[http://media.hot97.com/_SHARED/podcasts/angie_icecube_040507.mp3 Ice Cube on Hot 97 Podcast]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with BlackFilm.com, Ice Cube stated that he would be interested in involving all major characters from the ''Friday'' franchise in a possible sequel, but added &quot;I know I'm not going to get Chris [Tucker] back, but I'd love to get everybody else back.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BLACKFILM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackfilm.com/20050121/features/icecube.shtml |title=Are We There Yet?: An Interview with Ice Cube |publisher=Blackfilm.com |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ice Cube is an avid fan of the [[Oakland Raiders]].

===Family===
He married Kimberly Woodruff in 1992, with whom he has five children (three boys, two girls) - O'Shea Jr., Darrel, Shareef and Karima, Deja.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Cube â Biography|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001084/bio|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A father of five, Ice Cube was asked by [[Fresh Air]]'s [[Terry Gross]] to provide some perspective on the relationship between his work and his family. When asked whether or not he allowed his children to listen to his music, he responded: &quot;What's worked for me is instilling in my kids a level of self-respect,&quot; helping them to understand the content of not just music but the violence found on the evening news. When asked what he tells his children about [[profanity]], he recalled telling his kids that there are &quot;appropriate times to use any kind of language.... Adults should never hear you use these words. If you want to use these words around your friends, that's really on you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresh Air&quot; /&gt; Two of Ice Cube's sons are also rappers under the names, OMG and Doughboy. They were featured on his album, [[I Am the West]].

Jackson is also the cousin of rapper [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] who started his career writing for Jackson's Group [[Da Lench Mob]]. With Cube's help Del released his debut album [[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]] when he was only 18.

===Religion===
In an interview with British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', Ice Cube stated that he is a Sunni [[Muslim]], having converted sometime in the 1990s. He described his Muslim faith as a simple, personal one that does not involve attending prayer services or following rituals. Although he has spoken favorably of the [[Nation of Islam]], he denied ever being in the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;CubeMuslim&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/feb/25/icecube|title=Ice Cube on Islam|publisher=(www.)guardian(.co.uk)|accessdate=November 15, 2008 | location=London | date=February 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
