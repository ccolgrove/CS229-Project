'''AEK Athens F.C.''' ({{lang-el|Î .Î.Î. AEK â ÎÎ¸Î»Î·ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® ÎÎ½ÏÏÎ¹Ï ÎÏÎ½ÏÏÎ±Î½ÏÎ¹Î½Î¿ÏÏÏÎ»ÎµÏÏ}} â '''Athlitiki Enosis Konstantinoupoleos'''), the ''Athletic Union of Constantinople'', is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[association football]] club based in the city of [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. Outside Greece, the club is also known as '''AEK Athens''', however, the word ''Athens'' is not part of the club's official title.

Established in Athens in 1924 by [[Greek refugees]] from [[Constantinople]] in the wake of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], AEK has grown to become a fairly successful club in Greek football, winning 30 national titles (including 11 [[Super League Greece|Championships]], 14 [[Greek Cup]]s, 2 [[Greek League Cup|League Cup]] and 3 [[Greek Super Cup|Super Cups]]).The team regularly appears in European ([[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]]) competitions.

==History==
{{Main|History of AEK Athens F.C.}}
===Early history===
[[Image:kostas-negropontis.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Kostas Negrepontis]]]]

The large Greek population of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], not unlike those of the other Ottoman urban centres, continued its athletic traditions in the form of numerous athletic clubs. Clubs such as '''Enosis Tataoulon''' ({{lang|el|ÎÎ½ÏÏÎ¹Ï Î¤Î±ÏÎ±Î¿ÏÎ»ÏÎ½}}) from the [[KurtuluÅ|Tatavla]] district, '''Megas Alexandros''' ({{lang|el|ÎÎ­Î³Î±Ï ÎÎ»Î­Î¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Ï}}) of Vathyriakos, '''Hermes''' ({{lang|el|ÎÏÎ¼Î®Ï}} â '''Ermis''') of [[Galata]], '''Olympias''' ({{lang|el|ÎÎ»ÏÎ¼ÏÎ¹Î¬Ï}}) of Therapia, and '''Kati Kioi''' ({{lang|el|ÎÎ±ÏÎ¯ ÎÎ¯Î¿Ï}}) of [[KadÄ±kÃ¶y|Chalcedon]] existed to promote [[Greeks|Hellenic]] athletic and cultural ideals. These were amongst a dozen Greek-backed clubs that dominated the sporting landscape of the city in the years preceding [[World War I]]. After the war, with the influx of mainly French and English soldiers to Constantinople, many of the city clubs participated in regular competition with teams formed by the foreign troops. [[Taksim Square|Taxim]], [[BeyoÄlu|Pera]] and [[KurtuluÅ|Tatavla]] became the scene of weekly competitions in not only football, but of athletics, cycling, boxing and tennis.

Of the clubs in the city, though, football was dominated by Enosis Tataoulon and Hermes. Hermes, one of the more popular clubs, was formed in 1875 by the Greek community of Pera (Galata). Forced to change its name to [[BeyoÄluspor|Pera Club]] in 1921, many of its athletes, and those of most other sporting clubs, fled during the population exchanges at the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], and settled in Athens and [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;[The history of AEK by Panos Makridis. Athlitiki Iho] Newspaper, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; 

====1924â1939====
[[Image:kleanthis-maropoulos.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Kleanthis Maropoulos]]]]

In 1924, a group of Constantinopolitan refugees (among them athletes from Pera Club and the other Constantinopolitan clubs) met at the athletic shop of Emilios and Menelaos Ionas on Veranzerou Street, in the center of Athens, and established AEK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=3014 History of AEK: Born through the ashes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of AEK established the club with the intention of providing athletic and cultural diversions for the thousands of predominantly Constantinopolitan and Anatolian refugees who had settled in the new suburbs of Athens (predominantly [[Nea Filadelfeia]], [[Nea Ionia]], [[Nea Chalkidona]], [[Nea Smyrni]]).
=====A.E.K. F.C. first football team=====
[[Goalkeeper|GK]]:N.Kitsos, [[Defender (association football)|DF]]:Ieremiadis, [[Defender (association football)|DF]]:T.Asderis, [[Midfielder|MF]]:Kehayas, [[Midfielder|MF]]:Paraskevas, [[Midfielder|MF]]:Dimopoulos, [[Midfielder|MF]]:Karagiannidis, [[Forward (association football)|FW]]:Baltas, [[Forward (association football)|FW]]:Milas, [[Forward (association football)|FW]]:Iliadis, [[Forward (association football)|FW]]:Georgiadis.The first match was against Aias Athinon in November 1924 and A.E.K. won it with 2â0.

AEKâs football team grew rapidly in popularity during the 1920s, eclipsing the already-established Athens-based refugee clubs ([[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]], [[Apollon Smyrnis]]), thanks mainly to the large pool of immigrants that were drawn to the club and due, in no small part, to the political connections and wealth of several of the clubâs board members. Not possessing a football ground, AEK played most of its early matches at various locations around Athens, including the grounds of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] and the [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium|Leoforos Alexandras Stadium]].

AEKâs first president, Konstantinos Spanoudis (1871â1941), a [[journalist]] and associate of the then Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], petitioned the government to set aside land for the establishment of a sports ground. In 1926, land in Nea Filadelfia that was originally set aside for refugee housing was donated as a training ground for the refugees. AEK began using the ground for training (albeit unofficially) and by 1930 the property was signed over to the club. Venizelos soon approved the plans to build what was to become AEKâs home ground for the next 70 years, the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]]. The first home game, in November 1930, was an exhibition match against Olympiacos that ended in a 2â2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=3015 History of AEK: The first achievements]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 [[Panathinaikos FC]], Olympiacos, and AEK began a dispute with the fledgling [[Hellenic Football Federation]] (EPO), decided to break away from the Athens regional league and form an alliance called [[P.O.K.]](acronym for Podosfairikes-Omades-Kentrou). During the dispute, POK organised friendly matches against each other and several continental European clubs. In 1929, though, the dispute ended and AEK, along with the other POK clubs, entered the EPO fold once again.

In 1932, AEK won their first Greek Cup title, beating [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.]] 5â3 in the final. The team boasted a number of star football players in [[Kostas Negrepontis]] (a veteran of the original Pera Club of Constantinople), [[Kleanthis Maropoulos]], [[Tryfon Tzanetis]], Michalis Delavinias, Giorgos Mageiras and Spyros Sklavounos.

The clubâs mixed success during the 1930s was highlighted by the first Greek Championship-Cup double in 1939.

====1940â1959====

Under former player Kostas Negrepontis as coach, AEK won the Greek Championship in 1940.
With [[England|English]] coach Jack Bimby at the reins, veteran players Maropoulos, Tzanetis, Delavinias and Mageiras, along with new blood Kostas Poulis, Giorgos Goulios, and Pavlos Emmanoualidis, AEK won the Greek Cup competitions of 1949 and 1950, beating Panathinaikos 2â1 and Aris 4â0.

AEK won also the Athens regional championship of 1950, but the playoff games for the
Pan-Hellenic title were not played, due to many players being called up for a prolonged
training camp for the national team.

The early 1950s saw the addition of the next generation of star footballers in Giannis Kanakis, [[Andreas Stamatiadis]], and goalkeeper Stelios Serafeidis, and along with Poulis and Emmanoualidis, AEK again won the Greek Cup title of 1956, this time beating Olympiacos 2â1 in the final. 1957 saw the debut of one of the greatest forwards of the era, [[Kostas Nestoridis]]. Having joined AEK from [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]] in 1956, Nestoridis was forced to sit out the 1956 season because of a dispute between the two clubs over his transfer. In 1958 and 1959 he finished top goal scorer in the league, but it wasnât enough for AEK to take any titles.

====1960â1979====
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0622-0030, FuÃball-WM, Schottland - Jugoslawien 1-1.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ]]]]

With Kostas Nestoridis scoring goals aplenty in the early 1960s, (top goalscorer 1958â1963), and the timely signing of attacker [[Mimis Papaioannou|Dimitris Papaioannou]] in 1962, AEK went on to win the 1963 Championship.

Known affectionately as âMimisâ by the AEK supporters, Papaioannou scored twice in the 1963 playoff against Panathinaikos, levelling the scores at 3â3 and giving AEK its first post-war championship title on goal aggregate. Coached by [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]-[[Germany|German]] JenÅ Csaknady, the championship team also consisted of veterans Nestoridis, Serafeidis and Stamatiadis, Alekos Sofianidis, [[Stelios Skevofilakas]], Giorgos Petridis, Manolis Kanellopoulos, and Miltos Papapostolou.

The club followed up with Cup victories in 1964 and 1966 on papers, and with the return of Csaknady to the coachâs position in 1968, and with some great players in Kostas Nikolaidis, Giorgos Karafeskos, Panagiotis Ventouris, Fotis Balopoulos, Spyros Pomonis, Alekos Iordanou, Nikos Stathopoulos and Andreas Papaemmanouil, AEK won the championship with relative ease, and became the first Greek football club to reach the quarter-final of European Champions Cup.
The addition of goalkeeper Stelios Konstantinidis and Apostolos Toskas reinforced the team and allowed AEK to take its fifth championship title in 1971.
AEK won also the unofficial Super-Cup of 1971 beating Olympiacos 4â2 on penalty kicks,
after 2 draws of 2â2 at Piraeus and 1â1 at Nea Filadelfia (normal time).

The Barlos âGolden Eraâ saw some of the greatest players ever to have played for AEK. [[Christos Ardizoglou]], [[Giorgos Dedes]], Giorgos Skrekis, the Germans [[Walter Wagner (footballer)|Walter Wagner]] and [[Timo Zahnleiter]], Dionysis Tsamis, Pantelis Nikolaou, [[Petros Ravousis]], [[Serbia]]n [[DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ]], Takis Nikoloudis, [[Stefanos Theodoridis]], Christos Itzoglou, Nikos Christidis.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stelios-01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stelios Manolas was the mainstay in AEK's defence from 1980 to 1998]] --&gt;
Captained by Papaioannou, 1976â1977 saw AEK reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup competition, the first Greek football club to do so. Beating [[FC Dynamo Moscow]] ([[Russia]]) 2â0, [[Derby County F.C.]] (U.K.) 2â0 and 3â2, [[Red Star Belgrade]] ([[Yugoslavia]]) 2â0, and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] (U.K.) 3â0 and 7â6 on penalties, AEK were eventually eliminated by [[Gianni Agnelli]]âs [[Juventus FC]]. Juventus went on to win their first European title.

It was during this period that AEK signed one of Greeceâs finest strikers, [[Thomas Mavros]]. He was an integral part of the team that reached the UEFA Cup semi finals in 1976, but it was his devastating form (top goal scorer of 1978 and 1979 â 22 and 31 goals, respectively) that helped AEK take the 1978 Championship-Cup double. The addition of former Panathinaikos FC stars [[Mimis Domazos|Dimitris Domazos]] and [[Kostas Eleutherakis]] to the AEK roster the following year saw the club cap off their most successful decade to-date by winning the 1979 Championship.

Under Loukas Barlos, the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]] was finally completed with the addition of the iconic âCovered Standâ, or '''Skepasti''' ({{lang|el|Î£ÎºÎµÏÎ±ÏÏÎ®}}), which eventually became home to the most fanatic of AEK supporter groups, [[Original 21]]. The next generation of star players, fresh out of the AEK Academy, made their debut during this period â [[Stelios Manolas]], Spyros Ekonomopoulos, [[Vangelis Vlachos]] and [[Lysandros Georgamlis]].

====1980â1999====
[[Image:Tsiartas.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Vassilios Tsiartas]]]]

With new president Michalis Arkadis and [[Austria]]n head coach [[Helmut Senekowitsch]], AEK won the 1983 Greek Cup, beating [[PAOK FC]] 2â0 in the newly built [[Athens Olympic Stadium]]. Thomas Mavros and 21-year-old captain [[Vangelis Vlachos]] were the goalscorers.

[[File:Miroslaw Okonski.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[MirosÅaw OkoÅski]]]]

AEK also chased the elusive Championship title and it finally came in 1989. Coached by former player [[DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ]], AEK clinched the title after a winning a crucial match 1â0 against Olympiacos at the [[Athens Olympic Stadium]]. Takis Karagiozopoulos scored the goal that gave AEK its first Championship in a decade.
AEK won also the Greek Super-Cup of 1989, beating Panathinaikos on penalties, (normal time 1â1).

After the 1989 triumphs, under BajeviÄ, AEK built what was to become one of the most successful teams in its history. Led by [[Stelios Manolas]], the team, which included [[Toni Savevski]], [[Daniel Batista]], [[Vaios Karagiannis]], [[Vasilis Dimitriadis]], [[Giorgos Savvidis]], Alekos Alexandris and [[Refik Å abanadÅ¾oviÄ]] dominated the Greek league through the 1990s with three successive Championship titles (1992, 1993, 1994). AEK also won the Greek League Cup of 1990 (beating Olympiakos 3â2).

In 1994â1995 AEK was the first Greek football club that participated in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League after defeating [[Scotland|Scottish]] champions [[Rangers FC]]; AEK was eliminated by [[Ajax Amsterdam]] and [[AC Milan]], who made it to the final. With Michalis Trochanas as president and DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ as coach, the club won the 1996 Greek Cup.

Former player [[Petros Ravousis]] took over the coaching position when DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ defected to Pireaus-based rivals Olympiacos at the end of 1996, and led the team to its second Super-Cup (August 1996), beating Panathinaikos on penalties, and to its eleventh Cup title in 1997, again beating Panathinaikos on penalties.
By far AEKâs most successful run with titles, the period also saw AEK sign talented players in
[[Demis Nikolaidis]], [[Christos Kostis]], [[Vassilis Tsiartas]], Christos Maladenis, [[Andreas Zikos]] and [[Michalis Kasapis]]. Demis Nikolaidis, in particular, an AEK fan since childhood, declined more lucrative offers from Olympiacos and Panathinaikos FC to sign for his beloved club.
During seasons 1996â1997 and 1997â1998, AEK progressed to the Quarter-Final of the European Cup Winners'
Cup.

In 1999, ex-president Dimitris Melissanidis organised a friendly match against [[FK Partizan]], in [[Belgrade]], during the height of the [[NATO bombing of Serbia]]. As a gesture of compassion and solidarity towards the embattled Serbs, the AEK players and management staff defied the international embargo and traveled to Belgrade for the match. The game ended 1â1, when after 60 minutes of play thousands of [[Serbia]]n football fans invaded the pitch to embrace the footballers.

===21st century===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Demis33.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Demis Nikolaidis]] one of AEK'S greatest ever strikers went on to become club chairman in 2004]] --&gt;
AEK won its twelfth Cup title in 2000 under Coach Giannis Pathiakakis, defeating [[Ionikos FC|Ionikos]] 3â0 in the final. The club continued its consistency in the Championship of 2001â02 finishing second by goal aggregate to Olympiacos, and beating Olympiakos in the Greek Cup final.

Dusan Bajevic returned as coach in the summer of 2002, a move that sparked open hostility towards Bajevic from a section of AEK supporters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Under Bajevic, AEK progressed through the qualifying rounds in the 2002 UEFA Champions League by eliminating [[APOEL FC]]. Drawn in Group A with [[AS Roma]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and [[Racing Genk]], AEK drew all their games and were knocked out of the competition. Off the field, AEK's home stadium for over 70 years, [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]], was demolished and club president Chrysostomos Psomiadis, with the assistance of his bodyguards, allegedly assaulted team captain Demis Nikolaidis.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  After the altercation, and partly due to the clubâs growing financial problems from mismanagement, Nikolaidis was let on free transfer by mutual consent to [[AtlÃ©tico Madrid]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Unable to cope with the negativity from a large section of AEK fans,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} BajeviÄ resigned in 2004 during a match against [[Iraklis FC|Iraklis]].

By now, on the brink of bankruptcy, and losing most of its Euro 2004 stars and experienced players to other European clubs, AEK needed a miracle to prevent it from being relegated to the Greek amateur leagues. Though both [[Kostas Katsouranis]] and [[Nikolaos Lymperopoulos|Nikos Lymperopoulos]] remained, [[Vassilis Borbokis]], [[Grigorios Georgatos]], [[Theodoros Zagorakis]], [[Michalis Kapsis]], [[Michalis Kasapis]], [[Michel Kreek]], [[Vassilis Lakis]], [[Vassilis Tsiartas]], and [[Ioannis Okkas]] all left the club in the wake of the troubles.

In 2003 Demis Nikolaidis and other significant AEK followers formed a supporters' club Enosis 1924 (Union 1924) in order to motivate all AEK supporters into taking up the club's shares and governance. The project was not fully realised because, in the meantime, businessmen decided to buy shares and invest money to the club. However, until today, Enosis 1924's chairman is member of the AEK F.C. board.

In 2004, on the back of strong AEK fan support, [[Demis Nikolaidis]], at the head of a consortium of businessmen, bought out the beleaguered club and became the new president. His primary task was to lead AEK out of its precarious financial position. The first success was an arrangement through the Greek justice system to write off most of the massive debt that previous club administrators had amassed, and to repay any remaining public debts in manageable installments.

Securing the clubâs existence in the Alpha Ethniki, Nikolaidis then began a program to rebuild AEK to its former glory. He appointed experienced former player [[Ilija IviÄ]] as technical director of the club and brought back [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] as coach. The AEK fans, emboldened by Nikolaidisâs efforts, followed suit by buying season ticket packages in record numbers (over 17,000).

AEK recruited promising young players to strengthen a depleted team. Led by the experienced Katsouranis and [[Nikolaos Lymperopoulos|Lymperopoulos]], and featuring Brazilian [[JÃºlio CÃ©sar da Silva e Souza|JÃºlio CÃ©sar]], the club made it to the Greek Cup final for seventh time in 13 years but lost to [[Olympiacos]] with 3â0, finished second in the Championship, and in the process, secured a place in the Third Qualifying Round of the UEFA Champions League. For the [[Super League Greece 2006-07|2006â07]] season, former [[Real Betis]] coach [[LlorenÃ§ Serra Ferrer]] was appointed to the coaching position after Fernando Santos's contract was not renewed.

[[File:RivaldoEmad-2009-23-08.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Rivaldo]]]]

By beating Hearts over both legs (2â1 in Scotland and 3â0 in Greece), AEK progressed to the group stage of Champions-League, the club obtained a total of 8 points, having beaten [[AC Milan]] 1â0, [[Lille OSC|Lille]] 1â0, and managing two draws with Anderlecht (1â1 in Greece and 2â2 in Belgium). AEK finished second in the Greek Super League, qualifying again for the 3rd round in the UEFA Champions League.

For the [[2007-08 in Greek football|2007/08]] season AEK changed kit sponsors from [[adidas]] to [[Puma AG|Puma]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=3234&amp;cpage=2 AEK switch to PUMA]&lt;/ref&gt; they have played with [[Sevilla FC]] in
the [[UEFA Champions League 2007-08|UEFA Champions League]] third qualifying round,the 1st leg has been played on August 15, away at the [[RamÃ³n SÃ¡nchez PizjuÃ¡n]] when AEK was defeated by 2 goals&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scorespro.com/lives2/goals.php?f=220339 Sevilla FC â AEK FC : 2â0] Match report from Scorespro.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2nd leg played on September 3 at the [[Athens Olympic Stadium]] where AEK lost again by 1â4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scorespro.com/lives2/goals.php?f=220355 AEK FC â Sevilla FC : 1â4] Match report from Scorespro.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, AEK completed the signings of [[Brazil]]ian legend [[Rivaldo]] after he was left free from Olympiacos, [[Rodolfo Arruabarrena]], [[Charilaos Pappas|Charis Pappas]] and Argentine striker [[Ismael Blanco]]. [[Traianos Dellas]] was rewarded with a new contract, keeping him at the club until summer 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=305&amp;n_id=3188 Dellas signes new contract]&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August the [[Super League Greece|Super League]] and [[Greece football federation|EPO]] decided to postpone the opening season's games due to the [[2007 Greek fires|fire disaster]] in the [[Peloponnese]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=574997.html Greece postpone games]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1281450,00.html &quot;National Tragedy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After being eliminated from the [[UEFA Champions League]], AEK were drawn to play [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|FC Salzburg]] in the [[UEFA Cup]]. On September 20 in [[Athens]], AEK defeated FC Salzburg 3â0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15118/match=301417/index.html AEK 3â0]&lt;/ref&gt; The second leg was played in [[Salzburg]] on October 4 AEK lost the match but still went through 3â1 on agg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15118/match=301457/index.html Salzburg â AEK]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9 AEK were drawn in Group C in the UEFA Cup group stage along with [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[FK MladÃ¡ Boleslav|MladÃ¡ Boleslav]], and [[IF Elfsborg|Elfsborg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=600044.html Past masters meet in group stage]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25 AEK kicked off the group stage's with a 1â1 draw away to [[IF Elfsborg|Elfsborg]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15119/match=301611/report=rp.html AEK hold on to frustrate Elfsborg]&lt;/ref&gt; on November 29 AEK again drew 1â1,this time at home to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15119/match=301642/report=rp.html Balzaretti own goal earns AEK a point]&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 5 AEK won [[FK Mlada Boleslav|Mlada Boleslav]] 1â0&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scorespro.com/lives2/goals.php?f=228382 M Boleslav â AEK Athens : 0â1] Match report from ScoresPro.com&lt;/ref&gt; away and on December 20
although AEK was home defeated 1â2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scorespro.com/lives2/goals.php?f=228384 AEK FC â Villareal : 1â2] Match report from Scorespro.com&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Villarreal CF]], finally booked a place in the knockout stage of the [[UEFA Cup]], finishing third in the group. They were then drawn against [[Getafe CF]] in the third round (phase of 32). AEK has been advanced to the third round of UEFA Cup, for second consecutive season.

On 12 February AEK parted company with LlorenÃ§ after a poor run of form and un-successful signings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=657089.html AEK call time on coach Serra Ferrer]&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced him with former player [[Nikos Kostenoglou]], on a caretaker basis, at the end of an indifferent season. The team initially finished in first place in the league, but after the court case between [[Apollon Kalamarias F.C.|Apollon Kalamaria]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] for the illegal usage of a player in the 1â0 Apollon Kalamaria win earlier in the season, Olympiacos were awarded the 3 points in a court hearing, thus finishing 2 points ahead of AEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=16/newsid=685259.html|title=Legal Dispute|accessdate=2008-05-15|date=2008-04-20|publisher=uefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; AEK president [[Demis Nikolaidis]] and several other managers and chairmen have been angered with the court's decision, stating that the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] knew about the usage of the illegal player prior to the game but didn't do anything about it.
[[Giorgos Donis]] was appointed head coach of AEK on May 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=305&amp;n_id=4184&amp;cpage=1 Giorgos Donis â Head Coach of AEK FC]&lt;/ref&gt;

His reign at the club did not go well. It all began when AEK failed to surpass [[AC Omonia]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] second qualifying round, meaning there elimination from European competitions for the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=15283/match=303886/report=rp.html Omonia keep the party going in Nicosia]&lt;/ref&gt; Key player [[Rivaldo]] asked to leave the club to sign for [[Bunyodkor]] on August 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4383 Rivaldo leaves club (greek)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scocco.jpg|thumb|80px|right|[[Nacho Scocco]]]]

The league campaign started very well after a win over rivals [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]] in the opening game of the season, but poor performances and results from then on left AEK in a difficult situation. Head coach [[Giorgos Donis]] was eager to leave the club, but president [[Demis Nikolaidis]] did not allow him to leave. Nevertheless, Nikolaidis left due to these disappointing results and after a controversy with the clubs supporters [[Original 21]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4584 Nikolaidis Resigns]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving temporarily the presidency to member of the D.C., Nikos Koulis and Takis Kanellopoulos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4584 Kanellopoulos and Koulis take charge]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the series of disappointing results continued, bringing anger and insecure situations for everyone in the team. The first to be hit by this wave of disappointment and with the council of the team upset, was the coach Giorgos Donis, who was asked to leave the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=2557 Donis's brief tenure at AEK is over]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 2008, AEK hired [[DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ]] as head coach for the third time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4638 AEK FC sign Dusan Bajevic]&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a while, Takis Kanellopoulos left the team, as he sparked a rivalry with BajeviÄ.

On 4 February 2009, Nikos Thanopoulos was elected as the 41st president of AEK FC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=2859 Thanopoulos is new AEK president]&lt;/ref&gt; Bajevic brought some much-needed stability to the club, and performances on the pitch improved vastly towards the end of the season, culminating in AEK's progression to the [[Greek Cup]] final against Olympiacos which was played on 2 May 2009 at [[Athens Olympic Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=3102 AEK qualify for final]&lt;/ref&gt; AEK lost in the [[Greek Cup 2008â09#Final|final]] 14â15 on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=3181 Olympiakos win epic final 15â14 on pens]&lt;/ref&gt; AEK finished the regular season at 4th position, thus qualifying for the season's [[Super League Greece 2008â09#Play-offs|playoff's]], in which they eventually finished second, just missing out on [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification.

[[Image:Eidur Gudjohnsen 10mar2007.jpg|thumb|80px|right|[[EiÃ°ur GuÃ°johnsen]]]]


In the summer transfer period of 2010, AEK, despite being low on budget, manage to reinforce it's ranks with many notable players. Club idols [[Nikos Liberopoulos]] and [[Traianos Dellas]] signed the last 1-year contract of their careers, and many new and experienced players signed to AEK, the most notable of whom were [[Papa Bouba Diop]], [[Cristian Nasuti]] and [[Christos Patsatzoglou]] amongst others. AEK qualified for the [[2010-11 UEFA Europa League#Group G|2010â2011 Europa League group stage]] after defeating [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] 2â1 on aggregate.


On 7 October 2010, [[Manuel Jimenez Jimenez|Manolo JimÃ©nez]] took over from [[DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ]] at AEK Athens after he stepped down as AEK manager, agreeing to a two-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1314320.html Jimenez to fill AEK Athens hotseat]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30th April 2011, AEK won the [[Greek Cup]] for 14th time, by defeating 3â0 Atromitos FC at the final.

To compensate the departures of [[Nacho Scocco]], [[Papa Bouba Diop]], [[Sebastian Saja]] and [[Ismael Blanco]] in the summer of  2011 A.E.K. signed amongst others the captain of [[Iceland national football team|Iceland's]] [[EiÃ°ur GuÃ°johnsen]] and the Colombian international [[FabiÃ¡n AndrÃ©s Vargas|FabiÃ¡n Vargas]].

[[File:AEK shirt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|AEK's shirt history]]

The colours of yellow and black were adopted from AEK's connections with [[Constantinople]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=319 | title=Colours info |work=aekfc.gr| accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEK have always worn predominantly yellow shirts (striped or plain), black shorts, and yellow or black socks. The only exception has been in the unusual, but notable, [[Kappa (company)|Kappa]] kits of the 1990s (which featured a double-headed eagle across the kit), or in recent years, mainly in European competitions, when the club has worn an all-yellow kit.

AEK's traditional away colours are all-black or all-white; on a few occasions, the club has introduced a light blue, a grey, and even a [[Scarlet (color)#Dark scarlet|dark scarlet]] kit as a third kit.

AEK's current kit is manufactured by [[Puma AG|Puma]], which is contracted to supply the club's kit from 2007 to 2014. Their previous kit manufacturer were [[Diadora]], [[Kappa (company)|Kappa]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Adidas]]. AEK's first shirt sponsor was [[Citizen Watch Co.|Citizen]] (1982â83), followed by [[Nissan]] (1983â85), Ethniki Asfalistiki and Phoenix Asfaleies (1988â96), [[Geniki Bank]] (1996â98), [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] (1999), [[Marfin Bank|Marfin]] (1999â2001), [[Alpha TV|Alpha Digital]] (2001â02), [[Piraeus Bank]] (2002â04), which caused controversy
because it was situated in [[Pireaus]] â home of fierce rivals [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], [[WIND Hellas|TIM]] (2004â06), [[LG Group|LG]] with [[Chevrolet]] on the sleeves, [[Forthnet]] on the shorts and [[Diners Club]] on the back (2006â09) and 2009â2010 was [[Diners Club]]. AEK's current shirt sponsor for 2010â2012 is [[OPAP]] and International Service on the back of the shirt with APHCA(E.PSI.PE) on the sleeves.

===Crest===

In 1924, AEK adopted as their emblem the image of a [[double-headed eagle]] ({{lang|el|ÎÎ¹ÎºÎ­ÏÎ±Î»Î¿Ï ÎÎµÏÏÏ}} â '''Dikefalos Aetos'''). When AEK was created by [[Greeks|Greek]] refugees from [[Constantinople]] in the years following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and subsequent [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]], the emblem and colours (yellow &amp; black) were chosen as a reminder of lost homelands; they represent the club's historical ties to [[Constantinople]].After all, the double-headed eagle is featured in the flag of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], whose headquarters are in Constantinople, and served as [[Byzantine heraldry|Imperial emblem]] under the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty.

AEK's main emblem underwent numerous minor changes between 1924 and 1982. The design of the eagle on the shirt badge was often not identical to the design of the eagle depicted on official club correspondence, merchandise and promotional material. All designs were considered &quot;official&quot; (in the broadest sense of the word), however, it was not until 1982 that an identifiable, copyrighted design was established as the club's official, and shirt, badge. The emblem design was changed in 1989, and again in 1993 to the current shield design.

==Stadium==
:''Main articles: [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]], [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)]]''

'''Nikos Goumas Stadium''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Nea Filadelfeia]] (&quot;''New [[AlaÅehir#Ancient Philadelphia|Philadelphia]]''&quot;), a northwestern suburb of [[Athens]], [[Greece]].

==Supporters and Rivalries==

===Supporters===
[[AEK Athens]] has a large fanbase,the majority of AEK supporters are refugees or have refugee decent from [[Constantinople]] and people from the population exchange of the Minor Asia Catastrophe.[[Original 21]] is the largest [[AEK Athens]] supporters club. The first attempt to organise AEK supporters was '''Gate 21''' (formed in 1975), which took its name from the gate in the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]], [[Nea Filadelfia]], where the most hardcore fans gathered.[[AEK Athens]] have also many supporters worldwide,most of them Greek immigrants,in places as [[North America]], [[England]], [[Australia]] and [[Cyprus]].
[[Image:Original21AEK.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A.E.K. F.C. fans in [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]]]

===Supporters Friendships===
There is a strong relationship between [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|AS Livorno]], AEK Athens, and [[Olympique Marseille]]. A.E.K. fans often lift banners and create choreography in support of the fellow teams. A so-called &quot;triangle of brotherhood&quot; has developed between the most heavily supported fan clubs of Olympique de Marseille, Livorno, and AEK Athens, namely between Commando Ultras 84, Brigate Autonome Livornesi 99, and Original 21. Their connection is mostly an ideological one.

===Rivalries===
{{main|AEK and Panathinaikos rivalry}}
{{main|Olympiacos and AEK rivalry}}
{{main|Double-headed eagles derby}}

AEK Athens' biggest rivalries are with [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], and [[P.A.O.K. F.C.|PAOK]].
Against neighbours [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] they contest the [[Athens]] local football [[derby]]. The rivalry started because of the refugee ancestry of AEK Athens fans and, by contrast, the fact that [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] was considered the classic representative of Athenian high class society.
The rivalry with [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] stems from the rivalry between the two regions of Attica that the clubs are from; AEK hailing from [[Athens]] and Olympiacos from [[Piraeus]]. Another reason is that, although it has working class fans of its own, [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] has many high class &amp; rich supporters.
