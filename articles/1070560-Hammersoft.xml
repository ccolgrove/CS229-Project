'''Kevin Eldon''' (born 3 October 1960) is an [[English people|English]] [[actor]] and [[comedian]]. He featured in critically acclaimed [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy]] [[television]] shows of the 1990s, notably ''[[Fist of Fun]]'', ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'', ''[[Big Train]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'' and ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]''.

==Early career and ''Lee &amp; Herring''==
Eldon was born in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Kent]], [[England]]. He started on the stand-up circuit in the early '90s performing an act in character as the political poet Paul Hamilton, but has also done stand-up as himself on occasions. On the circuit, Eldon formed a friendship with the stand-up comedian [[Stewart Lee]], which would later lead to an invitation to work with Lee on the radio series ''[[Fist of Fun|Lee &amp; Herring's Fist of Fun]]'' with Lee's comedy partner [[Richard Herring]]. Lee and Herring would usually refer to him as &quot;The Actor Kevin Eldon&quot;, in reference to his claim to be an actor, rather than a comedian.

Eldon's work sat well with that of Lee &amp; Herring, and he continued to work with them on all their projects, including ''[[Lee and Herring (radio series)|The Lee &amp; Herring Radio Show]]'', ''[[Fist of Fun]]'' and ''[[This Morning with Richard Not Judy]]'', providing a multitude of characters, most notably: the [[Gelatin dessert|jelly]]-obsessed False [[Rod Hull]]; and Simon Quinlank, the self-proclaimed &quot;king of hobbies&quot;, who would always be accompanied by a flask of &quot;weak lemon drink&quot;. He also played a version of himself, as The Actor Kevin Eldon. In addition to his Lee &amp; Herring collaborations, he has worked closely with [[Simon Munnery]] and [[Julia Davis]].
