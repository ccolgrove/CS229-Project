<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="9104854" ns="0" title="Mklivecd"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''mklivecd''' is a script for [[Linux_kernel|Linux]] [[Linux distribution|distributions]] that allows for one to compile a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the current hard drive partition and all data which resides in it (all settings, applications, documents, bookmarks, etc.) and compress it into an ISO 9660 CD-image. This allows easy backup of a user's data and also makes it easy to create customized Linux-distribution. It was originally used primarily for the [[Debian]] distribution, but has since become available prominently on all distributions of [[Linux_(kernel)|Linux-operating system]]. Some Linux-distributions like Mandriva and from it derived [[PCLinuxOS]] includes a graphical frontend for easier script usage.
