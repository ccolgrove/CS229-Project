The '''White Rock Tritons''' are a youth [[baseball]] team located in the city of [[South Surrey]], [[British Columbia]].  Although most of the Tritons players are from the [[White Rock]] and South Surrey communities, the team also attracts talent from other areas around the [[Lower Mainland]] such as [[Delta,_British_Columbia|Delta]], [[Ladner,_British_Columbia|Ladner]] and [[Surrey,_British_Columbia|Surrey]], as well as attracting HS players from Blaine. 

Russ Smithson is the newly appointed Head Coach as of 2010/2011 season.

The team was founded in 1993, and joined the [[B.C. Premier Baseball League]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;BCPBL: [http://www.bcpbl.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=71&amp;42e49c9cb5032e7bc289b8fc6c3aa25d=msyqxurgg League History] Retrieved on 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The team plays their home games at [[South Surrey Athletic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;BCPBL: [http://www.bcpbl.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=218&amp;Itemid=484 White Rock Tritons Home Field] Retrieved on 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
