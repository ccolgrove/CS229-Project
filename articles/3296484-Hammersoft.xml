'''The Ohio State University at [[Newark, Ohio|Newark]] campus''' in [[Licking County, Ohio]] is a [[coeducational]] [[public university]] founded in 1957 as the first OSU regional campus. During its early years, classes were held at an old Newark High School. In 1966, over one million dollars pledged by 7,000 local citizens to match funds from the state legislature supported the cost of buying {{convert|155|acre|km2}} of land and constructing the first building, Founders Hall, which opened in 1968.

Since Founders Hall opened, it has become home to classrooms, general administrative and faculty offices, labs and the library. Hopewell Hall, opened in 1976, and includes labs, a student lounge area, classrooms, faculty offices, the cafeteria, the bookstore, financial aid and fees and deposits. Adena Hall was completed in 1978 and contains the gymnasium and workout facilities, classrooms, laboratories and faculty offices. In autumn 1986, the student apartment complex opened and in 1988 the Child Development Center was built. LeFevre Hall, opened in 1993, and is home to technical education, performing arts and faculty offices. The Reese Center, one of the most state-of-the-art facilities in the country, opened in October 2004 and contains classrooms, a 600-seat auditorium, a ballroom and conference center, the Cyber CafÃ©, faculty offices, labs and the executive board room. Currently, the Ohio State Newark is the largest of the OSU regional campuses with 50 distinguished faculty members and a student body of 2,100.
 
Since 1971, the OSU Newark campus has partnered with [[Central Ohio Technical College]] (COTC) to share higher education complex and to help meet the stateâs growing need for skilled technicians. The Newark Campus Library, now located on the first floor of the Warner Center, is a cost-shared department serving the communities of OSU Newark and COTC. The Library houses about 50,000 print volumes, 375 serial subscriptions, over 36,000 microforms, 1000 audio tapes/CDs and video cassettes/DVDs, 1,200 maps. In addition, as part of the Ohio State University library system and the OhioLINK consortium, the Library provides access to over 9 million unique items including 19,000 e-books and nearly 6,000 full text electronic journals.
 
The Martha Grace Amphitheatre was reopened in 1999 at The Ohio State University-Newark campus. It was named after the mother of J. Gilbert Reese and the Gilbert Reese Family Foundation who donated the money to rededicate the amphitheatre and make it open to the public. Because it is opened to the public the Martha Grace Amphitheatre also holds weddings and other types of large events for people in the community.
 
For the students of The Ohio State University-Newark campus, it offers them a place to relax and enjoy the scenery surrounding the amphitheatre which includes a large pond that has a walk-way across it, as well as a very nice fountain at the entrance to the amphitheatre. It is located in the middle of the Newark campus next to Adena Hall making it convenient for all students.
 
Due to some of the free concerts the Newark Advocate has rated it one of the top 25 things to do in Licking County. Several bands play there every year from The Ohio State Marching Band to Grammy nominees Restless Heart and Styx.
