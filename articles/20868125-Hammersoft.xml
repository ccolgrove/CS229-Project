'''Debra Dean''', played by actress [[Ruth Gemmell]], first appears on 5 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a138824/lauren-turns-herself-in.html|title= Lauren turns herself in|first=Kris|last=Green|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the mother of established character [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), who she left along with Whitney's father, Nathan Dean, when Whitney was very young. Debra kept in touch with Nathan and his partner [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) so Nathan and Bianca could keep her informed about Whitney. Debra is known to have worn a [[crucifix]], which she gave to Whitney before she left. She also gave Whitney a porcelain doll that was broken by Whitney's sister, [[Tiffany Dean|Tiffany]] ([[Maisie Smith]]).

Debra is first mentioned in late December 2008 when Whitney decides to get in touch, only to discover Debra has not received the letter as Bianca gave her the wrong address. She claims not to have the right address when Whitney asks for it, wanting to protect her, but [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) discovers Bianca is lying and steals it from Bianca's address book, and gives it to Whitney.

Debra and Whitney meet on 5 January at a cafÃ© where Debra works. Whitney tries to discuss when they had lived together but Debra is not interested. She shows no interest in Whitney, coldly rejecting her, upsetting Whitney so much that she breaks down in tears just after she leaves the cafÃ©. She goes home and tells Bianca that she is her mother as Whitney felt visiting her birth mother was the biggest mistake she has made.

Whitney does not have any further contact with Debra until 5 June when she arrives unexpectedly. Bianca sends her away but Debra returns a few days later, insisting she wants to get to know her daughter. Bianca tells [[Ricky Butcher]] that Debra is not to be trusted and on Whitney's first birthday, she went on holiday with friends instead of being there for her daughter. Debra takes Whitney out for lunch at [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], where they start to bond, and Debra confesses that she is homeless. As a result, Whitney asks Bianca to let her stay with them. Whitney helps her sell some counterfeit DVDs. Their bond grows stronger and she surprises Whitney with her plan to move to Greece and asks if she will come. Whitney delightfully accepts, but realises that Debra is using her when she leaves suddenly, giving Whitney a sealed envelope, telling her she will be back for it and tells her not to open it or she would be &quot;sorry&quot;.

She returns on 17 July with cuts on her face, just after Ricky leaves, after failing to convince Whitney to go to Brighton with them. Debra says that someone is after her and this turns out to be her son, [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]). Whitney and Debra go to an abandoned school and retrieve a bag. Debra will not let Whitney see the contents and when they get home, a man who has been stalking Whitney is inside. The man is Ryan and he and Debra argue. When Whitney defends her mother, Ryan tells her she is his mother too. It is revealed that the bag contains a knife that Ryan stabbed somebody with. Ryan returns the next morning and argues with Debra again, causing Whitney to run out and throw the knife into the canal. When she returns, Debra plans to leave but when Whitney tells her about her abuser [[Tony King]] and his upcoming trial and says she is going to cook them a family meal, she agrees to stay. When Ryan and Debra are alone, he tells her to leave, insisting she is a bad mother and that Whitney is better off without her. Looking frightened, Debra leaves. In December, Debra sends Ryan a text message to say that she cannot attend Tony's trial to support Whitney and not to contact her again.

'''Marissa Moore''', played by [[Finn Atkins]],&lt;ref&gt;Bolger, Keeley; [http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article2151926.ece &quot;EE bitch Janine fuels Jack's fear&quot;] ''TheSun.co.uk'', 20 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; makes her first on-screen appearance on 13 January 2009, working at the newly opened Gilly's Massage Parlour. The parlour is met with opposition from [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) and [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), amongst other residents. Peggy tries to convince [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) not to serve Marissa in his shop, but [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) sticks up for her and strikes up a friendship with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Cara|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article2127177.ece|title=Jay defends Enders hooker|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Kris Green of [[Digital Spy]] reports, &quot;Jay (Jamie Borthwick) tries to take his friendship with Marissa (Finn Atkins) to another level. [...] He plans to run away with Marissa. [...] When Jay meets with Marissa, however, he's confused by her behaviour. All's not what it seems with the young female as she brushes Jay off and makes a call and says into the mic: 'I did what you said. Now leave him alone.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/a143104/streets-tony-mown-down-edale-arrest-and-oaks-arrival.html|title=Street's Tony mown down, E'dale arrest and 'Oaks arrival|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=17 January 2009|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins discussed her role in an interview with the ''[[Nottingham Evening Post]]''. When asked, &quot;The ears of local viewers must have pricked up when they heard Marissa?&quot; Atkins replied, &quot;A lot of people have said that! I've had a lot of nice feedback. When I went for the casting I'd prepared a London accent, but they were like, 'You know what, we prefer your Nottingham accent,' and I was like 'Get in!' A lot of people had assumed I would be giving it the Cockney slang and I said, 'No â I'm doing it with my Nottingham accent.' I kind of felt like I was representing the city.&quot; Atkins described the character at some length, noting, &quot;My character, Marissa, was in a lot of scenes with Jamie Borthwick, who plays Jay Brown... Marissa was a runaway who had been let down by people. She arrived in London to stay with a friend, but found the friend wasn't there, so she'd been on her own and the hardship had forced her into prostitution. Obviously that wasn't something that ''EastEnders'' could delve too much into, but you got the idea that she was going through hard times. She could seem quite hard but she did have a softer side. I don't know if they'll return to the storyline or not... The character, Marissa, was only 16. Because I'm quite small I can play anything from 15 up to my age or even a bit older.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Jo|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/entertainment/Cannes-Walford-Clifton-s-Finn/article-667428-detail/article.html|title=From Cannes to Walford for Clifton's Finn|work=[[Nottingham Evening Post]]|date=4 February 2009|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grace Dent]] writes, &quot;I feel sad for Marissa already. Gilly's brothel is a garish tribute to why this really is still a man's world and Marissa's just the faceless droid who masturbates him. I'm not sure that banning Marissa from the [cafÃ©] so she can't have a bacon sandwich afterwards is really solving anything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dent|first=Grace|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/jan/17/coronation-street-eastenders-soaps|title=Grace Dent world of lather: In the soaps this month, Janine cons half the Square in 'Endersâ¦|publisher=[[Guardian.co.uk]]|date=17 January 2009|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theo Kelly''', played by [[Rolan Bell]], was scripted as a love interest for the character [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]), who, it is claimed, was won over by his &quot;good looks and impeccable manners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a141859/enders-bosses-cast-mystery-character.html 'Enders bosses cast mystery character], ''Digital Spy'', URL last accessed 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He appears between 26 January and 15 June 2009.

According to a BBC news release, &quot;Theo's good looks and manners make him a hit with the ladies on the Square. He seems like the perfect gent&quot;. Discussing his casting, Rolan Bell said, &quot;As a lifelong fan of ''EastEnders'' it is amazing to be part of the show - everyone has been so welcoming on set. Working with actors such as [[Rudolph Walker]] has been a dream come true and I can't wait to see how my character develops on screen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20090112_n1.shtml New arrival: Rolan Bell], ''BBC'', URL last accessed 13 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He added, &quot;I auditioned for EastEnders a few years ago when I 'd just left drama school and, quite luckily, I didn't get the part because it was only a small walk-on role. When the audition for Theo came up, I just went for it and gave it all I could.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a146877/rolan-bell-theo-kelly-eastenders.html|title=

In an interview with media website [[Digital Spy]], Bell revealed information about his character's personality: &quot;He's a well-to-do guy [...] He's been raised with good manners and he's definitely a mummy's boy. He's the kind of guy that wants to do right by women, but at the same time, he's a bit of a ladies' man. He's quite a gentleman and definitely old-fashioned.&quot; According to Bell, the writers of ''EastEnders'' pitched Theo as &quot;a young, charming guy with impeccable manners&quot;; however, he revealed that not much about his character's background was revealed in the beginning, so development has been &quot;an organic process&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS&quot;/&gt;

In February 2009, the character was featured as part of ''EastEnders''' first episode acted by an all-black cast, which received focus in the British media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/eastenders-focuses-on-race-attitude-1631848.html|title=
EastEnders focuses on race attitude|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=13 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
The character's backstory was revealed by Rolan Bell: &quot;Theo's grown up in a one-parent family in [[Brixton]] [...] he's the eldest of his brothers and sisters - he's actually one of six children [...] The father/son relationship is quite distant - almost non-existent - and I think that's why he has the attitude towards women that he has. Theo's seen the pain his mother's been through and he has quite a compassion for women in that situation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DS&quot;/&gt;

Theo Kelly arrives in [[Walford]] in search of [[Patrick Trueman]]. He is searching for him on behalf of [[Tommy Clifford]] in regard to the 1950s race riots that Patrick was involved with. He introduces Tommy to Patrick, not realising that Tommy is the man who killed Patrick's fiancee during the riots. Theo begins dating Chelsea Fox, who is close to Patrick, but when Tommy's true identity is discovered, Theo falls out with Chelsea, although she eventually forgives him, believing that he was not a part of Tommy's deception.

Chelsea believes she is not intelligent enough for Theo, she strays with a footballer named Ellis in June 2009. Theo is willing to forgive her, but Chelsea rejects him due to her insecurities.  Chelsea later dumps Theo in favour of Ellis and later leaves Walford with Ellis.  However she returns a few weeks later admitting to her family that she's been the victim of [[domestic abuse]].  She has had no further contact with Theo and he has not been seen around Albert Square since.

'''Sydney &quot;Syd&quot; Chambers''' is played by [[Nina Toussaint-White]] and appeared on screen between 6 February and 11 December 2009. After her first appearance, it was revealed that Syd has a deaf son named [[#Noah Chambers|Noah]].

In January 2009, it was announced that actress Nina Toussaint-White would join ''EastEnders'' playing Syd, a new love interest for [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;DSsyd&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a143999/potential-love-for-bradley-joins-enders.html|title=Potential love for Bradley joins 'Enders|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Speaking of her part, Toussaint-White said: &quot;I have been a fan of ''EastEnders'' for as long as I can remember and I am extremely excited to be working on such a great show. Finding out I got the job was exciting, but standing on [[Albert Square|the Square]] for the first time was amazing although very surreal.&quot; She added: &quot;I'm looking forward to working with Charlie Clements and seeing what Syd is going to get up to.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSsyd&quot;/&gt;

Toussaint-White has subsequently claimed that the relationship between Bradley and Syd is an attempt to portray more [[interracial relationship]]s in ''EastEnders''. However, she also urged the soap to go further in trying to accurately portray the diversity of modern London. Toussaint-White also claimed that her addition in the cast of ''EastEnders'' was part of an ongoing process of including more ethnic-minority characters in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/2663074/Stars-blast-EastEnders-for-being-out-of-touch.html|title=Albert Squares|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|first=TV|last=Biz|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of Syd's relationship with Bradley is directly linked to the high-profile storyline of [[Stacey Slater]]'s ([[Lacey Turner]]) ongoing battle with [[bipolar disorder]], and her subsequent sectioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1218620/EastEnders-Stacey-Slater-restrained-police-Bradley-leaves-Albert-Square.html|title=EastEnders' Stacey Slater has to be restrained by police as Bradley leaves Albert Square|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|first=Daily Mail|last=Reporter|date=7 October 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
Syd and her dog, Sugar, come to [[Walford]] in February 2009 to return Gumbo, [[Bradley Branning]]'s dog, who had gone missing. Upon meeting Bradley, she accepts his offer of a cup of tea and is seen again in March when Bradley finally plucks up the courage to phone her. Later that evening, they spend time together at his home but are briefly interrupted by Bradley's estranged wife Stacey Slater. Liking the area, Syd moves into the flat above the bookmakers and begins dating Bradley. She finds herself attracted to him as he is different from the other men she has dated, and when Bradley confesses that he is unemployed, she admires his honesty and kisses him, cementing their relationship.

However, she disappears for some time, making Bradley worried that she is no longer interested. When she finally reappears, she insists that she has been busy with her job as a nurse. Bradley, however, remains unconvinced that Syd has feelings for him and, attempting to prove him wrong, she gives him a rose and they sleep together. Bradley is delighted by this but Syd breaks his heart when she finishes with him. After seeing a man leave her flat, Bradley decides to move to [[Edinburgh]] until Syd hears about it. She rushes to his house and begs him to reconsider, inviting him to her flat so she can explain her actions. Bradley relents and Syd introduces him to her deaf son Noah, informing him that the man he saw was her babysitter.

When Bradley is admitted to hospital, Max urges Syd to visit him, but she refuses because she does not want to leave Noah. She changes her mind when Noah takes a shine to Bradley and asks about him.

In August, she receives a job offer in Canada. Excited, Noah announces that Bradley is coming with them, but Bradley is worried about leaving his family behind, particularly his grandfather, who has just returned from a nursing home. She is sad but understands his circumstances. Noah too is against the idea of moving to Canada as he has made friends in Walford. After arguing with Stacey, Bradley tells Syd that he will go to Canada with her and Noah whenever she wants. They leave on 9 October but return on 7 December to visit his mother, [[Rachel Branning|Rachel]], in hospital. However, Bradley tells Syd that he is still in love with Stacey and refuses to return to Canada. She tries but fails to convince him that Stacey is trying to split them up and that he cannot leave Noah. However, he insists he is staying in Walford and says goodbye to them after helping to put their luggage in the car. Heartbroken, she and Noah leave without Bradley.

Syd was not heard from again until February 2010 when her former roommate [[Amira Shah|Amira]] contacted her in order to inform her of Bradley's death.

'''Todd Taylor''', played by [[Ashley Kumar]], is introduced as a love interest for [[Whitney Dean]]. The pair meet at the laundrette on 10 February 2009 when they are doing their laundry. They are later reacquainted when coincidentally Todd is working for [[Ricky Butcher]] as a car valet and Whitney accidentally picks up and washed a pair of Todd's boxer-briefs.

Todd is shy but asks her out on a date. Whitney initially is not interested, but later changes her mind. Their first date starts well, but when Todd tells Whitney about his past relationship with another girl, he puts pressure on her, wanting to know about her past relationship too. Whitney runs away when she feels haunted over her sexual abusive relationship with paedophile [[Tony King]]. Todd later bumps into Whitney and asks her what was bothering her, but she storms off, although he finds her later again and immediately contact Ricky, where he discovers her drunk in a dark alleyway. The next day Todd visits the Whitney's home to check on her and drops off some chocolates for her. This makes a good impression on Ricky as he states that Todd is a mature person that cares for Whitney, unlike Tony who took advantage of her.

Todd appears two months later after his new boss [[Darren Miller]] buys the car lot back from Ricky's manipulative sister [[Janine Butcher]]. He meets Whitney again when he comes to play on his [[Xbox 360]]. However things do not end as expected when [[Tiffany Dean]], Whitney's adoptive half-sister's pet caterpillar crawls into his clothes and he takes off his shirt in a panic. When Ricky walks into the room, he thinks that Todd is stripping for Whitney and kicks him out. Later on, Todd helped Whitney down from the swing in the playground and she stumbles onto him, which leads her to think he was about to kiss her. Todd later turns up at her home where Ricky apologises for the misunderstanding, along with Whitney making up with him. They go to play on the Xbox again but Todd accidentally stands on the caterpillar, much to Tiffany's dismay. Whitney and Todd decide to just be friends, but Whitney discovers a condom in his wallet, which he left behind by mistake, discovering that he is still thinking of being more than just friends. After trying to apologise to Whitney and telling her his mother made him carry a condom, he is threatened into leaving by Whitney's older brother [[Ryan Malloy]].

He returns in December 2009 when he bumps into Ricky in [[The Queen Victoria]], who thinks Todd may help Whitney take her mind off Tony's abuse trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a188215/roxys-furious-with-janine.html Digital Spy] {{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd goes to see Whitney to give her a Christmas card, saying he hopes they are still friends, and she lets him in. He cooks mince pies and says he wants to be a mechanic like Ricky. Whitney realises that Ricky has put him up to spending time with her but they later play darts together in the pub. However, the next time he invites her out, she turns him down and he embarrasses himself and leaves. Whitney starts ignoring Todd's calls, and she is upset when Ricky invites him to his and Bianca's engagement party on New Year's Eve. When he turns up, Whitney apologises and they kiss after midnight.

Todd and Whitney find Darren asleep on a park bench and help him, as he is freezing cold. Todd reveals he is a first aider. [[Lucy Beale]] invites Todd to a house party and he invites Whitney. At the party, Lucy comes onto Todd so Whitney takes him off to a bedroom. He tells her about a girl whose life he once saved when she was choking. They plan to have sex but then change their minds and decide to wait. At a meal with Whitney, Janine and Ryan, Ryan sarcastically makes fun of Todd's anecdotes. When Whitney's step-uncle [[Billie Jackson]] arrives for [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] and Ricky's wedding in February 2010, Whitney shows a clear interest in him and once again starts shunning Todd, much to his jealousy. As her feelings for Billie start to deepen, she breaks up with Todd, despite his pleading with her to give him another chance, telling her that he loves her and that he will get a [[motorbike]] like Billie if that will impress her, but she remains cold with him, and he leaves the Square in tears.

'''Trina Johnson''', played by [[Sharon Duncan Brewster]], is introduced as the wife of already established character [[Lucas Johnson]] and mother of his son [[Jordan Johnson (EastEnders)|Jordan]].

She first appears on 23 February 2009, unexpectedly to Lucas, Jordan and Lucas's fiancÃ©e [[Denise Wicks]]. At first, Lucas is shocked to see her and tells her that their marriage is over and that he is going to marry Denise. It is revealed that Trina is also a drug addict. After being warned by [[Patrick Trueman]] to stay away from them, she shockingly tells him that Lucas spent Christmas with her. She is not seen after this and when Patrick confronts Lucas, he says he has applied for a divorce.

Patrick sees Trina spying on Lucas and Denise kissing, on 19 June 2009. A week later, Lucas reveals to Denise he dislikes Trina because she was a bad mother to Jordan. When he was a baby, he was born addicted to heroin â the reason why she abandoned him. The following week, Trina reveals that Lucas spent Christmas with her, which prompts Denise to throw Lucas out.  After being rejected by Lucas, Trina is kicked out of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] by barmaid [[Roxy Mitchell]] for throwing a drink over [[Jack Branning]]. Trina goes to [[Pat Evans]]' house where Lucas is staying and comes downstairs in her underwear, asking Lucas to come back to bed, witnessed by Denise who has only just forgiven Lucas.

Trina plays a trick on Denise by telling the police that Denise is abusing Jordan. However, the social worker can find no evidence of abuse. Despite all of her plans to drive them further apart, Trina tells Lucas and Denise that she has agreed to a divorce. However, she also tells them that she is planning to relocate to Walford with Jordan. A few weeks later she returns during an exciting day for Denise's daughter [[Libby Fox]]. The family are planning to go to celebrate as Libby has a place to study at [[Oxford University]]. Trina turns up and Jordan is ecstatic, but Denise tells Lucas to get rid of her. Outside, he asks her if she is back on drugs to which she walked off, determined to have Lucas back. She sleeps with Lucas again and the next day arranges to meet him in the allotments. They meet in [[Charlie Slater]]'s shed but as she tries to seduce him he pushes her away and her throat is impaled on a rake. Lucas leaves the shed as she lies bleeding to death. She attempts to phone Denise but dies before the call connects. When Lucas goes in to check on her, he sees she is dead and hears Denise on the phone. He ends the call and assembles evidence around Trina to make it look like she died in an accident whilst taking drugs.

Her body is discovered on 14 September by Jordan and his friend [[Abi Branning]], with Lucas watching from a distance. Trina's death is pronounced as an accident by the police on 29 September 2009.

In October 2011, Duncan Brewster received a special mention at the Screen Nation Awards for her portrayal of Trina, which celebrate the best British Black talent.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/10/eastenders-nominated-for-scree.shtml|title=EastEnders nominated for Screen Nation Awards and MVSAs|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=6 November 2011|date=13 October 2011|first=Nickie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danielle was killed off in the show in April 2009. Joel has been mentioned several times since Ronnie joined the show in 2007, most notably when she attends a school reunion hoping he will be there, and then goes to his house to talk, but one of his daughters answers the door, so she leaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsjoel&quot;/&gt; Ronnie also writes him a letter to tell him their daughter died 13 years previously, although this was a lie told by her father [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]), and Joel writes back, but Archie destroys the letter before Ronnie can read it.

''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] said on Clerkin's casting: &quot;[He] is a delightful and subtle actor with a big funny bone. He's grabbed this enigmatic and rather odd character and made it his own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dsjoel&quot;/&gt; Clerkin said of Joel: &quot;[He] is a nice guy who fantasises about a future with an amazingly beautiful woman, so that's something a lot of men may relate to!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dsjoel&quot;/&gt;

===Storylines===
Joel's introduction to the show begins when [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) phones him after stealing Ronnie's address book. She invites him to [[The Queen Victoria]] public house and is served by Ronnie. Ronnie sees and recognises Joel when he turns around, and drops their drinks in shock. [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) sends both Joel and Janine out of the pub. Joel's car breaks down and while Ronnie offers to fix it for him, they both talk about the memories of their past and he is reacquainted by Archie who fixes his car. Before he leaves, Joel gives his business card to Ronnie. He and Ronnie later meet up and, although Ronnie discovers a picture of his wife and children, they have sex. Archie warns Joel off the next day and gives him money to stay away from Ronnie. Ronnie goes to his office to ask why he has stopped speaking to her and discovers what Archie did. She tells him to meet her in The Queen Victoria, but Stephanie turns up with their daughters instead to warn Ronnie off him. Ronnie visits Joel's house and forces him to choose between her and his wife. Joel chooses Ronnie and stays with her at The Queen Victoria. Their happiness is then ruined by Ronnie's sister, [[Roxy Mitchell|Roxy]] ([[Rita Simons]]), who reveals that their daughter died four months ago, rather than years ago as he believed. Roxy urges Joel to ask Ronnie about Danielle. He comforts Ronnie, telling her he wishes he could have been there for her. Ronnie tells people she and Joel are trying for a baby, though Joel is unaware that she is trying to get pregnant. When she thinks she is pregnant, he shocks her by telling her he had a [[vasectomy]]. Ronnie says he lied to her, but he says he could not find the time to tell her. She admits she is only with him to get pregnant and throws him out. He tells Ronnie that she is &quot;dead on the inside&quot; and walks away with Danielle's locket, which Ronnie had thrown out of her bedroom window.

She returns the money Charlie gave her and leaves Walford on 4 September 2009 along with the man she was seen with.

After her departure, Tamm told entertainment website [[Digital Spy]]: &quot;I absolutely loved [being in ''EastEnders'']. It's the Russian background [that got me the role]. My mother, despite spending most of her life in Estonia, was actually Russian. The director I worked with on ''EastEnders'' directed me on ''[[Brookside]]'' and he'd remembered this Russian background so that's why he cast me â because they love to have authenticity where possible. It was great to do and they were all lovely â very friendly and welcoming. It was a very happy experience and I absolutely loved it. Hopefully they'll ask me back, which would be nice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a183185/tamm-hopes-for-eastenders-return.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Tamm hopes for 'EastEnders' return|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|coauthor=Rawson-Jones, Ben|date=22 October 2009|accessdate=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Michael Trott''' is the son of [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]) and [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]), named after his mother's favourite singer, [[George Michael]]. He is born in the show, in the episode broadcast on 20 October 2009, though it was actually set three days later. Heather discovers she is pregnant in May 2009, which comes as a shock to her as she is 41 years old. She decides to keep the identity of the father a close secret, however, the possible fathers are Darren, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]) and [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a179162/poll-whos-the-daddy-revisited.html|title=Poll: 'Who's The Daddy?' Revisited|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After George is born, Darren gets used to having a son and continues to provide for him. In July 2010, Heather makes plans to have George christened. He is christened in September 2010; his godparents are [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]), [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and Minty Peterson. In February 2011, Heather suffers financial problems and suffers [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] from her faulty boiler. She is unable to look after George and leaves him with Darren as she feels he is better off there. Darren's fiancÃ©e [[Jodie Gold]] ([[Kylie Babbington]]) soon gives Darren an ultimatum, and when Darren struggles with George on his own, he returns George to Heather.When Darren announces he is moving away from Walford, he asks Heather to take good care of George, and gives her some money. The money enables Heather and George to move into their own flat.

===Creation and development===
[[Cheryl Fergison]], who plays Heather, revealed to entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] how the crew attempted to make Heather's waters breaking appear realistic: &quot;We had several ideas about balloons and gloves filled with water. In the end, I had this balloon between my legs and burst it with my nutcracker thighs. You just see this huge gush! I have to admit, I don't remember a gush myself, but in true ''EastEnders'' style, we have a water display! It's all a bit of a shocker and everyone starts panicking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dsoctober09&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a181024/cheryl-fergison-heather-trott-eastenders.html|title=Cheryl Fergison (Heather Trott, 'EastEnders')|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heather then decides to tell the father about the baby. Fergison commented, &quot;This is where I think the writing's been really clever. When you watch it, you'll see what I mean. They have the suspects â Minty, Phil, Darren and Billy â and all their phones ring. Heather leaves a voicemail on the daddy's phone to let them know that they've become a dad. There are several cuts to all the various suspects and you see each of them flying to the hospital...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dsoctober09&quot;/&gt; The father was revealed to be Darren, played by [[Charlie G. Hawkins]].

Before the father was revealed on screen, Hawkins gave an interview in which he talked about what would happen if Darren was the father: &quot;It would change everything. Darren would worry that [his girlfriend] [[Libby Fox|Libby]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]) wouldn't marry him â and what about Libby's parents [[Denise Wicks|Denise]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and [[Owen Turner|Owen]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]])? I think he'd be alright as a dad, but he wouldn't want the burden. It'd rock the boat if it was Darren.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a182120/hawkins-darren-as-dad-would-rock-boat.html|title=Hawkins: 'Darren as dad would rock boat'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darren was revealed to be the father of George in the episode broadcast on 23 October 2009. Fergison told Digital Spy, &quot;Darren will be a good dad but he'll be very businesslike about it. He'll say that he doesn't really want to have anything to do with George but will pay his way for him. You'll see him change, though, and you'll start to see him getting attached. [Heather's friend] [[Shirley Carter|Shirley]] ([[Linda Henry]]) doesn't want Darren to go anywhere near George, though! It'll be interesting to see how they write it from here for Darren, especially with the Libby angle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a183266/whos-the-daddy-darren-miller-thats-who.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Who's The Daddy?

In December 2009, executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] was asked by entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] if there were plans for Kim and Dexter to return. He said, &quot;There's nothing currently storylined for Kim and Dexter, but they really caught my eye. I know they've caught [future executive producer] [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan [Kirkwood's]]] eye, too, because we were only talking about them recently. They work brilliantly with the rest of the family. I hope that if the actors are up for it and if me or Bryan find the right moment, we'll see them again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dssanter&quot;/&gt;

When Jean asks Stacey to come home for one day, Becca tries to convince her not to go. The next day, Jean and Stacey's boyfriend [[Bradley Branning]] come to collect Stacey, and Becca and Stacey say an emotional goodbye. Stacey visits her on 19 January 2010 and Becca reveals she is coming out of hospital soon but will be living in Brent Cross meaning it will be difficult for Stacey and Becca to see each other, as they want to stay in touch. Stacey later texts her, inviting her to stay in Albert Square.

When she arrives, she wants to meet everyone that Stacey has told her about, including [[Max Branning]], Bradley's father who Stacey once had an affair with when she was previously married to Bradley. Later, Becca wants to take Stacey out but Bradley does not think she should be going out as she is pregnant. Becca asks Bradley if she is welcome there but he does not answer. In the pub, Becca tells Stacey the doctors thought it was too soon for her to come out and wonders if she should go back. She asks Stacey to call her a taxi. The next day, Stacey will not eat anything, so Bradley brings Becca back to stay and Stacey cheers up. Bradley allows Becca to sleep upstairs in his bed as she is paranoid about [[Archie Mitchell]]'s murderer living on the Square. Becca tells Bradley that Stacey has told her about Archie, but Stacey assures Bradley that Becca does not know that Archie raped Stacey and that Bradley punched him on Christmas Day. Later, Stacey tells Becca not to say anything about Christmas or Stacey's baby. However, when Stacey auditions for a barmaid job, she goes to drink a cocktail and Becca reveals to everyone that Stacey is pregnant. The next day, Becca and Stacey look for jobs. Becca suggests opening a stall on the market, but Stacey says the market inspector, [[List of EastEnders characters (2008)#Mr Lister|Mr Lister]], hates her. They ask Mr Lister for a chance but he says no. Becca comes up with a plan, steals a suit from the laundrette and dresses up as a businesswoman. She puts on a posh accent and pretends to be from Walford Council, telling Mr Lister that Stacey has lodged a complaint against him and making legal threats, using the name Amanda Swanson. Becca returns the suit and as Stacey and Becca work on their new stall, Mr Lister tells Becca that her 'sister' can stuff her human rights.

Becca starts to think that Stacey does not want her around and thinks that Bradley and Stacey are planning something, but Stacey insists it is not about her. She steals [[Ronnie Mitchell]]'s hairbrush from [[The Queen Victoria]] and tells Stacey that she can take a DNA test to prove the baby is Archie's. Becca is upset when she is not invited to Bradley and Stacey's wedding and thinks that Bradley hates her. Bradley makes things worse when, after Becca says that he cannot take her best friend away from her, he tells Becca that they are planning to move. Becca tries to sneak the hairbrush back into Ronnie's room but Ronnie catches her and Becca tells her that Archie raped Stacey, leading to Stacey's discovery that Archie was infertile. Becca then calls the police about Bradley. Bradley and Stacey flee, but police chase him to a rooftop. Becca watches as Bradley falls from the roof of The Queen Victoria to his death. After visiting him in the chapel of rest, Stacey runs away and Becca and Jean try all they can to find her. Becca gets an address from Max of a flat they used during their affair, but after failing to find her, she decides to places an advertisement for Bradley's funeral service in the ''Walford Gazette'' in the hope that Stacey will see it and come to the funeral. On the day of the funeral, Jean prepares a dress for Stacey, but Becca wears it, which leaves Jean furious, and she says Stacey and Bradley were happy until Becca arrived. Stacey fails to turn up at the funeral. Becca comforts Max after the funeral, he is unable to resist her attempt to seduce him, so they kiss.

The next day Max tells her it was a mistake but she attempts to seduce him by stealing his daughter [[Abi Branning|Abi]]'s keys and laying naked on his kitchen table covered in cream and fruit. He tells her to get dressed and get out. However, after Max and the Slaters visit the body of a girl found in a river believed to be Stacey, Becca and Max have sex. Becca gets a phone call and leaves in a hurry, so a suspicious Max follows her to a flat where Stacey is staying. Max convinces Stacey to return home, and she and Becca decide to bring up the baby together after she tells Becca that Archie is not the father.

Refusing to allow Stacey to work on the stall due to her pregnancy, Becca comes up with a plan to make more profit. She askes [[Mo Harris]] to buy [[Whitney Dean]]'s stock of t-shirts that [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] has promised to sell for her, then sells them on her own stall. She then tells Fatboy she had no idea the t-shirts came from Whitney and flirts with him. They eat chips together and when Fatboy says he has ideas for t-shirt designs for Whitney's stall, Becca asks to see them. He gives her a design so she has several t-shirts printed up, but fails to sell them and is humiliated when she realises that the design reads &quot;[[chav]]&quot; in the mirror.

Following the birth of Stacey's child, [[Lily Branning|Lily]], Becca grows increasingly paranoid of people trying to interfere with Stacey's life, leading her to accost Ryan Malloy when he shows up at the Slater house with a bouquet for Stacey. Becca is further devastated when Stacey throws her out of her room, as she thinks it is too crowded for Stacey, Lily and Becca at the same time. Becca starts to manipulate Stacey by deleting a message from Max about the scattering of Bradley's ashes, and then telling her that having his ashes is spooky, causing her to not want to go. She convinces Stacey to stop taking her medication and lies about Jean in order to cause a rift between mother and daughter. When Jean confronts Becca, she says if it was not for her, Stacey would be with a murderer, revealing that she was the person who called the police about Bradley. She tells Jean that if Stacey finds out, it will make her condition worse. Jean tells Stacey and Becca denies it, but Stacey says Jean has never lied to her, so Becca admits the truth saying Bradley was a killer. Stacey hits Becca so she picks up the urn containing Bradley's ashes and throws it at the wall. Jean then tells Becca to leave.

Qadim is introduced when Amira visits him in prison. They hug and he says he wants to make up for lost time. She tells him she and her boyfriend [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliott]]) are back together and are now engaged. Qadim is instantly furious and refuses to give them his blessing. Amira later takes money for the wedding from his safety deposit box without him knowing, using a key she has hidden inside a photo album.

On the day of Amira and Syed's [[Mehndi celebration]], Amira receives a call saying Qadim's lawyer has found a loophole in the law meaning that Qadim can be released. After his release, he interrupts the Mehndi. The next day, Syed's mother [[Zainab Masood|Zainab]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) is angry at his actions and Amira is forced to reveal that Qadim has not given his blessing and that she stole the money. Qadim arrives at the Masoods' home and says that Syed does not love Amira and will break her heart. Syed tells him they took his money but Amira interrupts and says it was her idea. Qadim orders her to pack her bags but she defies him and Syed says they will pay back the money. Qadim says angrily says he expects the money the next day in cash and leaves. He returns on the day of the wedding and talks to Amira. When he realises how much Masood has done for her, he gives his blessing and agrees to pay for the wedding.

Qadim returns as a guest at Syed and Amira's house warming party on 23 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher= BBC Press Office|date= 1 April 2010|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2010/wk16/fri.shtml#fri_eastenders|title= Network TV BBC Week 16: Friday 23 April 2010|accessdate= 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Syed reveals that he is gay and has been seeing [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]]). Qadim attacks Syed, saying he warned Amira not to marry him. After Amira packs her bags, Qadim takes her home with him. He returns days later with two associates, looking for Syed. Masood tells them he has been unable to contact him. They then break into Christian's flat and wait for him. When he arrives, Qadim demands to know where Syed is and refuses to believe him when he says he does not know. They then beat him up and leave.

In 2011, Syed and Christian decide to find Amira so Syed can get a divorce. They feel the only way to do so is to find Qadim first, but Zainab forbids it as he wanted to kill them both. Zainab's ex-husband and father of her daughter-in-law, [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), tells Zainab it may be a good idea to find Amira anyway. He then visits Qadim and says that if Syed can believe he is getting his way, then Yusef will be able to avenge Qadim's humiliation. It is revealed that Qadim has been keeping Amira prisoner in her own home. Amira secretly meets up with Syed, and introduces hers and Syed's daughter, [[Yasmin Masood|Yasmin]] to the Masood family. When Yusef phones Qadim and tells him that Amira is at the Masood's house, he storms round there and demands that Amira and Yasmin return with him. Amira refuses, and Qadim leaves stating that Amira is no longer his daughter. The next day he sends round all of Amira and Yasmin's belongings to the Masood house.

Afia is a friend of [[#Bushra Abbasi|Bushra Abbasi]]'s ([[Pooja Ghai]]) daughter [[#Zulekha Abbasi|Zulekha Abbasi]] ([[Lisa Shah]]). Afia's mother is abroad so Bushra lets Afia stay with her. She attends [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliott]]) and [[Amira Shah]]'s ([[Preeya Kalidas]]) [[Mehndi celebration]], with Bushra and Zulekha. Zulekha gives [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) Afia's mobile number, though he thinks it is Zulekha's, and arranges a date. He is surprised when Afia turns up instead, and she says he is cute in a &quot;[[geek chic]]&quot; way. At Syed and Amira's wedding, Afia gives Tamwar some contact lenses, saying Zulekha might prefer him without his glasses. He confesses to her that he has never kissed a girl &quot;properly&quot;, so she proposes if he puts the contacts in, she will give him lessons. They end up kissing more than once. However, Tamwar tells her he is a student at [[Oxford University]] and she is told by Bushra that he is not. Despite this, she was willing to stay with him until he refuses to laugh at the situation, at which point she dumps him. Afia's mother dies off screen.

Several months later in 2010, she contacts Tamwar and they meet up. They spend time kissing at Tamwar's house while his parents, [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) and [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) are out. They insist nothing went on, and Zainab and Masood arrange a dinner to get to know Afia better. Afia lies to them that her father, [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), is a surgeon, when in actual fact he is a [[General Practitioner|GP]]. Tamwar meets Afia and her father in a restaurant where Tamwar believes Yusef will think he is not good enough for his daughter, but says she is amazing. Yusef accepts Tamwar as his lack of wealth is unimportant to him but he obviously cares about Afia. When Yusef meets Zainab and Masood, it is revealed he is Zainab's ex-husband whose family set her on fire for infidelity. On this discovery, Tamwar tells Afia they cannot see each other again. The next day Afia visits Tamwar and tries to persuade him to reconsider. Tamwar refuses, saying he has to respect the will of his parents. Syed arranges for Afia to see Tamwar again, and they spend time alone together. However, Masood discovers this and again bans Tamwar from seeing her. Tamwar and Afia continue to see each other and Tamwar tries to tell his parents this on their anniversary but does not want to ruin their day so instead, [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) pretends he was meeting Afia to sell her a car. However, at the opening of the Masoods' new restaurant, the Argee Bhajee, Afia turns up having been invited by Tamwar. Tamwar is again forbidden from seeing her, so says he will move out so he no longer has to live by his parents' rules. Eventually, Zainab is told by [[Denise Johnson]] ([[Diane Parish]]) that they will force the couple together by forbidding their relationship, so Zainab and Masood agree to let them see each other in the hope that it will fizzle out naturally.

Afia prepares to tell Yusef that she and Tamwar are still together but before she can, he hands her a round the world ticket. Afia refuses it and tells him that she is still with Tamwar and wants to stay with him. Afia turns up for dinner with Tamwar's family at, but only Zainab turns up. Zainab starts to take a liking to Afia but when Jane persuades Masood to turn up, Afia starts talking about Yusef which upsets Zainab. Back at the house, Masood tells Afia to dump Tamwar as the thought of Yusef is upsetting Zainab. She then leaves, telling Tamwar that her dad had just rung and wanted her home. Afia then accepts the ticket from Yusef. However, when Tamwar finds out, he asks Masood to convince Yusef that he is good enough for Afia. Yusef visits and Tamwar reveals he and Afia have been seeing each other for a few weeks, so Yusef gives his blessing for them to marry. Although they are happy, Masood and Zainab do not want Yusef to become part of their family.

When Zulekha tells Masood that Afia could have any man she wants, he accuses Afia of lying that she is not a virgin. Afia fears that everything will be ruined, so she and Tamwar marry in secret on the night before their mangni (engagement party). Masood later realises his mistake and Zulekha apologises to Afia at the mangni. Tamwar is about to tell his family that they are already married when they are interrupted by Syed's entrance and the roof collapsing. They then decide against telling anyone as Tamwar's parents are facing financial difficulties. Afia and Yusef make the move to Albert Square.  However, when Afia and Tamwar learn that Masood kidnapped Yusef and threatened him, this leads to Masood being banned from the couple's mehndi, causing a strain between Tamwar and his father. However, at the mehndi, Tamwar and Afia admit their secret marriage to the family (including Masood who turns up uninvited), and the couple begin living with each other at the Masood family home. Although Yusef moves out, he later moves back after lying to Zainab that it is not safe for her on her own. Afia tells Yusef that he will bring shame on her by being in a relationship with Zainab as it will make Afia and Tamwar [[mahram]] to each other, so Yusef then an [[imam]] and reports to Afia that it would be acceptable for him to marry Zainab, and only [[Allah]] can judge them, so Afia reluctantly accepts the relationship. Afia's relative [[List of EastEnders characters (2011)#Tariq|Tariq]] (Antony Bunsee) arrives and her father says that he will give him the Argee Bargee. Tariq tells this to Afia and she says it doesn't belong to her father, leading to Tariq telling Afia that Yusef started the fire.
