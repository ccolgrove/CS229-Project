{{2005 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''2005 Iowa Hawkeyes football team''' represented the [[University of Iowa]] during the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005 college football season]]. The Hawkeyes played their home games at [[Kinnick Stadium]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[Iowa]] and were coached by [[Kirk Ferentz]]. 

Iowa finished the season 7-5, including a record of 5-3 in the [[Big Ten Conference]].  Despite an up-and-down season, the Hawkeyes were invited to a January [[bowl game]] in [[Florida]] for the fourth consecutive year.

==Preseason==
{{see also|2004 Iowa Hawkeyes football team}}
Coming off a 10-2 season that included a thrilling last second [[2005 Capital One Bowl]] victory over [[2004 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], expectations were high.  With the return of first-team All-Big Ten quarterback [[Drew Tate]], the Hawkeyes were considered national title contenders by some publications. Indeed, the addition of a running game (which the Hawkeyes lacked in 2004 due to injuries) was thought to make Iowa even stronger.  The Hawkeyes entered the season ranked 11th, their highest preseason ranking in two decades.

The game ended in controversy.  Iowa kicked a field goal in the 4th quarter, which brought the game to a one possession lead by Florida.  Iowa attempted an onside kick, and recovered the ball.  However, flags were down, with the call being offsides against Iowa, giving the ball back to Florida.  However, replays clearly showed no one offsides, even being pointed out by commentators.  &quot;Challenges&quot; were not allowed in college football at this time, so Iowa had no way of arguing the bad call.
