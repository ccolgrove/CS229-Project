'''Albert William &quot;Al&quot; Kaline''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|k|eÉª|l|aÉª|n}}; born December 19, 1934 in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[right fielder]]. He is a member of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=br_stats&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Kaline Statistics and History|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kalinal01.shtml|publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hof_bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Kaline biography|url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/kaline-al|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaline played his entire 22-year baseball career with the [[Detroit Tigers]].&lt;ref name=br_stats/&gt; Kaline still works for the Tigers as a front office official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Kaline - Special Assistant to the President|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/team/team_frontoffice_bio.jsp?loc=al_kaline|publisher=Detroit Tigers|accessdate=7 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60lmtKvQB|archivedate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his lengthy career and longtime association with the Tigers organization, Kaline's nickname is &quot;Mr. Tiger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six: A Salute to Al Kaline|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100325&amp;content_id=8922348&amp;vkey=pr_det&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=det|publisher=Detroit Tigers|accessdate=7 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60ln45cv0|archivedate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of his career, Kaline played in the [[outfield]], mainly as a [[right fielder]], where he was known for his strong throwing arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Kaline|url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/kalinal01|publisher=The Baseball Page.com|accessdate=7 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60lnEGhYH|archivedate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the end of his career, he also played as [[first baseman]] and, in his last season, was the Tigers' [[designated hitter]].

==Major League Baseball career==
[[Image:A Kaline at bat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Kaline in 1957]]
Kaline bypassed the [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] system and joined the team directly from Baltimore's [[Southern High School (Baltimore)|Southern High School]] as an 18-year-old &quot;[[Bonus Rule|bonus baby]]&quot; signee, receiving $35,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1953|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} to sign with the Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Official Profile, Photo and Data Book|year=1957|publisher=Detroit Tigers|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigers Pay $95,000 Bonus Money For School Hurler and Outfielder|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10F63D5B177B93C1AB178DD85F478585F9#|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=October 2, 2008|date=June 23, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his major league debut on June 25, [[1953 Detroit Tigers season|1953]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] as a late-inning replacement for outfielder [[Jim Delsing]]. Kaline wore No. 25 during his rookie campaign, but asked teammate [[Pat Mullin]] for his No. 6 after the 1953 season ended. Kaline, who was also known simply as &quot;Six&quot; in the Tiger clubhouse, wore the number for the rest of his major league playing career. 

In [[1955 Detroit Tigers season|1955]], at age 20, Kaline ended the season with a .340 [[batting average]], becoming the youngest player ever to win the [[American League]] [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1907, Tiger hall-of-famer [[Ty Cobb]] had become the first to win an American League batting title at age 20. Although Cobb was born on December 18, whereas Kaline was born on December 19, the fact of 1900 not having been a leap year leads to Kaline and Cobb having been equivalent numbers of days old on corresponding dates of the years in which each won his batting title. However, as the 1907 baseball season concluded some days later in the year than the 1955 season did, Kaline secured his title at an age a few days younger than Cobb secured his.

Although he had missed two months of the [[1968 Detroit Tigers season|1968]] season with a [[Bone fracture|broken arm]], he returned to the [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]] when Tiger manager [[Mayo Smith]] benched [[shortstop]] [[Ray Oyler]] and sent center fielder [[Mickey Stanley]] to play shortstop to make room for Kaline in the outfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Baseball Biography Project: Al Kaline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=1902&amp;pid=7253|title=The Baseball Biography Project: Al Kaline|last=Waddell|first=Nick|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN]] later called Smith's move one of the ten greatest coaching decisions of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest coaching decisions|url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/coaches.html|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[1968 World Series]], the [[1968 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] had won three of the first four games of the series and were leading Game 5 by a score of 3â2 in the seventh inning, when Kaline hit a [[bases loaded]] [[Single (baseball)|single]] to drive in two [[Run (baseball)|runs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET196810070.shtml 1968 World Series Game 5 box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tigers went on to win the next two games to win their first world championship since [[1945 Detroit Tigers season|1945]]. In his only World Series appearance, Kaline hit .379 with two home runs and eight RBIs in seven games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1968_WS.shtml 1968 World Series at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, [[1974 Detroit Tigers season|1974]], Kaline became the 12th player in Major League Baseball history to reach the [[3000 hit club|3000 hit]] plateau, when he hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]] off the Orioles' [[Dave McNally]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/3000_hit_club/kaline_al.htm 3000 hit club at the Baseball Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/boxscore/09241974.shtml September 24, 1974 Tigers-Orioles box score at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL197409240.shtml September 24, 1974 Tigers-Orioles box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Kaline finished his career with 3,007&amp;nbsp;hits (25th on the all-time list), 399 home runs (a Tigers record and 43rd on the all-time list) and 1583 RBIs.&lt;ref name=br_stats/&gt; He batted over .300 nine times in his career to finish with a lifetime batting average of .297 and, while never considered a true power hitter, he hit 25&amp;nbsp;or more home runs seven times in his career.&lt;ref name=br_stats/&gt;

Kaline was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1980|1980]], becoming the tenth player in history to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.&lt;ref name=hof_bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=145 Al Kaline â the Detroit Tigers' 'Mr. Perfection']&lt;/ref&gt; Kaline was honored by the Tigers as the first of their players to have his uniform number (6) retired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/det/history/retired_numbers.jsp Detroit Tigers retired numbers at mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Versatile and well-rounded, he won ten [[Gold Glove Award]]s (1957â59 and 1961â67) for excellence in the field and appeared in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] game for fifteen seasons (1955â67, 1971, 1974).&lt;ref name=br_stats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#1957 Gold Glove Award winners at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In {{By|1998}}, he ranked Number 76 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml Sporting News 100 Greatest (1998)] [retrieved October 10, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ Al Kaline at The Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball Players]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp Al Kaline at The Major League Baseball All-Century Team]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cherry Street, which ran behind the left-field stands at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], was renamed Kaline Drive in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Baseball Biography Project: Al Kaline&quot;/&gt; Later that year, on September 27, 1999, when the team played its last game at Tiger Stadium, Kaline was invited to appear in uniform and present the last lineup card to the umpires. He did so along with [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]], considered one of the greatest players ever for the Tigers' opponents that day. [[Baltimore Oriole]] third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]] said of him, ''&quot;There have been a lot of great defensive players. The fella who could do everything is Al Kaline. He was just the epitome of what a great outfielder is all about â great speed, catches the ball and throws the ball well.â''&lt;ref name=hof_bio/&gt; With earlier legend [[Ty Cobb]] having been more respected and feared than loved,&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/dirtiest/players.html Reader's Poll: Dirtiest Pro Players at ESPN.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Kaline is the probably most popular player ever to play for the Tigers, and possibly the most popular athlete in [[Detroit]] history, as he is remembered as much for being a true gentleman as he is for being a superb athlete.

After his playing career, Kaline lived in the Detroit area, and has remained active within the Tigers organization, serving first as a [[color commentator]] on the team's [[television]] broadcasts (1975â2002) mostly with play by play announcer and former Tiger [[George Kell]], and then later as a consultant to the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Baseball Biography Project: Al Kaline&quot;/&gt; Since 2003, Kaline has served as a special assistant to Tigers President/CEO/General Manager [[Dave Dombrowski]],&lt;ref name=&quot;The Baseball Biography Project: Al Kaline&quot;/&gt; and his duties include coaching/mentoring outfielders during spring training.&lt;ref&gt;Gage, Tom. &quot;Tigers 'lifer' Al Kaline stays in background but still commands attention.&quot; ''Detroit News'', February 23, 2011. [http://detnews.com/article/20110223/SPORTS0104/102230318/1129/rss15]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Tigers teammate [[Willie Horton (baseball)|Willie Horton]] also holds this position, and the two threw out the first pitch of the [[2006 World Series]] at [[Comerica Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Baseball Biography Project: Al Kaline&quot;/&gt;

In the Nickelodeon cartoon ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', there is a famous baseball player by the name of &quot;Mickey Kaline&quot;, whose name would be a mixture of both legendary baseball players Al Kaline and [[Mickey Mantle]]

Kaline is an active golfer, playing multiple times per week. On May 24, 2008, Kaline hit a hole-in-one at [[Oakland Hills Country Club]].
