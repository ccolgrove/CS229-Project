'''TV2''' is a national television network in [[New Zealand]], which is owned and operated by the state-owned broadcaster [[TVNZ]]. It targets a younger audience than its sister network, [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]]. TV2's line up consists of dramas, sitcoms, and reality shows, most of which are produced in New Zealand or imported from the [[United States]].

==History==
TV2 was formed following the dissolution of the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1975, and is a sister station to TV1 which took over the AKTV2 and CHTV3 stations in [[Auckland]] and [[Christchurch]]. It began broadcasting in those cities on 30 June of that year, but did not begin broadcasting in [[Wellington]] until that November.

TV2 opened with a Telethon for the St John Ambulance Service. As there was only one national link, and TV One had priority, TV2 used the link overnight to feed the next day's programmes between Auckland and Christchurch so they could be broadcast simultaneously.
In 1976 TV2 was renamed [[South Pacific Television]], and along with TV One and [[Radio New Zealand]] it became part of the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ) in 1977.

In 1980, South Pacific Television (which reverted to its original name of TV2) and TV One merged to form [[Television New Zealand]], with the promise of 'complementary programming'.
In 1981, tenders were called for the supply of programmes for TV2's morning slot. The following year Northern Television began producing programmes as the first private enterprise TV broadcaster in the country. In 1983 Northern TV was forced to close due to high costs and low advertising revenue.

The [[New Zealand National Party|National]] government debated selling off TV2 to a private enterprise in 1983, but this did not happen. In 1988 the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government dissolved BCNZ, and deregulated the broadcasting market. With the launch of [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] in 1989, TV2 (now rebranded 'Channel 2') moved away from complementary programming and repositioned itself as an entertainment channel, leaving more serious programming to TV One. In 1995 Channel 2 reverted to its old name, TV2.

On 22 September 2007, TV2 went into 16:9 widescreen on [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview]] 24 hours a day.

On 2 September 2010, TV2 changed from broadcasting in [[720p]] [[High-definition video|high definition]] to [[1080i]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Programming==
===News programming===
News and sport is usually catered for by sister channel [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]]. However, the channel does feature one news show, ''[[20/20 (New Zealand television series)|20/20]]'', which borrows the format and some of the stories from the [[American Broadcasting Company]] in the [[United States]], the program's originator. TV2 once featured headline updates at the top of the hour, but these were discontinued in 2002 also TV2 had its own late night news called News Night during the mid-nineties hosted by Marcus Lush. TV2 does broadcast headlines for the ''[[One News (New Zealand)|ONE News]]'' bulletin at 5:00pm and 5:30pm.
