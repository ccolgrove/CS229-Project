'''Windows 98''' ([[Microsoft codenames|codenamed]] '''Memphis''')&lt;!--please add the citation also in Windows Nashville!--&gt; is a graphical [[operating system]] by [[Microsoft]]. It is the second major release in the [[Windows 9x]] line of operating systems. It was released to manufacturing on 15 May 1998 and to retail on 25 June 1998. Windows 98 is the successor to [[Windows 95]]. Like its predecessor, it is a hybrid [[16-bit application|16-bit]]/[[32-bit application|32-bit]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pre-multi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/117567/EN-US/|title=How 16-Bit and 32-Bit Programs Multitask in Windows 95 |publisher=support.microsoft.com |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; monolithic product with an [[MS-DOS]] based [[Booting|boot loader]].&lt;ref name=&quot;w95-archi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc751120.aspx |lang=en|title=Windows 95 Architecture Components|publisher=technet.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 98 was succeeded by Windows 98 Second Edition on 5 May 1999, then by [[Windows Me]] (Millennium Edition) on 14 September 2000. Microsoft support for Windows 98 ended on 11 July 2006.

==Web integration and shell enhancements==
Windows 98 includes [[Internet Explorer 4|Internet Explorer 4.01]]. Besides Internet Explorer, many other internet companion applications are included such as [[Outlook Express]], [[Windows Address Book]], [[FrontPage Express]], [[Microsoft Chat]], [[Microsoft Personal Web Server|Personal Web Server]] and a Web Publishing Wizard, [[NetMeeting]] and [[NetShow|NetShow Player]] (in the original release of Windows 98) which was replaced by [[Windows Media Player]] 6.2 in Windows 98 Second Edition.

The Windows 98 [[Windows shell|shell]] includes all of the enhancements from [[Windows Desktop Update]], an Internet Explorer 4 component, such as the Quick Launch toolbar, deskbands, [[Active Desktop]], [[Active Channel|Channels]], ability to minimize foreground windows by clicking their button on the taskbar, single click launching, Back and Forward navigation buttons, favorites, and address bar in [[Windows Explorer]], image thumbnails, folder infotips and web view in folders, and folder customization through [[HTML]]-based templates.

Windows 98 also integrates shell enhancements, themes and other features from [[Microsoft Plus!|Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95]] such as [[DriveSpace]] 3, Compression Agent, Dial-Up Networking Server, Dial-Up Scripting Tool and [[Task Scheduler]]. [[Full Tilt! Pinball#3D Pinball for Windows: Space Cadet|3D Pinball]] is included on the CD-ROM but not installed by default. Windows 98 had its own separately purchasable Plus! pack called [[Microsoft Plus!#Microsoft Plus.21_98|Plus! 98]].

Title bars of windows and dialog boxes support two-color [[Color gradient|gradients]]. Windows 98 menus and tooltips support slide animation. Windows Explorer in Windows 98, like [[Windows 95]], converts all uppercase filenames to [[Sentence case]] for readability purposes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.08.windowsconfidential.aspx Windows 'Prettified' Filenames]&lt;/ref&gt; however, it also provides an option ''Allow all uppercase names'' to display them in their original case. Windows Explorer includes support for compressed [[Cabinet (file format)|CAB]] files. The ''Quick Res'' and ''Telephony Location Manager'' Windows 95 PowerToys are integrated.

==Improvements to hardware support==
===Windows Driver Model===
{{Main|Windows Driver Model}}
Windows 98 was the first operating system to use the [[Windows Driver Model]] (WDM). This fact was not well publicised when Windows 98 was released, and most hardware producers continued to develop drivers for the older [[VxD]] driver standard, which Windows 98 also supported. The WDM standard only achieved widespread adoption years later, mostly through [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]], as they are not compatible with the older VxD standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244601/ &quot;You cannot use virtual device driver (.vxd) files common to Windows 98 or Windows 95 drivers with Windows 2000.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Driver Model was introduced largely so that developers would write [[source code compatibility|source compatible]] drivers for all future versions of Windows. Device driver access in WDM is actually implemented through a [[VxD]] device driver, &lt;tt&gt;NTKERN.VXD&lt;/tt&gt; which implements several [[Windows NT]]-specific kernel support functions. NTKERN creates [[I/O request packet|IRPs]] and sends them to WDM drivers.

Support for WDM audio enables digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams and [[kernel streaming]] with high quality [[sample rate conversion]] on Windows 98. WDM Audio allows for software emulation of legacy hardware to support MS-DOS games, [[DirectSound]] support and [[MIDI]] [[Sample-based synthesis|wavetable sythesis]]. A Microsoft [[Roland GS|GS]] Wavetable Synthesizer licensed from [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] shipped with Windows 98 for WDM audio drivers. Windows 98 supports digital playback of [[Compact Disc|audio CD]]s, and the Second Edition improves WDM audio support by adding DirectSound [[hardware mixing]] and DirectSound 3D hardware abstraction, [[DirectMusic]] kernel support, [[Windows legacy audio components#KMixer|KMixer]] sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams and multichannel audio support. All audio is sampled by the Kernel Mixer to a fixed sampling rate which may result in some audio getting upsampled or downsampled and having a high latency, except when using Kernel Streaming or third party audio paths like [[Audio Stream Input/Output|ASIO]] which allow unmixed audio streams and lower latency. Windows 98 also includes a WDM streaming [[class driver]] (''Stream.sys'') to address real time multimedia data stream processing requirements and a WDM kernel-mode video transport for enhanced video playback and capture.

Windows Driver Model also includes [[Broadcast Driver Architecture]], the backbone for TV technologies support in Windows. [[WebTV]] for Windows utilized BDA to allow viewing television on the computer if a [[Broadcast Driver Architecture|compatible]] [[TV tuner card]] is installed. TV listings could updated from the Internet and WaveTop Data Broadcasting allowed extra data about broadcasts to be received via regular television signals using an antenna or cable, by embedding data streams into the [[vertical blanking interval]] (VBI) portion of existing broadcast television signals.

===USB===
Windows 98 had more robust [[USB]] support (e.g.  support for [[Universal Serial Bus#Overview|USB composite devices]]) than Windows 95 which only had support in OEM versions (OSR2.1 or later).&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/253756 Availability of Universal Serial Bus Support in  Windows 95]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 98 supports [[USB hub]]s, USB scanners and imaging class devices. Windows 98 also introduces built-in support for some [[USB Human Interface Device class]] (USB HID) and PID class devices such as USB mice, keyboards, force feedback joysticks etc. including additional keyboard functions through a certain number of Consumer Page HID controls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/w2kbd.mspx Enhanced Keyboards and Windows]&lt;/ref&gt;

USB audio device class support is present from Windows 98 SE onwards. Windows 98 Second Edition also introduced support for WDM for modems (and therefore USB modems and virtual [[COM (hardware interface)|COM]] ports). Microsoft driver support for both USB printers, and for [[USB mass-storage device class]] is not available for Windows 98; support for both was introduced in [[Windows 2000]]; however generic third party free drivers are available today for USB MSC devices.

===ACPI===
Windows 98 introduced [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] 1.0 support which enabled ''Standby'' (ACPI S3) and ''[[Hibernation (computing)|Hibernate]]'' (ACPI S4) states. However, hibernation support was extremely limited, and vendor-specific. Hibernation was only available if compatible (PnP) hardware and [[BIOS]] are present, and the hardware manufacturer or OEM supplied compatible [[Windows Driver Model|WDM]] drivers, non-[[VxD]] drivers. However, there are hibernation issues with the [[FAT32]] file system,&lt;ref name=&quot;98I/O&quot;/&gt; making hibernation problematic and unreliable.

===Other device support improvements===
Windows 98, in general, provides improvedâand a broader range ofâsupport for IDE and SCSI drives and drive controllers, floppy drive controllers and all other classes of hardware than Windows 95.&lt;ref name=&quot;98I/O&quot;&gt; [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc768180.aspx Disks and File Systems: Windows 98 Resource Kit]&lt;/ref&gt; There is integrated [[Accelerated Graphics Port]] (AGP) support (The USB Supplement to Windows 95 OSR2 and later releases of Windows 95 did have AGP support). Windows 98 has built-in [[DVD]] support and [[Universal Disc Format|UDF]] 1.02 read support. The Still imaging architecture (STI) with [[TWAIN]] support was introduced for scanners and cameras and Image Color Management 2.0 for devices to perform [[color space]] transformations. [[Multi-monitor|Multiple monitor]] support allows using up to 8 multiple monitors and/or multiple graphics adapters on a single PC. Windows 98 shipped with [[DirectX]] 5.2 which notably included [[DirectShow]]. Windows 98 Second Edition shipped with DirectX 6.1.

==Networking enhancements==
{{main|Winsock}}
Windows 98 networking enhancements to [[TCP/IP]] include built-in support for [[Winsock|Winsock 2]], [[Server Message Block|SMB]] signing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887429 Overview of Server Message Block signing]&lt;/ref&gt; a new IP Helper API, [[Automatic Private IP Addressing]] (APIPA) (also known as link-local addressing), [[IP multicast]]ing (including [[Internet Group Management Protocol|IGMPv2]] support and [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] [[ICMP Router Discovery Protocol|Router Discovery]] â RFC 1256), and performance enhancements for high-speed high bandwidth networks ([[TCP window scale option|TCP large windows]] and [[Transmission Control Protocol#TCP timestamps|time stamps]] â RFC 1323, [[Retransmission (data networks)|Selective Acknowledgement (SACK)]] â RFC 2018, TCP Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery). [[Multihoming]] support with TCP/IP is improved and includes [[Routing Information Protocol|RIP]] listener support.

The [[DHCP]] client has been enhanced to include address assignment conflict detection and longer timeout intervals. [[NetBIOS over TCP/IP|NetBT]] configuration in the [[Windows Internet Naming Service|WINS]] client has been improved to continue persistently querying multiple WINS servers if it failed to establish the initial session until all of the WINS servers specified have been queried or a connection is established.

[[Network Driver Interface Specification|NDIS]] 5.0 support means Windows 98 can support a wide range of network media, including [[Ethernet]], [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI), [[token ring]], [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM), [[wide area network]]s (WANs), [[ISDN]], [[X.25]], and [[Frame Relay]]. Additional features include NDIS power management, support for [[Quality of service|QoS]], [[Windows Management Instrumentation|WMI]] and support for a single [[INF file|INF]] file format across all Windows versions.

Windows 98 Dial-Up Networking supports [[Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol|PPTP]] tunneling, support for ISDN adapters, multilink support, and connection-time scripting to automate non-standard login connections. Multilink channel aggregation enables users to combine all available dial-up lines to achieve higher transfer speeds. [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]] connection logs can show actual packets being passed and Windows 98 allows PPP logging per connection. The Dial-Up Networking improvements are also available in Windows 95 OSR2 and downloadable for earlier Windows 95 releases.

For networked computers that have user profiles enabled, Windows 98 introduces Microsoft Family Logon which lists all users that have been configured for that computer, enabling users to simply select their names from a list rather than having to type it in. The same feature can be added to Windows 95 if [[Internet Explorer 4.0]] is installed.

Windows 98 supports [[IrDA]] 3.0 that specifies both Serial Infrared Devices (SIR) and Fast Infrared (FIR) devices, which are capable of sending and receiving data at 4 Mbit/s. Infrared Recipient, a new application for transferring files through an infrared connection is included. The IrDA stack in Windows 98 supports networking profiles over the IrCOMM kernel-mode driver. Windows 98 also has built-in support for browsing [[Distributed File System (Microsoft)|DFS]] trees on [[Server Message Block|SMB]] shares.

Windows 98 Second Edition added [[Internet Connection Sharing]] ([[IP forwarding]] and [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] capabilities). [[Windows Me]] later supported NAT traversal by means of [[Universal Plug and Play|UPnP]]. UPnP and NAT traversal APIs can also be installed on Windows 98 by installing the [[Windows XP]] Network Setup Wizard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa939488(WinEmbedded.5).aspx Network Setup Wizard Down Level Setup]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol#L2TP.2FIPsec|L2TP/IPsec]] [[Virtual private network|VPN]] client can also be downloaded. By installing Active Directory Client Extensions, Windows 98 can take advantage of several Windows 2000 [[Active Directory]] features .

==Improvements to the system and built-in utilities==

===Performance improvements===
Windows 95 introduced the 32-bit, protected-mode cache driver, VCACHE replacing SMARTDrv to cache the most recently accessed information from the hard drive in memory, divided into chunks. However, the cache parameters needed manual tuning as it degraded performance by consuming too much memory and not releasing it quickly enough, forcing paging to occur far too early. The Windows 98 VCACHE cache size management for disk and network access, CD-ROM access and paging is more dynamic compared to Windows 95 resulting in no tuning required for cache parameters. &lt;ref&gt; [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc768196.aspx Chapter 26 - Performance Tuning: Windows 98 Resource Kit] &lt;/ref&gt; On the FAT32 file system, Windows 98 has a [http://www.cwdixon.com/support/win98_support/map_cache.htm ''MapCache''] performance feature that can run applications from the disk cache itself if the code pages of executable files are aligned/mapped on 4K boundaries, instead of copying them to virtual memory. This results in more memory being available to run applications, and lesser usage of the swap file.

WinAlign (Walign.exe and Winalign.exe) are tools designed to optimize the performance of executable code (binaries). WinAlign aligns binary sections along 4 KB boundaries, aligning the executable sections with the memory pages. This allows the Windows 98 MapCache feature to map directly to sections in cache&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q191655 Description of the Walign.exe and Winalign.exe Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; Walign.exe is included in Windows 98 for automatically optimizing Microsoft Office programs. Winalign.exe is included in the Windows 98 Resource Kit to optimize other programs.

[[Disk Defragmenter (Windows)|Disk Defragmenter]] has been improved to rearrange program files that are frequently used to a hard disk region optimized for program start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing Windows 98, Second edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 98 also supports a ''Fast Shutdown'' feature that initiates shutdown without uninitializing [[device drivers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/187607 How to Disable Fast Shutdown in Windows 98]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 98 supports write-behind caching for removable disk drives. A [[FAT32]] converter utility for converting [[FAT16]] drives to FAT32 without formatting the partition is also included.

===Other system tools===
A number of improvements are made to various other system tools and accessories in Windows 98. Microsoft Backup supports differential backup and [[SCSI]] [[Tape drive|tape]] devices in Windows 98. [[Disk Cleanup]], a new tool, enables users to clear their disks of unnecessary files. Cleanup locations are extensible through Disk Cleanup handlers. Disk Cleanup can be automated for regular silent cleanups.

Scanreg (DOS) and ScanRegW are Registry Checker tools used to back up, restore or optimize the [[Windows registry]]. ScanRegW tests the registry's integrity and saves a backup copy each time Windows successfully boots. The maximum amount of copies could be customized by the user through &quot;scanreg.ini&quot; file. The restoration of a registry that causes Windows to fail to boot can only be done from DOS mode using ScanReg.

System Configuration Utility (also known as [[Msconfig]]) is a new system utility used to disable programs and services that are not required to run the computer. A Maintenance Wizard is included that schedules and automates [[SCANDISK|ScanDisk]], Disk Defragmenter and [[Disk Cleanup]]. [[Windows Script Host]], with [[VBScript]] and [[JScript]] engines is built-in and upgradeable to version 5.6.

[[System File Checker]] checks installed versions of system files to ensure they were the same version as the one installed with Windows 98 or newer. Corrupt or older versions are replaced by the correct versions. This tool was introduced to resolve the [[DLL hell]] issue and was replaced in [[Windows Me]] by [[Windows File Protection|System File Protection]].

The Windows 98 Startup Disk contains generic, real-mode [[Parallel ATA#ATAPI|ATAPI]] and SCSI CD-ROM drivers and has been preconfigured to automatically start MS-DOS mode with CD-ROM support enabled. For computers without an operating system and that do not support booting from optical drives, the Startup disk can be used to boot into MS-DOS and automatically start Windows 98 setup from the CD.

Windows 98 includes an improved version of the [[Dr. Watson (debugger)|Dr. Watson]] utility that collects and lists comprehensive information such as running tasks, startup programs with their command line switches, system patches, kernel driver, user drivers, DOS drivers and 16-bit modules. With Dr. Watson loaded in the system tray, whenever a software fault occurs (general protection fault, hang, etc.), Dr. Watson will intercept it and indicate what software crashed and its cause. All of the collected information is logged to the \Windows\DrWatson folder.

Windows Report Tool takes a snapshot of system configuration and lets users submit a manual problem report along with system information to technicians. It has e-mail confirmation for submitted reports. The system could be updated using [[Windows Update]]. A utility to automatically notify of critical updates was later released.

[[File:Windows 98 - Critical Update Notification.png|300px|thumb|A Critical Update Notification in Windows 98]]

===Accessories===
Windows 98 includes [[Magnifier (Windows)|Microsoft Magnifier]], Accessibility Wizard and [[Microsoft Active Accessibility]] 1.1 API upgradeable to MSAA 2.0. A new [[HTML Help]] system with 15 Troubleshooting Wizards was introduced to replace [[WinHelp]].

Users can configure the [[font]] in [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]]. [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]] supports GIF transparency. [[HyperTerminal]] supports a TCP/IP connection method allowing it to be used as a Telnet client. [[Imaging for Windows]] is updated. [[System Monitor]] supports output to a log file.

===Miscellaneous improvements===
* [[Telephony Application Programming Interface|Telephony API]] (TAPI) 2.1
* [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] version 1.2
* Ability to list fonts by similarity determined using [[PANOSE]] information.
* Tools to automate setup such as Batch 98 and INFInst.exe support error-checking, gathering information automatically to create an [[INF file]] directly from the registry of the machine, customizing IE4, shell and desktop settings and adding custom drivers.
* Several other [[Resource Kit]] tools are included on the Windows 98 CD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/247024/en-us Tools Included with the Microsoft Windows 98 Resource Kit]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows 98 has new system event sounds for ''low battery alarm'' and ''critical battery alarm''. The Windows 98 startup sound was composed by Ken Kato.
* Windows 98 shipped with [[Flash Player]] and [[Shockwave Player]] preinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Macromedia+Shockwave(TM)+and+Flash(TM)+Players+Incorporated+Into...-a020957947 Macromedia Shockwave(TM) and Flash(TM) Players Incorporated Into Windows 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Windows98FirstEditionCover.jpg|thumb|right|Windows 98 Upgrade cover.]]

==Windows 98 Second Edition {{anchor|SE}} ==
'''Windows 98 Second Edition''' (often shortened to '''SE''') is an updated release of Windows 98, released on 5 May 1999. It includes fixes for many minor issues, improved WDM audio and modem support, improved [[USB]] support, the replacement of [[Internet Explorer 4|Internet Explorer 4.0]] with [[Internet Explorer 5.0]] and related shell updates. Also included is basic [[Open Host Controller Interface|OHCI]]-compliant [[FireWire]] (IEEE 1394a) [[DV]] camcorder support (MSDV class driver) and SBP-2 support for mass storage class devices &lt;ref&gt; [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg454506#E3AAC IEEE 1394 and the Windows platform] &lt;/ref&gt;, [[Wake-On-LAN]] support (if ACPI compatible [[Network Driver Interface Specification|NDIS]] drivers are present) and [[Internet Connection Sharing]], which allows multiple computers on a [[Local area network|LAN]] to share a single Internet connection through [[Network Address Translation]]. Other features in the update include DirectX 6.1 which introduced major improvements to [[DirectSound]] and the introduction of [[DirectMusic]], improvements to [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] support ([[Internet Protocol|IP]]/ATM, [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]]/ATM and [[Winsock|WinSock 2/ATM]] support), [[Windows Media Player]] 6.2 replacing the older [[Media Player (Microsoft)|Media Player]], Microsoft [[NetMeeting]] 3.0, [[Microsoft Data Access Components|MDAC 2.1]] and [[Windows Management Instrumentation|WMI]]. A memory overflow issue was resolved which in the older version of Windows 98 would crash most systems if left running for 49.7 days (equal to 2Â³Â² milliseconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miles| first=Stephanie|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-222391.html|title=Windows may crash after 49.7 days â CNET News|publisher=News.cnet.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 98 SE could be obtained as retail upgrade and full version packages, as well as OEM and a Second Edition Updates Disc for existing Windows 98 users. Windows 98 Second Edition did not ship with the [[WinG]] API or [[RealPlayer]] 4.0 unlike the original release of Windows 98, both of these being superseded by DirectX and Windows Media Player.

==Press demonstration==
The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at [[Comdex]] in April 1998. Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for [[Legacy Plug and Play|Plug and Play]] (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela plugged  a scanner in and attempted to install it, the operating system crashed, displaying a [[Blue Screen of Death]]. Gates remarked after applause and cheering from the audience, &quot;That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.&quot; Video footage of this event became a popular [[List of Internet phenomena|Internet phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9804/21/windows.98/index.html?iref=allsearch Computer users on Windows 98: It's not revolutionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product life cycle==
Microsoft planned to discontinue its support for Windows 98 versions on January 16, 2004. However, due to the continued popularity of the operating system (27% of [[Google]]'s pageviews were on Windows 98 systems during OctoberâNovember, 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=OctoberâNovember 2003|url= http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-nov03.html|title=Zeitgeist|work=Google Press Center |publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=22 April 2006}} ''Note: A graphic depicting the decline in use of Windows 98 from June 2001 to June 2004 as an operating system to access Google is available on Wikimedia Commons; [[:Image:Win98 operatingSystem GoogleAccessPercentage 200101to200406.gif|IMAGE]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft decided to maintain support until July 11, 2006. Support for [[Windows Me]] also ended on this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ward|first=Mark|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5164450.stm|title=Technology &amp;#124; Microsoft shuts down Windows 98|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-07-11|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, Windows 98 market share had diminished to 2.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=10&amp;qpmr=24&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=90|title=July 2006 market share by Hitslink|publisher=Marketshare.hitslink.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 98 is no longer available from Microsoft in any form due to the terms of Java-related settlements Microsoft made with Sun Microsystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/ff723773.aspx MSDN Subscriptions Subscriber Download Help]&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 98 Second Edition is the last operating system in the Windows 9x series that includes real mode MS-DOS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://franck.kiechel.free.fr/dbr_eng/Versions.htm Windows 98 Second Edition: Last OS in the Windows 9x series that includes real mode MS-DOS.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==System requirements==
&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/182751/ Windows 98 System Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;
*486DX2/66&amp;nbsp;MHz or higher processor (Pentium processor recommended)
*16&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM (24&amp;nbsp;MB recommended, it's possible to run on 8&amp;nbsp;MB machines with /nm option used during the installation process)
*At least 500 MB of space available on HDD. The amount of space required depends on the installation method and the components selected, but virtual memory and system utilities as well as drivers should be taken into consideration.
:*Upgrading from Windows 95 (FAT16) or 3.1 (FAT): 140-400&amp;nbsp;MB (typically 205&amp;nbsp;MB).
:*New installation (FAT32): 190-305&amp;nbsp;MB (typically 210&amp;nbsp;MB).
:*'''Note 1:''' Both Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE can have significant problems associated with hard drives that are over 32 Gigabytes (GB) in size. This issue only occurs with certain Phoenix [[BIOS]] settings. A software update has been made available to fix this shortcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows98/downloads/contents/WURecommended/S_WUFeatured/bigide/Default.asp|title=Windows 98 Large IDE Update|accessdate=2006-08-30|author=Staff|date=28 December 1999|work=Microsoft Windows Update|publisher=Microsoft Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Note 2:''' Also, both Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE are unable to handle hard drives that are over 137&amp;nbsp;GB in size with the default drivers, because of missing 48-bit LBA support â whole disc data corruption is likely. Third party patches are available to fix this shortcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msfn.org/board/Enable48BitLBA-Break-the-137Gb-barrier-t78592.html|title=Enable48BitLBA-Break-the-137Gb-barrier|accessdate=2008-07-13|author=Staff|date= 12 July 2006|work=MSFN|publisher=MSFN |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080629041310/http://www.msfn.org/board/Enable48BitLBA-Break-the-137Gb-barrier-t78592.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Note 3:''' It is also possible to compress a Windows 98 installation using DriveSpace 3 to less than 120 MB, using maximum compression, without deleting many files. Installing Windows 98 on a HDD that small is usually useless, because it doesn't leave much room for programs, but can be accomplished by moving the DriveSpace 3 container file there.
*[[VGA]] or higher resolution monitor (640x480)
*CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive (floppy install is possible but slow) &lt;!-- Floppy disk install was available from Product Support, but this does not belong in the article. --&gt;
*Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device (optional).&lt;ref&gt;System requirements from the Microsoft Windows 98 SE manual&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its predecessor, Windows 95, and its successor, Windows Millennium Edition (Me), users can bypass hardware requirement checks with the undocumented /im setup switch. This allows installation on computers with processors as old as the [[80386]].

Unlike Windows 95, Windows 98 requires a [[Floating-point unit]] (Math Coprocessor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189670|title=Err Msg: Windows 98 Requires a Computer with a Math Coprocessor|date=January 23, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intel 80486DX]] and later [[Pentium]] processors include a floating-point unit as part of the CPU.

==Physical RAM limit==
The maximum amount of physical [[RAM]] in a [[Personal Computer|PC]] that Windows 98 supports is 1.5 GB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/304943 Physical RAM limit for Windows 98.]&lt;/ref&gt;
