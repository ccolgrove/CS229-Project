'''Juhu Aerodrome''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: à¤à¥à¤¹à¥ à¤µà¤¿à¤®à¤¾à¤¨à¤¤à¤³) {{Airport codes||VAJJ}} an [[airport]] serving [[Mumbai]], was India's first [[civil aviation]] airport. It is currently used by small private aircraft and as a heliport.

The aerodrome is located at  [[Juhu]], an upmarket residential [[suburb]] in northwest Mumbai flanking the city's [[Juhu Beach]] along the [[Arabian sea]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;book76647674&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Volume 7 | title=Asian and Indian skyways | publisher= | location= | year=1953 | url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zhs-AQAAIAAJ&amp;q= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}} Page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Juhu_aerodrome_composite.jpg|thumb|Runway 08/26 with the [[Arabian Sea]] in the background]]
The aerodrome started off as an unpaved airfield around 1928. It was used by the newly established Bombay Flying Club for tuition, joy-rides, and air travel.The activities of the club were, unfortunately, limited by the fact that the aerodrome
at Juhu was not suitable during the monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bombay Flying Club First Annual Report |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1929/1929-1%20-%200670.html |work=[[Flight Global]] |date=1 August 1929 |accessdate=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much progress had been made in the layout of the ground of the aerodrome by 1932, although the ground was still not fit for use during that year's monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bombay Aerodrome at Juhu |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1932/1932%20-%200843.html |work=[[Flight Global]] |date=19 August 1932 |accessdate=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[J. R. D. Tata]], the father of civil aviation in India, made his maiden voyage to Juhu airport from [[Drigh Road Airstrip]] in [[Karachi]], via [[Ahmedabad]], on 15 October 1932 carrying mail in a [[de Havilland Puss Moth|Puss Moth]] aircraft.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Tata Airmail Service |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1933/1933%20-%200531.html |work=[[Flight Global]] |date=14 September 1933 |accessdate=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Tata Airmail Service, as it was called, continued on to Pune, Bellary and Madras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When air mail came to Madras |url=http://madrasmusings.com/Vol%2020%20No%2014/when-air-mail-came-to-madras.html |work= Madras musings | date=1-15 November 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the birth of [[Air India]] which, in 1932 was based here out of a hut with a palm thatched roof and had 1 pilot and 2 apprentice mechanics along with 2 piston engined aircraft, one [[de Havilland Puss Moth|Puss Moth]] and one [[de Havilland Leopard Moth|Leopard Moth]] aircraft. &lt;ref name=&quot;isbn8120724828&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Pran Nath Seth, Pran Nath Seth, Sushma Seth Bhat | title=An introduction to travel and tourism | publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

Waterlogging and the absence of proper runways for monsoon take-offs were Juhu's serious drawbacks. The former problem was addressed by 1937  while proper runways, night flying facilities, hangars etc were provided in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Juhu Improvements |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1937/1937%20-%202980.html |work=[[Flight Global]] |date=28 Octoberber 1937 |accessdate=17 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Atleast two airlines were based at Juhu during this period Air Services of India, Ltd. and Tata Sons, Ltd.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Airline Companies of the World |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1939/1939%20-%201264.html |work=[[Flight Global]] |date=27 April 1939 |accessdate=17 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport served as the city's sole airport till Santacruz airport, now [[Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] was built in 1948. &lt;ref name = &quot;IE1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=On a high |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=240391 |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date= 2007-06-10|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WW II ghost over land near Sahar|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2011/mar/210311-Air-Cargo-Complex-World-War-II-MIAL-British-Raj-Sahar.htm|accessdate=28 March 2011|newspaper=[[Mid Day]]|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It served as the city's airport up to and even during the 1939-45 war. Two bitumen runways were in operation and a third was planned for construction in 1939 but this never occurred.

==Current Status==

At present, Juhu has only a single operational runway (08/26, 3750&amp;nbsp;ft/1143&amp;nbsp;m) and is run by the [[Airports Authority of India]]. It hosts the [[Bombay Flying Club]] along with several executive and light aircraft, [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]], and a [[heliport]] for private charters and to ferry [[Oil and Natural Gas Corporation]] personnel by carrier [[Pawan Hans]] to offshore oil rigs at [[Bombay High]]&lt;ref name=IE1 /&gt; .

[[Jal Hans]], India's first seaplane service was launched at the Juhu Aerodrome in December 2010. &lt;ref name=et2010&gt;{{cite news|title=First Indian seaplane service takes off|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-12-28/news/27631265_1_seaplane-nicobar-islands-port-blair|accessdate=28 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Economic Times of India{{!}}The Economic Times]]|date=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Helicopter Operations===

Juhu Aerodrome handles all helicopter operations, including private helicopter charters out of Mumbai. &lt;ref name = &quot;IE2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Come Jan 10, small aircraft to fly from Juhu |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Come-Jan-10--small-aircraft-to-fly-from-Juhu/724394/ |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date= 2010-12-14|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to congestion at the CSI Airport, in December 2010 all helicopter operations were moved to Juhu. The aerodrome can handle 6 helicopter operations at a time. The airport currently handles about 100 helicopter operations a day. &lt;ref name = &quot;MSNI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=150 CISF personnel to guard Juhu Airport |url=http://news.in.msn.com/national/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4767823 |publisher=[[MSN News]] |date= 2011-01-05|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private Aircraft Operations and Upgrade===

There is currently a plan to move all small private aircraft (such as [[Beechcraft]] [[Beechcraft Super King Air|B-200]] and [[Cessna]] C-90)operations from CSI Airport to Juhu Aerodrome to decongest CSI Airport. &lt;ref name=&quot;IE2&quot;/&gt; This was to take place by January 10, 2011. &lt;ref name=&quot;IE1&quot;/&gt; However, due to lack of infrastructure and security considerations, this has been delayed. As part of this move, the aerodrome is currently being upgraded to Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) from the current Visual Flight Rules (VFR). Currently the air controllers at CSI Airport have to align aircraft to the Juhu flight path using their radar before they hand over the aircraft to Juhu. The airport is also being fitted with a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to facilitate night landing facilities that have demanded by helicopter operators. There is also a plan to align runway 08-26 with runway 09-27 of CSI Airport to facilitate independent operations. A new terminal building is being built to handle passenger movement, it currently only has a VIP terminal for private charter movements. The runway is also being extended besides permissions pending. &lt;ref name = &quot;IE3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Juhu airport to the rescue again, this time with parking bays for small aircraft |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/juhu-airport-to-the-rescue-again-this-time-with-parking-bays-for-small-aircraft/725983/2 |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date= 2010-12-17|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = &quot;IE4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Runway âoverlapâ delays shift to Juhu |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Runway--overlap--delays-shift-to-Juhu/735954 |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date= 2011-01-11|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = &quot;HT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan to divert pvt planes to Juhu deferred |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Plan-to-divert-pvt-planes-to-Juhu-deferred/Article1-648808.aspx |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |date= 2011-01-11|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===

The airport is currently being guarded by the Maharashtra Home Guard who will soon hand over charge to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) that handles security for all major airports in India. A contingent 174 personnel has been sanctioned for Juhu aerodrome with CISF infrastructure being accommodated in a renovated hangar. The CISF personnel will be armed with AK-47s and INSAS rifles. It will also have a vehicle-borne Quick Reaction Team (QRT). A perimeter wall is being built around the premises as well. &lt;ref name=&quot;MSNI&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name = &quot;IE5&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Stage is set for CISF to take over Juhu airport |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/stage-is-set-for-cisf-to-take-over-juhu-airport/734326/ |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date= 2011-01-07|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Airlines and destinations ==
No commercial services at this time.

==Extension and Conservation==
With air traffic congestion reaching an unacceptable threshold in Mumbai, Airports Authority of India put on fast track its age-old plan of reviving the Juhu airport to ease some pressure off [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] (CSIA) in 2010. The Airports Authority of India appointed consulting major KPMG to draw up a development plan for Juhu airport.  It was envisioned that the Juhu airstrip could take up to 18% load off CSI Airport with turboprop [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] and then [[Boeing 737]] aircraft. The plan was to extend the runway to 2000 meters in phases would ultimately see the airstrip jutting into the sea with reclaimed parts of the famous Juhu beach and seafront, however the permission for the same was denied by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]], [[Government of India]]. &lt;ref name = &quot;MD&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Juhu aerodrome to take load off airport? |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2010/jul/100710-DGCA-AAI-aircraft-Juhu-aerodrome-KPMG.htm |publisher=[[Mid Day]] |date= 2010-07-10|accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = &quot;HT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Navi Mumbai airport gets ministry nod |url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/11/22231043/Navi-Mumbai-airport-gets-minis.html |publisher=LiveMint ([[Hindustan Times]]) |date= 2010-11-27|accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the ministry asked for the conservation of land around the airstrip stating no development should take place there and that it should be conserved as a green open space to compensate the pollution caused by the airstrip. &lt;ref name=&quot;HTmoef&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Ramesh-wants-380-acre-open-space-around-Juhu-heliport/Article1-666495.aspx | title=Ramesh wants 380-acre open space around Juhu heliport | accessdate=March 07, 2011 | date=February 24, 2011 | publisher=Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 15 July 1953, a [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] [[de Havilland Comet|DH.106 Comet]] landed at Juhu Aerodrome instead of Mumbai's much larger [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|Santa Cruz International Airport]].

* On 13 October 2006, a private five seater [[Beechcraft_Baron#Baron_55|Beechcraft B 55]] aircraft owned by Container Movement Transport Pvt. Ltd. crash landed at the Juhu aerodrome after experiencing engine trouble and losing radio communications. The aircraft, on its way to [[Vadodara]] returned to Mumbai from where it took off was badly damaged as it caught fire on landing.

==Culture and media==

The Aerodrome was used for the opening scene of [[Slumdog Millionaire]] and can be seen in subsequent scenes as well. Part of the climax of the 2008 film [[A Wednesday]] was shot here.&lt;ref name=ht.net&gt;{{cite web|title=Slumdog Millionaire, Indiaâs Oscar Nod|url=http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/2009/02/22/slumdog-millionaire-indias-oscar-nod/|publisher=Hollywoodtoday.net|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aerodrome was referred to as ''Juhu Aviation Base'' in this particular film. &lt;ref name=starbox&gt;{{cite web|title=A Wednesday|url=http://www.starboxoffice.com/movie/share/printpage.aspx?bid=2008/August/reviews_20080825_13|publisher=Starboxoffice.com|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
