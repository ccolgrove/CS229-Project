The '''Monk Parakeet''', also known as the '''Quaker Parrot''', (''Myiopsitta monachus'') is a [[species]] of [[parrot]], in most treatments the only member of the [[genus]]  '''''Myiopsitta'''''. It originates from the temperate to [[subtropical]] areas of [[Argentina]] and the surrounding countries in [[South America]]. Self-sustaining [[feral]] populations occur in many places, mainly in [[North America]] and [[Europe]].

==Description==
[[File:Quaker Parrot.jpg|thumb|left|Female pet Monk Parakeet]]
The [[nominate subspecies]] of this parakeet is 29&amp;nbsp;cm long on average, with a 48&amp;nbsp;cm wingspan, and weighs 100&amp;nbsp;g. Females tend to be 10-20% smaller but can only be reliably sexed by DNA blood or feather testing. It has bright green upperparts. The forehead and breast are pale grey with darker scalloping and the rest of the underparts are very-light green to yellow. The [[remiges]] are dark blue, and the tail is long and tapering. The bill is orange. The call is a loud and throaty ''chape(-yee)'' or ''quak quaki quak-wi quarr'', and screeches ''skveet''.&lt;ref name = hbw+j&amp;p&gt;Collar (1997a,b), Juniper &amp; Parr (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic breeds in colors other than the natural plumage have been produced. These include birds with white, blue, and yellow in place of green. As such coloration provides less camouflage, feral birds are usually of wild-type coloration.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
''Myiopsitta monachus'' is presently the [[monotypic|only unequivocally accepted member]] of the [[genus]] ''Myiopsitta''. However, it seems that the Cliff Parakeet (see below) will eventually be recognized as a species again, as it has been on-again-off-again since it was first described in 1868.&lt;ref name = hbw-luchsi&gt;Collar (1997b)&lt;/ref&gt; It is presently included with the Monk Parakeet because there is too little up-to-date research on which an authoritative [[taxonomic]] decision could be based. The [[American Ornithologists' Union|AOU]] for example has deferred recognizing the Cliff Parakeet as distinct &quot;because of insufficient published data&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;SACC (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this only sources last sentence of paragraph --&gt;

Consequently, there are four [[subspecies]] presently recognized:&lt;ref name = hbw+j&amp;p /&gt;
* '''''Myiopsitta monachus monachus''''' &lt;small&gt;(Boddaert, 1783)&lt;/small&gt; &amp;ndash; [[Argentina]] from SE [[Santiago del Estero Province]] throughout the [[Salado River, Argentina|RÃ­o Salado]] and lower [[ParanÃ¡ River|ParanÃ¡]] basins to [[Buenos Aires Province]] and [[Uruguay]]
:The largest subspecies
* '''''Myiopsitta monachus calita''''' &lt;small&gt;(Boddaert, 1783)&lt;/small&gt; &amp;ndash; [[Andean]] foothills up to 1,000&amp;nbsp;m [[Above mean sea level|ASL]], from SE [[Bolivia]] ([[Santa Cruz Department|Santa Cruz]] and [[Tarija department]]s) to [[Paraguay]] and NW Argentina, then west of the range of ''monachus'', extending into the lowlands again in [[RÃ­o Negro Province|RÃ­o Negro]] and possibly [[Chubut province]]s.
:Smaller than ''monachus'', wings more prominently blue, grey of head darker.
* '''''Myiopsitta monachus cotorra''''' &lt;small&gt;(Finsch, 1868)&lt;/small&gt; &amp;ndash; SW [[Brazil]] ([[Mato Grosso]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], possibly [[Rio Grande do Sul]]&lt;ref name = adqp2006&gt;Amorim &amp; Piacentini (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;) throughout the [[RÃ­o Paraguay]] and middle ParanÃ¡ basins as well as the [[Gran Chaco]].
:Essentially identical to ''calida'' but reported as less yellow below and brighter overall.
* '''Cliff Parakeet''', '''''Myiopsitta (monachus) luchsi''''' &lt;small&gt;(Boddaert, 1783)&lt;/small&gt; &amp;ndash; [[Andean]] valleys of central Bolivia between 1,000&lt;ref name = j&amp;p1998&gt;Juniper &amp; Parr (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;/1,300&lt;ref name = hbw-luchsi /&gt; and 3,000&amp;nbsp;m ASL, roughly from SE [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]] to N [[Chuquisaca department]]s. Essentially the same range as the [[Red-fronted Macaw]].
:Smaller, with clearer plumage pattern: no scalloping on breast, underparts brighter yellow, underwing lighter. Base of [[maxilla]] dark.

The first three subspecies' ranges meet in the general area of Paraguay, and there they are insufficiently delimited. The distinctness and delimitation of ''calita'' and ''cotorra'' especially requires further study. As regards the Cliff Parakeet, it appears as if its altitudinal range does not overlap with that of ''calita''/''cotorra'' and that it is thus entirely &amp;ndash; but just barely &amp;ndash; [[allopatric]].&lt;ref name = j&amp;p1998 /&gt;

Like the other [[Neotropical parrots]], the Monk Parakeet is usually placed in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] Arini, which might warrant elevation to [[subfamily]] rank as Arinae. ''M. monachus'' belongs to the long-tailed [[clade]] of these &amp;ndash; [[macaw]]s and [[conure]]s, essentially &amp;ndash;, which would retain the name Arini/Arinae if this [[polyphyletic]] group is split.

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Myiopsitta monachus -nests -Zaragoza -Spain-8.jpg|right|thumb|Nests in [[Zaragoza]], Spain.]]
[[File:Myiopsitta monachus -Santiago, Chile -nest-8.jpg|right|thumb|Birds and their nest in Santiago, Chile]]
The Monk Parakeet is globally very common,&lt;ref&gt;BLI (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and even the rather localized Cliff Parakeet is generally common.&lt;ref name = hbw-luchsi /&gt; In Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, Monk Parakeets are regarded as major agricultural pests (as noted by [[Charles Darwin]] among others). Their population explosion in South American rural areas seems to be associated with the expansion of [[eucalyptus]] [[forestry]] for paper pulp production, which offers the bird the opportunity to build protected nests in artificial forests where there is small ecological competition from other species. The Cliff Parakeet occasionally plunders [[maize]] fields but it is apparently not considered a major pest as there is no serious persecution.&lt;ref name = hbw-luchsi /&gt;

The Monk Parakeet is the only parrot that builds a stick [[bird nest|nest]], in a tree or on a man-made structure, rather than using a hole in a tree. This [[social animal|gregarious]] species often breeds colonially, building a single large nest with separate entrances for each pair. In the wild, the colonies can become quite large, with pairs occupying separate &quot;apartments&quot; in nests that can reach the size of a small [[automobile]]. These nests can attract many other tenants including birds of prey such as the [[Spot-winged Falconet]] (''Spiziapteryx circumcincta''), ducks such as the [[Speckled Teal]] (''Anas flavirostris''), and even [[mammal]]s. Their 5-12 white eggs hatch in about 24 days.

The Cliff Parakeet, as its name implies, rather nests in cliff crevices. This [[taxon]] rarely builds communal nests, but individual pairs still prefer to nest in close association.&lt;ref name = hbw-luchsi /&gt;

Unusually for a parrot, Monk Parakeet pairs occasionally have helper individuals, often a grown offspring, which assists with feeding the young (see [[kin selection]]).

The lifespan of Monk Parakeets has been given as 15â20 years&lt;ref&gt;Fasbach (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; or as much as 25â30 years;&lt;ref&gt;Kamuda (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; the former might refer to average lifespans in captivity and/or in the wild, while the latter is in the range of maximum lifespans recorded for parakeets.

===As pets===
[[File:Myiopsitta monachus -pet with toys -upper body-8.jpg|thumb|right|Pet with rope and parrot toys]]
Monk Parakeets are highly intelligent, social birds. Those kept as pets routinely develop large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]]. They are able to learn scores of words and phrases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070927045349/http://www.butnowyouknow.com/oatmeal.html The Vocabulary of a Quaker Parrot]. Retrieved 2008-JAN-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an introduced species===
[[File:Myiopsitta monachus -Old San Juan -Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|left|Monk Parakeet in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]
Self-sustaining [[feral]] populations have been recorded in several US states and various countries of [[Europe]] (namely [[Spain]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Great Britain]] and [[Belgium]]), as well as in [[Brazil]], [[Israel]], [[Bermuda]], [[Bahamas]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Japan]]. As it is an open woodlands species, it adapts readily to [[city|urban]] areas.

In areas where they have been introduced, some fear that they will harm [[agriculture|crops]] and native species. Evidence of harm caused by feral colonies is disputed, and many people oppose killing this charismatic bird. However, there have been local bans and eradication programs in some areas of the USA. Outside the USA, introduced populations do not appear to raise similar controversy, presumably because of smaller numbers of birds, or because their settlement in urban areas does not pose a threat to agricultural production. The UK appears to have changed its view on its feral populations and Defra is to remove Monk Parakeets from the wild,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13181503]. Retrieved 2011-APR-25.&lt;/ref&gt; as they believe that the Monk Parakeets threaten local wildlife and crops.

It was found that feral populations are often descended from very small founder populations. Being as social and intelligent as they are, Monk Parakeets will develop some cultural [[tradition]]s, namely vocal [[dialect]]s that differ between groups. In populations descended from a large number of birds, a range of &quot;dialects&quot; will exist. If the founder population is small however, a process similar to [[genetic drift]] may occur if prominent founders vocalize in an unusual &quot;dialect&quot;, with this particular way of vocalizing becoming established in the resulting feral colony. For example, no fewer than three different &quot;dialects&quot; occur among the feral Monk Parrots of the [[Milford, Connecticut]], metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;Buhrmann-Deever ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
The species has in recent years expanded its range in [[Brazil]], where there is now a self-sustaining population in the downtown area of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Since this population occurs far from the bird's original range in Brazil - it was only found in the far south and southwest - it is most probably a consequence of escapees from the [[pet trade]]. In Rio de Janeiro, the bird can be easily seen at the [[Aterro do Flamengo]] gardens - where it nests on [[palm trees]] and feeds on their fruit; the Rio birds seem to favor nesting amid the leaves of [[coconut]] palm trees - as well as in the vicinity of the neighboring domestic flight terminal, the [[Santos Dumont Airport]] and in the gardens of [[Quinta da Boa Vista]], where communal nests of roughly one meter in diameter have been seem.&lt;ref&gt;JosÃ© FelipeMonteiro Pereira, ''Aves e PÃ¡ssaros Comuns do Rio de Janeiro'', Rio de Janeiro, Technical Books Editora, ISBN 978-85-61368-00-5, pg.66&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Santa Catarina State]], probable escapees have been reported on occasion since quite some time, and a feral population seems to have established itself in [[FlorianÃ³polis]] in the early [[2000â2009|2000s]] when birds were observed feeding right next to the highway in the Rio Vermelho-Vargem Grande area.&lt;ref name = adqp2006 /&gt;

====United States of America====
[[File:Myiopsitta monachus -Florida -two in tree-8.jpg|right|thumb|Monk Parakeets in Florida, USA.]]
Considerable numbers of Monk Parakeet were imported to the [[United States]] in the late 1960s as pets. Many escaped or were intentionally released, and populations were allowed to proliferate. By the early 1970s, ''M. monachus'' was established in seven states, and by 1995 it had spread to eight more. There are now thought to be approximately 100,000 in [[Florida]] alone.

As one of the few temperate-zone parrots, the Monk Parakeet is more able than most to survive cold climates, and [[bird colony|colonies]] exist as far north as [[New York City]], [[Harold Washington Park#Parakeet nests|Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], northern [[New Jersey]], coastal [[Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut]], and southwestern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. This hardiness makes this species second only to the [[Rose-ringed Parakeet]] amongst parrots as a successful [[introduced species]].

In addition, they have also found a home in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], after an accidental release decades ago of what appears to have been black-market birds&lt;ref&gt;Powell (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; within [[Green-Wood Cemetery]]. The grounds crew initially tried to destroy the unsightly nests at the entrance gate, but no longer do so because the presence of the parrots has reduced the number of [[feral pigeon|pigeons]] nesting within it. The management's decision was based on a comparative chemical analysis of pigeon feces (which destroy brownstone structures) and Monk Parakeet feces (which have no ill effect). Oddly then, the Monk Parakeets are in effect preserving this historic structure. [[Brooklyn College]] has a Monk Parakeet as an &quot;unofficial&quot; mascot in reference to the colony of the species that lives in its campus grounds. It is featured on the masthead of the student magazine. Most of these Quaker populations can be traced to shipments of captured Quakers from Argentina.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuakeLegal&quot;/&gt;

Because of Quakers' listing as an agricultural pest, [[California]], Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Hawaii, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wyoming outlaw sale and ownership of a monk parakeet. In Connecticut, one can own a Quaker, but cannot sell or breed them. In New York and [[Virginia]], it is possible to own a Quaker with banding and registration. In Ohio, owning a Quaker is legal as long as the bird's wings are clipped so that it cannot fly.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuakeLegal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quakerparrots.com/general/why-quaker-parrot-laws/|title=Why are Quaker Parrots Illegal in Some States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
[[File:MonkParakeetsSantaPonsa.jpg|right|thumb|Monk Parakeets in Santa Ponsa, [[Majorca]], [[Spain]].]]
Monk Parakeets can be seen in [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Cadiz]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[MÃ¡laga]], [[Zaragoza]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Majorca]]. In Madrid, they especially frequent the [[Complutense University of Madrid|Ciudad Universitaria]] (Complutense university campus) and [[Casa de Campo]] park. They are a common sight in Barcelona parks, often as numerous as pigeons. They form substantial colonies in [[Parc de la Ciutadella]], Parc de la [[Barceloneta]], and in smaller city parks such as Jardins [[Josep Trueta]] in [[Poble Nou]], with a colony as far north as [[Empuriabrava]].

====United Kingdom====
The population in 2011 is believed to be around 150 in the [[Home Counties]]. The [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] announced plans to control them to counter the threat  to  infrastructure, crops and native British wildlife by trapping and re-homing, removing nests and shooting when necessary.&lt;ref name=gray&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Louise|title=Wild parakeets living in Britain to be shot before they become a nuisance|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/8471075/Wild-parakeets-living-in-Britain-to-be-shot-before-they-become-a-nuisance.html|accessdate=5 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=25 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
Small groups of Monk parakeets can be found in the capital city [[Brussels]] and its surrounding areas. They have been living in the wild at least since the 1970s.
