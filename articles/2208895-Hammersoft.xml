The '''Bay Bridge Series''' is the name of a series of [[baseball]] games played between&amp;mdash;and the rivalry of&amp;mdash;[[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Oakland Athletics]] of the [[American League]] and [[San Francisco Giants]] of the [[National League]]. The series takes its name from the [[San Francisco â Oakland Bay Bridge]] which links the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Francisco]]. Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants is considered a friendly one with mostly mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to [[White Sox â Cubs rivalry|White SoxâCubs]], or [[MetsâYankees rivalry|YankeesâMets]] games where animosity runs high. Hats displaying both teams on the cap are sold from vendors at the games, and once in a while the teams both dress in uniforms from an historic era of their franchises.
The series is also occasionally referred to as the &quot;'''BART Series'''&quot; for the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] system that links Oakland to San Francisco. However, the name &quot;BART Series&quot; has never been popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and has fallen out of favor. Bay Area locals almost exclusively refer to the rivalry as the &quot;Bay Bridge Series&quot;.

Originally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of [[spring training]], immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the [[1989 World Series]] which the Athletics won and the first time both teams had met since they moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Today, it also refers to games played between the teams during the regular season since the commencement of [[Interleague play]] in 1997. Through 2010, the A's have won 42 games, and the Giants have won 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head.cgi?teams=OAK&amp;from=1997&amp;to=2009&amp;submit=Submit|work=baseball-reference.com|title=Head-to-Head record for Oakland Athletics against the listed opponents from 1997 to 2009|publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History prior to Bay Area move==
The Giants and Athletics met in the {{wsy|1905}}, {{wsy|1911}} and {{wsy|1913}} World Series as the New York Giants and Philadelphia Athletics.  The Giants won in 1905, and the Athletics won in 1911 and 1913. Hall of Famers such as [[John McGraw]], [[Roger Bresnahan]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Joe McGinnity]] and [[Rube Marquard]] took part on the Giants side while the Athletics had [[Connie Mack]], [[Chief Bender]], [[Eddie Plank]], [[Rube Waddell]], [[Frank Baker]] and [[Eddie Collins]].

==The Move to the Bay==

===1989 World Series===
{{main|1989 World Series}}
The San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics met for the first time in the [[1989 World Series]]. This series was interrupted minutes before Game 3 on October 17, 1989 when the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|earthquake]] struck the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] with a 7.1 on the [[Richter Scale]]. The resulting damage to both [[Candlestick Park]] and to a lesser extent the [[Oakland Coliseum]], along with the emotional and economic damage to the area, delayed the resumption of the series for 10 days, the longest interval between games in [[World Series]] history. The earthquake caused the collapse of a portion of the [[San Francisco â Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]], the centerpiece of many promotions for the &quot;Bay Area Series.&quot;

The Athletics swept the Giants to win their most recent World Series championship.

===Interleague Play===
Both teams met for the first time in the regular season in June of 1997.

The Giants' [[Barry Zito]] started 0-4 against his former team, finally beating the Athletics on June 12, 2010 at AT&amp;T Park.

==Athletics Relocation Controversy==
The A's have been considering relocating to San Jose, CA for thirteen years but have reportedly met resistance from the Giants. San Jose is located in Santa Clara County, which is considered to be the Giants &quot;territory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=bryant_howard&amp;id=6665421|work=espn|title=Nowhere men.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
