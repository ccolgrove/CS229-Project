== History ==
=== Creative Suite 1 &amp; 2 ===
[[File:Adobe Creative Suite 2 logo.svg|right|thumb|250px|The Adobe Creative Suite 2 logo]]
The first version of Adobe Creative Suite was released in September 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200309/092903CREATIVESUITE.html |title=Adobe Creative Suite Press Release |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Creative Suite 2 in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200504/040405CreativeSuite.html |title=Creative Suite 2 Press Release |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two versions (CS and CS2) were available in two editions.

The Standard Edition included:

* Design guide and training resources

=== Creative Suite Production Studio ===
'''Adobe Creative Suite Production Studio''' (previously ''Adobe Video Collection'') was a suite of programs for acquiring, editing, and distributing digital video and audio that was released during the same timeframe as Adobe Creative Suite 1.  The suite was available in standard and premium editions.

The Standard edition consisted of:
* [[Adobe After Effects|Adobe After Effects Standard]]
* [[Adobe Bridge]]

Since CS3, Adobe Production Studio became part of the Creative Suite family. The equivalent version for Production Studio Premium is the ''Adobe Creative Suite Production Premium''.

=== Macromedia Studio ===
'''Macromedia Studio''' was a suite of programs designed for web content creation designed and distributed by Macromedia. After [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s 2005 acquisition of Macromedia, Macromedia Studio 8 was replaced, modified, and integrated into two editions of the Adobe Creative Suite family of software from version 2.3 onwards. The closest relatives of Macromedia Studio 8 are now called ''Adobe Creative Suite Web Premium''.

Core applications from Macromedia Studio have been merged with Adobe Creative Suite since CS3, including Flash, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks. Some Macromedia applications were absorbed into existing Adobe products, e.g. [[Macromedia FreeHand|FreeHand]] has been replaced with Adobe Illustrator. [[Macromedia Director|Director]] and [[Adobe ColdFusion|ColdFusion]] are not part of Adobe Creative Suite and will only be available as standalone products. The final version of Macromedia Studio released include:
* '''Macromedia Studio MX''' Released 29 May 2002, internally it was version 6 and the first incarnation of the studio to use the &quot;MX&quot; suffix, which for marketing purposes was a shorthand abbreviation that meant &quot;Maximize&quot;. Studio MX included Dreamweaver, Flash, FreeHand, Fireworks and a developer edition of ColdFusion.
* '''Macromedia Studio MX Plus''' Released 10 February 2003, sometimes referred to as MX 1.1. MX Plus was a special edition release of MX that included Freehand MX (replacing Freehand 10), Contribute and DevNet Resource Kit Special Edition in addition to the existing MX suite of products.
* '''Macromedia Studio MX 2004''' Released 10 September 2003, despite its name, it is internally version 7. Studio MX 2004 included FreeHand along with updated versions of Dreamweaver, Flash and Fireworks. An alternate version of Studio MX 2004 included Flash Professional and a new interface for Dreamweaver.
* '''Macromedia Studio 8''' Released 13 September 2005, Studio 8 was the last version of Macromedia Studio. It comprised Dreamweaver 8, Flash 8, Flash 8 Video Converter, Fireworks 8, Contribute 3 and [[Macromedia FlashPaper|FlashPaper]].

All of the above editions included shared applications and services including [[Adobe Bridge]], [[Adobe Version Cue]] (except Production Premium), [[Adobe Device Central]], [[Adobe Acrobat Connect]] and [[Adobe Stock Photos]]. [[Adobe Dynamic Link]], [[Adobe OnLocation]] (Windows only) and [[Adobe Ultra]] (Windows only) were included in Production Premium and Master Collection editions.

CS3 included several programs, including [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], and [[Adobe Fireworks|Fireworks]] that were developed by [[Macromedia]], a former rival acquired by Adobe in 2005. It also included [[Adobe OnLocation]] and [[Adobe Ultra]] that were developed by Serious Magic, also a firm acquired by Adobe in 2006.

Adobe dropped the following programs (that were previously included in CS2) from the CS3 software bundles:&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Adobe Audition]] ''(replaced by [[Adobe Soundbooth]])''

Adobe had announced that it would continue to develop Audition as a standalone product, while GoLive had been discontinued. Adobe GoLive 9 was released as a standalone product on June 10, 2007. Adobe Audition 3 was announced as a standalone product on September 6, 2007. Adobe had discontinued ImageReady and had replaced it with Fireworks, with some of ImageReady's features integrated into Photoshop.

=== Creative Suite 4 ===
[[File:Adobe Creative Suite 4 logo.png|right|thumb|250px|Adobe Creative Suite 4 logo]]
Adobe Creative Suite 4 (CS4) was announced on September 23, 2008 and officially released on October 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All applications in CS4 featured the same user interface, with a new tabbed interface for working with concurrently running Adobe CS4 programs where multiple applications can be opened inside multiple tabs contained in a single window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atelier-us.com/consumers-and-ecommerce/article/adobe-creative-suite-4-release-brings-unprecedented-efficiency-via-a-unified-application-interface |title=Adobe Creative Suite 4 Software Brings Unprecedented Efficiency via a Unified Application Interface |publisher=Atelier-us.com |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe CS4 was also developed to perform better under 64-bit and multi-core processors. On [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], Adobe Photoshop CS4 ran natively as a [[64-bit]] application. Although they were not natively 64-bit applications, Adobe After Effects CS4 and Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 have been optimized for 64-bit computers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/production/pdfs/cs4_production_premium_64bit_wp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were no 64-bit versions of CS4 available for [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Adobe_CS4_will_be_64bit_but_only_on_Windows/1207258861 |title=Adobe CS4 will be 64-bit, but only on Windows |publisher=Betanews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early testing of 64-bit support in Adobe Photoshop CS4, overall performance gains ranged from 8% to 12%, due to the fact that 64-bit applications could address larger amounts of memory and thus resulted in less file swapping â one of the biggest factors that can affect data processing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/faq/ |title=Adobe Photoshop CS4: FAQ |publisher=Adobe.com |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two programs were dropped from the CS4 line-up: [[Adobe Ultra]], a vector keying application which utilizes image analysis technology to produce high quality [[chroma key]] effects in less than ideal lighting environments and provides keying of a subject into a virtual 3D environment through virtual set technology, and [[Adobe Stock Photos]]. Below is a matrix of the applications that were bundled in each of the software suites for CS4:

=== Creative Suite 5 ===
=== Creative Suite 5.5 ===
Following the release of CS5 in April 2010, Adobe changed its release strategy to an every other year release of major number installments. CS 5.5 was presented on April 12th, 2011, as an in-between program. The update helps developers optimize websites for a variety of tablets, smart phones, and other devices. At the same time, Adobe announced a subscription based pay service as an alternative to full purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Product Family. 2011, April 10. http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/04/introducing-adobe-creative-suite-5-5-product-family.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2011, Adobe Systems announced its Switcher Program, which will allow people who have purchased any version of Apple's Final Cut Pro (or Avid Media Composer) to receive a 50 percent discount on Creative Suite CS 5.5 Production Premium or Premiere Pro CS 5.5.&lt;ref&gt; Don Reisinger, CNET. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20076042-17/adobe-tries-discounts-to-woo-final-cut-pro-ranters/?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Adobe tries discounts to woo Final Cut Pro ranters].&quot; Jul 1, 2011. Retrieved Jul 1, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Future versions===
During an Adobe conference call on June 21, 2011, CEO [[Shantanu Narayen]] said that the April 2011 launch of CS5.5 was &quot;the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle,&quot;  adding, &quot;We intend to ship the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012, and it will include an updated version of Photoshop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/pdfs/Q211_Script_FINAL_Draft_FOR_RELEASE.pdf?PID=2159997 |title=Q2 Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Call Script  |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person posting as an Adobe employee on Adobe's forum said on May 27, 2011, that &quot;CS6 is scheduled for release around May 2012.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/message/3705280#3705280 |title=Audition CS5.5 |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
