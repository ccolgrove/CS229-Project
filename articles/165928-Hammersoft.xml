'''The Flamingos''' were a [[doo wop]] group from the [[United States]], most popular in the mid to late 1950s and best known for their 1959 [[cover version]] of &quot;[[I Only Have Eyes for You]]&quot;.

==Early quintet==
Jacob Carey (Jake) and Ezekial Carey (Zeke), bass and 2nd tenor, respectively, formed the group in [[Chicago, Illinois]], after meeting cousins [[baritone]] [[Paul Wilson]] and first tenor [[Johnny Carter (singer)|John E. &quot;Johnny&quot; Carter]] at a [[Church of God and Saints of Christ|Hebrew Israelite]] congregation.  Earl Lewis (not [[the Channels]] lead) soon joined, and after a series of name changes, ('''The Swallows''', '''El Flamingos''', '''The Five Flamingos'''), wound up being known as The Flamingos.  Sollie McElroy soon replaced Lewis (who joined [[The Five Echoes]]). The Flamingos' first single (for [[Chance Records]]), &quot;[[If I Can't Have You]]&quot;, was a moderate local success, as was the follow-up &quot;[[That's My Desire (1931 song)|That's My Desire]]&quot;, but it was Johnny Carter's composition of &quot;Golden Teardrops,&quot; with its complex vocal harmonies and Carter's soaring [[falsetto]], that cemented their reputation as a top regional act of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldberg&quot;&gt;[http://home.att.net/~uncamarvy/Flamingos/flamingos.html Marv Goldberg's R&amp;B Notebooks - FLAMINGOS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flamingos left Chance Records sometime after their December 1953 session and signed with DJ Al Benson's [[Parrot Records (blues label)|Parrot Records]]. Sollie McElroy was on their first Parrot session, but left the group in December 1954, to be replaced by tenor Nate Nelson (who was on their second Parrot session; he's lead on &quot;I'm Yours,&quot; released in January 1955). In early 1955, the Flamingos signed with [[Chess Records]], to record for their [[Checker Records]] [[subsidiary]].  At Chess/Checker, the Flamingos achieved their first national chart hit with &quot;[[I'll Be Home]]&quot;, which went to #5 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&amp;B]] chart ([[Pat Boone|Pat Boone's]] cover version, complete with incorrect lyrics, was a hit on the pop charts).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  The group also had moderate success for the label with other chestnuts like &quot;A Kiss From Your Lips,&quot; &quot;The Vow,&quot; and &quot;Would I Be Crying&quot;.  The Flamingos also appeared in the 1956 [[Alan Freed]] movie, ''[[Rock, Rock, Rock (film)|Rock, Rock Rock]]''.  Both Zeke Carey and Carter were drafted that year (Carter was drafted in September).&lt;ref name=&quot;goldberg&quot; /&gt;

Nate Nelson, Jake Carey, and Paul Wilson continued the group with new member [[Tommy Hunt]] (added in October 1956). Another new member, tenor/lead, [[guitarist]], and [[music arranger|arranger]] [[Terry &quot;Buzzy&quot; Johnson]], joined in late December of that year. This group (Nate Nelson, Tommy Hunt, Terry Johnson, Paul Wilson, and Jake Carey) began recording for Decca Records in April [[1957 in music|1957]]. Their most notable single was Johnson's arrangement of &quot;The Ladder of Love&quot;, but legal entanglements between Checker and Nate Nelson ruined any chance of commercial success.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Zeke Carey returned to the Flamingos in 1958, making the group a [[sextet]]. (When Johnny Carter was discharged from the service, he joined [[The Dells]]; he had been with them for almost 50 years up until his death in 2009.) &lt;ref name=&quot;goldberg&quot; /&gt;

Zeke and Jake Carey were not blood-related, but were considered cousins, because of Zeke being adopted by Jake's aunt and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terryjohnsonsflamingos.com/History.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==End Records==
That year, the Flamingos began recording for [[George Goldner|George Goldner's]] [[End Records]] in New York City, where they had several national hits.  Almost immediately, the group had their first pop chart hit with &quot;Lovers Never Say Goodbye&quot;, written by Terry Johnson, who shared lead chores on the song with Paul Wilson.  The formula was a winner as Terry and Paul also led three of the 12 songs selected for their first album ''Flamingo Serenade'' - [[George Gershwin|George Gershwin's]] &quot;[[Love Walked In]]&quot;, &quot;[[But Not for Me (song)|But Not For Me]]&quot; and &quot;[[Time Was]]&quot;.  The Flamingos would have their biggest seller in 1959 with another old standard from that LP, on which Nate Nelson handled lead chores.  &quot;[[I Only Have Eyes for You]]&quot; (written in 1934 by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin for the film [[Dames]]) became their biggest seller, and has been featured in dozens of movies and TV shows.  A long series of hits followed, including the Johnson-penned &quot;[[Mio Amore]]&quot;, [[Doc Pomus]]' composition &quot;[[Your Other Love]]&quot;, &quot;[[Nobody Loves Me Like You]]&quot; (written for the group by [[Sam Cooke]]), and &quot;[[I Was Such a Fool]]&quot;.  LP cuts &quot;Love Walked In&quot; and &quot;Time Was&quot; were also issued as singles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  That same year, they appeared in the Alan Freed movie, ''Go, Johnny, Go'', singing a frenetic version of &quot;Jump Children&quot; (originally recorded for [[Chance Records]] in the early days).  The group became known almost as much for their stage show and [[choreography]] as for their harmonies.  Groups including [[The Temptations]] and [[Tavares (band)|The Tavares]] would later credit the group as major influences.

==Splintering==
[[Image:Flamingos60s.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Album cover showing the Flamingos, mid to late 1960s. Top: Jake Carey, Julien Vaught. Bottom: Zeke Carey, Doug McClure, Alan Fontaine.]]

The group began to come apart at the turn of the decade. Tommy Hunt left for a solo career in 1960. Nate Nelson and Terry Johnson split to form the &quot;Modern Flamingos&quot; in 1961, and  went on to record as [[The Starglows]] on [[Atco Records]] in 1963. (The Modern Flamingos name was used later; the group would include members of the defunct [[Del-Knights]] in the late 1960s). New members were brought in, making the group Zeke Carey (tenor), Jake Carey (bass), Paul Wilson (baritone), [[Billy Clarke]] (tenor), [[Eddie Williams (saxophonist)|Eddie Williams]] (tenor), Alan Fontaine (guitar), and [http://www.julienandellavaught.com/ Julien Vaught] (saxophone). Clarke and Williams took duties on most new lead vocals.

A sixth vocalist, Doug McClure, was added in 1962. Shortly afterwards, Clarke and Williams left the group. Founding member Paul Wilson left in [[1964 in music|1964]], new member Sidney Hall joined in 1966, and Jacob Carey's son J.C. Carey joined in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;worcestermag&quot;&gt;[http://www.worcestermagazine.com/content/view/2063/30/ Worcester Magazine - It's not old, it's vintage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded several uptempo songs through the 1960s, peaking at #26 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] with &quot;The Boogaloo Party&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The group continued recording into the 1970s. A new album was released in 1972 on Ronze, entitled ''The Flamingos Today''. By this time, the group was the Careys, McClure, Fontaine, the returning Billy Clarke, and former [[Shep and the Limelites|Limelite]] Clarence Bassett, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~uncamarvy/5Sharps/5sharps.html Marv Goldberg's R&amp;B Notebooks - 5 SHARPS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bassettbranches.org/newsletters/2006/20060521/20060521.shtml Bassett Family Association Newsletter May 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; New member Frank &quot;Mingo&quot; Ayers joined soon after.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockabillynl&quot;&gt;[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/flamingos.htm Flamingos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; More mildly successful recordings came in this decade, including the uptempo &quot;Heavy Hips&quot;, and &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;.

By 1980 the group was Jake Carey, Zeke Carey, Frank Ayers, and Jerome Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bomsey-autographs.com/cgi-bin/sigList.pl Edward N. Bomsey Autographs, Inc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ayers left around this time, joining the [[Del-Vikings|Del Vikings]]. In 1984, two new members joined: Bennie Cherry and Archie Satterfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchofsilkvocalgroup.com/About.htm About Touch of Silk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the group was featured at the 1988 [[Grammy Awards]]. 

By the early 1990s, the group was the Careys, Satterfield, Ron Reace, and [[Kenny Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rockabillynl&quot; /&gt; Later, it was the Careys, Reace, and King Raymond Green.&lt;ref&gt;CD jacket; ''Doo Wop 50 Live!''&lt;/ref&gt; Jake Carey died in 1997. The group recorded a new album, ''Unspoken Emotions'', under the Ronze label in 1999. It featuring re-recordings of &quot;Ain't Nothing But A Party&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Home&quot;, led by Zeke Carey. The group appeared on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television special ''[[Doo Wop 50]]'' that same year. The lineup was Zeke Carey, J.C. Carey, Ron Reace, King Raymond Green, and [[Larry Jordan]]. Zeke Carey died in 2001. King Raymond Green and Ron Reace left around that time and were replaced by Earnest &quot;Just Mike&quot; Gilbert and former [[The Dynamic Superiors|Dynamic Superior]] George Spann. James Faison entered shortly thereafter. Tommy Hunt has flown in from England (where he has lived since 1970) to perform with this group twice since 2001.

The group split up in late 2005 due to money disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mccracken.itgo.com/docs/flamingos.html Message&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Spann, Jordan, Gilbert, and Faison grouped together to reform Spann's old group, The Dynamic Superiors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jsoundsproductions.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; Carey brought in new members, and toured with Tommy Hunt starting in April 2007. The current lineup is Carey, Victor Brown, Philip &quot;Flip&quot; Thomas (founding member of [[Crown Heights Affair]]), the returning Sidney Hall and Doug McClure.&lt;ref name=&quot;worcestermag&quot; /&gt;

==Other Flamingos groups==
Terry Johnson owns the trademark &quot;The Flamingos&quot; and leads a Flamingos' group, which has appeared on two PBS specials: ''Doo Wop at Fifty'' (in which they were the only group to have more than two songs featured) and ''Doo Wop Cavalcade: The Definitive Anthology''. Terry always has talented singers from around the country, to join him in representing  The Flamingos' name and music.. Johnson's group maintains a full schedule of doo wop revival concerts and private functions. They are working on a 50th anniversary album and Johnson is working on a solo album, entitled 'Still in the Pink'.

Ron Reace also leads a [http://www.ronreacesflamingos.com/ Flamingos group].

There was an unrelated doo-wop group based in [[Los Angeles]] that called itself &quot;The Flamingos&quot;, operating in the early fifties. Its members were Gaynel Hodge, Cornelius Gunter, Joe Jefferson, Curtis Williams and Richard Berry. When the Chicago Flamingos hit nationally, they changed their name to the Turks, but eventually disbanded, and went on to greater things. Williams was one of the founders of [[The Penguins]]; Hodge, Gunter and Jefferson joined the pre-recording-career edition of [[The Platters]], Gunter eventually joining The Coasters, while Richard Berry went on to sing on &quot;[[Riot In Cell Block Nine|Riot in Cell Block #9]]&quot; and &quot;The Wallflower&quot;, and to write &quot;[[Louie Louie]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Marsh, ''Louie Louie''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pepsi lawsuit==
Current Flamingos member J.C. Carey, along with Terry Johnson, Tommy Hunt, and descendants of Nate Nelson and Paul Wilson, sued [[PepsiCo]] for having used &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; in a 1998 [[television commercial]], allegedly without having consulted the group. The group was awarded $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.targetmarketnews.com/storyid01310601.htm The Flamingos wins settlement from Pepsi for unauthorized use of song&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The Flamingos received the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation Pioneer Award in 1996 (where Terry Johnson, Jake Carey, Zeke Carey, Tommy Hunt and Johnny Carter performed) and were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2000, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, and the Doo-Wopp&lt;!--correct spelling is two &quot;p&quot;s, see http://www.harveyrobbins.net/id2.htm--&gt; Hall of Fame in 2004. The group that performed at the Rock Hall ceremony included Terry Johnson on lead, Tommy Hunt and Johnny Carter.
