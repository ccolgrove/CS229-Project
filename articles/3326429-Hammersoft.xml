'''WIPR-TV''' is an [[non-commercial educational]], full-power [[public television]] station located in San Juan, Puerto Rico transmitting over analog channel 6, digital 43. The station is owned and operated by CorporaciÃ³n de Puerto Rico para la DifusiÃ³n PÃºblica ''('''English:''' Puerto Rico Corporation for Public Broadcasting)''. Most of its [[television show|television shows]] on the main channel is [[local programming]].

Because of its audience, much of WIPR's programming is in Spanish, as with most Puerto Rico television stations. The station is branded as ''Puerto Rico TV''. Previously, the station was branded as ''Teve 6 / Teve 3'' and ''TUTV - Tu Universo TelevisiÃ³n''.

WIPR-TV operates a [[semi-satellite]] on the island west Coast, '''WIPM-TV''', channel 3 in [[MayagÃ¼ez, Puerto Rico|MayagÃ¼ez]]. WIPM-TV largely repeats WIPR, but does produce some local programming. WIPM-TV transmits its digital signal on channel 35, virtual 3.

==History==
WIPR-TV was created as a result of lobbying for public broadcasting in Puerto Rico, beginning in the 1950s. The station went on the air for the first time on [[Three Kings Day]] (January 6), 1958 becoming the first [[educational television]] station in Latin America.

It was also unique among other government-controlled broadcasters in the [[Caribbean]] as it did not show [[commercials]]. All other government-controlled broadcasters (with the exception of [[Cuba]] and the [[US Virgin Islands]]) showed [[advertising]].

The station was one of the few TV stations in Puerto Rico with English-language programming, via a membership with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (and an affiliation with [[National Educational Television]] prior to PBS' founding in 1970); this ended on July 1, 2011 after WIPR and PBS failed to reach an agreement to renew the station's membership, with money previously allocated to PBS membership dues being invested in the station's extensive local programming.  PBS programming remains available on Puerto Rico via [[WMTJ]].&lt;ref name=c-wiprnopbs&gt;{{cite news|last=Sefton|first=Dru|title=Puerto Rican station drops PBS shows|url=http://www.current.org/ptv/ptv1115puertorico.html|accessdate=October 11, 2011|newspaper=[[Current (newspaper){{!}}Current]]|date=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[1996]], WIPR-TV was the first Puerto Rican television station that used [[streaming media]] to broadcast programming to the [[internet]].
