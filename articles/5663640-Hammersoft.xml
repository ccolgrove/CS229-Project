Schwartz|publisher=Air Force Link|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously served as Commander, [[United States Transportation Command]] from  September 2005 to August 2008. As Chief of Staff, he serves as the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the organization, training and equipping of nearly 700,000 active-duty, Guard, Reserve and civilian forces serving in the United States and overseas. As a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the general and other service chiefs function as military advisers to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[President of the United States|President]]. He assumed his current assignment on August 12, 2008.

General Schwartz graduated from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1973. He is an alumnus of the [[National War College]], a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and a 1994 Fellow of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Seminar XXI. He has served as Commander of the [[United States Special Operations Command|U.S. Special Operations Command]]-Pacific, as well as [[Alaskan Command]], Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region and the 11th Air Force.

General Schwartz is a command pilot with more than 4,400 flying hours in a variety of aircraft. He participated as a crewmember in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon, and in 1991 served as Chief of Staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq in operations [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] and [[Desert Storm]]. In 1997, he led the Joint Task Force that prepared for the noncombatant evacuation of U.S. citizens in Cambodia.

General Schwartz is the first Air Force Chief of Staff not to have a background as a fighter or bomber pilot, and it is speculated that [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] picked him for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defensetech.org/2008/06/13/schwartz-a-chief-to-mend-fences/ &quot;Schwartz a Chief to Mend Fences&quot;], ''Defense Tech'', June 13, 2008.
