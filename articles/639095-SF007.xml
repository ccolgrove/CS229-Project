'''RealPlayer''' is a [[cross-platform]] [[media player (application software)|media player]] by [[RealNetworks]] that plays a number of multimedia formats including [[MP3]], [[MPEG-4]], [[QuickTime]], [[Windows Media]], and multiple versions of [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] [[RealAudio]] and [[RealVideo]] formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;suppreal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.real.com/product/help/r1p_v2g/en/MM_Media_Formats.htm |title=Supported Formats by RealOne Player |publisher=Home.real.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611210214/http://home.real.com/product/help/r1p_v2g/en/MM_Media_Formats.htm |archivedate = June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first version of RealPlayer was introduced in April 1995 as '''RealAudio Player''', one of the first media players capable of [[streaming media]] over the [[Internet]]. Version 4.01 of RealPlayer was included as a selectable internet tool in [[Windows 98|MS Windows 98]] installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/scripts/sysadmin/answerfile_w98.htm |title=msbatch.inf - Unattended and Customized Installation of Windows 98 |accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 6 of RealPlayer was called RealPlayer G2; version 9 was called RealOne Player. Free &quot;Basic&quot; versions have been provided as well as paid &quot;Plus&quot; versions with additional features. On Windows, version 9 subsumed the features of the separate program [[RealJukebox]].

RealPlayer 11 was released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] in November 2007, and for [[Mac OS X]] in May 2008. Versions of RealPlayer are also available for [[Linux]], [[Unix]], [[Palm OS]], [[Windows Mobile]], and [[Symbian|Symbian OS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaaaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realnetworks.com/products/media_players.html |title=RealPlayer - Multiple Editions |publisher=Realnetworks.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is powered by an underlying [[open source]] media engine called [[Helix (multimedia project)|Helix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://helixcommunity.org/beula/ |title=Helix Community License |publisher=Helixcommunity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RealPlayer was a popular [[streaming media]] player during the early years of the [[Internet]], but in recent years it has been surpassed in market share by [[Windows Media Player]], and, since mid-2007, Apple's [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By website optimization on 18 Jan 2008 AM |url=http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/0801/ |title=iTunes Passes RealPlayer in Unique Users |publisher=Websiteoptimization.com |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many users would have initially encountered RealPlayer as a plugin to watch streaming video or listen to streaming audio, e.g. the [[BBC]]'s websites at one time used this almost exclusively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/help/faq/download_and_install_realplayer.shtml |title=How do I download and install RealPlayer?|publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years [[Adobe Flash]] has become a much more popular format for this as demonstrated by the comparable success of [[BBC iPlayer]]. As a streaming media player, the number of unique users using RealPlayer has fallen by 50% over the 3 year period from March 2007 to March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

The latest version of RealPlayer, RealPlayer 14, was released November 10, 2010. Highlights for this version include enabling the user to easily transfer video, music, and photos between their computer and mobile devices, share links of videos and photos to sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]], and download videos from popular sites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Metacafe|Meta CafÃ©]] with one click.

==Features==
'''RealPlayer''', beyond its function as an audio/video player, also contains additional features such as:

* '''Media Browser''' based on [[Internet Explorer]] which allows web browsing while playing media.
* '''Playlist editor''' similar to other [[media player (application software)|media player]]s, supporting &quot;drag and drop&quot; and playlist randomize.
* '''Theater Mode''' (full screen mode) video playback. This will only play on monitor 1 of a multi-monitor windows PC. The paid version offers a skinnable '''Toolbar Mode''' which uses less desktop space.
* '''Visualizations''' - graphical animations or &quot;light shows&quot;. Five are included with RealPlayer set-up. Others are available from RealNetworks, including a 3D Visualization Plug-In Surreal.FX.
* '''Continuous Play''' (Loop multiple songs) and '''Shuffle Play''' (Play tracks randomly; however, RealPlayer will select the random tracks in sequence e.g. Track 1, Track 5, Track 2, Track 6, Track 3 etc.).
* '''Stay on top while playing''' option.
* '''Favorites menu''' to save and recall media locations for files or streams.
* '''Equalizer''' and '''Video controls'''. '''Crossfade''' and '''Gapless playback''' are included in RealPlayer Plus.

* '''LivePause''' pauses streaming video clips without having to stop the buffering.
* Version 10.5 included [[FairPlay#Harmony: RealPlayer Music on the iPod|Harmony]] technology, making the Music Store compatible with [[iPod]] and [[Windows Media DRM]]-compatible players.
* Both the basic and the plus version can '''burn CDs'''. The current burning technology is powered by NPI; formerly it was powered by [[Adaptec]] (Roxio). The free version can burn audio and data CDs; the premium version burns MP3 CDs.
* '''CD ripping''' into AAC (in [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]]) (32 kbit/s - 320 kbit/s) (default), Real Audio 10 (32 kbit/s - 320 kbit/s), MP3 (32 kbit/s - 320 kbit/s),  Real Audio Lossless, WAV (1411 kbit/s), Windows Media Audio (Requires Windows Media Player 10 installed) (64 kbit/s - 192 kbit/s) formats.
* '''RealPlayer Music Store''' allows users to locate, preview, and purchase songs, which cost $0.49 to $0.99.

==Editions==
===RealPlayer for Windows===
'''RealPlayer SP''' includes audio CD burning capabilities, DVR-style playback buffering, multimedia search, Internet radio, a jukebox-style file library, an embedded web browser (using Microsoft Internet Explorer), and the ability to convert and transfer media to a wide range of devices: Music players such as [[iPod]] and [[Zune]], smartphones such as [[iPhone]] and [[BlackBerry]], portable gaming devices such as [[PlayStation Portable|Sony PSP]], and console gaming systems such as [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3|PS3]], and [[Wii]]. Since version 11, RealPlayer SP has gained Flash Video support, DVD, SVCD, VCD burning (120-minute) and video recording (DRM is supported).

{{As of |2011}} '''RealPlayer Enterprise''' is a licensed product&lt;!--no longer free--&gt; for enterprise applications which can be customized and remotely administered by RealPlayer Enterprise Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realnetworks.com/products/rpe/index.html |title=RealPlayer Enterprise |publisher=Real Networks |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The free ''Realplayer Enterprise Education Edition'' has been removed.&lt;ref name=RPEntEdu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forms.real.com/rnforms/products/tools/rpedist/index.html |title=Realplayer Enterprise Education Edition download |publisher=Real Networks |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions of Realplayer Enterprise are lightweight, ad-free versions of Real Player, missing most consumer features and most plug-in support. The RealSched.exe update reminder can be disabled in two steps, and it is not reinstalled upon running the player.

===RealPlayer for Mac OS X===
[[File:RealPlayer browser.png|thumb|RealPlayer 10's browser showing the RealPlayer Wikipedia page.]]

RealPlayer for Mac OS X is distributed for free. The latest current stable release {{as of|lc=y|2010|07}} is version RealPlayer SP 1.0. It includes Real's Helix playback engine for RealAudio and RealVideo, a 10-band equalizer and video adjustment controls, and a full-screen, resizable &quot;theater mode&quot; for video playback, as well as many features found in its Windows counterpart.

Since the release of version 10.0 in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realnetworks.com/company/press/releases/2004/real_macbeta.html |title=RealNetworks announces RealPlayer 10 for Mac OS X |publisher=Realnetworks.com |date=2004-06-28 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/15540&amp;vid=152394 |title=Release notes from |publisher=Versiontracker |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; RealPlayer has become much more closely integrated with Mac OS X including features such as:
* QuickTime playback support (including full-screen viewing which Apple only introduced to its own basic [[QuickTime|QuickTime Player]] in 2007)
* An integrated Web browser based on Apple's [[WebKit]] framework, resulting in RealPlayer and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] sharing cookies.
* Support for [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] to share Internet favorites.
* [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] user interface.

===RealPlayer for Linux/Unix===
RealPlayer for Linux/Unix was developed separately from the Windows and Mac versions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The client is based on the open-source [[Helix (multimedia project)|Helix Player]] which can be found at the [https://helixcommunity.org/ Helix Community Website]. It supports Windows Media 7/8, RealAudio/Video, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis.  The interface depends on the current [[GTK+]] theme.

===RealPlayer for Android===
The Android version of RealPlayer is currently available as a free download from the Android Market. It supports Real Audio, Real Video, MP3, 3GP, AMR and other media formats.

===RealPlayer for Symbian===
The Symbian version of RealPlayer allows mobile phones to play Real Audio, Real Video, MP3, 3GP, AMR and other media formats. It is provided as [[freeware]]. In newer Symbian devices it can also be used to stream both audio and video content in the form of MP3 (music) and 3GP (videos).

===RealPlayer for Palm===
RealPlayer 1.6.1 (US) or RealPlayer 1.6.0 (worldwide) is available for free for PalmOne-made [[Palm OS]] 5 devices, such as the [[Palm Tungsten]] or [[Zire Handheld|Zire]] series.&lt;ref name=&quot;palmone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.real.com/realmobile/palmone.html |title=RealPlayer for palmOne Handhelds |publisher=Real.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also compatible with RealPlayer Music Store tracks. However, they will neither install nor run on non-PalmOne-made devices like [[Sony|Sony's]] [[CLIÃ|Clie]] line of PDAs. They also do not support modern Palm smartphones such as the treo 700p, 755p, or Centro, although the treo 600 and 650 are listed as supported devices. Their Web page regarding PalmOS support (shown above) gives no indication if support for those devices will ever be provided.

===RealJukebox===
RealJukebox was a [[computer program]] released by [[RealNetworks]] that allowed users to organise their digital music. It was first released in May 1999. By late 2001 the functions of the program had been integrated into the Real's core media player program, RealPlayer.

==Controversy==
[[File:Realplayer message center.JPG|thumb|RealPlayer's Message Center has been criticized for its pop-up advertisements]]

Past versions of RealPlayer have been criticized for containing features similar to [[adware]] and [[spyware]]. In 1999 security researcher Richard M. Smith dissected some of RealJukebox's [[network traffic measurement|network traffic]] and discovered that it was sending a unique identifier with information about the music titles to which its users were listening.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web

''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' magazine named RealPlayer (1999 Version) as #2 in its 2006 list ''The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time'', writing that RealPlayer &quot;had a disturbing way of making itself a little too much at home on your PC--installing itself as the default media player, taking liberties with your Windows Registry, popping up annoying 'messages' that were really just advertisements, and so on.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tynan25&gt;{{cite web

In 2008 [[StopBadware.org]] labeled RealPlayer &quot;[[Malware|badware]]&quot; for not completely disclosing software components it installs as well as those it leaves behind after being un-installed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=realplayer01282008 |title=StopBadware Report: Realplayer |publisher=StopBadware.org |date=2008-01-28  |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Chasen, vice president for RealPlayer, responded by stating: &quot;I actually admire what StopBadware is trying to do to keep consumers safe.  But in this case the only thing bad is the report itself.  Hereâs why: Not a single claim raised by StopBadware actually hurts anyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Realâs Response to StopBadware.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rws-blog.rhapsody.com/realplayer/2008/02/reals-response.html |title=Realâs Response to StopBadware.org blog entry| publisher=Rws-blog.rhapsody.com |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2009-07-16 |archivedate=2008-02-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080227180404/http://rws-blog.rhapsody.com/realplayer/2008/02/reals-response.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RealPlayer ''Message Center'' has caused controversy due to its pop-up advertisements. In previous versions of the program the Message Center had a reputation for being difficult to turn off completely. In RealPlayer 11 it will not appear unless it is turned on by the user.

When RealPlayer for Windows is installed, a [[Process (computing)|process]] called ''tkbell.exe'' will run automatically each time the computer starts up, and may appear on the list of active processes as ''realsched.exe''.  The process is linked to the ''Message Center'' and can also check for updates to the program.  The process is non-essential and is not considered to be harmful, but has been seen as a nuisance by some users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auditmypc.com/process/tkbell.asp |first=James |last=Maurer |title=What is '&amp;#39;'tkbell.exe'&amp;#39;'? |publisher=Auditmypc.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be disabled by altering the settings of RealPlayer's Message Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.help2go.com/Tutorials/MP3%10Audio/Disable_RealPlayer_realsched.exe.html |title=Disable RealPlayer realsched.exe |publisher=Help2Go|first= Oscar|last= Sodani |date=2004-07-07 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060111184746/http://www.help2go.com/Tutorials/MP3%10Audio/Disable_RealPlayer_realsched.exe.html |archivedate=2006-01-11 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier Windows versions of RealPlayer experienced a problem with the volume control, where muting the sound in the program would also mute all system sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=User Telstar|url=http://forums.techguy.org/multimedia/384746-adjusting-realplayer-volume-affects-comp.html |title=Adjusting RealPlayer volume affects Comp volume settings |publisher=Forums.techguy.org |date=2005-07-26 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real Alternative==
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play [[RealMedia]] files without installing RealPlayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;filehippo-ra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Alternative 2.02|url=http://www.filehippo.com/download_real_alternative/|work=[[FileHippo]]|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;download.com-ra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Alternative|url=http://download.cnet.com/Real-Alternative/3000-2139_4-10698783.html|work=[[Download.com]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=August 29, 2011|date=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010.

Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year old Dutch webmaster for having inserted [[hyperlink]]s to Real Alternative on his website www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a [[reverse engineer]]ed package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=De Winter |first=Brenno |title=RealNetworks crushes Dutch webmaster for hyperlink |url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/tech-industry/3299285/realnetworks-crushes-dutch-webmaster-for-hyperlink/ |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |newspaper=PC Advisor |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Download.com]]&lt;ref name=&quot;download.com-ra&quot; /&gt; and [[FileHippo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;filehippo-ra&quot; /&gt; continue to host the software product, unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=RealNetworks Destroying Dutch Webmaster's Life Because He Linked To A Reverse Engineered Alternative|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110826/00013315692/realnetworks-destroying-dutch-webmasters-life-because-he-linked-to-reverse-engineered-alternative.shtml|accessdate=August 29, 2011|newspaper=TechDirt|date=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
