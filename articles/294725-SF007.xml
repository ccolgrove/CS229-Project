The '''ROX Desktop''' is a graphical [[desktop environment]] for the [[X Window System]]. It is based on the '''ROX-Filer''' which is a  drag and drop [[spatial file manager]]. It is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. The environment was inspired by the user interface of [[RISC OS]]. Programs can be installed or removed easily using [[Zero Install]].

==The desktop==

The '''ROX Desktop''' is a [[desktop environment]] based on the ROX-Filer [[file manager]]. Files are loaded by [[drag and drop|dragging]] them to an application from the filer, and saved by dragging back to the filer. Applications are [[Application Directory|executable directories]], and are thus also [[Installation (computer programs)|installed]] (copied), uninstalled (deleted), and run through the filer interface. ROX has a strong link with [[Zero Install]], a method of identifying and executing programs via a [[URL]], to make software installation completely automatic.

It is inspired by the user interface of [[RISC OS]] (not to be confused with [[RISC/os]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact2002.html ROX founder: Why I brought RISC OS to Unix]&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;ROX&quot; comes from &quot;RISC OS on [[X Window System|X]]&quot;. The project was started by Thomas Leonard as a student at [[University of Southampton]] in 1999&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.sys.acorn.misc/msg/bdb27a8da23af4e6 comp.sys.acorn.misc - Re: ROX desktop]&lt;/ref&gt; and is still led by him in 2009.

The desktop uses the [[GTK+]] toolkit, like the [[GNOME]] and [[Xfce]] desktops. The design focuses on small, simple programs using drag-and-drop to move data between them. For example, a user might load a compressed file into a spreadsheet from the web by dragging the data from the web browser to the archiver, and from there into the spreadsheet. A program would be installed in the same way, by dragging the archive from the web to the archiver, and from there to the applications directory in the filer.

Drag-and-drop saving allows the user to save the text file to any directory they please, or directly to another application, such as the archiver on the panel.

'''ROX-Filer''' is a graphical [[spatial file manager]] for the [[X Window System]]. It can be used on its own as a file manager, or can be used as part of ROX Desktop. It is the file manager provided by default in certain [[Linux distribution]]s such as [[Puppy Linux]] and [[Dyne:bolic]], and was used in [[Xubuntu]] until [[Thunar]] became stable.

ROX-Filer is built using the [[GTK+]] toolkit. Available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, ROX-Filer is free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = COPYING | url = http://rox.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rox/releases/ROX-Filer-2.6.1/ROX-Filer/Help/COPYING?view=markup }}&lt;/ref&gt;
