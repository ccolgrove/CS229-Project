'''Bernard Fellay''', [[Society of St. Pius X|SSPX]] (born 12 April 1958) is a [[bishop]] and [[superior general]] of the [[Traditionalist Catholic]] [[Society of St. Pius X]]. In 1988, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] declared Fellay [[latae sententiae|automatically]] [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] through being [[EcÃ´ne Consecrations|consecrated a bishop]] by [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]], an act that the [[Holy See]] described as &quot;unlawful&quot; and &quot;[[Schism (religion)|schismatic]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html Apostolic Letter 'Ecclesia Dei']&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, at Fellay's request, the Holy See lifted the excommunication that it stated had automatically occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;212.77.1.245&quot;&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cbishops/documents/rc_con_cbishops_doc_20090121_remissione-scomunica_en.html Decree remitting the excommunication ''latae sententiae'' of the Bishops of the Society of St Pius X]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and ministry==
Fellay was born in [[Sierre|Sierre, Switzerland]] in 1958. In October 1977, at the age of nineteen, Fellay began studies for the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at [[the International Seminary of Saint Pius X]] at [[EcÃ´ne, Switzerland]]. On 29 June 1982 he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]]. After his ordination, he was named Bursar General of the SSPX and was stationed at [[Rickenbach]], the headquarters of the SSPX in Switzerland. He continued in that position for the next ten years.

==SSPX Superior General==
In July 1994 the General Chapter of the SSPX met at EcÃ´ne and elected Fellay Superior General in succession to Father [[Franz Schmidberger]]. On 12 July 2006, he was re-elected to another twelve-year term, which expires in 2018. Some opponents of the SSPX, most notably the [[Old Catholic]] run TRADITIO Network, have criticized the 12-year terms as too long, noting that other religious orders have 4-year terms. However, the SSPX has not announced a change in the term lengths.

On 29 August 2005 Fellay was received in audience by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] at [[Castel Gandolfo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.ca/Documents/Bishop-Fellay/DICI_Interview_Sept_2005.htm Interview with Bishop Fellay about Papal Audience]&lt;/ref&gt; The audience was also attended by [[DarÃ­o CastrillÃ³n Hoyos|Cardinal CastrillÃ³n Hoyos]] and Father Schmidberger. They discussed the present state of the Church and of the SSPX, the Society's concerns about [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] in the Church, the re-allowance of the [[Tridentine Mass]], and the possible recognition of the SSPX by the [[Holy See]].

By a decree of 21 January 2009 (Protocol Number 126/2009), which was issued in response to a renewed request that Bishop Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated on 30 June 1988, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by Pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of Saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the Pope's Magisterium and authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;212.77.1.245&quot; /&gt;  The canonical situation of the four bishops thus became the same as that of the other clergy of the Society, who are suspended ''a divinis''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CEDSSPX.HTM Letter of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei of 29 September 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remissions have not been unanimously welcomed by all members of the SSPX.  Fr. [[Florian Abrahamowicz]], a SSPX's dean of Northeastern Italy, called the action &quot;insulting,&quot; since it claimed to remit an excommunication of these four bishops that the Society had officially maintained since 1988 did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agerecontra.it/lasvolta/omelia_pronunciata_da_don_floriano_domenica_25_gen.html Homily on 25 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Abrahamowicz was very soon expelled by the Italian chapter of the Society of Saint Pius X, whether for this reason or his [[Holocaust]]-related remarks.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Father Florian Abrahamowicz has for some time been expressing opinions differing from the official views of the Society of St. Pius X. The painful decision to expel him has become necessary in order to avoid having the image of the Society of St. Pius X further distorted with consequent harm to its work at the service of the Church&quot; [http://www.ilmessaggero.it/articolo.php?id=45444&amp;sez=HOME_NELMONDO Lefebvriani, FraternitÃ  San Pio X espelle prete negazionista] 5 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in relation to the talks with Rome in an interview in July 2009, Fellay said of the significance of the Second Vatican Council that: &quot;'We will not make any compromise on the Council. I have no intention of making a compromise. The truth does not tolerate compromise. We do not want a compromise, we want clarity regarding the Council.'&quot; In February 2011, Fellay said that the reconciliation talks with the Vatican would soon be coming to an end, with little change in the views of either side. In addition to disputes over the changes introduced by the [[Second Vatican Council]], new problems have been created by plans for the [[Beatification and canonisation of Pope John Paul II|beatification of Pope John Paul II]]. Fellay said the scheduled beatification of Pope John Paul II on 1 May 2011 poses &quot;a serious problem, the problem of a pontificate that caused things to proceed by leaps and bounds in the wrong direction, along 'progressive' lines, toward everything that they call 'the spirit of Vatican II.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1100721.htm Traditionalist bishop cites lack of progress in talks with Vatican]&lt;/ref&gt;
