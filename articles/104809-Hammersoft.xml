The '''World Organization of the Scout Movement''' ('''WOSM''') is the [[non-governmental organization|Non-governmental international]] organization which governs most national [[Scouting|Scout Organizations]], with 31 million members. WOSM was established in 1920, and has its headquarters at [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. It is the counterpart of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS).

The mission of WOSM is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the [[Scout Promise]] and [[Scout Law]], to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;mission&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.scout.org/en/about_scouting/mission_vision | title = The Mission of Scouting | format = | work = | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; WOSM is organized into regions and operates with a conference, committee and bureau.

==World Scout Conference==
The '''World Scout Conference''' (WSC) is the governing body and meets every three years, preceded by the [[World Scout Youth Forum]]. The World Scout Conference is the general assembly of Scouting and is composed of six delegates from each of the member Scout associations. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation. The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/international/worldscout.html#wsc|work=WOSM World Scouting|title=World Scouting|accessdate=February 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association. At the World Scout Conference basic cooperative efforts are agreed upon and a plan of mutual coordination is adopted. The Conference directed the move of the World Scout Bureau from [[Ottawa, Canada]] to Geneva on May 1, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scout.org/en/our_organisation/governance/world_bureau/secretary_general/laszlo_nagy Laszlo Nagy (1921 - 2009) / Secretary General / World Bureau / Governance / Our Organisation / Home - World Organization of the Scout Movement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Scout Committee==
[[Image:World Scout Emblem 1939-1955.svg|thumb|140px|1939-1955 version of the [[World Scout Emblem]], used by the World Scout Committee]]

The '''World Scout Committee''' is the chief executive body of the World Scout Conference and is composed of elected volunteers. The World Scout Committee represents World Scout Conference between the meetings of the full conference. The World Scout Committee is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Scout Conference and for acting on its behalf between its meetings. The Committee meets twice a year, usually in [[Geneva]]. Its Steering Committee, consisting of the Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen and the Secretary General, meet as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scout.org/en/our_organisation/governance/world_committee|work=WOSM World Scouting|title=World Scout Committee|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee is composed of 14 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for six-year terms by the World Scout Conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, represent the interests of the movement as a whole, not those of their country. The Secretary General and the Treasurer of WOSM are ''ex-officio'' members of the Committee. The chairmen of the regional Scout committees participate in the World Scout Committee meetings in a consultative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/international/worldscout.html#wsc
|work=WOSM World Scouting|title=World Scouting|accessdate=2006-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Scout Committee has set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by the World Scout Conference, which at present include:
* Youth involvement
* Volunteers in Scouting
* Scouting's profile (communications, partnerships, resources)

Standing committees include:
* Audit
* Budget
* Constitutions
* Honours and Awards
* ''Working With Others''- a consultative committee of the WOSM and the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS), composed of members of the World Committee/World Board of both organizations
* 2007 Task Force for the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, composed of members of the World Scout Committee, World Scout Bureau, World Scout Foundation, and [[The Scout Association]] of the United Kingdom

* Note: &lt;small&gt;The World Scout Conference in 2008 decided that, starting at the World Conference in 2011, elected members will serve for only three years, but be eligible for re-election for one additional term.&lt;/small&gt;

===Bronze Wolf===
{{main|Bronze Wolf}}
The [[Bronze Wolf]] is the only distinction awarded by WOSM, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. It was first awarded to [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell]] by a unanimous decision of the then-''International Committee'' on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in [[Stockholm]] in 1935.

==World Scout Bureau==
[[Image:World Organization of the Scout Movement map.svg|400px|thumb|right|The World Scout Bureau is headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] and has offices in six regional divisions:
{{legend|#73C2FB|'''[[WOSM-European Region|European Region]]''': [[Geneva, Switzerland]]; [[Brussels, Belgium]] and [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]}}
{{legend|#32CD32|'''[[WOSM-Arab Region|Arab Region]]''': [[Cairo, Egypt]]}}
{{legend|#FFA500|'''[[WOSM-Africa Region|Africa Region]]''': [[Nairobi, Kenya]]; [[Cape Town, South Africa]]; and [[Dakar, Senegal]]}}
{{legend|#FF007F|'''[[WOSM-Asia-Pacific Region|Asia-Pacific Region]]''': [[Makati City|Makati City, Philippines]]; [[Australia]]; and [[Tokyo, Japan]]}}
{{legend|#FFD700|'''[[WOSM-Interamerican Region|Interamerican Region]]''': [[Ciudad del Saber, Panama]]}}
{{legend|#BF00FF|'''[[WOSM-Eurasian Region|Eurasian Region]]''': [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Moscow, Russia]]}}
{{legend|#D3D3D3|grey areas such as [[Burma]] and [[Cuba]] have no Scouting}}]]

The '''World Scout Bureau''' (WSB, formerly the '''International Bureau''') is the secretariat that carries out the instructions of the World Scout Conference and the World Scout Committee. The WSB is administered by the secretary general, who is supported by a small staff of technical resource personnel. The bureau staff helps associations improve and broaden their Scouting by training professionals and volunteers, establishing finance policies and money-raising techniques, improving community facilities and procedures, and assisting in marshaling the national resources of each country behind Scouting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/international/worldscout.html|work=WOSM World Scouting|title=World Scouting|accessdate=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff also helps arrange global events such as the [[World Scout Jamboree]]s, encourages regional events, and acts as a liaison between the Scouting movement and other international organizations. A major effort in the emerging nations is the extension of the universal Good Turn into an organization-wide effort for community development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-505.aspx|work=WOSM World Scouting|title=World Scout Bureau fact sheet|accessdate=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Organization of the Scout Movement is associated with the three [[#World Scout Centres|World Scout Centres]]. The [[World Scout Jamboree]] is held roughly every four years under the auspices of the WOSM, with members of WAGGGS also invited. WOSM also organises the [[World Scout Moot]], a Jamboree for 17-26 year olds, and has organised the [[World Scout Indaba]], a gathering for Scout leaders. The [[World Scout Foundation]] is a perpetual fund governed by a separate Board of Governors and supported by donations for the development of Scouting programs throughout the world.

[[File:World Bureau (World Organization of the Scout Movement).png|thumb|140px]]

The WOSM is the non-governmental organization (NGO), that represents the Scouting movement at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;wosmUN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.scout.org/en/our_organisation/governance/world_organisation | title = World Organization | format = | work = | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WOSM and WAGGGS both have General [[Consultative Status]] with the Economic and Social Council [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]] of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;wagggsUN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/issues/WAGGGS_and_the_UN/How_we_work_with_the_UN/wbank | title = How We Work With The UN | format = | work = | publisher = World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Scout Centres==
''World Scout Centre'' is a brand of the WOSM and actually used by three Scouting facilities in different countries. These facilities are operated by the corresponding regional divisions or by independent bodies:
* [[Kandersteg International Scout Centre]] in [[Switzerland]], operated by the ''Scouts International Home'' association
* [[Cairo International Scout Centre]] in [[Egypt]], operated by the ''Arab Region''
* [[PicarquÃ­n World Scout Centre]] in [[Chile]], operated by the ''Interamerican Region''

==Badge==
The WOSM membership badge is the [[World Scout Emblem]], a purple, circular badge with a [[fleur-de-lis]] in the center, surrounded by a piece of rope tied with a [[reef knot]] (also called a square knot). The fleur-de-lis is an ancient symbol, originally used by Baden-Powell for the enlisted scouts of the British Army and subsequently adopted and modified for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three duties, to God, self and others. The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law ([[Scouting#Scout Law|see below]]). The bond at the base of the fleur-de-lis shows the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement.

==History==
As a result of the [[1st World Scout Jamboree|first World Scout Jamboree]] at Olympia, London in 1920, leaders there created the Boy Scouts' International Conference. All 31 nations represented at Olympia were the charter members. A Bureau was established at 25, Buckingham Palace Road, London, and the then United Kingdom International Commissioner, [[Hubert S. Martin]], was appointed as Honorary Director. The Boy Scouts' International Conference was later superseded by the World Scout Conference.

The needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. For years there was an active [[Boy Scouts of the United Nations]] with several troops at [[Kew Gardens Hills, Queens#History and development|Parkway Village]] in [[New York City]], with but 14 members in 1959. Also directly registered to the World Bureau were the 900 member [[International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = John S.| authorlink = J. S. Wilson| title = Scouting Round the World| edition = first edition| year = 1959| publisher = Blandford Press| location = London| pages = 134| chapter = The International Bureau Goes on the Road| quote = &quot;At Balboa we met up with Gunnar Berg and Ray Wyland of the B.S.A., also on their way to Bogota, and had a conference about the question of coloured Scouts in the Canal Zone, who claim British and not Panamanian nationality. It was agreed that they should be taken under the wing of the Canal Zone Council of the Boy Scouts of America, but ten years later they were transferred directly under the International Bureau as the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone.&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 84 Scouts of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], an early precursor to the [[European Union]].

==Publications==
Publications of WOSM include:
* ''[[Scouting 'Round the World]]'': a book updated every three years with details on all WOSM member organizations;
* ''[http://www.scout.org/front/winfoen.shtml WorldInfo]'': a monthly circular distributed in electronic format with the help of [[Scoutnet]].
