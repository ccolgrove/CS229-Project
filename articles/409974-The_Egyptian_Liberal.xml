Sayed Darwish put music to the Egyptian national anthem, ''[[Bilady, Bilady, Bilady]]'', the words of which were adapted from a famous speech by [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]].

Coincidentally, on the day of his death, the national Egyptian leader [[Saad Zaghloul]] returned from exile; the Egyptians sang Darwish's new song &quot;[[Bilady, Bilady, Bilady]]&quot; which was to become the national anthem in 1979.
