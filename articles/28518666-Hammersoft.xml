'''Henan Airlines Flight 8387''' (VD 8387) was a flight from [[Harbin Taiping International Airport]] to the new [[Yichun Lindu Airport]], both located in [[Heilongjiang]] province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]. On the night of August 24, 2010 it crashed on approach to Yichun Lindu with 91 passengers and 5 crew members on board.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=China passenger plane crashes in north-east |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11076816 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=August 24, 2010 |accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first [[Write-off|hull-loss]] and the first accident with fatalities involving an [[Embraer]] [[Embraer E-Jets|E-190]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Accident description |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20100824-0 |publisher=Aviation Safety.net |date=August 24, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash==
According to Yichun officials, the aircraft broke apart while it was in the process of landing at around 2136 local time (1336 UTC), while the airport was enclosed with fog.&lt;ref name=AvHerald&gt;{{cite news|url=http://avherald.com/h?article=4300bc3c&amp;opt=0 |author=Simon Hradecky |work=Aviation Herald |title=Crash: Henan Airlines E190 at Yichun on Aug 24th 2010, burst into flames after landing |date=August 24, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aircraft touched down around {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} short of the runway, then caught fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvHerald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;netease&quot;/&gt; The wreckage of the fuselage came to a rest 700m from the runway.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvHerald&quot;/&gt; Some passengers escaped through gaps in the fuselage of the cabin.&lt;ref name=&quot;netease&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Details surrounding the crash were unclear in the immediate aftermath of the incident; a local official reported that the aircraft broke in two as it was landing, and that passengers were thrown from the aircraft, though some survivors said that it remained intact until it came to a rest away from the runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plane Crashes in Northeastern China, Killing 42|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/world/asia/25china.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=August 25, 2010|date=August 24, 2010 | first=Sharon | last=Lafraniere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
The flight carried a total of 96 people, out of a capacity of 108, of which 91 were passengers and five were crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua aftermath&quot;/&gt;  Initial reports suggested that 53 people survived the crash, while 43 were found dead at the scene; later reports corrected the death toll to 42 because the body of one victim was torn apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua aftermath&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Many passengers were participants of a national conference on human resources and employment, including vice minister [[Sun Baoshu]] and other officials of the national [[Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security]]. Two participants from [[Chengdu]] were among the fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-08/26/content_11203698.htm China Daily, 26th August, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some survivors said that they escaped through a hole in the front of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-china-plane-crash-20100825,0,3269984.story|title=China plane crash survivor describes severe turbulence|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=August 25, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, Henan Airlines announced that it would pay 960,000 [[Renminbi|yuan]] (around $140,000 [[United States dollar|USD]]) to the relatives of each person killed in the crash. The payment was required under PRC civil aviation law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NE China plane crash victims to receive compensation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-08/31/c_13470154.htm|publisher=Xinhua|accessdate=7 September 2010|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Crews immediately began searching for survivors, although the efforts were hampered by fog.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua aftermath&quot;/&gt; This phase of the rescue operation lasted for around eight hours before personnel at the scene began clearing the wreckage the morning after the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua aftermath&quot;/&gt;

Henan Airlines cancelled all flights in the days after the incident and fired the airline's general manager. Nationally, Chinese airlines performed increased safety checks in response to the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese carriers review safety checks after air crash|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/26/346654/chinese-carriers-review-safety-checks-after-air-crash.html|publisher=Flightglobal.com|accessdate=26 August 2010|date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administration for Industry and Commerce of [[Henan Province]] announced days after the incident that it had rescinded the enterprise name registration of Henan Airlines, and demanded that the airline operator restore its original name of Kunpeng Airlines. The administration cited as reasons for its decision that the name Henan Airlines had caused public misunderstanding and greatly damaged the image of the province, which holds no stake in the airline operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It was also revealed that the province had offered favorable conditions to attract the airline operator to adopt its current name, and celebrated the renaming afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Investigation==
Both the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] (CAAC) and the aircraft's manufacturer, [[Embraer]], sent teams of investigators to the crash site.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua aftermath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Embraer sends crew to probe China plane crash |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67N6B320100824 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |date=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. National Transportation Safety Board]] appointed an accredited representative, as the aircraft's [[General Electric CF34]] engines were made in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20100825X10814&amp;ntsbno=DCA10WA087&amp;akey=1 |title=DCA10WA087 |publisher=NTSB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flight recorder]]s were recovered at the scene and sent to [[Beijing]] for analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvHerald&quot;/&gt;

Early in the investigation, the qualifications of the pilot were focused on, as it emerged that upwards of a hundred pilots flying for [[Shenzhen Airlines]], Henan Airlines' parent company, had falsified their claims of flying experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese pilots lied about flying records|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11200188|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=7 September 2010|date=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
