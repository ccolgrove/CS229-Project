At 15, Barnes landed his first professional job as a drummer in the West End musical adaptation of ''[[Bugsy Malone]]''. He was briefly a singer in the pop [[boyband]] Hyrise, which was in the running to represent the United Kingdom in the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] Song Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] with the song &quot;Leading Me On&quot;; however, they lost out to [[James Fox]] and &quot;[[Hold Onto Our Love]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[CosmoGIRL!]]'' magazine. June/July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes began working in television in 2006, including a guest appearance on the UK series ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]''. That same year, he joined the ensemble cast of a West End production of ''[[The History Boys]]'', in which he starred as the sexually provocative Dakin, a role originally played by [[Dominic Cooper]] on stage and in the film ''[[The History Boys (film)|The History Boys]]''. 

Barnes made his feature-film debut as Young Dunstan in 2007's ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]'', directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]] and based on the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel of the same name. Barnes then starred as a Russian hoodlum named Cobakka in Suzie Halewood's ''[[Bigga Than Ben]]'', which was released in 2008 in the United Kingdom and other European countries.

In February 2007, it was announced that Barnes would play the role of [[Caspian X|Caspian]] in the film adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]'', directed by [[Andrew Adamson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In brief: Barnes skips History for Caspian |date=6 February 2007 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2006925,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2007-08-01 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson said &quot;''Caspian'' is a coming of age and, to some degree, a loss of innocence story, with Caspian starting out quite naÃ¯ve, then craving revenge and finally letting go of the vengeance.&quot;&lt;ref name=moviefone&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Johnson |title=The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian Character Guide |publisher=[[Moviefone]] |date=2008-04-11 |url=http://movies.aol.com/movie/the-chronicles-of-narnia-prince-caspian/24862/character-guide | accessdate=2008-04-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080413090133/http://movies.aol.com/movie/the-chronicles-of-narnia-prince-caspian/24862/character-guide &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many readers interpret Caspian as a child, a passage in the novel mentions his age to be near that of Peter's, so an older actor was sought to match [[William Moseley (actor)|William Moseley]]. Barnes had read the novel as a child, and was cast in two-and-a-half weeks after meeting with the filmmakers. He spent two months in New Zealand horse riding and stunt training to prepare for shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Edward Douglas |title=Ben Barnes is Prince Caspian |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/interviewsnews.php?id=38419 |publisher=Comingsoon.net |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes says his Mediterranean accent in the movie was inspired in part by [[Mandy Patinkin]]'s performance as [[Inigo Montoya]] in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Dan Jolin |title=Ben Barnes is Prince Caspian |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=April 2008 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson did not expect to cast a British actor as Caspian, and said Barnes fit well into the surrogate family of Adamson and the four actors playing the Pevensies.&lt;ref name=orchestra&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchestrating Magic in Narnia All Over Again |publisher=Disney Insider |url=http://disney.go.com/inside/mainattraction/080401/index.html |accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sale of each rose plant, a donation (20% of each sale) will go directly to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (Registered Charity no. 235825) as part of Disneyâs partnership with the charity, to help raise Â£10 million towards the hospital's redevelopment appeal.

In the spring of 2008, Barnes finished filming the role of John Whittaker for [[NoÃ«l Coward]]'s romantic comedy, ''[[Easy Virtue (2008 film)|Easy Virtue]]'' opposite [[Jessica Biel]].
