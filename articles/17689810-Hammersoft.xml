The '''[[Republic of South Africa]]''' is a [[List of sovereign states|sovereign country]] located at the southern tip of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 3, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sf.html|title=South Africa|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South Africa's coast stretches 2,798 kilometres&lt;ref name=&quot;samsa-main&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samsa.org.za/ |title=South African Maritime Safety Authority|publisher=South African Maritime Safety Authority|accessdate =2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and borders both the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] [[ocean]]s.&lt;ref name=safacts&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.southafrica.info/about/facts.htm|title=South Africa Fast Facts|publisher = SouthAfrica.info|date=April 2007 |accessdate = 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north of South Africa lie [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Swaziland]], while the [[Lesotho|Kingdom of Lesotho]] is an independent [[enclave]] surrounded by South African territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica-lesotho&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9113829/LESOTHO |title=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern human beings have inhabited South Africa for more than 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.southafrica.info/about/history/history.htm|title = A Short History of South Africa|accessdate = 2008-06-14|publisher = SouthAfrica.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the discovery of the [[History of Cape Colony|Cape Sea Route]], the [[Dutch East India Company]] founded a refreshment station at what would become [[Cape Town]] in 1652.&lt;ref name=&quot;wcupa-courses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his311/timeline/t-19saf.htm |title= African History Timeline|publisher= West Chester University of Pennsylvania }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the [[Boers]] (original Dutch settlers) and the British [[1820 Settlers]] claimed land in the north and east of the country. Conflicts arose between the original inhabitants of the land, the Khoi, Xhosa and Zulu, and the new European settlers. However, the discovery of diamonds and later gold triggered the conflict known as the [[Anglo-Boer War]] as the Boers and the British fought for the control of South Africa's mineral wealth. Although the Boers were defeated, limited independence was given to South Africa in 1910 as a British dominion. Anti-British policies focused on ultimate independence which was achieved in 1961 when South Africa was declared a republic. The leading [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] legislated [[Racial segregation|segregation]] known as ''[[apartheid]]'' despite opposition both in and outside of the country. In 1990, upon his release from prison, [[Nelson Mandela]] as well as the then president [[F.W. de Klerk]] began to dismantle this legislation, and in 1994 the first democratic election was held in South Africa. This election brought [[Nelson Mandela]] and the current ruling party, the [[African National Congress]] to power.

South Africa is known for its diversity, and eleven official languages are recognised in its constitution.&lt;ref name=safacts/&gt; English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial public life, however it is only the fifth most spoken home language.&lt;ref name=safacts/&gt;  South Africa is ethnically diverse, with the largest [[Whites in South Africa|Caucasian]], [[Asians in South Africa|Indian]], and [[Coloured|racially mixed]] communities in Africa. Although 79.5% of South Africa's population is [[Black people|Black]], this category is neither culturally nor linguistically homogenous, as they speak a number of different [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages, nine of which have official status.&lt;ref name=safacts/&gt; In 2006, South Africa's population was estimated at 47.4 million people.&lt;ref name=safacts/&gt;
