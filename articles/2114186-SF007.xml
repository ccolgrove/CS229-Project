'''''Tintin: Destination Adventure''''' is a [[video game]], loosely based on characters from ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic book series written and drawn by [[HergÃ©]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in [[Europe]] in late 2001.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is similar to the previous two Tintin games (''[[Prisoners of the Sun Game|Prisoners of the Sun]]'' and ''[[Tintin in Tibet Game|Tintin in Tibet]]''), with the exception in some parts where the player can operate vehicles. Aside from this the only other enhancement is the use of full [[3D computer graphics|3D]] for the game.

The places visited in the game are from
* The Black Island
* Red Rackhamâs Treasure
* The Land of Black Gold
* Explorers on the Moon
* Flight 714 to Sydney

==Availability==
The game was never released in the [[United States]] and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version can only be played on U.S. machines with a [[modchip]]. The [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version works on any PC with the correct requirements.

==Release dates==
* ''Tintin: Destination Adventure'' for PlayStation - September, 2001
* ''Tintin: Destination Adventure'' for Windows - November, 2001
