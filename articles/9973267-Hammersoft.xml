'''''Eelam War II''''' is the name given to the second phase of armed conflict between Sri Lankan military and the separatist [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]].  The war started after the failure of peace talks between the Premadasa government and the LTTE. This phase of the war was initiated by the LTTE who massacred almost 600 sinhalese and Muslim police personnel after they were ordered by the Premadasa government to surrender to the LTTE.  The truce was broken on June 10, 1990. The LTTE in October expelled all the 28,000 Muslims residing in [[Jaffna]].

The Sri Lankan forces issued shotguns to the Muslim villagers but these were inadequate to beat off LTTE attacks.
