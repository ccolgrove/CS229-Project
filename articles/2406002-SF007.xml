'''OpenOffice.org Base''' (&quot;Base&quot; for short), a database module, initially appeared with [[OpenOffice.org]] version 2.0. As of 2010, it builds on the [[HSQLDB]] [[database engine]] written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

OpenOffice.org users can connect to external full-featured [[SQL]] databases such as [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]] and [[Oracle database|Oracle]] through [[ODBC]] or [[JDBC]] drivers. OpenOffice.org Base can hence act as a GUI frontend for SQL views, table-design and query. In addition, OpenOffice.org has its own Form wizard to create dialog windows for form filling and updates.

Released under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public Licence]], Base is [[free software]].

== Product specifications ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

Early provisions for integration with database information appear in the Open Office Specification version 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
The OpenOffice.org team evaluated another database engine, [[SQLite]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}, but decided to use [[HSQLDB]] after evaluating the features, connectivity and embed quality of both database engines.

== Functionality ==
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
Starting with version 2.3, Base offers report-generation based on [[Pentaho]] software.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://blogs.sun.com/GullFOSS/entry/report_designer_will_extend_the
|title=Report Designer will extend the Database Application
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Base is integrated into the rest of the [[OpenOffice.org]] productivity suite.  It can provide [[mail merge]] functionality in conjunction with [[OpenOffice.org Writer|Writer]] and spreadsheet integration with [[OpenOffice.org Calc|Calc]].

== Limitations ==
The HSQLDB developers have suggested only 76% of the target has been met in the 1.8.0 release,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://hsqldb.org/web/openoffice.html
|title=HSQL page about integration with OpenOffice.org
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
the version first integrated with OOo 2.0. (They have appealed for contributions to fulfill all the feature targets, since the core database engine itself is an independent project with no external funding.)

As a result, HSQLDB 2.0 was released in 2010 with a vast list of improvements and new features&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title= New Features in HyperSQL 2.0
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
HSQLDB 2.x is scheduled for inclusion in OpenOffice.org 3.4,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
although [[LibreOffice]] has yet to commit.&lt;ref&gt;
