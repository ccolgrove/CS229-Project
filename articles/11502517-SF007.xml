===''ScrewAttack Europe''===

[[File:Retro Corner Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Guru Larry's Retro Corner Logo.]]

Introduced in late 2006, ScrewAttack Europe, located in [[Northwood, London]], [[UK]], was the name used by video game enthusiasts and TV presenters Guru Larry (Larry Bundy Jr) and &quot;UK&quot; Wez (Wesley Lock) for voluntarily creating video game related content for ScrewAttack.com. ScrewAttack Europe was the first official international feature and the only outside group to have 'ScrewAttack' in their title. Alongside [[The Angry Video Game Nerd]], ScrewAttack Europe was one of the longest lasting associates of ScrewAttack and second most popular partner provider after the AVGN.

==Current shows and featurettes==
{{Cleanup|section|date=May 2008}}

===SideScrollers===
SideScroller was a weekly audio podcast covering activities at ScrewAttack and general video games news. Features include &quot;Hard News&quot;, which looks at the latest news in the gaming industry, &quot;The SideScrollers News Desk&quot;, which is filled with unusual news from around the globe, and &quot;Forum Questions&quot;, where they answer questions from members on their official forum.

SideScrollers runs contests with the forum members which originate directly from the show. For instance, in the feature &quot;Name That Video Game Tune&quot;, the hosts play [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of short musical clips from often obscure video games and let the fans guess its origin via e-mail. Winners are entered in a contest drawing.

The show frequently runs short promotions and commercials to advertise new content on the site, often using it as a [[segue]] into the next discussion topic.

As of the 15th February 2011, SideScrollers changed its audio podcast format to a video format.

===Video Game Vault===
Hosted by Stuttering Craig, the series serve as a nostalgic, informative and humorous look at classic video games that are [[infamy|infamous]] for a particular reason.

===Hard News===
A daily news program shown on the site which is hosted and edited by Professional Jared. Its purpose is to inform viewers on the gaming news highlights of the day, often accompanied with humorous comments (mildly like [[Weekend Update]] and [[The Daily Show]], which described the story, then presented a humorous comment). The show is roughly 3 minutes long and is branched off of the Hard News segment on SideScrollers. Hard News is posted on ScrewAttack's website (usually posted at 6:30pm [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|Central time]]). It has once ceased postings on YouTube since November 30, 2009, but has resumed on April 19, 2010, as confirmed by Destin on his Twitter account. It was revealed on February 25, 2011 that Destin would be leaving Screwattack on March 4, and thus, Hard News. The ScrewAttack Team looked for a new host and g1s could upload their auditions to YouTube. Until a new host was found, Stuttering Craig and Professional Jared (as Craig had a surgery) acted as filler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSmqnegB8bU Hard News 03/07/11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHnHDguGLwk Hard News 03/15/11]&lt;/ref&gt; Jared announced in the Hard News Episode of April 20 that he is going to be the new anchor of Hard News.

===ScrewAttack Top Ten===
Stuttering Craig tries to keep the Top 10 lists non-traditional by focusing on games which might not have received as much critical acclaim as others, instead citing facetiously that because it is their list, the list is automatically great (an example comes from the &quot;Top Ten Worst Fighting Games&quot;, where after Handsome Tom stated that everyone's list would be different, Stuttering Craig said &quot;and besides, we're right anyways&quot;). As well, they will have Top 10 lists (such as the Top Ten Fighting Games) which only allow one game from a given franchise on to the list to allow more variety.  Airing on GameTrailers, the Top 10 lists generally receive over 300,000 views. The most popular Top 10 list to date is âTop Ten Boobies [in Video Games]â, which has received over 1,000,000 views since February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametrailers.com/player/17178.html Top Ten Boobies at GameTrailers]&lt;/ref&gt; Other favorites include &quot;Top Ten Douchebags of Gaming&quot; (more than 750,000 views),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametrailers.com/player/20064.html Top Ten Douchebags of Gaming at GameTrailers]&lt;/ref&gt; âTop Ten Worst Fighting Gamesâ (more than 690,000 views),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametrailers.com/player/20506.html Top Ten Worst Fighting Games at GameTrailers]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Top Ten Worst [[Mario]] Games&quot;, and âThe Best and Worst Gaming Peripheralsâ (more than 650,000 views).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametrailers.com/player/19276.html The Best and Worst Gaming Peripherals at GameTrailers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Angry Video Game Nerd===
{{Main|The Angry Video Game Nerd}}
The Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN; formerly &quot;The Angry Nintendo Nerd&quot;) is a series of [[farce|farcical]] [[retro gaming]] reviews by James D. Rolfe, an independent filmmaker and professional video editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemassacre.com/resume.html Resume at Cinemassacre.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The show consists of reviews for older video games on console systems, such as [[Atari 2600]], [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[PlayStation]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Nintendo 64]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]. The series' original music is played on guitar by Kyle Justin with lyrics by Rolfe. On August 8, 2007, Rolfeâs character was featured on the [[Opie and Anthony]] radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/8_08_07_Opie_Anthony.mp3|title=Opie and Anthony|author=James Rolfe|publisher=Cinemassacre|accessdate=August 14, 2007|date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clip/Quote of the Week===
Originally under the direction of Ben,it stars the entire SA staff and some rare cameos, the &quot;Clip of the Week&quot; (also is branded as &quot;Quote of the Week&quot;) is a series of [[Vignette (entertainment)|vignettes]] posted weekly that showcases offbeat and strange commercials, movie clips or promotions for products. Originally, the &quot;Quote of the Week&quot; was merely used to spotlight a specific quote from the featured clip, but after evolving into the 'Clip of the Week' it began to feature the SA staff in a skit inspired by the featured clip. After the departure of Hanley, the skits began to become more extravagant, to the point of full-fledged productions in some cases.

Recently Ben Switched direction Seat With Nervous Nick, Who directs Cotw {{as of|lc=y|2011|04}}.

===g1 Submission Sunday===
A segment in which fans of ScrewAttack submit their own videos to the site. Created by g1 SWAT Doctor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ScrewAttack |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSMnu1UqJLE |title=g1 Video Game Vault Submission |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-09-17 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the segment evolved into a standard feature on the site. The videos vary from user created Video Game Vaults, spoofs of the siteâs characters, Flash animation and other video game related material.

===Unaware Steve===
Unaware Steve, having not played a game since 1992, the last game he played was Cool Spot, goes to gaming conventions and interviews gamers. The interviewee usually ends up agitated with Steve as he is quite annoying when he wants to be. The last time he went to [[QuakeCon]] he wore a &quot;sophisticated&quot; outfit which was just a [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle]] costume. More recently he has started a new series &quot;Unaware Steve's Video Game Extravaganza.&quot; He reviews an old game, usually giving obvious hints or adding in a different game somewhere down the line. The character is played by [[Brad Skistimas]], Stuttering Craig's brother. According to his interviews at Quakecon 2008, he once drank lots of [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] after playing [[Cool Spot]] (which actually endorses [[7 Up]]), passed out and woke up in 2007 which may explain why he hasn't played a game since then.

Currently, Unaware Steve has been put on hiatus while Brad is promoting [[Five Times August|his band's]] new album. Unaware Steve made his return on August 14, 2011 while looking at QuakeCon.

===WTF Is That?===
&quot;WTF Is That?&quot; is a feature where a still frame is paused and zoomed in to the point of blurriness and near absolute unclarity on a screenshot of a particular game. The purpose is to run a contest on which video game the screenshot is from. The winner usually receives a free lunch or some other merchandise from the ScrewAttack store. Recent installments, however, ask what the games featured have in common.

===VGR===
VGR is another video game review show on ScrewAttack, similar to The Scoop.  However, instead of talking about the highs and lows of the game in question, categories of story, gameplay, sound, etc. are reviewed.  At the end of the video, viewers are given a recommendation by the reviewer to Buy it, Rent it, or F' it. For example, New Super Mario Bros. Wii had gotten a Buy It, Green Day Rock Band officially got a Rent It, and Dead To Rights Retribution got a F' it. Currently a score out of 10 is also given to each game reviewed.

===Out of the Box===
Now produced by Bryan, this is a show that previews recently released games and sneak peeks at upcoming ones. Stuttering Craig and Freelance Bryan the Intern play and express their thoughts about the game they're playing while answering G1 questions about the games on the show.

===Talking Classics===
As of May 2009, ScrewAttack is the home to this mocumentary that follows video game fan Keith Apicary, starring and created by comedian [[Nathan Barnatt]]. Keith Apicary (called the &quot;Borat of the gaming world&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asylum.com/2010/07/26/keith-apicary-nathan-barnatt-talking-classics/ |title=Being Keith Apicary â Meet the Borat of the Gaming World |last=Gallagher |first=Danny |date= 26 July 2010 |work=Asylum.com |publisher=AOL Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 28 year old gamer who favors [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]], [[Virtual Boy]], and [[Sega]]. Nathan has been forcibly removed from numerous events, including:
* The 2009 Comic Convention in San Diego (for jumping on stage as Keith during Peter Jackson and James Cameron's panel to get a drink of water).
* E3 2010 for interrupting a G4 interview and asking where the Sega Dreamcast 2 was. He was later given a &quot;Dreamcast 2&quot; in the form of two Sega Dreamcasts taped together by Felicia Day at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, which he was present for as Gametrailers.com Press.
* At PAX East 2011 he was also forced offstage by security while hosting a panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNO_VBbNRKA ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnatt is currently developing a TV series for Keith Apicary based on Talking Classics for Comedy Central.

A second season had been planned, and was indeed announced by show creator Chad Williams at [[MAGFest]] VI on January 6, 2008. To fill the gap until the second season airs, the writers produced a ''Captain S'' web-comic that is available to view on their [http://www.pbc-productions.com website].

In May 2009, PBC officially announced the second season of ''Captain S'' had been canceled, the second season having never left early preliminary development stages. In addition, the ''Captain S'' web-comic has not been updated in quite some time, indicating the concept has been rested entirely.

'''Main Cast'''&lt;br&gt;
Chad Belmont/Captain S - Brett Vanderbrook&lt;br&gt;
Nigel Edmund Silverman/NES - Devon Riley&lt;br&gt;
Lunk Stogsdill - [[Shael Riley]]&lt;br&gt;
Becky O'Connor - Ivy Hong&lt;br&gt;
Stacey Newfeld - Kitty Ostapowicz&lt;br&gt;
Head, and Game Genie - Chad Williams

The effect of Video-Land is achieved through stop-motion animation, where the image of Captain S is super-imposed on the game sprite.  In the season one finale, a more free-form style of animation, mimicking [[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'s motion capture style was used.

A special episode of Captain S was released in August 2007. In this episode, Captain S meets the Angry Video Game Nerd to join forces and save [[Christmas]] in July. Since Captain S is considered a family-friendly show, the AVGN's language is heavily toned down (only using the word ''[[wikt:crap|crap]]''), although at the end, he slips and curses (but it was censored), to which the Captain S characters react in shock.

While the title of the episode says it is non-canonical, an AVGN video seems to continue from where that episode left off.

===Life in a Game===
Life in a Game was a comedy/adventure series produced by Jonathan Tran from Enemy Crab Productions. It first aired on ScrewAttack in March 2008.

The show stars Guy, a normal person who realizes that classic video game items, characters, and music have begun affecting his everyday life. After fighting and destroying the Jackal, a mysterious boss character who had been stalking him, Guy is thrown into ever-stranger circumstances, from deadly chases to dance competitions. After defeating the reincarnated Red Jackal, Guy meets Frog of ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' fame. The reasons for Guy's peril, the threat of the Jackal, and the arrival of Frog are all tied to an as-of-yet unexplained force termed The Haxx.

On April Fool's Day 2009, Enemy Crab Productions &amp; Jared from Nametags pulled a prank on the g1 community, with the season finale of LiaG revealing that the show to that point was just a dream, and in fact, the characters had personalities &amp; lives very similar to the Nametags characters, before it was eventually revealed as a prank at the end of the episode by Jared, and that the real final episode was shown at SGC.

===''The Iron Man of Gaming''===
The Iron Man of Gaming is an annual gaming tournament, presented by ScrewAttack, to find who is the best all-round video gamer. Unlike traditional video game tournaments where participants compete on a single title, competitors are given a raft of video games from various genres to compete on. The winner is decided on a points-based system; the contender with the most points is declared the winner.
