[[Image:Rrddemo.png|thumb|right|RRDtool has a graph function, which presents data from an RRD in a customizable graphical format]]
{{Portal|Free software}}
'''RRDtool''' (acronym for '''r'''ound-'''r'''obin '''d'''atabase '''tool''') aims to handle [[time series|time-series]] data like [[Computer network|network]] [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[temperature]]s, [[Central processing unit|CPU]] load, etc.  The data are stored in a [[round-robin]] [[database]] ([[circular buffer]]), thus the system storage footprint remains constant over time.

It also includes tools to extract '''[[Round-Robin Database|RRD]]''' data in a graphical format.

[[Tobias Oetiker|Tobi Oetiker]] wrote RRDtool as a solution to store and graph the time series data points of his [[Multi Router Traffic Grapher|MRTG]] and licenses it as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

Bindings exist for [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Tcl]], [[PHP]] and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]. Two independent full [[Java (programming language)|Java]] implementations exist : [[rrd4j]] and [[jrobin]].

==General data storage==

RRDtool assumes time-variable data in intervals of a certain length. This interval, usually named '''step''', is specified upon creation of an RRD file and cannot be changed afterwards. Because data may not always be available at just the right time, RRDtool will automatically interpolate any submitted data to fit its internal time-steps.

The value for a specific step, that has been interpolated, is named a primary data point ('''PDP'''). Multiple PDPs may be consolidated according to a consolidation function ('''CF''') to form a consolidated data point ('''CDP'''). Typical consolidation functions are [[average]], minimum, maximum.

After the data have been consolidated, the resulting CDP is stored in a round-robin archive ('''RRA'''). A round-robin archive stores a fixed number of CDPs and specifies how many PDPs should be consolidated into one CDP and which CF to use. The total time covered by an RRA can be calculated as follows:

  time covered = (#CDPs stored) * (#PDPs per CDP) * steps

After this time the archive will &quot;wrap around&quot;: the next insertion will overwrite the oldest entry. This behavior is sometimes referred to as &quot;round-robin&quot; and is the reason for the program's name.

To cover several timespans and/or use several consolidation functions, an RRD file may contain multiple RRAs. The data retrieval function of RRDtool automatically selects the archive with the highest resolution that still covers the requested timespan. This mechanism is also used by RRDtool's graphing subsystem.
