Previously, Hispanic and Latino Americans were categorized as &quot;Spanish-Americans&quot;, &quot;Spanish-speaking Americans&quot;, and &quot;Spanish-surnamed Americans&quot;. However:
* Although a large majority of Hispanic and Latino Americans have Spanish ancestry, most are not of direct, 'from-Spain-to-the-U.S.' Spanish descent; many are not primarily of Spanish descent; and some are not of Spanish descent at all. People whose ancestors or who themselves arrived in the United States directly from Spain are a tiny minority of the Hispanic or Latino population (see figures in this article), and there are Hispanic/Latino Americans who are primarily or entirely of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ancestries]] other than [[Spanish people|Spanish]] (e.g. [[Italian people|Italian]], [[French people|French]], [[Germans|German]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]), and of [[Middle East]]ern (e.g. [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]]), [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|Black]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian/Native American]], and [[Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans|East or South Asian]] ancestries;
* Most Hispanic and Latino Americans can speak Spanish, not all; and most Spanish-speaking Americans are Hispanic or Latino, not all. E.g., Hispanic/Latino Americans often do not speak Spanish by the third generation, and some Americans who are Spanish-speaking may not identify themselves with Spanish-speaking Americans as an ethnic group;
* Not all Hispanic and Latino Americans have [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish surnames]], and ''most'' Spanish-surnamed Americans are Hispanic or Latino, not all. For example, non-Spanish surnamed [[Bill Richardson]] (former governor, Congressman, etc) and former [[National Football League]] (NFL) star [[Jim Plunkett]] have Hispanic or Latino origin. [[Filipino American]]s, and [[Pacific Islander American]]s of [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] ([[Guam]]anians and [[Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islanders]]), [[Palau]]an, [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesian (FSM)]], and [[Marshall Islands|Marshallese]] origin often have Spanish surnames, but have their own, non-Hispanic/Latino ethnic identities (though there may be exceptions). Likewise, while many [[Louisiana Creole people]] have Spanish surnames, they identify with the mostly [[Culture of France|French]] â though partially Spanish â culture of their region.

Neither term refers to [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], as a person of Latino or Hispanic origin can be of any race.&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;compraceho&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/compraceho.html |title=U.S. Census Bureau Guidance on the Presentation and Comparison of Race and Hispanic Origin Data |accessdate = 2007-03-18 |author=United States Census Bureau |quote = Race and Hispanic origin are two separate concepts in the federal statistical system.

[[File:Hispanic Flag2.png|thumb|left|250px|One of the flags representing [[Hispanidad|Hispanicity]].]]

A continuous Hispanic/Latino presence in the territory of the United States has existed since the 16th century,&lt;ref name=legacies/&gt;&lt;ref name=st-aug/&gt;&lt;ref name=amlib/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt; earlier than any other group after the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Spaniards pioneered the present-day United States. The first confirmed European landing in the continental U.S. was by [[Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n]], who landed in 1513 at a lush shore he christened ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''. Within three decades of Ponce de LeÃ³n's landing, the Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Grand Canyon]] and the [[Great Plains]]. Spanish ships sailed along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], penetrating to present-day [[Bangor, Maine]], and up the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] as far as [[Oregon]]. From 1528 to 1536, [[Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca]] and three other castaways from a Spanish expedition (including an African named [[Estevanico]]) journeyed all the way from Florida to the [[Gulf of California]], 267 years before the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].

In 1540 [[Hernando de Soto]] undertook an extensive exploration of the present U.S., and in the same year [[Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado]] led 2,000 Spaniards and Mexican Indians across today's [[Arizona]]âMexico border and traveled as far as central [[Kansas]], close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States. Other Spanish explorers of the US make up a long list that includes, among others: [[Lucas VÃ¡zquez de AyllÃ³n]], [[PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez]], [[SebastiÃ¡n VizcaÃ­no]], [[Gaspar de PortolÃ ]], [[Pedro MenÃ©ndez de AvilÃ©s]], [[Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca]], [[TristÃ¡n de Luna y Arellano]] and [[Juan de OÃ±ate]], but also non-Spanish explorers working for the Spanish Crown like [[Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo]]. In all, Spaniards probed half of today's lower 48 states before the first English colonization attempt at [[Roanoke Island]] in 1585.

The Spanish created the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States, at [[St. Augustine, Florida]], in 1565. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] also predates [[Jamestown, Virginia]] (founded in 1607) and [[Plymouth Colony]] (of ''[[Mayflower]]'' and [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] fame; founded in 1620). Later came Spanish settlements in [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[Tucson, Arizona]], [[San Diego, California]], [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[San Francisco, California]], to name just a few. 

Two iconic American stories have Spanish antecedents, too. Almost 80 years before [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]]'s alleged rescue by [[Pocahontas]], a man by the name of Juan Ortiz told of his remarkably similar rescue from execution by an Indian girl. Spaniards also held a [[thanksgiving]] â 56 years before the famous Pilgrims [[Harvest festival|festival]] â when they feasted near St. Augustine with Florida Indians, probably on stewed pork and garbanzo beans. As late as 1783, at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (a conflict in which Spain [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|aided and fought]] alongside the United States), Spain held claim to roughly half of today's continental United States; in 1775, Spanish ships even reached [[Alaska]]. From 1819 to 1848, the United States (through treaties, purchase, diplomacy, and the [[Mexican-American War]]) increased its area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, acquiring three of today's four most populous states â [[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Florida]] â and several smaller ones. Hispanics became the first American citizens in these new territories, and remained a majority in several [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] states until the 20th century. (See also [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]].) 

The Hispanic and Latino role in the history and present of the United States is addressed in more detail below (See [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Notables and their contributions|Notables and their contributions]]). On September 17, 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] designated a week in mid-September as National Hispanic Heritage Week, with [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s authorization. In 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] extended the observance to a month, designated [[Hispanic Heritage Month]].&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/013984.html |title=US Census Press Releases; Hispanic Heritage Month 2009: Sept. 15 â Oct. 15 |accessdate=2010-01-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, Hispanics accounted for 16.3% of the national population, or around 50.5 million people. The Hispanic growth rate over the April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007 period was 28.7% â about four times the rate of the nation's total population (at 7.2%).&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Census Bureau&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=PEP_2007_EST&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-mt_name=PEP_2007_EST_G2007_T001&amp;-format=&amp;-CONTEXT=dt |title=T1.

Of the nation's total Hispanic or Latino population, 49% (21.5 million) lives in [[California]] or [[Texas]]. Not counting [[Puerto Rico]] â which is a Commonwealth of the United States â [[New Mexico]] is the state with the highest ratio of Hispanics, 44.7%. Next are California and Texas, with 35.9% and 35.6%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/hispanics2006/Table-12.pdf |title=Hispanic Population by State: 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-07 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New 2000 hispanic density.gif|thumb|right|Density of Hispanic or Latino residents ([[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census data]])]] [[File:Census Bureau 2000, Hispanics in the United States.png|thumb|right|Percentage of Hispanic or Latino residents by county ([[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census data]])]]

The overwhelming majority of Mexican Americans are concentrated in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]/[[Western United States|West]], primarily in [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], and [[Utah]]. The majority of the Hispanic population in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], concentrated in [[Florida]], are of [[Cuba]]n origin. The Hispanic population in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], concentrated in [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], and Eastern [[Pennsylvania]], is composed mostly of Puerto Ricans; however, the Dominican population has risen considerably since the mid-1990s. The remainder of Hispanics and Latinos may be found throughout the country, though South Americans tend to concentrate on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and Central Americans on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990s, several cities on the East Coast have seen often impressive increases in their Mexican population, namely Miami and Philadelphia. 

The Hispanic population of [[Los Angeles County, California]], numbering 4.7 million, is the largest of any county in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/010482.html |title=US Census Press Releases; More Than 300 Counties Now &quot;Majority-Minority&quot; |accessdate=2008-05-18 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080419163600/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/010482.html |archivedate = April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 47 percent of the county's ten million residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_DP5&amp;-geo_id=05000US06037&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false |title=Los Angeles County, California - ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates: 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-18 |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2000, the ten most populous places with Hispanic majorities were [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] (97% Hispanic), [[Laredo, Texas]] (94%), [[Brownsville, Texas]] (91%) [[Hialeah, Florida]] (90%), [[McAllen, Texas]] (80%), [[El Paso, Texas]] (77%), [[Santa Ana, California]] (76%), [[El Monte, California]] (72%) [[Oxnard, California]] (66%), and [[Miami]] (66%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/mso/www/rsf/hisorig/sld023.htm |title=Ten Places with Highest Percent Hispanic: 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-05 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 64% of the nation's Hispanic population are of Mexican origin (see table). Another 9% are of Puerto Rican origin, with about 3% each of [[Cuban American|Cuban]], [[Salvadoran American|Salvadoran]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]] origins. The remainder are of other Central American or South American origin, or of origin directly from Spain. About 7% are of unspecified national origins. It should be noted that these figures pertain to ethnic self-identification; the same dataset (abstracted from the 2007 [[American Community Survey]]) indicates that 60.2% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/hispanics2007/Table-3.pdf |title=Detailed Hispanic Origin: 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-30 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few recent immigrants directly from Spain. In the 2000 Census, 299,948 Americans, of whom 83% were native-born,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-reg=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201:423;ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201PR:423;ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201T:423;ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S0201TPR:423&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-format= |title=United States - Selected Population Profile in the United States (Spaniard) |accessdate=2009-04-05 |work=2007 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically reported their ancestry as ''[[Spanish people|Spaniard]]''.&lt;ref name=ancestry2k&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf |title=Ancestry: 2000.

Patricia de la Cruz |month=June | year=2004 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|publisher=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Additionally, in the 2000 Census some 2,187,144 Americans reported &quot;Spanish&quot; as their ancestry. For more about this group, see [[Spanish American]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern New Mexico and southern [[Colorado]] live peoples who trace their ancestry to Spanish settlers of the late 16th century through the 17th century. People from this background often self-identify as &quot;[[Hispanos]]&quot;, &quot;Spanish&quot;, or &quot;Hispanic&quot;. Many of these settlers also intermarried with local Amerindians, creating a [[Mestizo]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmculturenet.org/heritage/cuartocentenario/spanish_view.php |title=New Mexico CultureNet - Cuartocentenario |accessdate=2008-05-13 |publisher=New Mexico CultureNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, southern [[Louisiana]] is home to communities of people of [[Canary Islands]] descent, known as [[IsleÃ±o]]s, in addition to other people of Spanish ancestry.

Hispanics are almost uniformly [[Christianity|Christian]], with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] the majority confession and an increasing [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community.

Hispanic or Latino origin is independent of race and is termed &quot;ethnicity&quot; by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. The racial categories are: [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian and Alaska Native]], [[White people|White]], [[Black people|Black or African American]], [[Asian people|Asian]], [[Native Hawaiian|Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander]], [[Racial and ethnic demographics of the United States#Some other race|Some other race]], and [[Multiracial|Two or more races]]. The distinction made by government agencies for those within the population of each race category is between those of ''Hispanic or Latino'' origin, and all others of ''Non-Hispanic or Latino'' origin.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

&lt;!--The official and the ACS figures should be updated at the same time--&gt;The majority of Hispanic and Latino Americans are [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|white]], in both sets of government estimates: 54% are white per the American Community Survey,&lt;ref name=b03002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G2000_B03002&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-currentselections=PEP_2006_EST_G2006_T004_2006&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en |title=B03002. Hispanic or Latino origin by race |accessdate=2009-01-19 |work=2007 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ratio rises to 92% in the Population Estimates Program, which are the official estimates.&lt;ref name=popest2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=PEP_2007_EST&amp;-mt_name=PEP_2007_EST_G2007_T004_2007&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-currentselections=PEP_2006_EST_G2006_T004_2006&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en |title=T4-2007. Hispanic or Latino By Race &lt;nowiki&gt;[15]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |accessdate=2009-01-19 |work=2007 Population Estimates |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; The much larger official figure is due to the absence of the ''Some other race'' category from these estimates, which instead reallocate that category among the five standard, minimum, single-race categories, mostly the white category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |title=Technical Documentation for the Census 2000 Modified Race Data Summary File |accessdate=2008-05-14 |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete 2007 Hispanic or Latino racial breakdown is as follows:&lt;ref name=popest2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=b03002/&gt; [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White]] 92% (official) or 54% (ACS); [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|Black]] or African American 3.8% (official) or 1.5% (ACS); American Indian and Alaska Native 1.4% (official) or 0.8% (ACS); [[Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans|Asian]] 0.6% (official) or 0.3% (ACS); Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 0.3% (official) or 0.07% (ACS); Some other race 40% (ACS only; not an official race); Two or more races 0.6% (official) or 3.8% (ACS).

Though comprising very small percentages of the Hispanic and Latino American population, and even smaller percentages of the total U.S. population, some of the preceding racial subgroups make up large minorities among the respective racial groups, overall. For instance, Hispanics and Latinos who are American Indian or Alaska Native compose 15% of all American Indians and Alaska Natives (per the ACS estimates). Meanwhile, the 120,000 Hispanics and Latinos who are of Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander race compose 22% of this entire race nationally (per the Population Estimates). Again, nearly a third of the overall 'Two or more race' population is Hispanic or Latino (ACS).&lt;ref name=popest2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=b03002/&gt;

Hispanics and Latinos are underrepresented in U.S. television, radio, and film. This is combatted by organizations such as the [[National Hispanic Media Coalition]] (NHMC), founded in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhmc.org/about/ |title=National Hispanic Media Coalition: About Us |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with numerous Latino civil rights organizations, the NHMC led a &quot;brownout&quot; of the national television networks in 1999, after discovering that there were no Latinos in any of their new [[prime time]] shows that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aspen.conncoll.edu/politicsandculture/page.cfm?key=145 |title=Politics and Culture: Making a Difference |last=Noriega |first=Chon |accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher=[[Connecticut College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the signing of historic diversity agreements with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]] that have since increased the hiring of Hispanic and Latino talent and other staff in all of the networks. 

[[Latino Public Broadcasting]] (LPB) funds programs of educational and cultural significance to Hispanic Americans. These programs are distributed to various public television stations throughout the United States.

The high school graduation rate is highest among Cuban Americans (68.7 percent) and lowest among Mexican Americans (48.7 percent). The Puerto Rican rate is 63.2 percent, Central and South American Americans' is 60.4 percent, and the Dominican American is 51.7 percent.

According to the 2000 census, Cuban Americans and Central and South Americans had the highest college graduation rates, with 19.4 percent of Cuban Americans and 16 percent of Central and South Americans 25 years and older possessing a 4-year [[Academic degree|college degree]]. On the other hand, only 6.2 percent of Mexican Americans, 9.9 of Puerto Ricans and 10.9 of Dominican Americans had achieved a 4-year degree. Over 21% of all second-generation Dominican Americans have college degrees, slightly below the national average (24%) but significantly higher than U.S.-born Mexican Americans (13%) and U.S.-born Puerto Rican Americans (12%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dominican Diaspora Revisited, Dominicans and Dominican-Americans in a New Century |last=Castro |first=Max J. |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison non-Hispanic [[Asian American]]s (43.3 percent) and non-Hispanic [[White American]]s (26.1 percent) had higher rates than any Hispanic American group. Non-Hispanic [[African American|Black Americans]] (14.4 percent) had a lower graduation rate than Cuban Americans and Central and South Americans, but had a higher rate than Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominican Americans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Cuban Americans have the highest attainment of graduate degrees among all Hispanic or Latino groups, with 6.7 percent. The Central and South American ratio is 4.2 percent. Both are lower than those of non-Hispanic Asian Americans (15.6 percent) and non-Hispanic White Americans (8.7 percent). Non-Hispanic Black Americans (4.1 percent) have a lower percentage of graduate-level degrees than most Hispanic or Latino groups. Of Hispanics and Latinos 25 years and older, only 3.1 percent of Puerto Ricans, 1.8 percent of Dominican Americans and 1.4 percent of Mexican Americans have attained a graduate-level degree.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Health ===
Hispanic and Latino Americans are the longest-living Americans, according to official data. Their [[life expectancy]] is more than two years longer than for non-Hispanic whites and almost eight years longer than for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Arias, E. [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_152.pdf United States life tables by Hispanic origin]. National Center for Health Statistics. Vital Health Stat 2(152). 2010. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workforce and average income ===

[[File:Race 6 figure household and.png|thumb|Percent of households with six-figure incomes and individuals with incomes in the top 10%, exceeding $77,500.]]

In 2002, the average individual income among Hispanic and Latino Americans was highest for Cuban Americans ($38,733), and lowest for Dominican Americans ($28,467) and Mexican Americans ($27,877). For Puerto Ricans it was $33,927, and $30,444 for Central and South Americans. In comparison, the income of the average Hispanic American is lower than the national average.

Among Hispanics, Cuban Americans (28.5 percent) had the highest percentage in professionalâmanagerial occupations. The percentage for Puerto Ricans was 20.7, Central and South Americans' was 16.8 percent, and Mexican Americans' was 13.2 percent. All these are lower than the average for non-Hispanics (36.2 percent).{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Poverty ===
According to the [[American Community Survey|ACS]],&lt;ref name=acsh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/acs-03.pdf |title=The American Community-Hispanics: 2004 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |year=2007 |month=February}}&lt;/ref&gt; among Hispanic groups the [[poverty threshold|poverty rate]] is highest among Dominican Americans (28.1 percent), Honduran Americans and Puerto Ricans (23.7 percent both), and Mexican Americans (23.6 percent). It is lowest among South Americans, such as Colombian Americans (10.6 percent) and Peruvian Americans (13.6 percent), and relatively low poverty rates are also found among Salvadoran Americans (15.0 percent) and Cuban Americans (15.2 percent). In comparison, the average poverty rates for non-Hispanic White Americans (8.8 percent)&lt;ref name=acsh/&gt; and Asian Americans (7.1 percent) were lower than those of any Hispanic group. African Americans (21.3 percent) have a higher poverty rate than most Hispanic or Latino groups.

=== Hispanophobia ===
{{Main|Hispanophobia|Anti-Mexican sentiment}}
[[Hispanophobia]] has existed in various degrees throughout U.S. history, based largely on ethnicity, race, culture, [[Anti-Catholicism]], and use of the [[Spanish language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://amath.colorado.edu/carnegie/lit/lynch/migrant.htm Lynching and Violence in America: Migrant Workers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/press3b.htm press3b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/21.1/forum_wilson.html Steven H.

In California, the state with the largest Latino population, the number of hate crimes against Latinos almost doubled&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2007/12/5/fbi_statistics_show_anti_latino_hate Democracy Now! | FBI Statistics Show Anti-Latino Hate Crimes on the Rise] December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the year 2009, the FBI reported that 483 of the 6,604 [[hate crimes]] committed in the [[United States]] were anti-Hispanic comprising 7.3% of all hate crimes. This compares to 34.6% of hate crimes being anti-Black, 17.9% being anti-Homosexual, 14.1% being anti-Jewish, and 8.3% being anti-White.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2009/data/table_01.html FBI: &quot;Incidents, Offenses, Victims, and Known Offenders by Bias Motivation, 2009&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political trends ==
{{Main|Hispanic and Latino American politics}}
[[File:CHCcirca1984.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]], circa 1984]]
Hispanics and Latinos differ on their political views depending on their location and background, but the majority (57%)&lt;ref name=BG&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/12/10/gop_debaters_beckon_hispanics/ |title=GOP hopefuls beckon Hispanics in debate - The Boston Globe |accessdate=2008-06-08 |last=Levenson |first=Michael |date=2007-12-10 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; either identify themselves as or support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and 23% identify themselves as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref name=BG/&gt; This 34 point gap as of December, 2007 was an increase from the gap of 21 points 16 months earlier. Cuban Americans and Colombian Americans tend to favor conservative political ideologies and support the Republicans, while Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominican Americans tend to favor liberal views and support the Democrats. However, because the latter groups are far more numerous â as, again, Mexican Americans alone are 64% of Hispanics and Latinos â the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position with the group overall.

The Presidency of [[George W. Bush]] had a significant impact on the political leanings of Hispanics and Latinos. As a former Governor of Texas, Bush regarded this growing community as a potential source of growth for the conservative movement and the Republican Party,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} and he made some gains for the Republicans among the group.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], 72% of Hispanics and Latinos backed President [[Bill Clinton]], but in 2000 the Democratic total fell to 62%, and went down again in 2004, with Democrat [[John Kerry]] winning Hispanics 58â40 against Bush. Hispanics in the West, especially in California, were much stronger for the Democratic Party than in Texas and Florida. California Latinos voted 63â32 for Kerry in 2004, and both Arizona and New Mexico Latinos by a smaller 56â43 margin; but Texas Latinos were split nearly evenly, favoring Kerry 50â49, and Florida Latinos (mostly being Cuban American) backed Bush, by a 54â45 margin.

In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm election]], however, due to the unpopularity of the [[Iraq War]], the heated debate concerning [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], and Republican-related Congressional scandals, Hispanics and Latinos went as strongly Democratic as they have since the Clinton years. Exit polls showed the group voting for Democrats by a lopsided 69â30 margin, with Florida Latinos for the first time split evenly. The runoff election in Texas' 23rd congressional district was seen as a bellwether of Latino politics, and Democrat [[Ciro Rodriguez]]'s unexpected (and unexpectedly decisive) defeat of Republican incumbent [[Henry Bonilla]] was seen as proof of a leftward lurch among Latino voters, as heavily Latino counties overwhelmingly backed Rodriguez, and heavily [[Anglo]] counties overwhelmingly backed Bonilla.

Although during 2008 the economy and employment were top concerns for Hispanics and Latinos, immigration was &quot;never far from their minds&quot;: almost 90% of Latino voters rated immigration as &quot;somewhat important&quot; or &quot;very important&quot; in a poll taken after the election.&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2009/01/30/republicans-and-latino-voters-has-the-gop-shifted-on-immigration-reform.html?PageNr=2 |title=Republicans and Latino Voters: Has the GOP Shifted on Immigration Reform? - US News and World Report |accessdate=2009-04-08 |publisher=[[US News]] |first=Justin |last=Ewers}} [http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2009/01/30/republicans-and-latino-voters-has-the-gop-shifted-on-immigration-reform.html?PageNr=1 Page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; There is &quot;abundant evidence&quot; that the heated Republican opposition to the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]] has done significant damage to the party's appeal to Hispanics and Latinos in the years to come, especially in the [[swing state]]s such as Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico.&lt;ref name=usnews/&gt; In a [[Gallup poll]] of 4,604 registered Hispanic voters taken in the final days of June 2008, only 18% of participants identified themselves as Republicans.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gJyH1GO3NGTeG0KIQjK8-P98ktwg |title=AFP: Obama dominates McCain among Hispanics: poll |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008 election ===
In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic primary]] Hispanics and Latinos participated in larger numbers than before, with [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] receiving most of the group's support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.afrik.com/article12914.html |title=Obama gets another ally - Politics - United States - United Kingdom - International - Obama running for the White House - Africa |date=2008-03-22 |author=Daniel Dombey |coauthors=Andrew Ward |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pundits discussed whether a large percentage of Hispanics and Latinos would vote for an African American candidate, in this case [[Barack Obama]], Clinton's opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/politics/15hispanic.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/R/Richardson,%20Bill In Obamaâs Pursuit of Latinos, Race Plays Role] By Adam Nagourney and Jennifer Steinhauer, Published: January 15, 2008, New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanics/Latinos voted 2 to 1 for Mrs. Clinton, even among the younger demographic, which in the case of other groups was an Obama stronghold.&lt;ref name=86pdf&gt;[http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/86.pdf The Hispanic Vote in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primaries] Report, Original Publication Date: February 21, 2008, Pew Hispanic Center&lt;/ref&gt; Among Hispanics, 28% said race was involved in their decision, as opposed to 13% for (non-Hispanic) whites.&lt;ref name=86pdf /&gt;

Obama defeated Clinton. In the matchup between Obama and Republican candidate [[John McCain]] for the presidency, Hispanics and Latinos supported Obama with 59% to McCain's 29% in the [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] tracking poll as of June 30, 2008.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; This surprised some analysts, since a higher than expected percentage of Latinos and Hispanics favored Obama over McCain, who had been a leader of the comprehensive immigration reform effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanictips.com/2008/11/06/mccain-lost-ground-with-hispanics-despite-immigration-stance/ Hispanictips.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, McCain had retracted during the Republican primary, stating that he would not support the bill if it came up again. Some analysts believed that this move hurt his chances among Hispanics and Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/immigration/106749/why_john_mccain_lost_the_latino_vote/?page=2 Alternet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Obama took advantage of the situation by running ads aimed at the ethnic group, in Spanish, in which he mentioned McCain's about-face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry9LnAazwMg Youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election, 67% of Hispanics and Latinos voted for Obama&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-11-06-hispanics_N.htm |title=Hispanic vote grows, shifts to Democrats - USATODAY.com |accessdate=2009-04-11 |last=Lawrence |first=Jill |date=2008-11-06 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 31% voted for McCain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1 | work=CNN | title=Local Exit Polls - Election Center 2008 - Elections &amp; Politics from CNN.com | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a relatively stronger turnout than in previous elections in states such as Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and [[Virginia]] helping Obama carry those formerly Republican states. Obama won 70% of non-Cuban Hispanics and 35% of the traditionally Republican Cuban Americans that have a strong presence in Florida, while the changing state demographics towards a more non-Cuban Hispanic community also contributed to his carrying Florida's Latinos with 57% of the vote.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/politics/6099797.html |title=In record turnout, Latino voters flip red states to blue |work=  Houston Chronicle |accessdate=2009-04-11 |last=Carroll |first=Susan |date=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanics and Latinos also supplanted Republican gains in traditional red states, for example Obama carried 63% of Texas Latinos, despite that the overall state voted for McCain by 55%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#TXP00p1 | work=CNN | title=Local Exit Polls - Election Center 2008 - Elections &amp; Politics from CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some political organizations associated with Hispanic and Latino Americans are [[League of United Latin American Citizens|LULAC]], the [[National Council of La Raza|NCLR]], the [[United Farm Workers]], the [[Cuban American National Foundation]], and the [[National Institute for Latino Policy]].

== Culture ==
{{Main|American culture|Hispanic culture}}
{{See also|National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations}}
The geographic, political, social, economic, and racial other diversity of Hispanic and Latino Americans extends to culture, as well. Yet several features tend to unite Hispanics and Latinos from these diverse backgrounds.

=== Language ===
{{See also|Languages of the United States|Spanish in the United States}}

With 40% of Hispanic and Latino Americans being immigrants,&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201:400;ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201PR:400;ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201T:400;ACS_2006_EST_G00_S0201TPR:400&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-format= |title=United States - Selected Population Profile in the United States (Hispanic or Latino (of any race)) |accessdate=2008-06-11 |work=2006 American Community Survey |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with many of the 60% who are U.S.-born being the children or grandchildren of immigrants, [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] is the norm in the community at large: at home, at least 69% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans over age five are bilingual in English and Spanish, whereas up to 22% are monolingual English-speakers, and 9% are monolingual Spanish-speakers; another 0.4% speak a language other than English and Spanish at home.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B16006&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-SubjectID=14829562 |title=B16006.

The other 30.8 million, or 78%, spoke Spanish at home. Of these, 3.7 million spoke no English, while the overwhelming majority, 27.2 million, did, at these levels: 15.5 million &quot;very well&quot;, 5.8 million &quot;well&quot;, and 5.9 million &quot;not well&quot;. These 27.2 million bilingual speakers represented 69% of all (39.5 million) Hispanic and Latino Americans aged five or over in 2006, while the 3.7 million monolingual Spanish-speakers represented 9%.]&lt;/ref&gt; In all, a full 90% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans speak English, and at least 78% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans speak Spanish.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt; Spanish is the oldest European language in the United States, spoken uninterruptedly for four and a half centuries, since the foundation of St. Augustine.&lt;ref name=legacies/&gt;&lt;ref name=st-aug/&gt;&lt;ref name=amlib/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt; 

The usual pattern is monolingual Spanish use among new migrants or older foreign-born Hispanics, complete bilingualism among long-settled immigrants and the children of immigrants, and the sole use of English, or both English and either [[Spanglish]] or colloquial Spanish by the third generation and beyond.&lt;!--needs a source, of course.--&gt;

=== Religion ===
The most methodologically rigorous study of Hispanic or Latino religious affiliation to date was the [http://latinostudies.nd.edu/pubs/pubs/HispChurchesEnglishWEB.pdf Hispanic Churches in American Public Life] (HCAPL) National Survey, conducted between August and October 2000. This survey found that 70% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans are Catholic, 20% are Protestant, 3% are &quot;alternative Christians&quot; (such as Mormon or Jehovah's Witnesses), 1% identify with a non-Christian religion, and 6% have no religious preference (with only .37% claiming to be atheist or agnostic). This suggests that Hispanics/Latinos are not only a highly religious, but also a highly Christian constituency. It also suggests that Hispanic/Latino Protestants are a more sizable minority than sometimes realized. Catholic affiliation is much higher among first-generation than second- or third-generation Hispanic or Latino immigrants, who exhibit a fairly high rate of defection to Protestantism. Also Hispanics and Latinos in the [[Bible Belt]], which is mostly located in the [[Southern United States|South]], are more likely to defect to Protestantism than those in other regions. Hispanic and Latino Americans' membership in the Catholic Church continues to grow in absolute numbers, due to the group's high birth and immigration rates. Hispanic or Latino Catholics are also increasingly working to enhance member retention through youth and social programs and through the spread of the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Espinosa, &quot;Latinos, Religion, and the American Presidency,&quot; in ''Religion, Race, and the American Presidency'', ed. Gaston Espinosa (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers), 242-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
The United States is home to thousands of Spanish language [[Mass media|media]] outlets, which range in size from giant commercial and some non-commercial [[List of United States over-the-air television networks|broadcasting networks]] and major [[magazine]]s with circulations numbering in the millions, to low-power [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] stations with listeners numbering in the hundreds. There are hundreds of Internet media outlets targeting U.S. Hispanic consumers. Some of the outlets are online versions of their printed counterparts and some online exclusively.

Among the most noteworthy Hispanic/Latino-oriented media outlets are:
*[[Univision]], the largest [[List of Spanish-language television channels|Spanish-language television network]] in the United States, with affiliates in nearly every major U.S. market, and numerous affiliates internationally;
*[[Telemundo]], the second-largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, with affiliates in nearly every major U.S. market, and numerous affiliates internationally;
*[[Azteca America]], a Spanish-language television network in the United States, with affiliates in nearly every major U.S. market, and numerous affiliates internationally;
*''[[La OpiniÃ³n]]'', a Spanish-language daily newspaper published in Los Angeles, California and distributed throughout the six counties of [[Southern California]]. It is the largest Spanish-language newspaper in the United States;

*[[CNN en Espanol]], a Spanish-language all-news television network based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]];
*''[[Vida Latina]]'', a Spanish-language entertainment magazine distributed throughout the [[Southern United States]].

===Intermarriage===

Hispanic Americans, like immigrant groups before them, are out-marrying at very high rates comprising 17.4% of all existing Hispanic marriages.  The rate is higher for newlyweds (which excludes already married immigrants): Among all newlyweds in 2008, 26% of all Hispanics married a non-Hispanic (this compares to out-marriage rates of 9% for non-Hispanic Whites, 16% for non-Hispanic Blacks, and 31% for non-Hispanic Asians). The rate was even more profound for native-born Hispanics with 41.3% of Native-Born Hispanic men out-marrying (compared to 11.3% of Foreign-Born Hispanic men) and 37.4% of Native-Born Hispanic women out-marrying (compared to 12.2% of Foreign-Born Hispanic women). The difference is attributed to the fact that recent immigrants tend to marry within their immediate immigrant community due to commonality of language, proximity, familial connections, and familiarity&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out&quot;&gt;[http://pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/755-marrying-out.pdf Pew Social Trends: &quot;Marrying Out&quot;] June 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;(see [[Interracial marriage in the United States]] for further discussion).

81% of Hispanics who intermarried married non-Hispanic Whites, 9% married non-Hispanic Blacks, 5% non-Hispanic Asians, and the remainder married non-Hispanic, multi-racial partners. 

Attitudes amongst non-Hispanics toward intermarriage with Hispanics are mostly favorable with 81% of Whites, 76% of Asians, and 73% of Blacks &quot;being fine&quot; with a member of their family marrying a Hispanic and an additional 13% of Whites, 19% of Asians, and 16% of Blacks &quot;being bothered but accepting of the marriage.&quot; Only 2% of Whites, 4% of Asians, and 5% of Blacks would not accept a marriage of their family member to a Hispanic. 

Hispanic attitudes toward intermarriage with non-Hispanics are likewise favorable with 71% &quot;being fine&quot; with marriages to Whites and 81% &quot;being fine&quot; with marriages to Blacks.  A further 22% admitted to &quot;being bothered but accepting&quot; of a marriage of a family member to a White and 16% admitted to &quot;being bothered but accepting&quot; of a marriage of a family member to a Black.  Only 4% of Hispanics objected outright marriage of a family member to an White and 3% to a Black.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out&quot;/&gt;
