The '''S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications''' is the communications school at [[Syracuse University]]. It has programs in print and broadcast journalism; advertising; public relations; and television and film.

The school was named for publishing magnate [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.|Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.]], who provided the founding gift in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;reference 1&quot;&gt;[http://sumagazine.syr.edu/archive/fall03/advancing/index.html Syracuse University Magazine, Fall 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; The Newhouse family, now led by sons [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|S.I. Newhouse Jr.]] and [[Donald Newhouse|Donald]], chairman and president, respectively, of [[Advance Publications]], continutes to support the school, most recently (in 2003) with a $15 million gift for the construction of Newhouse 3, the third building in the Newhouse School's three-building complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;reference 1&quot; /&gt;

== History ==

The roots of the Newhouse School are found in Syracuse Universityâs former School of Journalism, which was founded in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;reference 4&quot;&gt;[http://archives.syr.edu/collections/schools.html Syracuse University Archives: School and College Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Syracuse University became the first university in the nation to offer a college credit radio course. In 1947, SU launched [[WAER]], one of the nationâs first college radio stations. With the emergence of television, SU was the first to offer instruction in the field.

In 1964, supported by a gift from Samuel I. Newhouse, the Newhouse Communications Complex was officially inaugurated in Newhouse 1, an award-winning building designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]], which housed the School of Journalism. (A year later, the building would be cited as one of the top four honor award winners of the American Institute of Architects.) The building was dedicated by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who delivered his famous âGulf of Tonkin Speechâ on the Newhouse Plaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;reference 5&quot;&gt;[http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/newhouseI.html Syracuse University Archives: Syracuse University Buildings: Newhouse Communications Center I]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further growth came in 1971 when the School of Journalism merged with the Television and Radio Department, which had been located in the School of Speech and Dramatic Art. This merger marked the birth of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, named in honor of its main benefactor, and prompted the construction of a second building, Newhouse 2, which was dedicated in 1974 with a keynote address by [[William S. Paley]], chairman of the board of CBS.&lt;ref name=&quot;reference 6&quot;&gt;[http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/newhouseII.html Syracuse University Archives: Syracuse University Buildings: Newhouse Communications Center II]&lt;/ref&gt; The school became the most comprehensive, stand-alone school of its type in the nationâand remains so today. 

In 2003, the Newhouse School received a $15 million gift from the S.I. Newhouse Foundation and the Newhouse family to fund the construction of the third building in the Newhouse Communications Complex. The $31.6 million {{convert|74000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} modern structure, designed by the former [[Ennead Architects|Polshek Partnership]],&lt;ref name=&quot;reference 7&quot;&gt;[http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek08/0314/0314d_jschool.cfm AIArchitect, March 14, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; features the First Amendment etched in six-foot-high letters on its curving glass windows. Newhouse 3 was dedicated on September 19, 2007, with a keynote address from Chief Justice of the United States [[John G. Roberts|John G. Roberts Jr.]] The event was attended by the Newhouse family.&lt;ref name=&quot;reference 8&quot;&gt;[http://sumagazine.syr.edu/archive/fall07/features/feature2/index.html Syracuse University Magazine, Fall 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
