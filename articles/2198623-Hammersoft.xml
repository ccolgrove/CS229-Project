==History==
===1960s===
[[Image:dzbbtv7.png|100px|right|thumb|Original logo used by DZBB TV Channel 7 (1961-1974).]]
The origin of GMA Network can be traced back to '''Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc.''' through '''Radio Broadcasting Station'''âs [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]],&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/about GMA Network Corporate Information], GMANetwork.com&lt;/ref&gt;  which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in Metropolitan Manila in June 14, 1950 and owned by [[Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Stewart|Robert La Rue âUncle Bobâ Stewart]], an American war correspondent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;''GMA Gold: Fifty Years of Broadcast History'', Chelo Banal Formoso (ed.), GMA Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Venturing into television in the 1960s, Robert La Rue âUncle Bobâ Stewart started its television station through [[DZBB-TV|DZBB TV Channel 7]] on October 29, 1961, Philippines third terrestrial television station. Originally, DZBB TV Channel 7 programming composed of foreign programs from the United States and eventually produced local programs to cater Filipino audiences. It produces shows like ''Uncle Bobâs Lucky Seven Club'', a children show aired every Saturdays; ''Dance Time with Chito''; [[Lovingly Yours, Helen]]; [[GMA Supershow]] (formerly ''Germside'' and then ''Germspesyal'') and various news programs like [[News at Seven]]. And in 1963, [[GMA Network, Inc.|GMA Network Inc.]] (then Republic Broadcasting System Inc.) launches its first local television station in Cebu, the [[DYSS-TV|DYSS TV]] (now [[DYSS-TV|GMA TV 7 Cebu]]). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. was renamed to Republic Broadcasting System Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com GMA Network History&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[Image:Radio_Broadcasting_Station.jpg|130px|left|thumb|Logo used by RBS TV Channel 7 (1974-1975).]]
On September 21, 1972, then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared [[Martial Law|martial law]] by the virtue of [[Proclamation No. 1081|Proclamation 1081]].&lt;ref&gt; http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906446,00.html Time Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down Congress and media establishments including GMA Network. Military personnel occupied GMA Network compound and placed it under military control to prevent alleged communist propaganda. Media outlets including GMA Network that was critical to the Marcos administration ordered to be closed. Foreign citizens and entities were disallowed from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines. Stewart and the [[American Broadcasting Company]], who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a MalacaÃ±ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;PinoyTV&quot;&gt;''What's the story, Pinoy TV?'', Ellen Joy Anastacio and Janine Natalie Badiola, GMA Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a [[PhP]]7 million credit line. In the succeeding year, the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for Greater Manila Area, the station's initial coverage area), although Republic Broadcasting System Inc. remains as its corporate name until 1996.

===1980s===
[[Image:GMA logo 1980.PNG|100px|right|thumb|GMA Radio-Television Arts logo (1979-1992).]]
When [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino, Jr.]], a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot; /&gt; In 1984, [[Imee Marcos]], daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PinoyTV&quot; /&gt;  However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The network was the first to air a television interview with [[Corazon Aquino]] in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot; /&gt;  In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] broke away from the Marcos administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot; /&gt;

When democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then President, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot ''[[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]]'' located along Tandang Sora, [[Quezon City]], the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m6EVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jQsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6031%2C1257960 Pres.

===1990s===
[[Image:GMA Logo 1992.jpg|thumb|left|130px|GMA Rainbow Satellite Network logo (1992-2002).]]
International reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the ''Rainbow Satellite'' launched on April 30, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and Southeast Asia. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of South America through the ''International Channel Network''. GMA was also the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, ''[[Eat Bulaga]]'' and ''[[Okey Ka Fairy Ko!]]'' began broadcasting on GMA after [[TAPE Inc.]] disagreed with [[ABS-CBN]]'s proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel subsidiary, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet 27]], several new shows (among them were [[Bubble Gang]] and [[Startalk]], now some of the longest-running shows on TV), and the news program, ''[[Saksi]]'' with [[Mike Enriquez]], [[Mel Tiangco]] and [[Karen Davila]]. In 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''. [[GoBingo]], initially aired in 1996, is an interactive game show hosted by [[Arnell Ignacio]], with [[Maricar de Mesa]] as the first ''GobiGirl''. [[GMA Films]] was also launched in 1998 - its film ''[[JosÃ© Rizal (film)|JosÃ© Rizal]]'', which was at the time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million Pesos to produce), but becoming a huge success with many accolades and award nominations. GMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a [[Peabody Award]] for Investigative Reporting in 1999. Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the [[Channel V|Channel [V]]] franchise called [[Channel V Philippines|Channel [V] Philippines]]. Channel [V] Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and [[PLDT]] (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate [[MTV Philippines]] through their subsidiary, the [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]]. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for [[2000 Today]]. At the beginning of the year, Menardo Jimenez announced his retirement as president and CEO and on December 31, 2000, Felipe Gozon assumed the position with his concurrent capacity as chairman. Duavit's son Gilberto Duavit Jr. assumed the post of Chief Operating Officer.

===2000s===
[[Image:Kapuso unveiling.jpg|thumb|right|150px|GMA Network unveil their new corporate logo at the [[GMA Network Center]].]]
On October 27, 2002, during an episode of the network's longest-running Sunday afternoon entertainment show ''[[SOP Fully Charged|SOP]]'', GMA officially revealed a new logo and image campaign. The new logo features a rainbow colored heart-shaped logo, the '''''Kapuso''''', represented by a new slogan '''''Kapuso ng Pamilyang Pilipino, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay''''' ('''''One in Heart With the [[Filipino people|Filipino family]], In Whatever Colors of Life'''''), and a [[Century Gothic|Century Gothic Bold]] font for the letters. The &quot;Kapuso&quot; theme song is sang by [[Regine Velasquez]].

In [[2003]], ''Saksi'' won the New York Festival Gold Medal for best newscast, the first Philippine newscast to do so. This, and the Peabody Award in [[1999]], earned the network a [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] commendation later that year. On September 1 of the same year, GMA Network withdrawn its membership from the ''Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas'' (KBP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/30/ent_3-1.htm |title=KBP to GMA 7: Don't let rulings taint your view |date=September 29, 2003 | publisher=inq7.net |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050210034619/http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/30/ent_3-1.htm |archivedate=2005-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; after incidents involving host [[Rosanna Roces]], alleged commercial overloading and interfering when news anchor [[Mike Enriquez]] aired his complaints over his radio program, ''[[Saksi sa Dobol B]]'', against Lopez-owned cable firm [[SkyCable]]'s distortion of GMA's signal on its system, and a lost videotape containing evidence that the cable firm had violated the rule on soliciting ads for cable TV.

In 2005, the companyâs subsidiary, Citynet Inc., also signed a co-production and blocktime agreement with [[ZOE Broadcasting Network]], allowing the GMA Network with another platform to showcase its programming and talents. On November 11, 2005, ZOE's flagship station, [[DZOE-TV|DZOE-TV Channel 11]], went on the air as ''Quality TeleVision'' (later known as Q and was reformatted to become GMA News TV), and broadcasted shows that primarily targeted women audiences. Q's news programs shared the same resources of [[GMA News and Public Affairs]], while some programs are produced by Citynet, Inc. Also in 2005, GMA won the [[Asian Television Awards]]' Best Terrestrial Television Station, besting MBC of Korea and Mediacorp Channel 5 of Singapore. The network planned to go public, but due to political instability and downward trend of broadcast advertising, it has since been delayed.&lt;ref name =&quot;IPO1&quot;&gt;''&quot;GMA Network cancels IPO until &quot;issues&quot; are resolved&quot;''.

==Branding of the GMA Network==

===Network identity===
On October 29, 1961, then Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through '''Radio Broadcasting Station''' launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as [[DZBB-TV|DZBB TV Channel 7]]. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification. By 1974, the call letters were disregarded and paves the way for other networks to affect such naming structures. Thus, GMA is the first television station in the Philippines to be called by its corporate name and not by its call sign.
:*'''DZBB TV Channel 7 (1961-1974)'''âFrom the success of its amplitude modulation band radio [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]], [[Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Stewart|Robert La Rue &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Stewart]] launches its first television and the Philippines third terrestrial channel, [[DZBB-TV|DZBB TV Channel 7]].
:*'''RBS TV Channel 7 (1974-1975)'''âWhen Gilberto Duavit, Menardo Jimenez and Felipe Gozon took over the management of Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. in 1974, GMA Network was rebranded to Republic Broadcasting System.
:*'''GMA Radio Television Arts (1975-1992)'''âTo ascertain its present in its coverage area, the Greater Manila Area, GMA Network changed its character to GMA Radio-Television Arts.
:*'''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network (Rainbow Network, 1992-2002)'''âIn preparation for the launching of [[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]], GMA again rebranded its network identity on April 30, 1992.
:*'''GMA Network (Kapuso Network, 2002-Present)'''âIn October 27, 2002, GMA Network unveiled its new identity and catchphrase. In an effort to localized and transformed its image into a more intrinsic Filipino, GMA Network engaged in a rebranding course in line with its objective to become the leader in providing local news and entertainment. The rebranding of its logo and slogans reflects its new business distinctiveness and integrating the networkâs character as the former âRainbow Network.â

[[Image:60thanniv6002.jpg|thumb|right|170px|GMA Logo in their 60th Anniversary]]

===Logos===
GMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez and Duavit acquired the station in the 1974. From late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the [[Circle 7 logo]], which is also expended by several networks around the world. In the 1980s, to refine its presence in Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan ''Where You Belong'', and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1989, GMA Network redefines itself as the '''Rainbow Network,''' succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the '''Kapuso Network'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com GMA Network History&lt;/ref&gt; After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as '''''Kapuso''''') is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.

===Slogans===
{{main|List of GMA Network slogans}}
'''''Kapuso ng Bawat Pilipino''''' ('''''In the Hearts of Every Filipino''''') is the present characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network. The slogan was initially used in conjunction with the rebranding of GMA Network as the '''âKapuso Networkâ''' in October 27, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmapinoytv.com/about/GMANetwork&lt;/ref&gt; But the another slogan of the network '''''Kapuso Mo, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay''''' ('''''One in Heart, in Every Colors of Life''''') is still used in other purposes especially to their website ''www.igma.tv''. GMA Networkâs news and public affairs department meanwhile uses the slogan ''Serbisyong Totoo'' (''True Service''). It is one of the longest running slogans used for news broadcast promotion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/5636/gma-news-and-public-affairs-seals-commitment-to-serbisyong-totoo-via-panata-sa-bayan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/245276/panata-sa-bayan-reaffirms-serbisyong-totoo&lt;/ref&gt; GMA Network found itself on the other end of a battle concerning the slogan, when [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] uses similar catchphrase, and immediately discontinued in order to avoid legal predicament from GMA Network. In 2006, its news department also used an accompanying slogan, ''Just News,'' for its promotional campaign together with its news media partners, INQ7.Net.&lt;ref&gt;http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20061208-37156/Philippine_Daily_Inquirer,_GMA_Network_launch_'new_INQ7.net'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright infringement with ABS-CBN===
In July 22, 2004, during the arrival of Angelo de la Cruz at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] (a truck driver who was held hostage and threatened with beheading in Iraq abducted by armed rebels west of Baghdad while trucking fuel from Saudi Arabia), live news coverage was aired on GMA Network and other local television stations in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/20/content_350080.htm&lt;/ref&gt; GMA Network used audio-video coverage through the facilities of [[Reuters]], which GMA Network subscribed to.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anytimesnews.com/2010/11/18/ca-favors-gma-in-copyright-violation-case-filed-by-abs-cbn&lt;/ref&gt; During the said broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five-second of live feed, GMA Network did notice that the live feed from Reuters was also airing at another local station, its main competitor [[ABS-CBN]]. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneonline.org/metro/20101117met4.html&lt;/ref&gt; The local Court of Appeals junked the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for what was claimed to be illegal copying of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice department, which approved the filing of violation of [[Philippine copyright law|Republic Act 8293]] (or the [[Philippine copyright law|Intellectual Property Code]]) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network in airing the live video coverage was focused by good faith since there was no meaning to instigate damage to [[ABS-CBN Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malaya.com.ph/11232010/news18.html&lt;/ref&gt; The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it decided to instantaneously stop using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the said news event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The local court also stressed that apart from lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action also cannot be reflected intrusion of Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was just a short excerpt compared with the totality of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanews.tv/story/206354/ca-favors-gma-in-copyright-violation-case-filed-by-abs-cbn&lt;/ref&gt;
