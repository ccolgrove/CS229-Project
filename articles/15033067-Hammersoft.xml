'''Mr Lister''', played by [[Nick Wilton]], is the market inspector at Bridge Street market, the successor of [[Marie Matthews]] ([[Susan Cruse]]). He makes his first appearance on 3 January 2008 when he sacks his assistant, [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;3j&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a81130/its-the-day-of-kevins-funeral.html|title=It's the day of Kevin's funeral|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|last=Green|first=Kris|date=3 January 2008|accessdate=17 March 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears on a recurring basis thereafter, his next appearance being when [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) seeks approval for a new stall, which Mr Lister accepts. In August 2008, [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) gets a job as the market cleaner but Mr Lister sacks him when he loses his cart. In October 2008, [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) phones him because [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Danielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]) is selling stolen nightwear on the clothes stall. In May 2009, he closes down [[Stacey Slater]]'s ([[Lacey Turner]]) stall and in September 2009, he closes it again and gives it to [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]). In February 2010, Stacey and her friend [[Becca Swanson (EastEnders)|Becca Swanson]] ([[Simone James]]) decide to set up a stall but Mr Lister turns them down as he does not like Stacey. Becca dresses up and pretends to be from Walford Council and tells Mr Lister that Stacey has lodged a complaint against him and makes legal threats. Mr Lister then gives Stacey her stall. 

In April 2010, Mr Lister is seen investigating [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]]'s ([[Ricky Norwood]]) van, as Fatboy is trying to sell T-shirts from the vehicle without a market license. In May 2010, [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliott]]) asks Mr Lister if he can start a market stall, and Mr Lister suggests a mobile phone stall. In October 2010, [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) squirts water at him, so he orders Stacey to discipline or sack Kat, but Stacey refuses and squirts him as well, so he revokes Stacey's market traders' licence. In March 2011, Mr Lister offers Fatboy a month's trial on his own stall after Fatboy and [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]) argue over it.

In April 2011, he complains to Billy that his stall is in the wrong position, but Billy says nobody cares. [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) asks for her stall back, and they get chatting. He moans about his life as he gets abused by stallholders regularly, and his wife has left him so he rarely sees his two children. He invites Whitney for a drink and comforts her saying that her step father, [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), is doing what is best for her. He gets up to leave but falls onto Whitney, so [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) threatens him and calls him a pervert. In May, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) asks Mr Lister to get involved with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) but Mr Lister says he has no say over the shop, which Patrick owns. In June, Whitney and [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) ask Mr Lister for a stall, but he is reluctant as Whitney lost a stall for not paying her rent. However, he agrees as long as the owed rent is paid and a month's rent is paid in advance. In July, Mr Lister issues Fatboy with a warning for kicking his own stall, but Fatboy decides to abandon his stall before he can be disciplined. He warns [[Eddie Moon]] ([[David Essex]]) about flytipping, and is threatened by Eddie's son [[Tyler Moon|Tyler]] ([[Tony Discipline]]). Lister later accepts a bribe from Eddie. In November, Mr Lister appears following reports that someone is selling Dutch Father Christmas toys, and asks [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) if he knows anything. Alfie denies this, although it is his relatives Tyler and [[Anthony Moon]] (Matt Lapinskis) who have done it. Anthony asks Fatboy to change them so they no longer speak Dutch, and when Lister sees Fatboy with one, it plays a jingle in Fatboy's voice.

'''&quot;Tegs&quot; Teague''', played by [[Benjamin Smith (actor)|Ben Smith]], is the main leader of a gang called the 'E20'.

The gang harass [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) by wolf-whistling at her and calling her a &quot;zombie&quot;. [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) sees them and tells them to leave her alone. The gang, including Tegs' friend [[#Ziggy|Ziggy]] (Ashley Horne), steal DVDs from [[Winston (EastEnders)|Winston]]'s ([[Ulric Browne]]) market stall with the help of [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]). Tegs asks Jay if he wants to join the gang and gives him a mobile phone so they can call each other. Jay later sneaks out and Tegs hands him a knife, which is found by Jay's father, [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]) and his girlfriend [[Dawn Swann]] ([[Kara Tointon]]). The next day, the gang steal several packs of cigarettes from the local shop, the Minute Mart. They harass Dot by making silent phone calls and knocking on her door and running away. Tegs pulls a knife on [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]), who confronts the group of youths. After Jay criticises Tegs's harassment of Dot, they have a fight. After appearing to have reconciled their differences, Tegs is asked by his gang whether he is with them or Jay, at which point he stabs Jay in the leg, leaving him bleeding on the ground in the park. Tegs' mum, [[#Tina Teague|Tina Teague]] (Kerry Ann White) arrives before the trial to try and persuade Jay to drop the charges against Tegs but he does not and Tegs is sentenced in an off-screen trial on 29 February to two years in a [[Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution|Young Offenders Institution]] for his crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;29 Feb&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a89555/max-tells-tanya-he-wants-her-back.html|title=Max tells Tanya he wants her back|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
A show insider told ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that the storyline in which Tegs stabs Jay is &quot;easily one of the most shocking and controversial storylines ''EastEnders'' has ever done. It is not a decision bosses have taken lightly, but it is an issue that is top of the news agenda. We're going to tread very carefullyâit wonât be gratuitous. The plan is to screen the episodes in the usual slots before the watershed. Hopefully by showing the suffering gang violence can cause, some people may think twice about getting involved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;News&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article661746.ece|title=Jay knifed by Walford hoodies|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|last=Robertson|first=Colin|accessdate=5 April 2011|location=London|date=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be the first teenage gang-related attack that ''EastEnders'' has featured.&lt;ref name=&quot;News&quot;/&gt; Kris Green from ''[[Digital Spy]]'' described him as 'out of control'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hit/run&quot;/&gt;

Family matriarch [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) invites Jalil to stay with the family and work in their post office for a while, trying to set him up with her daughter, Shabnam.

Zainab sets them up with a romantic meal, listening in on their conversation using a baby monitor. Shabnam discovers that Jalil has a girlfriend, though Zainab sees a picture of her and says she is ugly and that her make-up looks like it has been done by [[Edward Scissorhands]].

Jalil and Shabnam later share a kiss, but during a conversation with the Masood family, he says that he thinks modern Muslim women like Shabnam provide &quot;great entertainment&quot; but are not marriage material.

Melinda comes to Walford with Ricky for funeral of his father, [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (entertainer)|Mike Reid]]). Throughout the day, she spends most of the time on the telephone to her father asking him for Â£25,000 as a property deposit, which he later fails to provide for her. She makes several attempts to introduce herself to [[Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and is dismissive when Ricky mentions his ex-wife [[Bianca Jackson]]'s ([[Patsy Palmer]]) absence from the funeral. At Frank's wake, it becomes clear that Melinda is only interested in what Frank has left to Ricky in his will. There is no financial gain, so Melinda quickly leaves in a bad mood. Later, Ricky announces that he and Melinda have split up, and Bianca tells Pat that Melinda was responsible for Ricky's lack of contact with their son [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]).

Speaking of the announcement of Melinda's arrival, an ''EastEnders'' source told [[Digital Spy]]: &quot;Ricky returns to the Square for his dad [[Frank Butcher|Frank]]'s funeral and turns up with Melindaâbut is it true love or just a fling between them?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melinda&quot;/&gt; An insider told ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that Melinda is &quot;a classy bird, not at all like Ricky's mouthy old flame Bianca.

Morgan, along with his mother, his half siblings [[Tiffany Dean]] ([[Maisie Smith]]) and [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]), and his stepsister Whitney, are thrown out their house by their landlord. After initially spending a week in care, Morgan and the rest of his family move to [[Walford]], where they begin living with his great-grandmother [[Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). The same week, a family party is held, where Morgan and his half-siblings meet the rest of their extended family. Bianca attempts to enter Morgan into a 'Beautiful Baby Competition' held at [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], but is forced to withdraw him due to his age. A few days later he celebrates his third birthday by going to a restaurant with his family. Despite initially being thought to be the son of Bianca's partner Tony, it is discovered that this is not the case when Tony is released from prison, due to Morgan's ethnicity. Bianca reveals that Morgan was the result of a one-night stand she had with an unknown man but has always seen Tony as his father due to the fact that they met during her pregnancy and he has always been a consistent figure in Morgan's life. 

Morgan becomes ill and is diagnosed by [[#Poppy Merritt|Dr Poppy Merritt]] ([[Amy Darcy]]) with chicken pox. This leads to Pat having to vacate the family home as she had never had the illness. When Tony is arrested for having had a sexual relationship with Whitney, Morgan starts asking for his dad, leading the family to make up an excuse as they know that he will not understand what Tony had done. [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) and [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) use Morgan to raise money for their rent, pretending they are his parents and they are collecting money for a new playground. While trying to make a sandwich he accidentally squirts tomato ketchup on a hoody belonging to his recently deceased uncle [[Billie Jackson]] ([[Devon Anderson]]). Liam hides it and later tries to wash the stain out but their grandmother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) sees it and slaps him. Morgan starts to follow Liam around, fearing that he will die as well but Ricky and Janine reassure him. He runs away from home after Bianca is put into prison but is caught.

Inzamam first visits [[Walford]] to check up on his brother's family while Masood is in [[Karachi]] visiting their sick father.

He comes onto her, and she leaves, forcing her to consider selling her house. On the day before Syed's wedding to Amira, Masood takes Inzamam to dinner to ask if he can help with some money. Inzamam does not know who is getting married as nobody has told him about it and also does not know that Zainab is pregnant. Masood asks Zainab why she did not invite Inzamam to the wedding and she says she forgot, but he realises she did it deliberately. She tells him that Inzamam sees her as a fallen woman as she was previously married to [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]),who returned a year later, when she met Masood, and he made many advances toward her. Masood orders Inzamam to stand and tells him that he knows what he has done. Masood returns Inzamam's money and says he is not invited to the wedding and is not welcome in their home and he walks out of their house with his wife, [[Fatima Inzamam|Fatima]] and children [[#Ali Inzamam|Ali]] ([[Omar Kent]]) and [[#Jamila Inzamam|Jamila]] ([[Sara Aisha Kent]]).

'''Jordan Johnson''', played by [[Michael-Joel David Stuart]], is the son of [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) and the half-brother of [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]), who arrives on Chelsea's birthday with his father. He is described on the ''EastEnders'' website as a &quot;cheeky chap&quot; who &quot;lights up the room with his winning smile&quot;. He is also described as a &quot;talented boy who works hard at school&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/jordan-johnson.shtml|title=Jordan Johnson played by Michael-Joel David Stuart|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first appears on 23 May 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan J&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a95789/sean-kidnaps-his-mother.html|title=Sean kidnaps his mother|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=23 May 2008|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaves on 21 December 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan Johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a292829/ryan-and-stacey-go-public-at-the-pub.html|title=Ryan and Stacey go public at the pub|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=22 December 2010|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lucas arrives in [[Walford]], he tells Chelsea's mother [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) that Jordan's mother [[Trina Johnson|Trina]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]) abandoned him shortly after he was born. He was in an incubator, addicted to heroin, as Trina was a drug addict. When [[Yolande Trueman]] ([[Angela Wynter]]) tries to get Chelsea to bond with Jordan, he finds [[cocaine]] in her handbag. Chelsea claims it is sherbet but Jordan is not deceived and tells her that their father helps drug addicts. When Jordan forgets his key to Lucas's flat, Yolande takes him to her B&amp;B. Denise is not pleased that he is there but eventually enjoys his company. Jordan leaves with his father after locals blame him for [[Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]) being allowed to work with children. Jordan and Lucas return a month later and stay at the B&amp;B before preparing to leave for Leeds. 

After Denise proposes to Lucas, Jordan reveals that Lucas is still married to Trina. Unknown to Jordan and Denise, Trina had been looking for Lucas and he knows her whereabouts. She asks about Jordan and says she is no longer addicted to drugs, and he says he is going to marry Denise. Eventually, Jordan and Trina bond, but he is unhappy that Trina is excluded from a family holiday. He tells Trina about the holiday and she arrives to try to stop it. Jordan becomes friends with [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Charlie Jones (actor)|Charlie Jones]]) and [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]). Trina is killed while trying to seduce Lucas, and he leaves her in a shed on the allotment. Jordan tries to contact her on her mobile phone as she has promised to contact him. Jordan and Abi discover her body when they volunteer to clean the shed for [[Charlie Slater]] ([[Derek Martin]]). They decide to raise funds for a tree to be planted in Trina's memory in Albert Square's gardens, but unknown to everyone, Lucas murders Denise's ex-husband [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]) and buries his corpse under the tree.

Ben dares Jordan to drink alcohol that Ben stole from his family's pub. Lucas catches him and threatens to get Ben's father [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) involved but Jordan insists it was his idea and nothing to do with Ben. Jordan is annoyed when he sees Ben's sister [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]] kicking Trina's tree and she later blames him for locking her in a shed when it was actually Ben. Jordan swears on the bible that he did not do it, so Lucas believes him, and he tells Phil that he thinks Ben did it. This eventually turns out to be true, and Ben reveals that Jordan has been bullying him, so Phil and Lucas leave them with [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]) to help them bond. After Minty leaves them alone, Jordan insults Ben, so Ben throws him to the ground and attacks him with a spanner, leaving him there. The next day he is found by Phil and taken to hospital where he is left in a coma with a fractured skull. Wracked with guilt, Ben confesses to the police that he attacked Jordan, while Jordan is brought out of his medically-induced coma. When he is discharged, his family throw him a party. In Jordan's police statement, he says that Ben attacked him for no reason. However, after Denise is visited by [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), who doesn't believe Ben would attack Jordan for no reason, she talks to Jordan and gets him to reveal that he had been bullying Ben. Jordan then decides to change his statement.

When Owen's corpse is discovered under the tree, Jordan gets upset every time the tree is mentioned and reveals he had a dream where a hand came out of the ground. Lucas promises to get the council to replace the tree. Jordan and Abi argue when he feels she does not care and their friendship ends. He wonders if it is his fault that the people around him are dying. When the truth emerges that Lucas allowed Trina to die, killed Owen and kidnapped Denise, Jordan tries to stick by his father when the rest of the family run out, but then leaves in fear when he discovers that, rather than outright killing Trina, Lucas could have saved her but chose not to. Lucas is then arrested. When Jordan visits Denise with the rest of the family, he does not speak and just clutches his Bible. Finding it hard to come to terms with what has happened, Jordan eventually opens up to [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]), crying on his shoulder. The next day he worries that no one will want to be friends with him because they all know about Lucas. However, after he ends his romance with Abi, he is happy that they agree to remain friends. Jordan then says goodbye to his sister Chelsea and Libby, who are moving away after their ordeal in Walford. On his birthday, Jordan receives a card from his father, but asks [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) to throw it away, and says he has to now look after Denise. However, Jordan is unable to speak to Denise about Lucas, so stays in contact with his aunt [[Gloria MacDonald]] ([[Michele Austin]]). Denise discovers they have been in contact for several months and allows Jordan to spend Christmas with her. Jordan is happy at his aunt's house, so Denise reluctantly lets him stay there into the New Year.

Lucy introduces her father [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) to Olly, whom she met when she was homeless and is five years Lucy's senior,&lt;ref name=&quot;Olly Gazette&quot;/&gt; and tells Ian that Olly is moving in or she will leave.

Arriving in Walford in search of his father, Callum is instantly attracted to [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]). Unperturbed by her rejections, Callum attempts to woo Stacey, despite discovering that she is married. He briefly dates Stacey's friend [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Dannielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]), but only to make Stacey jealous. Stacey continues to reject Callum, but after her husband [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]) angers her one night, she kisses Callum. Realising that her marriage is over, Stacey finishes with Bradley, allowing a casual relationship with Callum to begin. Their romance does not last, as Callum cannot bear to be around Stacey's mother [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]), who has [[bipolar disorder]]. Blaming Jean for the relationship's demise, Callum aggressively tells her that she is ruining her daughter's life. When Stacey discovers this, she punches Callum and he reveals that his mother, who was also mentally ill, used to abuse him and lock him in cupboards when he was a child. He has scars on his legs from an incident where his mother attacked him with a wire coat hanger at the age of ten. Due to this and realising that Stacey would never leave Jean, Callum declares there is nothing left for him in Walford. He bids a final goodbye to Stacey and leaves to pursue Vinnie, who has already departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/07/19/exclusive-bobby-davro-quits-eastenders-after-just-one-year-115875-20654465/|title=Exclusive: Bobby Davro quits EastEnders|first=Mark|last=Jefferies|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=19 July 2008|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1dec&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a136269/vinnie-leaves-walford.html|title=Vinnie leaves Walford|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''EastEnders'' website showed that Callum went to live with his Dad in [[Southend]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/danielles_diary/ Danielle's Diary] {{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- looking through ds spoilers and some of his storylines arent there like max telling him to stay away from stacey leading up to why he wanted to run max over--&gt;

Christian later went out for a drink with him and got Joel's contact details for Ronnie. Over the next few days Lee and Christian started a relationship, this was thanks to Christian's sister [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) sending Lee a text from Christian's phone. A few days into this relationship, Lee said that he was surprised he was attracted to Christian, as he tended to prefer younger men.

After Sergeant Morris found bullet holes in the wall, Max said that they were the work of his brother [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]). This however turned out to be a ploy of his in order to prevent Jack moving away to France with Max's wife [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) and their three children. As a result Jack was arrested for attempted murder, but was later released due to lack of evidence. The gun had been found by Turner, however he later met Jack and handed the gun over to him, as he had respect for him as a former police officer.

He later appeared after Max was mowed down by a moving car. He was worried about being discovered for giving Jack the gun, but Jack assured him that he was safe. However things got worse for him when [[Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]) turned up and announced that she was taking over the case of the Branning brothers' feud. After Tanya confessed to the hit and run and later refused bail, Jack enlisted DI Turner to help find the witness of Max's hit-and-run. He was reluctant, but after being blackmailed by Jack over his involvement with the &quot;missing&quot; gun, he relented and later revealed that the witness was [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]).

In the upcoming case, Tanya had been arrested for attempted murder on her estranged husband [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]). Despite promising Jack Tanya's freedom and helping her client in every way she could in order to see that she would be given bail, she admitted to Jack that Tanya didn't stand a chance of getting released. This proved true when Tanya's bail application was denied later that day. She later appeared, when she visited Tanya in prison to inform her that Max is concerned she is covering for Jack. However, this has been proven incorrect, although it has been revealed that Tanya is covering for her daughter, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]) . She returned to accompany Tanya in court, she asked Tanya to think about what her plea would be.When the truth about Lauren was revealed, she asked Kendra to contact social services because she felt that she will only make things worse for her family. She appeared later when she seemingly attended Lauren's court appearance.

'''Amy Christina Margaret Mitchell''' (nÃ©e '''Slater''') played by Kamil Lipka-Kozanka and Natalia Lipka-Kozanka, is the daughter of [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) and [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]). She made her first appearance on 14 November 2008, the episode in which she is born.&lt;ref name=&quot;birth&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a135142/roxy-goes-into-premature-labour.html|title=Roxy goes into premature labour|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=17 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first few weeks of her life, she is raised as the daughter of Roxy's husband [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]) as he and Jack are unaware of Amy's true paternity. Amy is born two months premature and is put on a ventilator from birth. She is named after her presumed-dead cousin (now known as [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Danielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]), the daughter of Roxy's sister, [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]). Roxy initially decides to raise Amy with her friend [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]]), after Sean misses Amy's birth but changes her mind when she and Sean reconcile. 

Jack asks Roxy for a paternity test, aware that Amy may be his daughter. It transpires that this is so on Christmas Day 2008 which leads to Sean abducting Amy. There is a fierce argument when Sean is found with Amy which leads to Sean leaving and Amy is returned to Roxy by Sean's sister [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) on New Year's Day. Jack then spends more time with Amy and Ronnie decides Amy should be Christened and Roxy agrees. Amy's godfather is Christian and her godmother is her step-grandmother [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), although Ronnie is originally meant to be her godmother, but gets drunk and turns up late to the ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;drunk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/gallery/gallery-specials/11810/3/2/see-pictures-eastenders-ronnie-mitchell-gets-drunk-and-ruins-her-niece-amy-slater-s-christening/1/|title=EastEnders: Ronnie Mitchell ruins Amy Slater's christening|work=[[NOW (British magazine)|Now]]|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian and his partner [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliot]]) look after Amy for a day and decide that they want a child. While Amy is being looked after by Ronnie, she draws a picture, which upsets Ronnie has Ronnie interprets it as including her son who died. Amy escapes from the house, which leads to everyone discovering Ronnie has been bailed from prison after swapping her dead baby [[James Branning|James]] with [[Kat Moon]]'s ([[Jessie Wallace]]) healthy son [[Tommy Moon|Tommy]]. Amy also escapes when Roxy's boyfriend [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) leaves the door open. Amy is almost hit by [[Carol Jackson]]'s ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) car but is saved by [[Eddie Moon]] ([[David Essex]]). When Amy suffers a fall at home, Roxy thinks nothing of it. Roxy goes on a night out with friends, leaving [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe) babysitting Amy. When he leaves Amy alone for a while to get a DVD from Jack's flat, Amy runs herself a bath, gets in and almost drowns. When Ben discovers her, [[Yusef Khan|Dr Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) is called and he revives her. Amy is taken to hospital in a critical condition. She recovers, but she is found to have a fracture from her previous fall, so a social worker awards temporary custody of Amy to Jack. Roxy later is allowed to see Amy, whilst a social worker evaluates Roxy's parenting skills. Jack refuses to allow Roxy to see Amy other than at arranged times. A solicitor tells Roxy to dig up as much dirt on Jack and his family as she can, but this does not work as a court grants full custody to Jack.

===Development===
Robert Kazinsky who plays Sean Slater teased the Christmas storyline saying, &quot;Sean ultimately deceives Roxy and snatches baby Amy from The Vic. Then there's a whole week of the Mitchells trying to track Sean and Amy down. Sean's holed up in a squat with the baby to give them more time together. He's simply looking after Amy, who's become the most important person in his life. Even if she isn't his child, mentally and emotionally, she is to Sean. Eventually, Sean's found and it all kicks off, culminating in a stunt with an icy lakeâ¦&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amy&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a137974/rob-kazinsky-sean-slater-eastenders.html|title=Rob Kazinsky (Sean Slater, 'EastEnders')|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=17 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazinsky said that he thinks Sean would be a good dad to Amy saying, Sean was 16 when his father died, so for Sean, bringing up baby Amy was a way for him to make it up to his dad - by being the father to Amy that his father was to him.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;amy&quot;/&gt;

He then later appeared when Stacey and Danielle were in the club with some boys Paul knew. Danielle spilt her drink on one of the boys and Paul appeared offering to buy her another one.

He then walked her to the bar and confronted her about her abortion. He thanked her because he believed he was too young to be a dad. Danielle realised Stacey told him and threw her drink at Paul and Danielle walked out before disowning Stacey.
