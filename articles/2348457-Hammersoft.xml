'''Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Anthony Pepitone''' (born October 9, 1940 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[first baseman]] and [[outfielder]] who played the bulk of his career for the [[New York Yankees]].  He also played several seasons with the [[Chicago Cubs]] and had short stints with the [[Houston Astros]] and [[Atlanta Braves]].  During his time with the Yankees, Pepitone was thrice-named to play in the [[All-Star Game]] and also won three [[Golden Glove]] awards.  His fame was adequate for him to become something of a cultural icon.

==Baseball career==
===Yankees===
In 1958, Pepitone was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur [[free agent]]. After playing four seasons in the [[minor leagues]], he broke in with the Yankees in 1962, playing behind [[Moose Skowron]] at [[first base]]. A much-discussed [[legend]] was that while on his way to 1962 [[spring training]] in [[Florida]], Pepitone spent his entire $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1958|r=0}}}} today) signing bonus. He bought a [[Ford Thunderbird]], a boat which he towed with the Thunderbird, and a [[dog]]. He arrived at Yankees [[spring training]] in [[Fort Lauderdale|Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], with a new car, a new boat, a new dog, and was wearing a new [[shark]]-skin suit.

Yankee management believed he could handle the first base job, and before the 1963 season traded Skowron to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]]. Pepitone responded, hitting .271 with 27 HR and 89 RBI. He went on to win three [[Gold Gloves]], but in the [[1963 World Series]] he made an infamous [[error]]. With the score tied 1-1 in the seventh inning of Game Four, he lost a routine [[Clete Boyer]] throw in the white shirtsleeves of the Los Angeles crowd, and the batter, [[Jim Gilliam]], went all the way to [[third base]] and scored the Series-winning run on a sacrifice fly. He redeemed himself somewhat in the [[1964 World Series|1964 Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] with a Game 6 [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]].

The ever-popular Pepitone remained a fixture throughout the decade, even playing [[center field]] after bad [[knees]] reduced [[Mickey Mantle]]'s mobility. 

===Astros, Cubs, and Braves===
After the 1969 season, despite having won his third [[Golden Glove Award]], Pepitone was traded to the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] for [[Curt Blefary]]. However, he played only about half the 1970 season before being traded to the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]].

In Chicago, Pepitone replaced [[Ernie Banks]] at first place.  He stayed with the Cubs through the 1971 and 1972 seasons, and was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in May, 1973.  In Atlanta, Pepitone only played three games, which marked the end of his major-league career in the United States.

===Japan===
In June 1973, Pepitone accepted an offer of $70,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|70000|1973|r=0}}}} today) a year to play for the [[Tokyo Yakult Swallows|Yakult Atoms]], a professional [[baseball]] team in [[Japan]]'s [[Central League]]. While in Japan, he hit .163 with one [[home run]] and two [[RBI]]s in 14 [[games played]]. According to an edition of ''Total Baseball'', Pepitone spent his days in Japan skipping games for claimed injuries only to be at night in [[disco]]s, behavior which led the Japanese to adopt his name into their [[vernacular]]--as a word meaning &quot;goof off&quot;.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

==Life after baseball==
===Memoirs===
[[Jim Bouton]] talks extensively about Pepitone in his book ''[[Ball Four]]''. Pepitone is described as being extremely vain. Bouton said that Pepitone went nowhere without a bag containing hair products for his rapidly balding head. Pepitone even had two [[hair piece|toupees]], one for general wear and one for under his baseball cap, which he called his &quot;game piece.&quot; Bouton told a humorous story about how the game piece came loose one day when Pepitone took off his cap for the national anthem.

In January 1975, Pepitone published his own tell-all baseball memoir, titled ''Joe, You Coulda Made Us Proud.'' The book received substantial attention for its many revelations. Later that year, he posed nude for Foxy Lady magazine, featuring full frontal nudity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/29878446/page/2/ Where Have Baseball's Characters Gone?- Article at NBC Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Other work===
In the late 70's, Pepitone played for the New Jersey Statesmen in the American Professional Slow Pitch League (APSPL), one of three [[professional softball leagues]] active during this period. Pepitone would also serve the front office  of the North American Softball League (NASL) for their only season in 1980.

In June 1982, Pepitone was hired as a batting coach with the Yankees, but was replaced by [[Lou Piniella]] later in the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C12F7355C0C758CDDAF0894DA484D81 New York Times Article - June 6, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Pepitone was given a job in the Yankees' front office. He currently spends his time signing autographs and baseball memorabilia at autograph shows, and working in a public relations capacity for the Yankees.

===Criminal history===
*Pepitone spent four months at [[Rikers Island]] jail in 1988 for two [[misdemeanor]] drug convictions after he and two other men were arrested on March 18, 1985, in [[Brooklyn]] after being stopped by the police for running a red light in a car containing nine ounces of [[cocaine]], 344 [[quaaludes]], a [[Freebase (chemistry)|free-basing]] kit, a pistol and about $6,300 in cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50915F83D5C0C738EDDAA0894DD484D81 New York Times Article - March 20, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of the story by WOR-TV (Channel 9) in the New York area featured clips of an incredulous Pepitone declaring, &quot;I didn't know cocaine was illegal&quot;, and his brother Vinnie, a New York City detective, staunchly defending his character.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He was released from jail on a work-release program when Yankee owner [[George Steinbrenner]] offered him a job in minor-league player development for the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D7103EF936A25754C0A96E948260 New York Times Article - July 15, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In January 1992, Pepitone was charged with misdemeanor assault in [[Catskills|Kiamesha Lake, New York]], after a scuffle police said was triggered when Pepitone was called a &quot;has-been.&quot; He was arraigned in town court and released after he posted $75 bail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DA123AF933A25752C0A964958260 New York Times Article - January 10, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In October 1995, the 55-year-old Pepitone was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after losing control of his car in [[New York City]]'s [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]]. Police found Pepitone bloodied, disoriented and mumbling as he walked through the tunnel. Authorities charged Pepitone with drunken driving after he refused to take a sobriety test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=You Can Call Me Joe Pepitone|publisher=Long Beach (CA) Press-Telegram|date=October 26, 1995|accessdate=2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pepitone pled guilty. When asked if he was staying away from alcohol, Pepitone responded: &quot;I don't drink that much.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Pepitone In Auto Plea|author=Karen Freifeld |publisher=Newsday (Melville, NY)|date=February 23, 1996|accessdate=2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
