{{Marketing}}
In [[economics]], '''vendor lock-in''', also known as '''proprietary lock-in''' or '''customer lock-in''', makes a customer dependent on a [[vendor (supply chain)|vendor]] for [[Product (business)|product]]s and [[Service (economics)|services]], unable to use another vendor without substantial [[switching barriers|switching costs]]. Lock-in costs which create [[barriers to entry|barriers to market entry]] may result in [[antitrust]] action against a [[monopoly]].

== Examples of lock-in ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}

=== SIM locking ===
{{Main|SIM lock}}

[[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] locking may be considered a vendor lock-in tactic as phones purchased from the vendor will work with SIM cards only from the same network. This creates additional inconvenience to the buyer as the phone cannot use a prepaid SIM from a different vendor while on vacation (a common tactic used by Asian tourists visiting another Asian country) and as a result the subscriber must also sign up the often expensive roaming service offered by the vendor. Additionally, should the subscriber wish to take out a second line for any reason, he/she must also get the line from the same vendor, as the SIM card of a competing vendor will not work. Sometimes, even the SIM card from the same vendor will not work and the buyer will be forced into buying another phone.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== Automobiles ===
Automobiles are often made with certain parts, such as [[car stereo]]s, which might be interchangeable. Sometimes the manufacturers will attempt to create lock-in by various means; in the case of a stereo, they might make the stereo unit an unusual size and shape instead of a standard one{{dubious|date=November 2011}}, or create a unique way for the dashboard part of the stereo to control a [[CD Changer]] in the trunk.

Various standards organizations, such as the US [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], regulate the design of certain automobile components to prevent vendor lock-in.

=== Gift certificates ===

Gift certificates are textbook examples of vendor lock-in as they can be used solely in the vendor's shops. Gift certificates typically only worth their face price (no bonus credit is added), so generally, they do not represent any advantage over money.

Also, some vendors practice a store-credit/gift certificate refund policy in the time of warranty if they can't replace or repair the product. This is illegal in many jurisdictions as it forces the client to buy a different article in the same shop possibly for lower price/quality ratio. It's also possible that the client is forced to buy a completely different product if the original product line is no longer sold.

This policy is different from the refund policy in case of dissatisfaction. In this case, the vendor offers to exchange the article in a typically short time frame. If the article is not faulty then the vendor has no obligation to exchange or refund it unless he's committed to do so in advance.

=== Telephone equipment ===

The [[Bell System]] monopoly initially refused to allow anyone to [[interconnection]] of their network to other networks or to non-Bell equipment,
until the [[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]] federal court ruling and the [[Carterfone]] FCC regulatory ruling.

The Bell System allowed interconnection to third-party equipment only through the added expense of protective [[acoustic coupler]], while Bell equipment could be directly electrically connected to the network,
until a later FCC order which led to [[registered jack#History_and_authority | standardized modular connectors]].

===Other examples===
*Many printers manufacturers claim that if any ink cartridges, beyond those sold by themselves, are used in the printer, the warranty of the printer becomes void.
*The [[Filofax]] brand of [[personal organizer]]s, for example, is not compatible with standard paper and ring-binder sizes, so users can buy additional and replacement supplies only from Filofax or a limited number of other suppliers. Costs are several times those of comparable stationery supplies in standard sizes and formats.
*The [[K-Cup]] single-use coffee pod system is patented and licensed by [[Keurig]], which is a subsidiary of [[Green Mountain Coffee Roasters]]. All K-Cups are licensed, there are no generics. K-Cup brewers can be used only with K-Cups, with the alternative being the optional reusable filter for use with any coffee grounds other than brands or blends approved by Keurig. Other [[:Category:Single-serving coffee|Single-serving coffee]] brands, such as [[Nespresso]], also have proprietary systems.
*Many [[vacuum cleaner]]s are only compatible with specific filter bags.
*The detachable heads of [[electric toothbrush]]es can often only be replaced by heads made by the same company.

==Lock-in for electronics and computers==
Vendor lock-in is rampant in the computer and electronics industries.

In the computer industry, both hardware and [[software]], vendor lock-in can be used to describe situations in which there is a lack of compatibility or [[interoperability]] between equivalent components.

This can make it difficult to switch systems at many levels; the [[application program]], the [[file format]], the [[operating system]], or various pieces of computer hardware ranging from a [[video card]] to a whole computer or even an entire network of computers. Note that in many cases, there are no technical standards that would allow creation of interoperable systems. At nearly any level of [[systems architecture]], lock-in may occur. This creates a situation where lock-in is often used as leverage to get market share, often leading to monopolies and antitrust actions.

===Adobe===

Adobe is accused of vendor lock-in because of their Flash Player. Adobe's browser plug-in is present in over 95% of computers worldwide and has been a cause of scrutiny against its privacy policies.

In response to Flash Player's dominance as a video player, the HTML5 specification allows video playback without requiring the Adobe Flash plugin. In accordance with this standard, [[Mozilla Foundation]] has natively (no plug-in necessary) included [[Vorbis]] and [[Theora]] playback in its flagship browser [[Firefox]] starting from the version 3.5, as they say &quot;to enable unencumbered, royalty-free, open-source friendly audio and video playback on the Web&quot; and Firefox 4.0 and later versions supports native (no plug-in necessary) playback of [[WebM]] &amp; [[VP8]] in addition to Theora playback support.

{{As of|2010|12|13}}, the biggest video website that has adopted HTML5 video playback is [[Daily Motion]] (with [[YouTube]] currently running a beta) although a sizable amount of videos aren't encoded with a royalty-free codec.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Google===
It is not required to have a [[Google Account]] to use an [[Android device]], but if one is added it cannot later be removed without a fulll factory reset, deleting all user data and applications.

===IBM===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
[[IBM]] was subject to a series of the longest and most complex monopoly antitrust actions in United States history, and presented the first significant model for understanding of how lock-in affected the computer industry. IBM had significant lock-in of the [[punched card]] industry from its earliest days; before computers as we recognize them today even existed. From dominance of the card punches, readers, tabulators, and printers, IBM extended to dominance of the [[mainframe computer]] market, and then to the [[operating system]]s and [[application program]]s for computers. Third party products existed for some areas, but customers then faced the prospect of having to prove which vendor was at fault if, say, a third party printer didn't work correctly with an IBM computer, and IBM's warranties and service agreements often stipulated that they would not support systems with non-IBM components attached. This put customers into an all-or-nothing situation.

===Microsoft===
[[Microsoft]] software carries a high level of vendor lock-in, based on its extensive set of proprietary [[application programming interface|API]]s. Their degree of lock-in combined with their market share has made them subject to a number of antitrust lawsuits.

The [[European Commission]], in its March 24, 2004 decision on Microsoft's business practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/download/legal/europeancommission/03-24-06EUDecision.pdf |title=Commission Decision of 24.03.2004 relating to a proceeding under Article 82 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft) |date=March 24, 2004 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |format=PDF |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes, in paragraph 463, Microsoft general manager for [[C++]] development Aaron Contorer as stating in a February 21, 1997 internal Microsoft memo drafted for [[Bill Gates]]:

:&quot;The [[Windows API]] is so broad, so deep, and so functional that most [[independent software vendor|ISV]]s would be crazy not to use it. And it is so deeply embedded in the [[source code]] of many Windows [[application software|apps]] that there is a huge switching cost to using a different [[operating system]] instead...

:&quot;It is this switching cost that has given the customers the patience to stick with Windows through all our mistakes, our buggy [[device driver|drivers]], our high [[total cost of ownership|TCO]], our lack of a sexy vision at times, and many other difficulties [...] Customers constantly evaluate other desktop platforms, [but] it would be so much work to move over that they hope we just improve Windows rather than force them to move.

:&quot;In short, without this exclusive franchise called the Windows API, we would have been dead a long time ago.&quot;

Microsoft's application software also exhibits lock-in through the use of proprietary [[file format]]s. [[Microsoft Outlook]] uses a proprietary datastore file and interface which are impossible to read without being [[Parsing|parsed]], and such parsers may in turn not be able to exist legally without performing [[reverse engineer]]ing. For example, to access data contained in Outlook's '.PST' files, the application must process the request through Outlook instead of directly handling the file. Present versions of Microsoft Word have introduced a new format [[OOXML|MS-OOXML]]. This may make it easier for competitors to write documents compatible with Microsoft Office in the future by reducing lock-in.  Microsoft released full descriptions of the file formats for earlier versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx |title=Microsoft Office Binary (doc, xls, ppt) File Formats |date=February 15, 2008 |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ActiveSync]] is a [[proprietary protocol]] used by [[PDA]]s and handheld devices for data transfer with a [[personal computer]].

===Apple Inc.===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[ITunes Store]] --&gt;
[[Apple Inc.]] has historically been well-known for its lock-in practices. For a long time their market share has been small enough that their anti-trust exposure has been substantially less than that of Microsoft or IBM.

Apple often makes use of new or unusual hardware systems; they were the first vendor to make widespread use of [[Sony]]'s 3.5&quot; [[floppy drive]], and they devised their own [[Apple Desktop Bus]] system for [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]s and [[mouse (computer)|mice]], their own [[LocalTalk]] networking system, the high-speed [[FireWire]] serial interface for storage and video transfer, the 30-pin [[Dock connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|iPod dock connector]], and non-standard display interfaces such as [[Apple Display Connector|ADC]], [[Mini-DVI]], and [[Mini DisplayPort]]. Due to Apple's smaller market share the number of third-party providers was more limited than for the competing [[IBM PC]] platform (though larger than for the [[Amiga]], which had similarly unusual components), and third-party providers sometimes had to license elements of the [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] technology, meaning that Apple made money on every peripheral sold, even if they did not manufacture it.

Prior to  March 2009 digital music files with [[Digital Rights Management|digital rights management]] were available for purchase from the [[iTunes Store|iTunes music store]] encoded in a proprietary derivative of the [[Advanced Audio Coding|.AAC]] format that used Apple's [[FairPlay]] DRM system. These files are compatible only with Apple's [[iTunes]] media player software on [[Macintosh|Macs]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], their [[iPod]] portable digital music players, [[iPhone]] [[smartphone]]s, [[iPad]] [[tablet computer]]s, and the [[Motorola]] [[Motorola ROKR E1|ROKR E1]] and [[Motorola SLVR|SLVR]] mobile phones. As a result, that music was locked into this ecosystem and available for portable use only through the purchase of one of the above devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/njtip/v5/n2/5/#note10 |title=Is Apple Playing Fair? Navigating the iPod FairPlay DRM Controversy |first1=Nicola F. |last1=Sharpe |first2=Olufunmilayo B. |last2=Arewa |month=Spring |year=2007 |journal=Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property |publisher=[[Northwestern University]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by burning to [[Compact Disc|CD]] and optionally re-ripping to a DRM-free format such as [[MP3]] or [[WAV]].

In January, 2005, an [[iPod]] purchaser named Thomas Slattery filed a suit against Apple for the &quot;unlawful bundling&quot; of their [[iTunes Music Store]] and iPod device.  He stated in his brief: &quot;Apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice.&quot;  At the time Apple was stated to have an 80% market share of digital music sales and a 90% share of sales of new music players, which he claimed allowed Apple to horizontally leverage its dominant positions in both markets to lock consumers into its complementary offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4151009.stm |title=Itunes user sues Apple over iPod |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=January 6, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2005, U.S. District Judge [[James Ware (judge)|James Ware]] approved ''[[Slattery v. Apple Computer Inc.]]'' to proceed with monopoly charges against Apple in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=/andrews/bt/cmp/20050922/20050922slattery.html |title=Antitrust Suit Against Apple Over iPod, iTunes to Proceed |first=Donna |last=Higgins |publisher=FindLaw Legal News |date=September 22, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2006, the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman [[BjÃ¸rn Erik Thon]] stated that Apple's [[iTunes Music Store]] violates Norwegian law. The contract conditions were vague and &quot;clearly unbalanced to disfavor the customer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iTunes violates Norwegian law |work=Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman |url=http://www.forbrukerombudet.no/index.gan?id=11032467 |date=June 7, 2006 |accessdate=June 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retroactive changes to the [[Digital Rights Management]] conditions and the incompatibility with other music players are the major points of concern.

{{As of|2007|05|29}}, tracks on the [[EMI]] label became available in a DRM-free format called [[iTunes Plus]]. These files are unprotected and are encoded in the AAC format at 256 [[kilobits per second]], twice the bitrate of standard tracks bought through the service. iTunes accounts can be set to display either standard or iTunes Plus formats for tracks where both formats exist.&lt;ref name=itunesplus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30itunesplus.html|title=Apple Launches iTunes Plus|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=May 30, 2007|date=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These files can be used with any player that supports the AAC file format and are not locked to Apple hardware. They can be converted to MP3 format if desired.

As of January 6, 2009, all 4 big music studios ([[Warner Bros.]], [[Sony BMG]], [[Universal Music Group|Universal]], and [[EMI]]) have signed up to remove the DRM from their tracks, at no extra cost. However, Apple charges consumers to have previously purchased DRM music restrictions removed.&lt;ref name=iTunesChanges2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/01/06Changes-Coming-to-the-iTunes-Store.html|title=Changes Coming to the iTunes Store|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=August 30, 2011|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of March, 2009, all music available on iTunes is DRM-free,&lt;ref name=iTunesChanges2009/&gt; however, digital downloads of [[television shows]], [[movies]], and [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] [[mobile app]]s through iTunes are still DRM-protected.

===Sony===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
Probably Sony's most famous example of lock-in was the [[Betamax]] [[VCR]] system. Since then, Sony has also used lock-in as a business tool in many other applications, and has a long history of engineering proprietary solutions to enforce lock-in. For many cases Sony licenses its technology to a limited number of other vendors, which creates a situation in which it controls a [[cartel]] that collectively has lock-in on the product. Sony is frequently at the heart of [[format war]]s, in which two or more such cartels battle to capture a market and win the lock.

Examples of Sony's formats include:
* Audio [[Elcaset]]
* Audio or computer data [[Minidisc]] and the related [[ATRAC3]] encoding system
* [[Super Audio CD]]
* [[Betamax]], [[8 mm video format|Video-8]], [[Hi8]], [[Digital8]], and [[MicroMV]] videotape formats
* [[PlayStation Portable]] [[Universal Media Disc]]
* [[Memory Stick]]s, used for a wide variety of applications in Sony products

{{As of|2006}}, [[Sony]] [[digital camera]]s and a number of other Sony products typically use [[Memory Stick]] cards that can be manufactured only by Sony, co-developer [[SanDisk]], and select licensees. This memory can be more expensive in some markets when compared to alternative memory types that exhibit similar characteristics such as data transfer speeds. This is an example of vendor lock-in, as existing users of Sony products are less likely to purchase a competitors product that uses a different storage medium due to the extra cost of acquiring a differing storage media. Similarly this can discourage consumers with non-Sony merchandise from purchasing Sony products.

In contrast, [[Blu-ray Disc]] was developed by the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]] where Sony is a member, but does not have a controlling position.

===Connector conspiracy===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
Manufacturers of computer hardware sometimes design unusual or proprietary [[electrical connector|connectors]].  The reasons for such designs vary; some are intended to quietly force customers into a vendor lock-in situation, or force upgrading customers to replace more components than would otherwise be necessary; others are the result of practical considerations such as cost, packaging, ease of design,  unusual or enhanced features; and still others result from an ignorance of standards, or even an absence of standards.  There may be little immediate financial incentive for a vendor to provide [[backward compatibility]] or interoperability.

The term '''Connector Conspiracy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/connector-conspiracy.html |title=connector conspiracy |work=[[Jargon File]] |date=December 29, 2003 |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was coined to describe this situation,   and implies the worst case scenario of a [[cabal]] of manufacturers [[collusion|colluding]] in secret to sell incompatible connectors.  Yet actual lock-in attempts can fail, if adapters can be purchased or manufactured to make the components compatible.

==Avoiding vendor lock-in for computer software==
In the 1980s and 1990s, public, royalty-free [[standardization|standard]]s were hailed as the best solution to vendor lock-in. But there is still a possibility that one software vendor uses &quot;[[embrace, extend and extinguish]]&quot; (EEE) tactics to achieves a dominant market share, which could render the standard obsolete. The history of [[SQL]] is an archetypal example.

Since the late 1990s, the use of [[free and open source software]] (FOSS) has arisen as a stronger solution. Because FOSS can be modified and distributed by anyone, the availability of functionality usually cannot tie a user to one distributor. The ineffectiveness of distributor lock-in means there's no incentive for FOSS developers to invent redundant new data formats if usable (royalty-free) standards exist.

In particular, [[copyleft]]ed FOSS is in some respects particularly resistant to the above mentioned &quot;EEE&quot; tactics since anyone distributing modified versions cannot legally prevent free or competing redistribution of the modifications and their [[source code]].  It is also, however, particularly well suited to those tactics in other respects, such as in competition with non-copyleft free and open source software.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reedlearning.co.uk/learn-about/1/ll-open-standards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar models==
===Razor and blade===
{{Main|Freebie marketing}}
The [[razor and blades business model]] involves products which regularly consume some material, part, or supply. In this system, a reusable or durable product is inexpensive, and the company draws its profits from the sale of consumable parts that the product uses. To ensure the original company alone receives the profits from the sales of consumable, they use a proprietary approach to exclude other companies. [[Inkjet]] computer printers are a common example of this model.

===Loyalty programs===
{{Main|Loyalty program}}
One way to create artificial lock-in for items without it is to create [[Loyalty card|loyalty]] schemes. Examples include frequent flier miles or points systems associated with credit card offers that can be used only with the original company, creating a perceived loss or cost when switching to a competitor.
