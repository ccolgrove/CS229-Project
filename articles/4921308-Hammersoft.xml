'''Whiplash''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Each Whiplash is a minor [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], with the first and latest appearing as prominent members of [[Iron Man]]'s [[rogues gallery]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Mark Scarlotti===
{{main|Blacklash}}
The first and most well-known Whiplash was '''Mark Scarlotti''', a recurring foe of [[Iron Man]] who debuted in ''Tales of Suspense'' #97 (Jan. 1968) and whose first storyline ended in ''Iron Man'' #1 (May 1968), the first issue of Iron Man's solo title. Scarlotti was an extremely gifted technician at Stark International's [[Cincinnati]] branch, but he never received recognition for his hard work or scientific acumen. Jealous of the global renown for Tony Stark's brilliance and the celebrity it granted him, Scarlotti decided to become a costumed supervillain. Adopting the moniker '''Whiplash''', he constructed a metallic, electrified whip capable of rending apart even the strongest of metals. As Whiplash, Scarlotti worked for the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] before becoming an underworld enforcer for shady industrialist [[Justin Hammer]].

In ''Iron Man'' #146 (May 1981), Scarlotti changed his costumed identity to '''[[Blacklash]]'''. By ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #8 (Nov. 1998), he had returned to his Whiplash alias, this time with whips of pure energy and a heavily [[BDSM]]-influenced costume; Scorlotti attributed the change to his grief over the death of his wife in ''Elektra'' vol. 1 #7, and subsequently having their son removed from his custody. Scarlotti was later killed in ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #28 (May 2000), slain by Iron Man's sentient, rogue armor.

===Leeann Foreman===
The second Whiplash was '''Leeann Foreman''', a professional criminal that was born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. She was a mutant with unrevealed abilities and used [[adamantium]] wires connected to her gloves as whips. She was part of Critical Mass's mutant [[Band of Baddies]]. The Baddies kidnapped a mutant girl and her father in order to coerce them to join their band. They forced the daughter to knock out [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], but they quickly recovered. The daughter then unleashed her powers, blew up the warehouse they were in, and defeated all of the Baddies. Whiplash disappeared after the daughter's telekinetic explosion enabled her to get free.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' #49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

She later joined the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]], and was hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to lure Spider-Man into a trap by threatening a United Nations ambassador. Spider-Man defeated the Femme Fatales and saved the ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #340&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatales then joined forces with the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Luis Alvarez|Tarantula]], but all of them were defeated by Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #343&lt;/ref&gt; The Femme Fatales later received an invitation to join [[Superia]] and her organization of female criminals, the [[Femizons]]. They accepted, and were among the superhuman females aboard Superia's cruise ship, where they battled [[Captain America]] and the [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. Whiplash also traveled to Superia's private island to be one of her new Femizons.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #389-390&lt;/ref&gt;

After the group disbanded, Whiplash teamed up with [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] and [[Killer Shrike]] in a plot to take over a retired aircraft carrier, the USS Intrepid. She and her allies were defeated by [[Heroes for Hire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; She was later seen in &quot;Bar With No Name&quot; and in a [[black market]] auction for the [[Venom (comics)|Venom Symbiote]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unnamed===
Two villains, a woman called Whiplash and a man called [[Blacklash]], appeared during the outset of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]]. Both were past associates of the current [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] ([[Andreas von Strucker]]) and frequenters of BDSM events before becoming supervillains. The duo was forcibly recruited into the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], and little has been seen of them since.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #104 (Sept. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=6701|title=Whiplash (2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Whiplash is '''Anton Vanko''' (sharing [[Anton Vanko|the same name]] as the original [[Crimson Dynamo]] although with no relation to him), a young scientist from a small Russian village by the name of Volstok. One day, the village is attacked by someone wearing a stolen suit of [[Iron Man's armor|Iron Man armor]], who murders a number of townspeople, including Vanko's father ('''Igor Vanko''') in an attempt to frame [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].

Using a specialized rifle, Vanko is able to shoot the impostor just before he flees, causing the chest plate on the armor to come off. Vanko becomes obsessed with exacting vengeance on Stark, still believing him to be the man who attacked his village, and decides to use the chest plate to fashion a suitable weapon to do so. Over the next six months, he reverse engineers a suit of body armor equipped with energy whips, and vows to kill Stark in order to avenge his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man vs Whiplash'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

After breaking into the prison where Stark is being held for his alleged crimes, Vanko kills several guards and attempts to track down and murder Stark and his confidant [[Pepper Potts]]. Stark fights off Vanko using a crude suit of Iron Man armor fashioned from parts of various machines around the prison, and forces him to flee. After Stark tracks down the criminal syndicate who framed him, Vanko arrives at their headquarters, intent on finishing off Iron Man once and for all. It is there that Vanko learns that Stark was indeed framed and that the syndicate was hired to destroy Volstok by secret international consortium funded by several governments including USA and Russia, notably Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], in order to wipe out an activist who was creating anti-Putin sentiments. Despite learning of Iron Man's innocence, Vanko makes one final attempt to kill him, claiming that even though he did not destroy the village, his technology did. After the building catches fire, both men are ultimately forced to run to safety, and Vanko then makes his escape. Following this, Stark is cleared of his alleged crimes, and helps rebuild Volstok. As this is happening, Vanko is seen in Moscow, approaching Saint Basil's Cathedral in the [[Red Square]], preparing to properly exact vengeance this time around.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man vs. Whiplash'' #2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiplash will appear in an upcoming ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' arc as a member of the new [[Masters of Evil]].&lt;ref&gt;http://marvel.com/news/story/17091/meet_the_masters_of_evil_whiplash&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The female Whiplash wears two gauntlets containing three spring-loaded retractable [[omnium]] steel whip-like cables on each of her arms. Each cable can extend a maximum length of about 25 feet and contains needle-sharp adamantium barbs on the tips. She wears a padded costume of synthetic stretch fabric laced with [[kevlar]], leather shoulder padding, and steel breastplates and mask, which provides her some protection from physical damage.

Whiplash possesses extensive hand-to-hand combat experience, and expertise at using whips. The unnamed Whiplash had no apparent superhuman abilities, and relied on an advanced energized whip.

The fourth Whiplash possesses a suit of armor equipped with two energy whips built into the wrists. The whips are shown to be powerful enough to slash through a metal staircase, as well as deflect a barrage of gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man vs Whiplash'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a skilled athlete and possesses a deep understanding of robotics, enough that he was able to fashion his suit from a destroyed piece of Stark technology.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The unnamed female Whiplash from the Thunderbolts appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode &quot;The Breakout&quot; Pt. 1. She is seen as an inmate of the Vault and is among the supervillains that escape during the mass-breakout.

===Film===
[[File:Whiplashfilm.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mickey Rourke]] as '''Whiplash''' in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.]]
* [[Mickey Rourke]] portrays '''Ivan Antonovich Vanko/Whiplash''' (an amalgamation of Iron Man villains Whiplash and the [[Crimson Dynamo]], and referred to as &quot;Whiplash&quot; in production materials, merchandise, and commercial tie-ins) in the 2010 [[feature film]] ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming, Marc Graser|title=Mickey Rourke set for 'Iron Man 2'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2009-03-11|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001114.html|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main antagonist of the film, Vanko is a disgruntled Russian physicist and [[Bratva]] member with a grudge against the Stark family. He is the son of [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], who defected to the United States to collaborate with Tony Stark's [[Howard Stark|father]] only to be fired by him, deported back to the [[Soviet Union]], and forced to live in exile. Constructing an arc reactor-powered suit of his own with the aid of his father's blueprints, Ivan Vanko attacks Tony Stark with two electrified whips during the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco]]. Stark defeats him using a portable Iron Man suit, and Vanko is sent to prison. Later, Vanko escapes from prison with the help of Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]]; hoping to upstage Stark and secure his own commercial enterprise, Hammer has Vanko build a battalion of military drones to present at the Stark Expo. At the presentation, Vanko gains remote control over both the drones and the [[War Machine]] armor worn by James Rhodes, directing them to attack Iron Man. Rhodes regains control of the War Machine suit, and he and Iron Man team up to defeat the drones and Vanko. In a last ditch effort to kill Stark, Vanko activates self-destruct mechanisms in the Hammer drones and in his own, heavily upgraded suit of armor. The bombs explode, apparently killing Vanko, leveling the Stark Expo, while Stark and Rhodes manage to escape.
