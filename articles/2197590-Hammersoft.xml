'''''You Could Have It So Much Better''''' is the second [[studio album]] by [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] [[indie rock|indie]] [[rock band]] [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] that was first released 3 October 2005 in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk/discog.php&lt;/ref&gt; Recorded in both the [[United States]] and their own studio in [[Glasgow]] with producer [[Rich Costey]], the album gave birth to the release of four UK Top 30 singles &quot;[[Do You Want To]]&quot; on 23 August 2005, &quot;[[The Fallen / L. Wells]]&quot;, &quot;[[Walk Away (Franz Ferdinand song)|Walk Away]]&quot; and &quot;[[Eleanor Put Your Boots On]].&quot; The album became the band's first UK #1 album and although [[Franz Ferdinand (album)|their debut album]] was relatively successful in the USA, going platinum and reaching #32, ''You Could Have It So Much Better'' managed to reach #8 and earned gold status in the States. The cover design is modeled on [[Alexander Rodchenko]]'s 1924 portrait of [[Lilya Brik]]. It was produced by Rick Costey and Franz Ferdinand.

==History==
Initially it was reported that the album would simply be eponymous like the debut album, 2004's ''[[Franz Ferdinand (album)|Franz Ferdinand]]''. Singer [[Alex Kapranos]] explained, &quot;The whole point is that the album doesnât have a title. We decided quite a while ago that we didnât want to give any of the albums titles, they were just going to be called 'Franz Ferdinand'.&quot;

He added, &quot;The albums are going to be identified by their colour schemes rather than a title. The contrast of different colours creates a different mood. We experimented with different combinations of colours and this one stuck. At one level they looked good together, and they capture the mood of this record quite well.&quot;

However, on 1 August it was revealed that the band had changed their minds and decided to give the album a name. At first they revealed that the title ''Outsiders'' was considered before the current title was decided upon.

As drummer [[Paul Thomson]] explained, &quot;I was thinking something similar, but that 'You Could Have It So Much Better' would have been even greater. We talked about how we liked that idea a lot and that it was a real shame that the album wasn't going to have a title. Then we started laughing when we realized that the album hadn't been manufactured yet and we could change it after all.&quot; The title was also initially reported as the lengthy ''You Could Have It So Much Better... With Franz Ferdinand''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franzferdinand.8k.com/v6/news.html Official fan-site news article]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;You're the Reason I'm Leaving&quot; is believed to be a dual-meaning track; it can be read as a typical relationship-centered song, but also as being a lighthearted political commentary on the rivalry between former UK [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and former UK Prime Minister (then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) [[Gordon Brown]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The song contains the lyric: ''I'd no idea that in four years I'd be hanging from a beam behind the door of number ten, singing &quot;fare thee well, I am leaving, yes I leave it all to you&quot;''. &quot;Number ten&quot; here refers to [[10 Downing Street]], the address of the UK Prime Minister. Four years is the typical length of a Parliament.

==Chart performance==
The album was the first chart topping album for both the band and their label, [[Domino Records]], in the UK. In the weeks after being released, the album fell first to 5, then 9, 15, and 24, before resting at #40 in the charts. On 25 December 2005, the album had risen to #37 in the charts. A week later, on 1 January 2006, the album had risen again to #24 in the official UK album charts, but fell two spots to #26 the following week before rising again to #23 on 15 January. A week later, the album had fallen again to #26. On 29 January the album had fallen a further six spots to #32. The album fell out of the top 40 altogether the week of 5 February.

Entering and peaking at #8, the album has sold 378,000 units in the [[United States]] as of October 2008, somewhat below the sales success of the band's 2004 debut, although it was certified gold.

The album received universal acclaim by music critics with a score 83 of 100 on [[Metacritic]]. [[Pitchfork Media]] gave the album an 8.3 out of 10 and complimented the band on returning with a &quot;big ridiculous stomper, a song whose hooks get so happily ballroom-glam you'd almost think they stole them from the Sweet or the Bay City Rollers-- the kind of song most bands wouldn't be able to pull off without telegraphing a whole lot of irony and embarrassment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/17937-you-could-have-it-so-much-better-with-franz-ferdinand Franz Ferdinand: You Could Have It So Much Better... With Franz Ferdinand: Pitchfork Record Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other positive responses are included here:

*[[Rolling Stone]] (No. 985, p.75) - 3.5 out of 5 stars - &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot; shows deeper roots in the first wave of white electric dance music: specifically the crunchy-guitar R&amp;B and arch-garage songwriting of 1965â1967 Kinks....&quot;
*[[Spin magazine|Spin]] (p.65) - Ranked #3 in Spin's &quot;40 Best Albums Of 2005&quot; - &quot;Their second disc builds on the kraut-disco of their debut, but frontman Alex Kapranos' dubious sensitivity makes 'You could have it' so much better than its predecessor.&quot;  (p.132) - &quot;Kapranos' voice is a marvelous wide-eyed sneer....[The album] sounds exactly like what you'd expect, with pumping disco beats and lookin'-sharp guitars on track after propulsive track.&quot; - Grade: B+
*[[Entertainment Weekly]] (No. 844, p.147) - &quot;...Shows Franz Ferdinand working harder and sounding bigger, befitting their stature as rock's saviors of the moment....&quot; - Grade B+
*[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] (p.58) - Ranked #11 in Mojo's &quot;The 50 Best Albums Of 2005&quot; - &quot;An imperious state-of-the-nation address delivered with ease.&quot;(p.94) - 4 stars out of 5 - &quot;Musically, the palette has grown without getting out of hand. Lead guitarist Nick McCarthy appears to have an inexhaustible well of singable guitar riffs: pungent, perfunctory, and hardly ever pretty...&quot;
*[[Vibe magazine|Vibe]] (p.210) - &quot;It overflows with danceable beats and catchy hooks&quot;.
