The '''Florida Gators men's basketball''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[basketball]].  The Gators compete in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  The Gators play their home games in the [[O'Connell Center]] on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Billy Donovan]].

The Gators have won two national championships&amp;mdash;the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] and [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] back-to-back, the first team since the [[1991â92 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team]] to accomplish this feat, and the first and only team to ever win two NCAA championships with the same starting line-up.

== Overview ==

The Florida Gators men's team annually plays a sixteen-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule against few annual opponents except for [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]].  Florida also often plays [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence]] during their non-conference schedule because of Billy Donovan's ties to the university.  Their conference schedule consists of a pair of home-and-home games against the other five SEC Eastern Division teams, plus one game against each of the six SEC Western Division teams, with home games alternating each season.  The Gators have seldom had significant rivals in basketball until recently, when their success found them competing against [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]].

== History ==

The modern University of Florida was created in 1905, when the [[Florida Legislature]] passed the [[Henry Holland Buckman|Buckman Act]], consolidating four predecessor institutions to form the &quot;[[History of the University of Florida|University of the State of Florida]].&quot;  Ten years later, the university sponsored the first Florida Gators men's [[varsity team|varsity]] basketball team that played its first season during the 1915&amp;ndash;1916 school year under head coach [[C. J. McCoy]].  That first Gators team compiled a 5&amp;ndash;1 record, but the following three seasons were canceled during and immediately after [[World War I]].  The team was re-started for the 1919&amp;ndash;20 season without a professional coach, though the Gators did have a new venue&amp;mdash;the newly-built [[Women's Gymnasium (Gainesville, Florida)|University Gymnasium]].  Head coach [[William G. Kline]], who also coached the [[Florida Gators football]] team, led the Gators basketball team from 1920 to 1922.

[[Image:Florida basketball 1921.jpeg|thumb|left|The 1920&amp;ndash;21 Florida Gators basketball team.]]

By the mid-1920s the team outgrew the University Gymnasium (now called the Women's Gymnasium), so the university built another gym to hold the crowds of the fast-growing student population.  Dubbed the &quot;New Gym,&quot; the Gators played there until 1949, when [[Florida Gymnasium]] was finished.

In December 1932, Florida joined the [[Southeastern Conference]] as one of its thirteen charter members.

The team moved from the Florida Gym to the [[O'Connell Center]] during the 1980&amp;ndash;81 season.

For most of the first half-century in the SEC, the Gators were not a factor.  They only finished higher than fourth twice from 1932&amp;ndash;33 to 1979&amp;ndash;80. This was partly because the Gators didn't have a full-time head coach for much of the first-half of the 20th century.  Instead, the post was filled by assistant football coaches or volunteers from the physical education department.  Things didn't really turn around until [[Norm Sloan]] arrived in Gainesville after a successful 14-year tenure at [[North Carolina State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]].  Sloan had previously been the program's first full-time head coach, from 1960 to 1966.  Under Sloan, the Gators made the [[National Invitation Tournament]] three years in a row from 1984 to 1986âthe first postseason appearances in school history.  In [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987]], [[Vernon Maxwell]] led the team to the school's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance, advancing all the way to the Sweet 16.  Sloan coached the team to the tournament again the following two years, winning the school's first-ever SEC regular season title in 1989.  in the 1988&amp;ndash;89 season.  After a drug scandal involving Maxwell and an NCAA investigation for various rules violations, Sloan resigned and the NCAA placed the program on two years' probation.  Former Tennessee coach [[Don DeVoe]] led the team as interim coach during the 1989&amp;ndash;90 season.

=== Lon Kruger era ===

[[Lon Kruger]] became the head coach before the 1990&amp;ndash;91 season.  Despite the probation he inherited, Kruger slowly brought the team to increased success and reached the [[1992 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] final four in his second year as coach.  In 1993&amp;ndash;94, the pieces fell into place for Florida to have their best season ever at that time.&lt;ref name=brockway5312009&gt;Kevin Brockway, &quot;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090531/ARTICLES/906019993/1136/sports  Top 25 Gator teams: #25 1993&amp;ndash;94 Men's basketball],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (May 31, 2009).  Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind [[Andrew DeClercq]] and Dametri Hill, the Gators went to their first Final Four following a dramatic victory over [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]] where [[Donyell Marshall]] missed two free throws with no time on the clock to force overtime, where the Gators eventually prevailed.&lt;ref name=brockway5312009/&gt;  They lost to [[1993-94 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] in the national semifinal, 70&amp;ndash;65.&lt;ref name=brockway5312009/&gt;  The next year, they returned to the NCAA tournament, but were eliminated in the first round.  Kruger's final season in 1995&amp;ndash;1996 resulted in a losing record, and he left to coach at [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]].

=== Billy Donovan era ===

Florida's Athletic Director, [[Jeremy Foley]], looking for a young coach with a proven track record, hired [[Billy Donovan]], then at [[Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball|Marshall]], as Kruger's replacement.  His recruiting prowess was evident early, bringing future [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]] with him from Marshall and having early recruiting classes with future NBA players [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]], [[Udonis Haslem]], and [[Matt Bonner]], among others.  The Gators made the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] every year from Donovan's third season with the team through the 2006&amp;ndash;2007 season, a nine-year streak that is the school record, and the sixth-longest NCAA Tournament streak. 

During the [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999&amp;ndash;2000 NCAA Tournament]], the upstart Gators beat such traditional powerhouses as [[1999-2000 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]], [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] (led by former coach [[Lon Kruger]]), and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] to advance to their first NCAA national championship game, before losing to heavily-favored [[1999-2000 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Brockway, &quot;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090604/ARTICLES/906049976/1136/sports  Top 25 Gator teams: #18 1999&amp;ndash;2000 Men's basketball],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun (June 7, 2009).  Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next few years the Gators went to the NCAA Tournament every year, but each year they lost in the first or second round. The Gators however repeated as SEC Champions during the 1999&amp;ndash;2000 and 2000&amp;ndash;01 seasons.

The [[2004-05 Florida Gators men's basketball team|2004&amp;ndash;05 team]] had the distinction of being the first to win an [[2005 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|SEC Tournament Championship]], when they beat rival [[2004&amp;ndash;05 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in the title game.

==== 2005&amp;ndash;06 NCAA national championship season ====

[[Image:Florida Gators 2006 championship team.jpg|right|thumb|The 2005&amp;ndash;06 Gator's basketball team with President [[George W. Bush]] at the [[White House]] following their national championship.]]

The [[2005&amp;ndash;06 Florida Gators men's basketball team|2005&amp;ndash;06 team]] began the [[2005&amp;ndash;06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|season]] unranked and went on a 17&amp;ndash;0 winning streak for the best start in school history, surprising many with a young (four sophomores and one junior) but selfless squad following the graduation of [[David Lee (basketball)|David Lee]] and the departures of [[Matt Walsh (basketball)|Matt Walsh]] and [[Anthony Roberson]] to the NBA.  The trio accounted for sixty percent of their offense in 2005. The team faded late in the regular season, losing its last 3 games in February and entering the postseason with a 24&amp;ndash;6 record, yet still managed to win its second consecutive [[2006 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|SEC Tournament Championship]].

The Gators entered the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] as a No. 3 seed with a 27&amp;ndash;6 record. They were ranked No. 10 by the AP and ESPN. They beat [[South Alabama Jaguars men's basketball|South Alabama]] and [[UW-Milwaukee Panthers men's basketball|Milwaukee]] to advance to the [[Minneapolis]] regional.  There, the Gators defeated the [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown Hoyas]] and upset the top-seeded [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova Wildcats]] 75&amp;ndash;62 to avenge their loss in the previous year's tournament and move on to their second [[Final Four]] under Donovan.

Florida defeated the upstart [[2005-06 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team|George Mason Patriots]] 73&amp;ndash;58 in the national semifinals in [[RCA Dome|Indianapolis]].  On April 3, 2006, the Gators defeated the [[2005-06 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA Bruins]] 73&amp;ndash;57 in the national final to win the school's first men's basketball NCAA Championship.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Brockway, &quot;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090621/ARTICLES/906219924/1136/sports  Top 25 Gator teams: #4 2005&amp;ndash;06 Men's basketball],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (June 21, 2009).  Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Association]] then purchased the floor used in Indianapolis for the Final Four, and installed it in the [[O'Connell Center]].

The Gators returned all five starters from their championship team to begin the [[2006&amp;ndash;07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006&amp;ndash;07]] basketball season ranked as the preseason No. 1 in both major media polls, a first for the university.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Dooley, &quot;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090625/ARTICLES/906249905/1136/sports  Top 25 Gator teams: #1 2006&amp;ndash;07 Men's basketball],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (June 25, 2009).  Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[2006-07 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Gators]] locked up the SEC regular season Championship relatively early in the 2006&amp;ndash;07 season and were in possession of a 24&amp;ndash;2 record before going on a late-February 1&amp;ndash;3 skid that mirrored their 0&amp;ndash;3 run a year earlier.  For the second season in a row, the losses in February would be their last.  Florida closed out [[2006&amp;ndash;07 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] on Senior Night to end the regular season 26&amp;ndash;5, and won their third straight [[2007 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|SEC Tournament Championship]] with relative ease, beating {{cbb link|year=2006-07|sex=men|team=Georgia Bulldogs|school=University of Georgia|title=Georgia}}, {{cbb link|year=2006-07|sex=men|team=Ole Miss Rebels|school=University of Mississippi|title=Ole Miss}}, and {{cbb link|year=2006-07|sex=men|team=Arkansas Razorbacks|school=University of Arkansas|title=Arkansas}} 77&amp;ndash;56.

Florida entered the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] as the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament, and they advanced to the Final Four after wins in the regional against No. 5 seed Butler and No. 3 seed [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]].  In a rematch of the 2006 title game, the Gators again eliminated the [[2006&amp;ndash;07 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA Bruins]] in the national semifinal.  Florida defeated the [[2006&amp;ndash;07 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State Buckeyes]] 84&amp;ndash;75, in a rematch of a game they won 86&amp;ndash;60 three months earlier, to become the first team since the 1991&amp;ndash;92 Duke Blue Devils to win back-to-back national championships and the first college team ever to repeat as national champions with the same starting line-up.

==== 2007&amp;ndash;present ====

[[Billy Donovan]] is currently the head coach of the Gators.  Having recently completed his 11th season as coach, agreed to coach for the NBA's [[Orlando Magic]] on May 31, 2007.  It was revealed on June 3, however, that Donovan had done an about-face and asked to be freed from his contract with the Magic to return to Florida.  He was soon thereafter released from his contract and reintroduced as the Gators coach on June 7. 

The Gators failed to make the NCAA Tournament in 2008 and 2009.  In 2008, the Gators were eliminated by [[UMass Minutemen basketball|UMass]] in a semi-final game of the [[2008 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].  In 2009, the Gators were eliminated by [[2008&amp;ndash;09 Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team|Penn State]] in a quarter-final game of the [[2009 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]]. In 2010, the Gators were eliminated in the first round of the NCAA tournament by [[2009â10 BYU Cougars men's basketball team|BYU]] in double overtime.  In the 2011 NCAA Tournament, the [[2010&amp;ndash;11 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Gators]] were the No. 2 seed in the Southeast region.  In the Second Round of the Tournament, Florida beat [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos|UC Santa Barbara]].  In the third round, the Gators defeated the [[2010&amp;ndash;11 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA Bruins]] to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.  On March 24, 2011, the Gators defeated [[2010&amp;ndash;11 BYU Cougars men's basketball team|BYU]] 83&amp;ndash;74 in overtime to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2007.  Their tournament run ended there against [[2010&amp;ndash;11 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|Butler]].
