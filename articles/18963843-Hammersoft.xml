'''Indian Americans''' are [[United States|Americans]] whose ancestral roots lie in [[India]]. The [[U.S. Census Bureau]] popularized the term '''Asian Indian''' to avoid confusion with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] who are commonly referred to as [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]].

==History==
===The term: Indian===

In North America the term ''Indian'' has an ambiguous meaning. Historically and currently, ''Indian'' has been commonly used to indicate ''Native American''. If a more specific term was or is needed, ''American Indian'' and ''East Indian'' were and are commonly used. ''American Indian'' is still the most common term, although ''Native American'' can be used to refer to the Indigenous peoples of North America. ''East Indian'' is still in common use. Currently ''[[South Asia]]n'' is often used instead of ''East Indian''. People of Indian origin sometimes use the term ''[[Desi]]'' to refer to the [[diaspora|diasporic]] [[subculture]] of South Asians, particularly Indians. Indian Americans are categorized as Asian Indian (and more broadly, [[Asian American]]) by the [United States Census Bureau]

===Arrival in the U.S.===
It was after the [[LuceâCeller Act of 1946]], that Indian Americans were granted naturalization rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/rootsinthesand/a_lucecellar.html&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Indian Americans came to the U.S. via [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian communities in other countries]] such as the United Kingdom and Canada, in both of which  2% of the population is of Indian origin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/foer2006/FoER_Main.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mauritius]], nations of Southeast Asia such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], South Africa, [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]], [[Fiji]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]], and [[Jamaica]]. Indian Americans are mostly Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, and Zoroastrian and are among the most highly educated of American demographics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asian-nation.org/demographics.shtml &quot;Asian American History, Demographics, &amp; Issues&quot;]. Asian-Nation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 U.S. Census,&lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&amp;prodType=table&lt;/ref&gt; the Asian Indian population in the United States grew from almost 1,678,765 in 2000 to 2,843,391 in 2010, a growth rate of 69.37%, the highest for any Asian American community, and among the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States. Indians are a large ethnic group of Asian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/2011-05-12-asian-indian-population-Census_n.htm | work=USA Today | title=Census shows growth among Asian Indians | date=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voiceofasiaonline.com/(A(CgXW2R5OzAEkAAAANzRkZDE5M2ItMmYzMC00YjI1LWE5Y2MtYWYyODk1MTE1MWIwGblNoq9V0WEB79YFyHqmpsxcE1A1)S(zs3q4w55basplt55ivfoh245))/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=372&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://divanee.com/2011/05/19/census-asian-indian-population-explodes-across-u-s/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://losangeles.pointslocal.com/news/2011/05/13/losangeles/320413/indian-american-population-is-fastest-growing-minority-group&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=June 2011}}

[[File:India Square JC jeh.JPG|thumb|right|[[India Square]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], is one of at least 20 Indian American [[ethnic enclave|enclaves]] characterized as a [[Little India (location)|Little India]] which have emerged within the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]].]]
The [[New York metropolitan area]], consisting of [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], and adjacent areas within [[New York]], as well as nearby areas within the states of [[New Jersey]] (extending to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]), [[Connecticut]] (extending to [[Bridgeport]]), and including [[Pike County, Pennsylvania]], is home to approximately 557,000 Indian Americans as of the 2010 Census, comprising by far the largest Indian American population of any metropolitan area in the United States. New York City itself contains the highest Indian American population of any city proper, at approximately 195,000. As of June 2011, Indian airline carriers [[Air India]] and [[Jet Airways]] as well as United States airline carrier [[Continental Airlines]] were all offering flights from the New York City Metropolitan Area to and from India. At least twenty Indian American enclaves characterized as a [[Little India (location)|Little India]] have emerged in the New York City Metropolitan Area.

Other metropolitan areas with large Indian American populations include [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta]], [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|BaltimoreâWashington]], [[Greater Boston|Boston]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas â Ft. Worth]], [[Metro Detroit|Detroit]], [[Greater Houston|Houston]], [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles]], [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia]], and [[San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco â San Jose â Oakland]].

In the year 2006, of the total 1,266,264 legal immigrants to the United States, 58,072 were from India. Immigration from India is currently at its highest level in history. Between 2000 and 2006, 421,006 Indian immigrants were admitted to the U.S., up from 352,278 during the 1990â1999 period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/yearbook/2006/table02.xls Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: Fiscal Years 1820 to 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2000 U.S. census, the overall growth rate for Indians from 1990 to 2000 was 105.87&amp;nbsp;percent. The average growth rate for the whole of USA was only 7.6&amp;nbsp;percent.

Indians comprise 16.4 percent of the Asian-American community. They are the third largest in the Asian American population. In 2000, of all the foreign born population in U.S., Indians were 1.007&amp;nbsp;million. From 2000 onwards the growth rate and the per cent rate of Indians amongst all the immigrants has increased by over 100 percent. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 1990 and 2000, the Indian population in the U.S. grew 130% â 10 times the national average of 13%.

Indians, along with other Asians, have one of the highest educational levels of all ethnic groups in the U.S. Almost 67% of all Indians have a bachelor's or high degree (compared to 28% nationally and 44% average for all Asian American groups). Almost 40% of all Indians in the United States have a masterâs, doctorate or other professional degree, which is five times the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;The Indian American Centre for Political Awareness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html CIA - The World Factbook - India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Friedman]], in his recent book, ''[[The World is Flat]]'', explains this trend in terms of [[brain drain]], whereby the best and brightest elements in India emigrate to the U.S. in order to seek better financial opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/266/ MIT World Â» : The World is Flat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities of [[Hindu]]s, [[Sikhs]], [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhists]], [[Muslims]], [[Christianity in India|Christians]], [[Parsis]], and [[Jews]] from India have established their religions in the [[United States]].
The first religious centre of an Indian religion to be established in the US was a Sikh [[Gurudwara]] in [[Stockton, California]] in 1912. Today there are many Sikh [[Gurudwara]]s, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain [[Temple]]s in all the 50&amp;nbsp;states. As of 2008, the American [[Hindu]] population was around 2.2 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hafsite.org/sites/default/files/HT_Census_USA_Jan08.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu]]s are the majority of Indian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_dem.html Composite U.S. Demographics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingaboutreligion.org/Backdrop&amp;Context/hinduism.htm Hinduism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many sects such as [[ISKCON]], [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]], [[Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha|BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha]], [[Chinmaya Mission]], and [[Swadhyay|Swadhyay Pariwar]] are well-established in the U.S. The Hindu Americans have formed the [[Hindu American Foundation]] which is represents [[Hinduism in the United States|American Hindus]] and aims to educate people about [[Hinduism]].

In addition, [[A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] initiated a popular [[ISKCON]] also known as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement while preaching [[Bhakti yoga]].

===Ethnicity===
Like the terms &quot;Asian American&quot; or &quot;South Asian American&quot;, the term &quot;Indian American&quot; is also an umbrella label applying to a variety of views, values, lifestyles, and appearances. Although Asian-Indian Americans retain a high ethnic identity, they are known to assimilate into American culture while at the same time keeping the culture of their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Mogelonsky, &quot;Asian-Indian Americans,&quot; pp. 32â38&lt;/ref&gt;  They may assimilate more easily than many other immigrant groups because they have fewer language barriers (English is widely spoken in India among professional classes), more educational credentials (Indian immigrants are disproportionately well-educated), and come from a democratic society. Additionally, Indian culture, like many other Asian cultures, puts emphasis upon achievement and personal responsibility of the individual as a reflection upon the family and community.

In countries such as the United States, Canada, and until more recently, Britain, there has been a large influx of Indian immigrants, beginning in the late 1960s. As a result of assimilation, mixed [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] and Indian backgrounds are becoming more prevalent. In the 2001 [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureauâs]] publication of the 56,497,000 [[married]] couples, it shows that Indian males married almost twice as much with White females (7.1%) than Indian females marrying with White males (3.7%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://multiracial.com/site/content/view/388/27/#census The Multiracial Activist - www.multiracial.com - The Reality of Interracial Marriages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is also home to associations of Indians united by ethno-linguistic affiliation. The big organizations include Cultural Association of Bengal and their annually sponsored event the [[North American Bengali Conference]], [[AKKA]] (Association of Kannada Kootas of America), Kannada Sangha and Kannada Koota, Telugu Association of North America (TANA), [[Orissa Society of the Americas]], Brihan Maharashtra Mandals of North America (BMM), [[Federation of Tamil Sangams of North America]], [[Gujarati Samaj]], Prabashi Federation of [[Kerala]], Associations of North America (FOKANA), Punjabi American Heritage Society and Punjabi-American Cultural Association. These associations generally put on cultural programs, plays, and concerts during the major Hindu festivals ([[Diwali]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Padva]], [[Pongal]], [[Sankranti]], [[Ugadi]], [[Baisakh]], [[Onam]], [[Vishu]]) and other religious (e.g., Christian) and cultural events such as [[Christmas]] and [[New Years]].

=== Classification===
{{Main|Racial classification of Indian Americans}}
{{Original research|section|date=August 2010}}

According to the current parameters defining the [[Race (United States Census)|official U.S. racial categories]] employed by the [[United States Census Bureau]], [[Office of Management and Budget]] and other U.S. government agencies, [[United States|American]] [[citizen]]s or [[resident alien]]s who marked &quot;''Asian-Indian''&quot; as their ancestry or wrote in a term that automatically gets classified as an &quot;''Asian-Indian''&quot; gets classified as part of the Asian race on the 2000 US Census. As with other modern official U.S. government racial categories, the term &quot;Asian&quot;&lt;!--the US Census does not use the term &quot;Asian American&quot;. It uses the term &quot;Asian&quot;.--&gt; is in itself a broad and [[heterogeneous]] classification, encompassing all peoples with origins in the original peoples of the [[Far East]], [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. For further discussion on the term [[Asian American]], please see that article.

In previous decades, Indian Americans were also variously classified as [[White American]], the &quot;Hindu race&quot;, and Other.&lt;ref&gt;Assisi, Frank. Desparades. Are Desis White? 2006. &lt;http://www.despardes.com/articles/feb06/20060212-are-desis-white.asp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, where individual Indian Americans do not racially self-identify, and instead report [[Muslim]] (or a sect of Islam such as [[Shi'ite]] or [[Sunni]]), [[Jewish]], and [[Zoroastrian]] as their &quot;race&quot; in the &quot;Some other race&quot; section without noting their country of origin, they are automatically tallied as white.&lt;ref&gt;Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results. Race and Nationality Descriptions from the 2000 US Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics. 2007. May 21, 2007. [http://www.seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2007/SPCSM_2007_AppendixD.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in the counting of persons such as [[Indian Muslims]], [[Indian Jews]], and [[Parsi people|Indian Zoroastrians]] as white, if they solely report their religious heritage without their national origin.

==Current social issues==
===Discrimination===

{{See also|Stereotypes of South Asians}}

Explicit discrimination is not widespread, but has been known to happen in certain instances. In the 1980s, a gang known as the [[Dotbusters]] specifically targeted Indian Americans in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with violence and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/nyregion/in-jersey-city-indians-protest-violence.html?pagewanted=all In Jersey City, Indians Protest Violence]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[racial discrimination]], as well as [[stereotyping]] and [[scapegoating]] of Indian Americans have been conducted in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dhillon&quot;&gt;[http://www.kavitachhibber.com/main/main.jsp?id=legal-Jan2006 Discrimination at Work] by [[Harmeet Dhillon]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, racial discrimination of Indian Americans in the workplace has been correlated with [[Indophobia]] due to the rise in [[outsourcing]]/[[offshoring]] paranoia, whereby Indian Americans are blamed for US companies offshoring [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] labor to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~ap2231/ET/et80_July27-05.htm Indophobia: Facts versus Fiction], Arvind Panagariya, [[Columbia University]] archives of ''[[The Economic Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yee&quot;&gt;[http://modelminority.com/article705.html Worries about technical-job losses, discrimination], by [[Amy Yee]],The Financial Times Ltd, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the offices of the Congressional Caucus on India, many Indian Americans are severely concerned of a backlash, though nothing serious has taken place yet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yee&quot;/&gt; Due to various socio-cultural reasons, implicit racial discrimination against Indian Americans largely go unreported by the Indian American community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dhillon&quot;/&gt;

Numerous cases of religious stereotyping of [[Hinduism in the United States|American Hindus]] (mainly of Indian origin) have also been documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/reference/cshm/ohrc066.html Center for the study of history and memory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], there have been scattered incidents of Indian Americans becoming mistaken targets for [[hate crimes]]. In one example, a [[Sikh]], [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], was murdered at a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] gas station by a [[white supremacist]]. This happened after September 11, and the murderer claimed that his [[turban]] made him think that the victim was a Middle Eastern American. In another example, a pizza deliverer was mugged and beaten in [[Massachusetts]] for &quot;being Muslim&quot; though the victim pleaded with the assailants that he was in fact Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/25/national/main530749.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Hindu Beaten Because He's Muslim | date=2002-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] joked at a fundraising event with South Asians for [[Nancy Farmer]] that [[Mahatma Gandhi]] owned a gas station in downtown [[St. Louis]], fueling the stereotype that gas stations are owned by Indians and other South Asians. She clarified in the speech later that she was just joking, but still received some criticism for the statement later on for which she apologized again. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3890946/ns/us_news-life/t/clinton-regrets-gandhi-joke/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2006, the [[Hindu Mandir of Minnesota]] was vandalized allegedly on the basis of [[religious discrimination]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. The vandals damaged temple property leading to $200,000 worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcco.com/local/local_story_103095026.html wcco.com - 600 Attend Forum About Hindu Temple Vandalism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=123097 New Header&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/iep/sunday/story/2081.html indianexpress.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2006, Senator [[George Allen (politician)|George Allen]] allegedly referred to an opponent's political staffer of Indian ancestry as  &quot;[[macaca (slur)|macaca]]&quot; and commenting, &quot;Welcome to America.&quot;  Some members of the Indian American community saw Allen's comments, and the backlash that may have contributed to Allen [[Controversies of the United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006#Allen's Macaca controversy|losing his re-election bid]], as demonstrative of the power of [[YouTube]] in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;

===Immigration===

Indians are among the largest ethnic groups legally immigrating to the United States. The immigration of Indian Americans has taken place in several waves since the first Indian American came to the United States in the 1700s. A major wave of immigration to California from the region of Punjab took place in the first decade of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. Another significant wave followed in the 1950s which mainly included students and professionals. The elimination of immigration quotas in 1965 spurred successively larger waves of immigrants in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With the technology boom of the 1990s, the largest influx of Indians arrived between 1995 and 2000. This latter group has also caused surge in the application for various immigration benefits including applications for green card. This has resulted in long waiting periods for people born in India from receiving these benefits.

===Media===
{{Main|List of Indian American media}}

==Politics==

Several groups have tried to create a unified or dominant voice for the Indian American community in political affairs, including US India PAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usinpac.com USINPAC - US India Political Action Committee | Indian American Community | www.usinpac.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are also industry-wide Indian American groupings including the Asian American Hotel Owners Association and the Association of American Physicians of Indian Origin. A majority of Indian Americans tend to identify as moderates and have voted for [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] in recent elections. Polls before the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]] showed Indian Americans favoring Democratic candidate [[John Kerry]] over Republican [[George W. Bush]] by a 53% to 14% margin, with 30% undecided at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FI16Aa01.html Asia Times - Asia's most trusted news source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican party has tried to target this community,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=express&amp;s=kurlantzick052604 ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several prominent conservative activists are of Indian origin.

In 2007, Republican Congressman [[Bobby Jindal]] became the first United States Governor of Indian descent when he was elected [[Governor of Louisiana]] and is cited as a leading GOP presidential contender in 2012 or 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071021/ap_po/louisiana_governor ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikki Haley]] is the [[governor of South Carolina]].
