The fighting was sparked by a government move to shut down [[Hezbollah]]'s telecommunication network and remove [[Beirut Airport]]'s security chief Wafic Shkeir over alleged ties to Hezbollah. Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] said the government's decision to declare the group's military telecommunications network illegal was a &quot;declaration of war&quot; on the organization, and demanded that the government revoke it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hezbollah takes over west Beirut |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7391600.stm |publisher=''[[BBC news]]''|accessdate=2008-05-10 | date=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lebanon tensions rise in clash with Hezbollah |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981937.html |publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezbollah-led opposition fighters seized control of several [[West Beirut]] neighborhoods from [[Future Movement]] militiamen loyal to the government, in street battles that left 11 dead and 30 wounded.

==Background==
{{main|2006â2008 Lebanese political protests|2005-2007 Lebanon bombings}}
On December 1, 2006, a series of protests and [[sit-in]]s began in [[Lebanon]], led by groups that opposed the government of Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]]. The opposition group was made up of pro-Syrian [[Hezbollah]] and [[Amal Movement|Amal]]. A number of smaller parties were also involved, including the [[Marada Movement]], the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] and the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Half of Lebanon rallies to demand sweeping changes|author=Cecil, Bill|url=http://www.workers.org/2006/world/lebanon-1221/|publisher=''workers.org''|accessdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the government are part of the [[March 14 Alliance]], a coalition of anti-Syrian political parties and former militias that include the [[Progressive Socialist Party]], the [[Lebanese Forces]] and the [[Future Movement]]. The two groups are also divided along religious lines, the majority of [[Sunni]]s supporting the government and the [[Shi'a]] supporting the opposition group. [[Druze]] aligned with [[Walid Jumblatt]] support the government, while those allied to [[Talal Arslan]] have backed the opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jazeera&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hezbollah in control of west Beirut|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/3D7DD5AC-6C8C-44EE-A39D-EACB9A8FDD8B.htm|publisher=''[[Al Jazeera]]''|accessdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian]] community is divided as well, with [[Michel Aoun]] claiming to have 70% of the Christian community's support, based on the results of 2005 parliamentary elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian leader says Lebanese opposition ready for power|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/dec/13/syria.lebanon|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=2008-05-13 | location=London | date=2006-12-13 | first=Clancy | last=Chassay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese Christians split over protests|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6300739.stm|publisher=''[[BBC]]''|accessdate=2008-05-10 | date=2007-01-26 | first=Martin | last=Patience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon by-election highlights Christian disunity|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL06198754|publisher=''[[Reuters]]''|accessdate=2008-05-10 | date=2007-08-06|first=Nadim|last=Ladki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahram1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Aoun's hour

The standoff between the March 14 government and the March 8 opposition resulted in a year-long deadlock over the election of a new President to succeed [[Emile Lahoud]] whose term had expired.

[[Seymour Hersh]] believed that the U.S was working to weaken and disarm Hezbollah with the help of [[Saudi Arabia]], who was attempting to strengthen Sunni groups as a counterweight to the Shi'a Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Hersh_Bush_arranged_support_for_militants_0522.html|title=

== May 2008 controversies and protests==
{{History of Lebanon}}
In May 2008 the tensions between the government and the opposition escalated when the government announced a series of security decisions. Heads of the government accused Hezbollah of preparing for a terrorist attack, which was dismissed by Hezbollah as scaremongering.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Beirut&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7385733.stm |title= Beirut to axe Hezbollah telecoms |publisher=''[[BBC news]]''|accessdate=2008-05-10 | date=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Airport&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7382289.stm |title= Hezbollah in airport spying row |publisher=''[[BBC news]]''|author=[[Jim Muir]] |accessdate=2008-05-10 | date=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heavily Damaged Car Beirut Lebanon Unrest 5-9-08.jpg|thumb|left|A [[car]] heavily damaged during the unrest in Lebanon on May 9.]]
On May 3, leaders of the government accused Hezbollah of setting up a hidden, remote-controlled camera in a container park overlooking the main runway of Beirut's international airport. The accusation is that the Shia movement, which controls the suburbs where the airport is located, was spying on air traffic in preparation for a possible attack, perhaps aimed at assassinating one of the prominent pro-government figures who fly in and out of the facility. Hezbollah dismissed the accusations as scaremongering, saying that those who leveled them were simply parroting a US campaign against it and other groups which are resisting [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Airport&quot;/&gt;

On May 6, 2008 the government attempted to disable [[Hezbollah]]'s communications network. Hezbollah operates an extensive fixed-line telecommunications network, in parallel to the government owned one, covering its strongholds of south and east Lebanon, and the southern suburbs of Beirut.  Hezbollah claimed that the telecommunication network was a key element in the [[2006 Lebanon War]], which according to Hezbollah was a victory that shocked the Israeli military. The government regarded the network as a breach on its sovereignty. In addition, the network was regarded by the government as an infringement on public funds since it competes with its own at the same time using its own infrastructure.
Hezbollah declared that it regards the network as an integral part of its defensive measures against Israel. The government also ordered the commander of security at [[Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport|Beirut international airport]], Brig Gen Wafiq Shuqeir, to return to the Army Command who had been suspected of acting on instructions from Hezbollah rather than his employer. Brig Gen Shuqeir hushed up the discovery of a secret surveillance camera allegedly set up by Hezbollah in a container overlooking the main runway, to monitor the movement of aircraft and VIPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Beirut&quot;/&gt;

On May 7, 2008 a labor strike which was planned before the month of May turned into violence when pro-government and opposition gunmen started their shootings, leading to clashes among the two groups in Beirut. The next day, Hezbollah's leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] stated on television that the telecommunications network was essential in the militant group's resistance against Israel. Nasrallah further said that the government was declaring war by threatening to shut down the groupâs private communications network and persecuting those controlling it.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTIntensify&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/world/middleeast/09lebanon.html?ex=1367985600&amp;en=27fbc7f2741a0ae2&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=Shiite-Sunni Clashes Intensify in Beirut|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|author=Nada Bakri|accessdate=2008-05-09 | date=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests===

On May 7, 2008, a [[work strike]] called for by the country's union federation to demand higher wages and decry high prices was used as a pretext by the opposition to launch its attack. The opposition threw their weight behind the strike which paralyzed large parts of Lebanon's capital [[Beirut]]. The clashes were first reported when government and opposition supporters in a pro-Government sector of Beirut exchanged insults and began throwing stones at each other after the Hezbollah men insisted on blocking the roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEBANON: High prices, low wages feed violent political stand-off|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=78100|publisher=''[[IRIN]]''|accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses said security forces intervened and gunshots were heard, apparently troops firing in the air to disperse the crowds.

Around the city, pro-Hezbollah protesters carrying machine guns and weapons, blocked roads with burning tires. The road toward [[Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport|Beirut international airport]] was blocked and cut off from the rest of the city, and the Beirut Port was occupied as a main reminder of 1975-90 civil war. By the end of this day, the Hezbollah militia had completely conquered the streets of West-Beirut, enforced an armed blockade on houses of Majority leaders Saad Hariri and Walid Jumblatt, and declared that it will continue with its actions until the Government backs down.

=== May 8 - May 9: Takeover of Beirut ===
[[File:Lebanese Tank Beirut Lebanon Unrest 5-9-08.jpg|thumb|left|A Lebanese [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]] in Beirut, on May 9, during the unrest]]
On May 8, 2008, minutes after Nasrallah's comments referring to pro-government actions as &quot;a declaration of open war&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_20080508&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/05/08/lebanon.hezbollah/index.html|title=Gunbattles break out in Beirut|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=''[[CNN]]'' | date=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; heavy street battles began. Fighting began along [[Corniche Mazraa]], an avenue separating Shiite and Sunni areas, spreading to the western, southern and eastern parts of [[Beirut]] where Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods overlapped. Combat was heard near the office of Lebanon's Sunni religious leader - an ally of the government - and near the official residence of the opposition-aligned parliament speaker. [[Machine gun]]s and [[rocket propelled grenade]]s were used by both sides. Opposition militants overran and burnt-down three pro-government offices. More barricades were set up, closing major highways. A ''[[CNN]]'' correspondent, pinned down with a Lebanese army unit during an intense gun battle, reported that government forces had not reacted to the violence. The army decided not to intervene in the clashes for fear of a breakup of the army along sectarian lines, which happened during the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_20080508&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Fighters in Beirut.jpg|thumb|right|Armed fighters near the [[Crowne Plaza Hotel (Lebanon)|Crowne Plaza]] in Beirut on May 9]]
Fighting from the previous day lasted throughout the night and only stopped for a short time a little bit after dawn on May 9, 2008. However, the fighting quickly resumed after the brief lull.

Late in the afternoon, the few Government supporters who had shown some resistance in Beirut had surrendered their arms to the Hezbollah-led opposition. The opposition moved in and took over their abandoned positions in west Beirut, virtually taking over more than half of the capital. About 100 opposition militants in camouflage uniforms marched down [[Hamra Street]]. All the media outlets related to the pro-Government Future Movement ([[Future Television]], [[Future News]], [[Al Mustaqbal Newspaper]], and [[Radio Orient]]) were occupied by opposition fighters and forced to close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hezbollah gunmen seize control of Beirut neighborhoods

The armed occupation of Beirut by pro-Hezbollah militia-men continued until the end of the crisis with almost no reaction from the Army nor Government loyalists.

Later that evening sporadic clashes erupted in [[Sidon]], where two civilians were killed; and in Bar Elias in the [[Bekaa Valley]] where a woman was killed. Also, eight people were killed near the town of [[Aley]] in clashes between government supporters and opponents. Seven people who were Hezbollah supporters were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2BB82CA0-4895-4454-8E29-7072B103E06C.htm |publisher=''[[Al Jazeera]]'' |title=Beirut streets 'calm' after clashes |accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanon death toll up following northern clash|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3541431,00.html|publisher=''[[Ynet]]''|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2008, a funeral procession was attacked by a shop-owner affiliated with the [[Amal Movement]], whose shop was previously burned down by Sunni militants, leaving six people dead. An [[Associated Press]] photographer who witnessed the shooting said the attack came as a procession of 200 people headed toward a nearby cemetery to bury a 24-year-old pro-government supporter killed in previous fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080510-six-killed-during-beirut-funeral-medics|title=Six killed during Beirut funeral: medics|publisher=[[France 24]]|accessdate=2008-05-10|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080510203646/http://www.france24.com/en/20080510-six-killed-during-beirut-funeral-medics |archivedate = May 10, 2008|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt; At least 14 people were killed in the town of [[Halba]], in the [[Akkar]] region of north Lebanon, as about 100 pro-Future Movement gunmen attacked an office of the [[SSNP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/aussies-death-sparks-lebanon-alert/2008/05/12/1210444296256.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Aussie's death sparks Lebanon alert | date=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 of the dead were SSNP members, three were government loyalists and one was an [[Australian]] citizen of Lebanese descent on vacation in Lebanon, who was trying to get information at the SSNP offices about evacuating from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/man-killed-in-lebanon-was-on-holiday/2008/05/12/1210444292099.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Andra | last=Jackson | title=Melbourne man killed in Lebanon 'was on holiday' | date=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hawke&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian killed in Lebanon: DFAT|url=http://hawkesbury.yourguide.com.au/news/national/national/general/australian-killed-in-lebanon-dfat/768453.aspx|publisher=''The Hawkesbury Gazette''|accessdate=2008-05-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802162738/http://hawkesbury.yourguide.com.au/news/national/national/general/australian-killed-in-lebanon-dfat/768453.aspx  |archivedate = 2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Day 5: Lebanese dare to hope worst is over|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=91930|publisher=''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)]]''|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian father of four, Fadi Sheikh, reportedly had his hands and feet cut off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/melbourne-dad-mutilated-in-lebanon/story-e6frf7kx-1111116330346 Melbourne dad mutilated in Lebanon &amp;#124; Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/aussies-body-is-mutilated-by-mob/story-e6frg6of-1111116321514 Australian Fahdi Sheikh's body mutilated by Beirut mob &amp;#124; The Australian]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, Beirut was quiet, after control of areas seized by the opposition was handed to the Lebanese army. Many roads in the capital remained blocked, including the airport road, as the opposition continued a campaign of civil disobedience.

On May 9, heavy fighting broke out in [[Mount Lebanon]] between pro-government [[Progressive Socialist Party]] members and opposition forces - mainly [[Lebanese Democratic Party]], SSNP and [[Tawhid Party]]. The clashes started in [[Aytat]], near [[Kayfoun]] and soon expanded to cover many spots in [[Mount Lebanon]] including [[Baysur]], [[Shuweifat]] and Aley. Most of the fighting was concentrated on Hill 888.

It started when four Druze members of the [[Aley]] municipal police were kidnapped by Hezbollah.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20080512134939559|title=Lebanon's Fighting Spreads to Druze Heartland|author=Kandy Ringer|accessdate=2008-12-24|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514030635/http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20080512134939559 |archivedate = May 14, 2008|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the news of the kidnapping spread, the Mayor of Aley assembled a group of PSP fighters and went up to Hill 888. As they reached the hill they were attacked by Hezbollah gunmen who wounded few of the PSP and municipality members. PSP members retaliated killing 3 of the kidnappers. The incident developed into an armed clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/05/_1415_governmen.php|title=Saturday's live coverage of the war in Lebanon|publisher=''[[Ya Libnan]]''|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artillery and mortars were used for the first time during these battles. A ceasefire agreement was supposed to take place at 18:00 of the same day, but fighters from both sides continued to exchange fire. Negotiations were ongoing for the PSP members to give up the fight and surrender their positions to the Lebanese Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting spreads in Lebanon|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/38C58B5A-9969-442A-858C-54EED513CB43.htm|publisher=''[[Al Jazeera]]''|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battles at Aley stopped for several hours, but the two sides clashed again in [[Mount Barook]] to the southeast shortly before midnight. Barook separates the Druze heartland of [[Shouf]] from the mainly Shi'ite southern end of the Bekaa Valley. That night Hezbollah's  fighters deployed from southern Beirut to the [[Qmatiyeh]] area tried to attack the hills near Aley but they were beaten back. After that Hezbollah tried to go on the offensive again and attacked their rival's positions. The Druze Militia had fought the Hezbollah militants from dug-in positions left over from the 1975-90 civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hizballah's Toughest Foe in Lebanon|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1756914,00.html?xid=feed-yahoo-full-world|author=Nicholas Blanford/Qmatiyeh|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)]]''|accessdate=2008-12-24 | date=2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Druze used hunting guns, AK 47 and other machine guns and RPGs to blast at the advancing Hezbollah.  The offensive was backed up by [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rockets fired from southern Beirut. Opposition forces bombarded the pro-government Druze area with artillery while ground forces attacked Druze positions using rockets and machine guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hezbollah-led forces take revolt to mountains above Beirut|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/05/11/lebanon.violence/index.html|publisher=''[[CNN]]''|accessdate=2008-05-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514143633/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/05/11/lebanon.violence/index.html  |archivedate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
