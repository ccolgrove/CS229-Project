'''The Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q)''' is a research centre established in 1996.

It is based at the Kelvin Grove campus of [[Queensland University of Technology]] (QUT) in Queensland, Australia and is part of both the Faculty of Health and the [[Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation]] (IHBI).

The Centre was established as a joint venture of the Motor Accident Insurance Commission (MAIC)&lt;ref name=&quot;MAIC&quot;&gt;Queensland Government - Motor Accident Insurance Commission [http://www.maic.qld.gov.au/about-maic/maic-funding-inits/research-centres.shtml &quot;CONROD and CARRS-Q&quot;], 2009.
