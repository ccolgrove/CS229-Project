'''Eldkvarn''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] rock band formed in [[NorrkÃ¶ping]] in [[1971]], consisting of brothers Plura Jonsson (the main songwriter, singer and rhythm guitarist of the band) and Carla Jonsson (lead guitarist who also writes songs and sings). The third original member is the bass player Tony ThorÃ©n, who has produced a number of albums by Eldkvarn, as well as other artists. The band is very active and widely regarded as one of the best rock bands in Sweden, with a following in other Nordic countries as well.

Eldkvarn have had some ups and downs in their career, highlights being the beginning of the 80's, then the late 80's with &quot;Himmelska dagar&quot; and &quot;Kungarna frÃ¥n Broadway&quot;, and - maybe above all - the period from &quot;Limbo&quot; (1999) to this day. The last period is by many Swedish music critics{{Who|date=March 2009}} considered to be the best in the band's career.

In all, the band have made more than 20 full length LP and CDs.
