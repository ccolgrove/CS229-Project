The '''University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce''' or UTCC ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]]: à¸¡à¸«à¸²à¸§à¸´à¸à¸¢à¸²à¸¥à¸±à¸¢à¸«à¸­à¸à¸²à¸£à¸à¹à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢) is a private educational institution located in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. The university began with just 300 students as the College of Commerce in 1940, offering a six month and a two year study program. However, it was soon shut due to the [[World War II]] Japanese invasion and occupation of Thailand. The College of Commerce reopened in 1963 and began offering bachelor's degree programs in 1967. It moved to its present location in 1973, and in 1984 was elevated to university status under its present name. 

The university is academically organized into 8 schools: Business, Accountancy, Economics, Humanities, Science, Communication Arts, Engineering, and Law. There are also international English language programs leading to a BBA or an MA, MS or MBA degree.

The university has a longer history than any other private university in Thailand. Its nearly half a century of educational experience contributes to an excellent environment for both students and faculty to progress to a higher academic level.

The all-English-language international programs now offered allow foreign students to receive a quality education while at the same time experiencing the lifestyle of the Thai community.
