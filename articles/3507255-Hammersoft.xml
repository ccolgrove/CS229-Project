'''Steve Carl Raible''' (born June 2, 1954) is a former [[NFL]] [[wide receiver]] and currently an anchor for [[KIRO-TV|KIRO 7]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

He was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], and attended college at [[Georgia Tech]]. An original member of the [[Seattle Seahawks]] as a second round selection in the [[1976 NFL Draft]] (59th overall), he played [[wide receiver]] from [[1976 NFL season|1976]] to [[1981 NFL season|1981]].  While with the Seahawks, Raible was known more for his locker room antics than his on field play. He now shares duties as one of the co-anchors for the [[KIRO-TV]] team, the lead play-by-play announcer for the Seahawks (the &quot;Voice of the Seahawks&quot;) on flagship stations [[KIRO-AM]] (710 ESPN Seattle) and [[KIRO-FM]] (News/Talk 97.3), and an anchor providing in-depth, TV coverage of the [[Seafair]] [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] races and [[Blue Angels]] airshow during the first weekend of August each year in Seattle. He shaved his famous mustache in March 2008, due to KIRO 7 making the switch to [[High-definition television|High definition]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Why Steve Raible lost his moustache&quot;&gt;http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2008/03/19/why-kiros-steve-raible-lost-his-moustache&lt;/ref&gt;
