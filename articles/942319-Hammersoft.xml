'''Starfleet ranks and insignia''' are fictional titles and badges that form the [[hierarchy]] of [[Starfleet]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television shows and movies.
&lt;!--info on each rank needs including--&gt;
==Overview==
The rank system of the ''Star Trek'' universe has always been based upon that of the [[United States Navy]] and the [[British Royal Navy]], as opposed to some other [[science fiction]] franchises that have used a rank system based more upon an army set of ranks.

In ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', ranks are indicated by sleeve stripes; in later movies based on ''The Original Series'', ranks are indicated by pins on a shoulder strap and the left sleeve. In later television series, ranks are indicated by varying numbers of pips or bars on the individuals' uniform collars.

Some licensed Star Trek publications present some insignia that contradict the ones shown on screen or in other publications. For example, the second and third editions of ''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'' offer differing insignia for various Starfleet ranks.&lt;ref name = &quot;EncycRankcomp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]''|last=Okuda|first=Mike|coauthors=Denise Okuda with Mirek, Debbie|authorlink=Mike Okuda|location=New York|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-35607-9|year=1997}} and {{cite book|title=''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]''|last=Okuda|first=Mike|coauthors=Denise Okuda with Mirek, Debbie|authorlink=Mike Okuda|location=New York|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=978-0-671-53609-1|year=1999}} Images accessible at {{cite web|title=Rank Comparison|work=Spike's Star Trek Page Rank Chart|url=http://www.st-spike.org/pages/uniforms/2278-2350/ranks_comparison.htm|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some Star Trek publications, including officially licensed ones, posit additional ranks that are not seen or mentioned in live-action productions.

===''Enterprise''===
''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', set prior to all other incarnations, did not include characters who hold the ranks of lieutenant commander or lieutenant, junior grade. The highest-ranking admiral seen wears two sets of three-pip insignia.

===''The Original Series'' pilot episodes===
Officers in the first ''Star Trek'' pilot, &quot;[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]&quot;, wear a single sleeve stripe, with only the officer grades &quot;lieutenant&quot; and &quot;captain&quot; used in dialog. A &quot;chief&quot; is also visible wearing a different sleeve stripe. Characters addressed as &quot;crewman&quot; wear no sleeve insignia.

In the second pilot episode, &quot;[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]&quot;, most officers again wear a single stripe; [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] [[James T. Kirk]] wears two stripes. [[Gary Mitchell (Star Trek)|Gary Mitchell]] is identified as a lieutenant commander.

===''The Original Series'' and ''The Motion Picture''===
Costumes in ''The Original Series'' were designed by [[William Ware Theiss]] and indicate rank with sleeve stripes. [[Robert Fletcher]] continued this system when he designed the uniforms for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. There are fewer stripes than are on US Navy uniforms because four stripes for a captain would have looked &quot;too militaristic&quot;.&lt;ref name=making_tmp&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of ''Star Trek: The Motion Picture''|author=[[Susan Sackett|Sackett, Susan]] and [[Gene Roddenberry]]|year=1980|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|isbn=978-0-671-79109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STTOS Starfleet Captain rank.jpg|thumb|right|Example Original Series sleeve insignia for Captain]]

A rank of fleet captain is mentioned in two episodes, but no insignia is shown. An August 3, 1978, memo describing the sleeve stripes for ''The Motion Picture'' does not mention the rank of lieutenant j.g., assigning its insignia to ensign, and identifies the rear admiral insignia as having one double-width stripe below one regular-width stripe.

In ''The Original Series'', every member of Starfleet wears an assignment patch on their left breast, which varies from ship to ship.&lt;ref name=Encyc&gt;{{cite book|author=Okuda, Michael &amp; Denise|authorlink=Michael Okuda|title=''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]''|location=New York | publisher=Pocket Books|year=1999|isbn=978-0-671-53609-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this assignment patch is a symbol that represents the officer's department, with Operations, Science, and Command represented by a spiral, a circle, and a star, respectively. In ''The Motion Picture'', the emblem used as the USS ''Enterprise''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s assignment patch in ''The Original Series'' is used as an emblem by all of Starfleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okuda|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Okuda|coauthors=Okuda, Denise|title=Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future|isbn=978-0-671-53610-7|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this has never been canonically established, although [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s novelization of ''The Motion Picture'' states that it was in honor of the ''Enterprise'', which was the only ship of its class to return from its five-year mission with ship and crew mostly intact. The 2009 film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', set in an alternate version of ''The Original Series'', also uses the ''Enterprise'' emblem for the entirety of Starfleet. In ''The Motion Picture'', the department is indicated by the background color of the circle on which the Starfleet arrowhead is set, white indicating Command, red for Engineering, orange for Science, pale gold for Operations, green for Medical, and gray for Security.&lt;ref name=making_tmp/&gt;

===''The Wrath of Khan'' to ''Generations''===
[[File:Fleet Admiral.jpg|thumb|right|Fleet Admiral sleeve insignia]]
[[File:FADM.jpg|thumb|left|Fleet Admiral strap insignia]]
Fletcher redesigned the costumes for ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. This design is used in the following movies, up to ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', and variations appear in some flashback scenes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. In this costume, Starfleet officers wear rank insignia on the uniform shoulder strap and left sleeve just above the armband. A service bar is worn just below the sleeve rank pin, denoting how many years of service the officer has devoted to Starfleet in one-year and five-year increments.

During this era, insignia representing departments are not worn; it is instead indicated by the color of the shoulder strap, arm band, and undershirt.&lt;ref name=Encyc/&gt; A Starfleet insignia is worn on the left breast.

Flag officers also wore an arm band on their left sleeve just below the rank insignia that denoted their rank.

===''The Next Generation'', ''Deep Space Nine'', and ''Voyager''===
[[File:Star Trek TNG OF5b.png|thumb|left|''TNG'', ''DS9'', ''Voyager'' captain insignia]]

During all the shows set in the 24th century, a consistent insignia scheme is used for officers: a series of gold pips, either a solid color or an outline, worn on each officer's right collar. After the first season of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', a consistent scheme is also used for admiral insignia: a series of gold circles inside a black rectangle with a gold border worn on both collars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot;/&gt;

For the first season of ''TNG'', admirals wear a different insignia, consisting of a triangle or stripe resembling gold weave along the right collar; one or two gold pips are sometimes underneath the weave. Three variants are visible in &quot;[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]&quot;: Admiral Quinn's insignia has no pips, Admiral Savar's has one, and Admiral Aaron's has two.
[[File:Voyager OF5.png|thumb|right|Voyager provisional Captain insignia]]
''Star Trek: Voyager'' introduces what ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'' refers to as &quot;provisional ranks&quot; for the titular ship's [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] crew. All ranks up to Captain appear on screen; ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'' shows them all to be analogous to the normal rank system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot;/&gt;

A Starfleet insignia is worn on the left breast: this also functions as a [[Communicator (Star Trek)|communicator badge]]. This commbadge insignia was redesigned for the movie ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (the only surviving part of a planned redesign of the uniforms), replacing the oval with a trapezoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Movie Costumes Planned|date=June 1996|publisher=Titan Magazines|work=Star Trek Monthly|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new commbadge is also used in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' from season three, and in ''Voyager''.

Enlisted and cadet ranks are seen rarely; their insignia are unclear.{{-}}

===Alternate realities and 29th century===
In the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode &quot;[[Future Imperfect]]&quot;, officers wear a series of stripes behind the [[Starfleet]] delta. Another episode, &quot;[[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Parallels]]&quot;, see this in addition to the collar insignia; the bars correspond to the rank of the officer, matching the number (and type) of rank pips.

The 29th-century officers in the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode &quot;[[Relativity (Star Trek: Voyager)|Relativity]]&quot; wear [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]-like collar insignia.
