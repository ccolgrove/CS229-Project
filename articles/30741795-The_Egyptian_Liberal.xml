{{Campaignbox Syrian uprising}}
The '''2011 Syrian uprising''' is an ongoing internal conflict occurring in [[Syria]]. Protests started on 26&amp;nbsp;January 2011, and escalated into an [[uprising]] by 15&amp;nbsp;March 2011. The uprising, which the [[United Nations]] considers a [[civil war]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/12/2011121151646992237.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=1 December 2011|title=UN sees Syria situation as 'civil war'}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Tunisia Effect|influenced]] by [[Arab Spring|concurrent protests in the region]], and has been described as &quot;unprecedented.&quot;&lt;ref name=afp19311&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5imPTFixkG47Y44ZniAQVv4wC6UGw?docId=CNG.301dc17b5d60dc6790da1726987ffe7d.c71| title = Syria funeral hit with teargas, protesters wounded: report | publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] (via [[Google News]]) |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=19 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj23311&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704461304576216761028539214.html| title =Syrian Protests Add to Pressure on Assad Regime|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of protesters include for President [[Bashar al-Assad]] to step down; for the ruling [[Ba'ath Party (Syria)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] to allow other political parties; for equal rights for [[Kurdish people]]; and for broad political freedoms, such as [[freedom of press]], speech and assembly.

Like the revolutionary movements in [[2011 Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]] and [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|Egypt]], it has taken the form of protests of various types, including marches and [[hunger strikes]], as well as rioting, vandalism of government property, and vandalism of private property, in a sustained campaign of [[civil resistance]] escalating into rebellion and the subsequent recognition of the conflict as a civil war, according to the international politival body, the UN.

As protests continued, the Syrian government used [[tank]]s and snipers to force people off the streets. Water and electricity were shut off and security forces began confiscating flour and food in particularly restive areas, including [[Daraa]], [[Duma, Syria|Douma]] and [[Homs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;News.sky.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115985647 |title=Video, Syria: Troops Storm Damascus Suburb And Arrest Hundreds Of People &amp;#124; Sky News |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;english.aljazeera.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/20114309234489989.html |title=Fresh Violence Hits Syrian Town |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the uprising, the [[Syrian Army]] has stormed the cities of [[Siege of Daraa|Daraa]], [[Siege of Rif Dimashq|Douma]], [[Siege of Baniyas|Baniyas]], [[Siege of Hama|Hama]], [[Siege of Homs|Homs]], [[Siege of Talkalakh|Talkalakh]], [[Siege of Rastan and Talbiseh|Rastan]], [[Siege of Jisr al-Shughur|Jisr ash-Shughur]], [[Siege of Deir ez-Zor|Deir ez-Zor]] and [[Siege of Latakia|Latakia]], among other towns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/10/us-syria-idUSLDE73N02P20110610 |title=Helicopters open fire to disperse Syrian protesters|author=Khaled Yacoub Oweis|date=10 June 2011|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occupied parts of [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Al Jazeera English&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/20115765059910917.html |title=Syrian Tanks Enter 'Protest Hub' Baniyas |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13343540].

More than 4,000 people have been killed, many more injured, and thousands of protesters have been detained. Dozens of detainees have reportedly been tortured and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14726294

Since the beginning of the uprising, the Syrian government has made several concessions, though widely considered trivial by protesters demanding more meaningful reform. On 21 April, the government repealed an emergency law that had been in place since 1963, which allowed the government sweeping authority to suspend constitutional rights. Yet crackdowns on protesters have continued to heighten since the beginning of the uprising. On 24 July, a draft law was created, to be debated by parliament, to allow more political parties, under the conditions that they were not based on religious, tribal or ethnic beliefs and does not discriminate against gender or race. Protesters have dismissed the law as superficial, as Article 8 of the Syrian Constitution, which grants the Ba'ath party the role of leader of the state and society, would need to be repealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;.

After the [[1970 Syrian Corrective Revolution|1970 Revolution]], President [[Hafez al-Assad]] led Syria for nearly 30 years, banning opposing political parties and any opposition candidates in elections.  In 1982, at the climax of a six-year [[Islamic uprising in Syria|Islamic insurgency]] throughout the country, Hafez al-Assad conducted a [[scorched earth]] policy against the town of [[Hama]] to quell an uprising by the [[Sunni Muslim]] community, including the [[History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria|Muslim Brotherhood]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shadid |first=Anthony |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/world/middleeast/27syria.html?src=twrhp |title=International Outcry Grows Over Syria Crackdown |work=The New York Times |date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tens of thousands of people, including 10â80,000 civilians, were killed in the [[Hama massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meforum.org/683/syrian-reform-what-lies-beneath |first=Farid N.|last=Ghadry|title=Syrian Reform: What Lies Beneath |date=Winter 2005 | work=[[Middle East Quarterly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sturdy House That Assad Built&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67561/michael-broening/the-sturdy-house-that-assad-built|title=The Sturdy House That Assad Built |date=7 March 2011 |author=Michael BrÃ¶ning |publisher=The Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/world/middleeast/27diplomacy.html|title=Chaos in Syria and Jordan Alarms U.S.|author=Landler, Mark |date=26 March 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GlobalSecurity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/syria/hama.htm |title=Hama |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org| accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of Hafez al-Assad's succession prompted the [[1999 Latakia protests|1999 Latakia incident]],&lt;ref name=alan&gt;George, Alan. ''Syria: neither bread nor freedom.'' 2003. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; when violent protests and armed clashes erupted following 1998 People's Assembly's Elections. The violent events were an explosion of a long-running feud between [[Hafez al-Assad]] and his younger brother [[Rifaat al-Assad|Rifaat]].&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; Two people were killed in fire exchanges between Syrian police and Rifaat's supporters during a police crack-down on Rifaat's port compound in Latakia.

''Europea World Year Book 2004''. Europa Publications, 2004. Volume 2, p. 4056.&lt;/ref&gt; Hafez al-Assad died one year later, from [[pulmonary fibrosis]].

Bashar, who speaks English and some French and has a British-born [[Asma Assad|Syrian wife]], was said to have &quot;inspired hopes&quot; for reform, and a &quot;[[Damascus Spring]]&quot; of intense political and social debate took place from July 2000 to August 2001.&lt;ref name=HRW2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=No Room to Breathe: State Repression of Human Rights Activism in Syria|journal=Human Rights Watch|year=2007|month=October|volume=19|issue=6|pages=8â13|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/10646/section/4|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period was characterized by the emergence of numerous political forums or [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] where groups of like minded people met in private houses to debate political and social issues. The phenomenon of salons spread rapidly in [[Damascus]] and to a lesser extent in other cities. Political activists, such as, [[Riad Seif]], [[Haitham al-Maleh]], [[Kamal al-Labwani]], [[Riyad al-Turk]] and [[Aref Dalila]] were important in mobilizing the movement.&lt;ref name=AISyria&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria Smothering Freedom of Expression: the detention of peaceful critics|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/007/2002/en/ee9fa6f2-d870-11dd-9df8-936c90684588/mde240072002en.html|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous of the forums were the [[Riad Seif Forum]] and the [[Jamal al-Atassi|Jamal al-Atassi Forum]].

Kurdish-Arab riots have prompted increased tension in Syria's Kurdish areas since 2004. That year the [[2004 Al-Qamishli riots|Al-Qamishli riots]] against the government began in the northeastern city of [[Al-Qamishli]]. During a chaotic soccer match, some people raised [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] flags, and the match turned into a political conflict.

===Socio-economics and civil rights===
{{main|Human rights in Syria}}
;Socio-economic
As with much of the Middle East, high youth unemployment and economic disenfranchisement of young adults has been a significant factor in Syria. A 2007 study by the Dubai School of Governmentâs Wolfensohn Center for Development, âYouth Exclusion in Syria: Social, Economic, and Institutional Dimensions,&quot; examined the aspects of high unemployment rates among young adults ages 15â24 in the country using available jobs data and survey responses. The study found that certain dynamics are particularly acute in Syria, even relative to countries in the region. Though its overall overall unemployment rate has traditionally been about average for the Middle East (about 25%), what distinguishes Syria is that the youth jobless rate has been more than six times higher than the rate among older adults (only 4%); that constitutes âthe highest ratio [youth-adult imbalance] among the regionâs countries outside the Gulf States.â The average ratio in the Middle East is 3.3, whereas the world average is 3.5. Additionally, the participation rate of Syrian youth in the labor market relative to adults is âsubstantially lower than the worldwide average (0.66 compared to 0.79 percent)&quot;. Demographic trends have exacerbated the problem; according to the study, &quot;the share of youth in the Syrian population peaked at 25.4 percent in 2005, presenting challenges in terms of job creation for young people; and in 2002, unemployed youth made up 77 percent of the working-age unemployed population in Syria.&quot; This is in spite of the burgeoning youth population; the study notes that âlabor supply growth rates of around 5 percent per year between 1983 and 2003.&quot; Survey responses indicated that most youth were actively seeking employment, but more than â75 percent of unemployed youth had been searching for work for over a year.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/youth-exclusion-in-syria-economic/ |title = Youth Exclusion in Syria: Social, Economic, and Institutional Dimensions |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socio-economic complaints have been reported, such as a deterioration in the country's [[standard of living]], a reduction of state support for the poor resulting from the gradual transition towards a [[free market]] economy {{dubious|date=November 2011}}, the erosion of subsidies for basic goods and agriculture, free trade without suitable support to the local industry, and high youth unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/scp310511.html|title=Message to Communists of the World|author=[[Syrian Communist Party]] (Unified)|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Human rights
The state of [[human rights in Syria]] has long been the subject of harsh criticism from global organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;w.r.p555&quot;&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2010 &quot;World Report 2010 Human Rights Watch World Report 2010&quot;], p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; The country was under [[state of emergency|emergency rule]] from 1963 until 2011, effectively granting security forces sweeping powers of arrest and detention.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmInt2009&quot;/&gt; After taking power in 1970, Hafez al-Assad quickly purged the government of any political adversaries and asserted his control over all aspects of Syrian society, consolidating his position as the [[Despotism|despotic]] statesman of the country. He developed an elaborate [[cult of personality]] and violently repressed any opposition, most notoriously in the 1982 [[Hama Massacre]] when thousands were killed in order to suppress an [[Islamic uprising in Syria|Islamic uprising]]. After his death in 2000 and the succession of his son [[Bashar al-Assad]] to the Presidency, it was hoped that the Syrian government would make concessions toward the development of a more liberal society; this period became known as the [[Damascus Spring]]. However, al-Assad is widely regarded to have been unsuccessful in implementing democratic change, with a 2010 report from [[Human Rights Watch]] stating that he has failed to improve the state of human rights since taking power ten years prior.&lt;ref name=GUARD&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/16/syrian-human-rights-unchanged-assad |work=The Guardian |location=London  | first=Ian | last=Black | title=Syrian human rights record unchanged under Assad, report says | date=16 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All other political parties have remained banned, thereby making Syria a one-party state without free elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmInt2009&quot;&gt;[http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/syria Amnesty International Report 2009, Syria]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published 31 January 2011, al-Assad declared it was time to reform, that the protests in [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisia]] and [[2011 Yemeni uprising|Yemen]] indicated a &quot;new era&quot; was coming to the Middle East, and that Arab rulers needed to do more to accommodate their peoples' rising political and economic aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703833204576114712441122894.html |title=Interview With Syrian President Bashar al-Assad |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=31 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704832704576114340735033236.html |title=Syria Strongman: Time for 'Reform' |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=31 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2011 |first=Jay |last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and ethnic minorities have faced discrimination in the public sector.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; Thousands of Syrian Kurds were denied citizenship in 1962, and their descendants continued to be labeled as &quot;foreigners&quot; until 2011, when 120,000 out of roughly 200,000 stateless Kurds were granted citizenship on 6 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-07/world/syria.kurdish.citizenship_1_kurdish-region-kurdish-identity-stateless-kurds?_s=PM:WORLD |title='&amp;#39;Stateless Kurds in Syria granted citizenship'&amp;#39;.

Nine people were killed when security forces fired on these demonstrations.

Throughout August and September, Syrian forces continued to suppress protests, with hundreds of killings and arrests taking place. The crackdown continued into the first three days of November. On 3 November, the government accepted an [[Arab League]] peace plan to halt its crackdown. The ceasefire quickly broke down, as government forces continued their suppression of protests. Throughout the month, there were numerous reports of civilians taken from their homes turning up dead and mutilated, clashes between loyalist troops and defectors, and electric shocks and hot iron rods being used to torture detainees. From 2 to 12 November, more than 250 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-417168,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local coordination committees===
The networks of anti-government protest organizers formed decentralized &quot;Local Coordination Committees&quot; which drew together the young, unorganized protesters. The Committees are used to document protests and spread anti-government messages throughout Syria. Though they have only a few hundred members, the Local Coordination Committees rose to prominence as the core of the protest movement on the ground, separate from the organized political opposition. The Committees are also noted for trying to reach out to minority groups and diversify the demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/world/middleeast/01syria.html | work=The New York Times | first=Anthony | last=Shadid | title=Coalition of Factions From the Streets Fuels a New Opposition in Syria | date=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurdish participation in the uprising===
Kurds have participated in the uprising in much smaller numbers than their Syrian Arab counterparts. This ha sbeen explained as being due to the Turkish endorsement of the opposition, and underrepresentation in the Syrian National Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/2011/11/16/142387417/new-republic-will-kurds-determine-syrias-fate&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The regime tried to neutralize Kurds,&quot; said Hassan Saleh, leader of the Kurdish Yekiti Party. &quot;In the Kurdish areas, people are not being repressed like the Arab areas. But activists are being arrested.&quot;

The National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, which consists of Syria's 12 Kurdish parties, boycotted Syrian opposition summit in [[Antalya]], Turkey on 31 May, stating that &quot;any such meeting held in Turkey can only be a detriment to the Kurds in Syria, because Turkey is against the aspirations of the Kurds, not just with regards to northern Kurdistan, but in all four parts of Kurdistan, including the Kurdish region of Syria.&quot; Kurdish Leftist Party representative Saleh Kado stated that &quot;we, the Kurds in Syria, do not trust Turkey or its policies, and that is why we have decided to boycott the summit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yoshie Furuhashi |url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/kb010611.html |title=Syrian Kurdish Parties Boycott Syrian Opposition Conference in Antalya, Turkey |publisher=Mrzine.monthlyreview.org |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the August summit in Istanbul, which led to the creation of the Syrian National Council, only two of the parties in the National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, the Kurdish Union Party and the Kurdish Freedom Party, attended the summit. Kurdish leader Shelal Gado stated the reason they did not participate was that &quot;Turkey is against the Kurdsâ¦in all parts of the world,&quot; and that &quot;If Turkey doesnât give rights to its 25 million Kurds, how can it defend the rights of the Syrian people and the Kurds there?&quot; Abdulbaqi Yusuf, representing the Kurdish Freedom Party, however, stated that his party felt no Turkish pressure during the meeting and participated to represent Kurdish demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/3941.html |title=Most Syrian Kurdish Parties Boycott Opposition Gathering |publisher=Rudaw.net |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic Union Party (PYD) chairman Salih Muslim Muhammad said that the lack of participation is due a tactical decission, explaining that: &quot;There is a de facto truce between the Kurds and the government. The security forces are overstretched over Syria's Arab provinces to face demonstrators, and cannot afford the opening of a second front in Syrian Kurdistan. On our side, we need the army to stay away.

According to [[International Christian Concern]], [[Christian Syrians]] have been attacked by anti-government protesters in recent weeks, for not joining the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/christians-under-attack-from-anti-government-protestors-in-syria-50104/ |title=Christians Under Attack From Anti-Government Protesters in Syria, Christian News |publisher=Christianpost.com |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free Syrian Army===
{{main|Free Syrian Army}}
[[File:Riyad al-Asad.jpg|thumb|right|[[Riyad al-Asad]], commander of FSA.]]
In late July 2011, a web video featuring a group of uniformed men claiming to be defected [[Syrian Army]] officers proclaimed the formation of a [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA). In the video, the men called upon Syrian soldiers and officers to defect to their ranks and said the purpose of the Free Syrian Army was to defend protesters from violence by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldtribune.com&quot;/&gt; Many Syrian soldiers subsequently deserted to join the FSA.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As deserting soldiers had to abandon their armored vehicles and bring only light weaponry and munitions, FSA adopted [[guerilla]]-style tactics against security forces inside cities. Its primary target has been the [[shabiha]] militias. Most of their attacks focused on buses bringing in security reinforcements, which were often attacked either with bombs or through hit-and-run attacks. To encourage defection, the FSA began attacking army patrols, shooting the commanders and trying to convice the soldiers to switch sides. FSA units have also acted as defense forces by guarding neighborhoods rife with opposition, guarding streets while protests take place, and attacking shabiha members. However, the FSA engaged in street battles with security forces in [[Deir ez-Zor]], [[Al-Rastan]] and [[Al-Bukamal]]. Fighting in these cities raged for days, with no clear victor. In [[Hama]], [[Homs]], [[Al-Rastan]], [[Deir ez-Zor]] and [[Daraa]], the Syrian military used airstrikes against them, leading to calls from the FSA for the imposition of a [[no-fly zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/124717/syrian-opposition-calls-for-no-fly-zone.html |title=Syrian Opposition Call for No-Fly Zone, 8 October 2011 Saturday 9:38 |publisher=Turkishweekly.net |date=8 October 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Syrian Army numbers to about 15,000 men according to a statement its leader [[Riyad al-Asad]] made on [[Al Jazeera]], and he added that these were almost exclusively reserve troops that defected from the Syrian army, and thus were no match against the government's highly trained active-duty troops.

On 15 November, the FSA attacked an air force intelligence complex in the Damascus suburb of of [[Harasta]] with shoulder-fired missiles and heavy machine guns. A gunfight ensued, and helicopters were deployed to the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4148920,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/201111163538991291.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign involvement===
Iranâs [[supreme leader]], [[Ali Khamenei]], has spoken out in favor of the Syrian government in regards to the uprisingââWherever a movement is Islamic, populist and anti-American, we support itâ&lt;ref name=abdo&gt;[http://www.insideiran.org/featured/how-iran-keeps-assad-in-power-in-syria/ How Iran Keeps Assad in Power in Syria]| Geneive Abdo| 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;âand news media sources such as [[The Guardian]], [[Telegraph]] and [[Reuters]] have reported that the Iranian government is assisting the Syrian government with riot control equipment, intelligence monitoring techniques, oil supply and snipers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/08/iran-helping-syrian-regime-protesters Iran helping Syrian regime crack down on protesters, say diplomats]| Simon Tisdall and foreign staff in Damascus| guardian.co.uk| 9 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=base&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8699077/Iran-agrees-to-fund-Syrian-military-base.html|title=Iran agrees to fund Syrian military base|first=Con|last=Coughlin|date=12 August 2011|work=The Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrian refugees===
{{main|Refugees of the 2011 Syrian uprising}}
By April 2011, a refugee problem has begun unfolding across Syrian borders, beginning with the [[siege of Talkalakh]] and unrest near the Turkish border. By 3 May, the number of Syrian citizens, crossing the Turkish border was estimated at 300.&lt;ref name=turkeypreparing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2011/05/03/turkey-preparing-for-large-numbers-of-syrian-refugees/ |title=Turkey preparing for large numbers of Syrian refugees |publisher=Ya Libnan |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of Turkey, Abdullah GÃ¼l, said that Turkey is preparing for âa worst case scenario,â in an apparent reference to a possible influx of large numbers of refugees from Syria.&lt;ref name=turkeypreparing/&gt; He was referring to the fact that Turkey had already set up a small camp in southern Hatay province for 263 Syrians who fled their country on Friday, 29 April.&lt;ref name=turkeypreparing/&gt;

By early July 2011, some 15,000 Syrian citizens had taken shelter in tent cities, set up in the YayladaÄÄ±, ReyhanlÄ± and AltÄ±nÃ¶zÃ¼ districts of [[Hatay Province|Hatay]] near Turkeyâs border with Syria,&lt;ref name=todayszaman0307&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-249275-five-babies-born-in-syrian-refugee-camps-in-turkey-named-recep-tayyip.html |title=Five babies born in Syrian refugee camps in Turkey named 'Recep Tayyip' |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 5,000 of them returning back to Syria by that time of their own volition.&lt;ref name=todayszaman0307/&gt; The number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon had reached some 10,000 by late June. On 12 July, Al-Jazeera reported that some Syrian refugees had found a sanctuary in Jordan,&lt;ref name=aljazeera1207&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2011/07/2011712175013150736.html |title=Syrians find sanctuary in Jordan â Middle East â Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though didn't give numbers. The reports came from the Jordanian town of Ramtha, along the border with Syria.&lt;ref name=aljazeera1207/&gt;

To block the flow of refugees, the Syrian military deployed troops and tanks along the border and set up checkpoints, arresting anyone caught trying to cross. Militiamen reportedly attacked people trying to deliver relief and food to refugees trying to flee. On 19 June, Syrian forces attacked the border town of Bdama, burning homes and a bakery supplying bread to refugees, and arresting people for assisting refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syrian-troops-and-tanks-target-border-with-turkey-2299945.html |location=London |work=The Independent   | first1=Zeina | last1=Karam | title=Syrian troops and tanks target border with Turkey | date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Al Jazeera English]] â Syrian forces 'prevent refugees from fleeing' â 19 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, Syrian forces reportedly made an incursion into [[Lebanon]] to search for refugees and army defectors.

In August 2011, Syrian security forces attacked the country's best-known political cartoonist, [[Ali Farzat]], a noted critic of Syria's government and its five-month crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators and dissent. Relatives of the severely beaten humorist told Western media the attackers threatened to break Farzat's bones as a warning for him to stop drawing cartoons of government officials, particularly Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Ferzat, who recently celebrated his 60th birthday, was hospitalized with fractures in both hands and blunt force trauma to the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/25/syria-cartoonist-ali-ferzat-beaten], 25 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Syrian-Activists-Anti-Regime-Cartoonist-Attacked-Beaten-128385448.html], 25 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March, the [[Cabinet of Syria|Syrian cabinet]] submitted its official resignation to al-Assad.&lt;ref name=AJSyriaGovQuit/&gt;

On 31 March, al-Assad set up a committee of legal experts to study legislation that would pave the way to replacing decades-old emergency laws.  The committee was to complete its study by 25 April.

On 16 April, al-Assad spoke to the People's Assembly in a televised speech, stating that he expected his government to lift the emergency law the following week.

He spoke of the importance of reaching &quot;a state of unity, unity between the government, state institutions and the people&quot;; stressed the need for dialogue and consultation in multiple channels, popular support, trust and transparency; explained the interrelatedness of reform and the needs of citizens for services, security and dignity. He stated the first priorities were citizenship for Kurds, lifting the state of emergency in the coming week or at the latest the week after, regulating demonstrations without chaos and sabotage, political party law, local administration law in both structure and elections, and new and modern media law, all with public timeframes. The next topics were unemployment, the economy, rural services, attracting investment, the public and private sectors, justice, corruption, petty bribery, tax reform and reducing government waste, followed by tackling government itself with more [[participatory democracy|participation]], [[e-government]], [[decentralization]], effectiveness and efficiency, as well as closer cooperation with civil society, mass organizations and trade unions.

On 19 April, a bill was approved by the Syrian government to lift the emergency law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria to lift decades-old emergency law |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/2011419135036463804.html |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, al-Assad signed legislative decree 50 into law.&lt;ref name=SANA220411&gt;{{cite news|title=Decrees on Ending State of Emergency, Abolishing SSSC, Regulating Right to Peaceful Demonstration|newspaper=Syrian Arab News Agency|date=22 April 2011|url=http://sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/22/342711.htm|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters210411&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria's Assad ends state of emergency|author=Khaled Yacoub Oweis, additional reporting by Mariam Karouny in Beirut; Suleiman al-Khalidi in Amman; Sami Aboudi in Cairo; writing by Yara Bayoumy; editing by Samia Nakhoul and Paul Taylor| publisher=Reuters |date=21 April 2011|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/21/us-syria-idUSTRE72N2MC20110421|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July, a draft law was created, to be debated by parliament, to allow more political parties, under the conditions that they were not based on religious, tribal or ethnic beliefs and does not discriminate against gender or race. Protesters have dismissed the law as superficial, as Article 8 of the Syrian Constitution, which grants the Ba'ath party the role of leader of the state and society, would need to be repealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

On 8 March, [[Syrian Arab News Agency|SANA]], the official Syrian news agency, published an article on its website titled &quot;President al-Assad issued a decree provides for a legislative grant amnesty for political crimes committed before the date of 2011-03-08&quot;. Three hours later, the publication was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://all4syria.info/content/view/40436/96/ |title=Ø³ÙØ§Ø¯Ø© Ø§ÙØ±Ø¦ÙØ³ ÙØµØ¯Ø± Ø¹ÙÙØ§Ù Ø¹Ù Ø§ÙØ¬Ø±Ø§Ø¦Ù Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ§Ø³ÙØ© Ø«Ù ÙØ³Ø­Ø¨ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ Ø«ÙØ§Ø« Ø³Ø§Ø¹Ø§Øª Ø |publisher=Ettihad |accessdate=13 April 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}{{ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hours later, Syrian authorities released [[Haitham al-Maleh]], an 80-year-old former judge, one of al-Assad's most outspoken critics, under an amnesty marking the anniversary of the [[1963 Syrian coup d'Ã©tat|1963 coup]] which brought the [[Ba'ath Party (Syria)|Ba'ath Party]] to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12679902 |title=Syrian activist [[Haitham al-Maleh]] freed under amnesty |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 March 2011|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/08/us-syria-rights-idUSTRE7274LC20110308 | title = Syria Frees 80-Year-Old Former Judge in Amnesty | publisher=Reuters | date=8 March 2011| accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve Syrian human rights organisations called on the government to scrap the [[state of emergency]] which had been in effect for almost 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jVJSMH9FyXYejUJ-MoOUniMK6CBg?docId=CNG.08dc880232fd4c049d2f1a10f4641409.cf1 |title=12 rights groups in Syria demand end to emergency |agency=AFP   |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March, newly released Haitham al-Maleh  announced in a YouTube video his support and assistance to the Syrian youth who are behind the new wave of protests and hoped that he will soon see democracy in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=ÙÙØ«Ù Ø§ÙÙØ§ÙØ­ ..

On 16 February, regime critic and director of the Organisation for Democracy and Freedom in Syria (ODFS) Ribal al-Assad, son of [[Rifaat al-Assad]] and cousin to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a press conference in London, in which he made it clear that he &quot;does not want to see a Syrian revolution, but a peaceful change of power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elaph.com/Web/news/2011/2/632409.html |title=Opposition leader Ribal Al-Assad is optimistic to changes in Syria |publisher=elaph.com |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 5 April interview, Ribal al-Assad warned of Syria's risk for a civil war, saying&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=257946 |title=Assad's exiled cousin warns Syria risks civil war |publisher=NOW Lebanon |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June, the Syrian Ambassador to France Lamia Shakkour was impersonated in announcing her resignation on [[France 24]] over the protests through a caller. The elaborate hoax was later exposed, resulting in the network filing legal charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/10/france24-hoax-syrian-ambassador &quot;France 24 to sue over hoax Syrian resignation&quot;], Kim Willsher.

[[Amnesty International]], a human rights advocacy group based in London, announced on 6 July that it had proof that the Syrian government committed [[crimes against humanity]] in [[Tel Kalakh]], a town in Syria's restive north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/07/201175202656973422.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=6 July 2011|title=Syria accused of crimes against humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July, [[Human Rights Watch]] issued a report stating that [[Syrian Army]] soldiers were ordered to shoot protesters during demonstrations, as well as take part in arbitrary detentions. The group cites defectors as saying that if they did not obey orders, they would have been shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43695260/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa HRW: Syrian troops describe shooting protesters â World news â Mideast/N.

As of mid-September, the United States and Turkey (both of whom had condemned regime violence against peaceful protesters in Syria) were reportedly working together to prepare for a post-Assad Syria, and to prevent a possible [[Religion in Syria|sectarian]] civil war. A âsenior [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] officialâ told the [[New York Times]] newspaper, âthereâs a real consensusâ  that Bashir al-Assad is âbeyond the pale and over the edge. Intelligence services say heâs not coming back.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/world/middleeast/us-is-quietly-getting-ready-for-a-syria-without-an-assad.html?_r=2 U.S. Is Quietly Getting Ready for Syria Without Assad] By HELENE COOPER nyt.com 19 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll by the Arab American Institute revealed that the vast majority of Arabs side with the revolutionaries against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aaiusa.org/reports/arab-attitudes-toward-syria-2011 | title = Arab Attitudes Toward Syria: 2011 | accessdate = 2011-11-24 | last = Zogby | first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hezbollah]], a long-standing ally of the regime, has stood in support of Bashar al-Assad, citing their status as a state of &quot;resistance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=vSuZkTmHsfM | title = Sayyed Nasrallah Clarifies Hezbollah's Position towards Situation in Syria | accessdate = 2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story in Arabiya suggested that Hezbollah is planning a military coup in Lebanon should the Assad regime fall, with the assistance of the [[Free Patriotic Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://subyraman.com/hezbollah-planning-military-coup-if-assad-falls-translation-and-analysis/ | title = Hezbollah planning military coup if Assad falls; translation and analysis | accessdate = 2011-11-24 | work = Tabeer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November, the Arab League voted to suspend Syria from the organization if Al-Assad's government would not stop violence against protestors by 16 November, and invited Syria's opposition parties to join talks in the League's headquarters in Cairo. Syria, [[Lebanon]] and [[Yemen]] voted against the action, while [[Iraq]] abstained from the vote. The League also warned of possible sanctions against Syria.&lt;ref name=nyt-suspended&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/world/middleeast/arab-league-votes-to-suspend-syria-over-its-crackdown-on-protesters.html|title=Arab League Votes to Suspend Syria|date=12 Novermber 2011|work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 November 2011|first=Neil|last=MacFarquhar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/11/12/arab-league-suspends-syria-from-meetings/|title=Arab League Suspends Syria From Meetings|date=12 November 2011|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/201111121342948333.html|title=Syria threatened with Arab League suspension|date=12 November 2011|publisher=Aljazeera|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet activists===

;Facebook
As in the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, the internet is playing a major role in the organization and covering of the protests. The largest Facebook site in support of the Syrian uprising called '''&quot;The Syrian Revolution 2011&quot;''' alone has more than 310,000 supporters. The site which was co-founded by [[Fida al-Sayed]] reports on news related to the uprising and provides general guidelines for the protests. For every Friday, the site suggests a new name that has so far been adopted by the demonstrators in Syria. As [[Facebook]] only was recently [[Censorship of Facebook|unblocked]], many governmental institutions are now on Facebook, such as Syrian TV etc.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

;Mobiles
Since international news media was banned in Syria, the main source of information has been private videos usually taken by mobile phone cameras and uploaded to YouTube. Such videos are difficult to verify independently, and several TV stations have shown older footage from Iraq and Lebanon, which was claimed to have been filmed in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s3218415.htm |title=Media Watch: Beware the 'trusted' source (16 May 2011) |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avisen.dk/gigantisk-dr-bommert-uden-konsekvenser_146651.aspx |title=Gigantisk DR-bommert uden konsekvenser â |publisher=Avisen.dk |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Websites
To add credibility to the videos, protestors often explicitly mention the date and location of the scene. Sometimes current newspaper issues are also shown. The largest collection of these videos is found on [http://www.onsyria.com Onsyria], which currently has more than 60,000 videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Syrian Revolution 2011 site calls Onsyria.com the largest collection of videos on the Syrian uprising.|url=https://www.facebook.com/Syrian.Revolution/posts/204310269605192}}  {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition publications===
[[File:Dr. Burhan Ghalioun.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. [[Burhan Ghalioun]], President of Syrian National Council]]
; Hurriyat Magazine
In August 2011, [[Hurriyat magazine]], which claims to be the first Syrian magazine opposing the Assad regime, published its first issue.  The weekly magazine, was initially published in [[Arabic]] and distributed underground in [[Damascus]] and [[Homs]], due to government regulation that in practice does not allow opposition newspapers.  The magazine is run, written, published, and distributed by Syrian activists and target all segments of Syrian society, even those who are still supportive of the regime and those who have been labeled the &quot;silent majority.&quot;  Soft copies of the magazine articles can be found on the Hurriyat Facebook page.

===Syrian opposition===
{{main|Syrian National Council}}
The Syrian opposition met several times in conferences held mostly in [[Turkey]] and formed a National Council.

The Federation of Tenseekiet Syrian Revolution helped in the formation of a Transitional National Assembly on 23 August in [[Istanbul]] &quot;to serve as a the political stage of the Revolution of the Syrian people&quot;.
