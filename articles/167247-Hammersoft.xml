Hardy began his career as a classical actor. In 1959 he appeared as Sicinius opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[Coriolanus]]'' at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phyllis.demon.co.uk/theatricalia/01smt/smt5560.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He then appeared in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' on stage and in television's ''[[Henry V (play)|An Age of Kings]]'' (1960), and subsequently played Coriolanus in (''The Spread of the Eagle'', BBC, 1963) and Sir Toby Belch for the [[BBC Television Shakespeare]] in 1980. It was while playing Henry V that Hardy developed an interest in medieval warfare, and he later wrote and presented an acclaimed television documentary on the subject of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. He has also written two books on the subject of the longbow, ''Longbow: A Social and Military History''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Longbow-Military-History-Robert-Hardy/dp/1852604123 Longbow: A Social and Military History]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Great War Bow'' with Matthew Strickland.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton Publishing 2005.

Over the years, Hardy has played a range of parts on television and film. His first continuing role in a TV series was as businessman Alec Stewart in the award-winning oil company drama ''[[The Troubleshooters]]'' for the BBC, which he played from 1966 to 1970. He won further acclaim for his portrayal of the mentally-unhinged [[Abwehr]] Sgt. Gratz in [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]'s 1969 war drama ''[[Manhunt (1969 TV series)|Manhunt]]''. In 1975, Hardy appeared in the episode &quot;Such a Lovely Man&quot; in the fifth season of the series ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs]]''.

He was seen as the senior veterinarian Siegfried Farnon in the long-running ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' (1978&amp;ndash;1990), an adaptation of [[James Herriot]]'s novels.

Hardy also made an appearance in the 1986â88 [[ITV]] comedy series ''[[Hot Metal]]'', in which he played the dual roles of newspaper proprietor Twiggy Rathbone (who bore more than a passing resemblance to [[Rupert Murdoch]]) and his editor, Russell Spam.

In 1993 Hardy appeared in an episode of ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', playing Andrew Baydon in &quot;[[Twilight of the Gods (Inspector Morse)|Twilight of the Gods]]&quot;. Hardy played the part of the successful businessman with a murky wartime past with a characteristic blend of the vulnerable and the bombastic.

Hardy holds the distinction of playing both [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and having played both roles on more than one occasion. He played Churchill most notably in ''[[Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years]]'' (1981), for which he won a [[BAFTA]] award, but also in ''[[The Sittaford Mystery#Film, TV or theatrical adaptations|The Sittaford Mystery]]'', ''[[Bomber Harris (television film)|Bomber Harris]]'' and ''[[War and Remembrance]]''. He played Roosevelt in the BBC serial, ''[[Bertie and Elizabeth]]'', and in the French TV mini-series, ''[[Le Grand Charles]]'', about the life of [[Charles de Gaulle]].

Returning to his Churchill experience at 3:50pm on 20 August 2010 he read Churchill's famous wartime address &quot;[[Never was so much owed by so many to so few]]&quot; at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawless|first=Jill|title=70 years on from WWII, Britain remembers 'the few'|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j1KzYh4FqCKHnpj0MIMFjHv9jNAQD9HN8NEO0|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also played [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]] in ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', and Prince Albert in ''[[Edward the Seventh]]'' (known as ''Edward the King'' to the American audience). He took a role in the 1995 film version of ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]''.

His big screen roles include [[Minister of Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films, and Lord Malan in ''[[His Master's Voice (radio series)|His Master's Voice]]''.

His voice performance as [[Robin Hood]] in ''[[Tale Spinners For Children]]'' &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, a [[Gramophone record|LP]] from the 1960s, is considered one of the best Robin Hood renditions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tale Spinners for Children: Robin Hood&quot; UAC 11001: &quot;Starring Robert Hardy as Robin Hood with the Famous Theater Company and the Hollywood Studio Orchestra&quot;; cf. also [http://www.artsreformation.com/talespinners/ Arts Reformation].&lt;/ref&gt; His voice was also the voice of [[D'Artagnan]] in ''The Three Musketeers'', and of [[FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin]], in &quot;The Story of Chopin&quot;.

==Awards==
He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] of 1981.
