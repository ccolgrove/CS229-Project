'''Middle Tennessee State University''', commonly abbreviated as '''MTSU''', is a [[public university|public]] [[university]] located in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], [[Tennessee]], [[United States]].

Founded in 1911 as an education college, the university is composed of seven undergraduate colleges as well as a college of graduate studies offering more than 80 majors/degree programs through over 35 departments. Total enrollment in Fall, 2010 was 26,430, and in spring 2011 it was 24,660 (Spring enrollment is typically a bit lower than Fall enrollment). Of the Spring, 2011 total, 22,274 were undergraduates, and 2,386 were graduate students. It is currently the largest institution of higher learning in Tennessee by undergraduate enrollment. Fall semester 2011 set a new MTSU record enrollment total of 26,442 students.  In 2009, Middle Tennessee State University was ranked among the top 100 public universities by Forbes. 

MTSU is part of the [[Tennessee Board of Regents]], and is [[accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;accreditation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtsu.edu/about_accreditation.shtml |title=Accreditations |work=MTSU.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current president is [[Sidney A. McPhee]].

==History==
[[File:MTSU 1952 Aerial.jpg|thumb|left|1952 aerial photograph of the university]]
In 1909, the General Assembly of the State of [[Tennessee]] moved &quot;to provide for the improvement of the system of Public Education of the State of Tennessee, that is to say, to establish a General Education Fund.&quot; The major thrust of this &quot;improvement&quot; embodied in the legislative act that was to become known as the General Education Bill of 1909 was the establishment of three normals or teacher-training institutions. Following the intent of the act that one was to be located in each of the grand divisions of the state, the State Board of Education assigned the middle Tennessee institution
to Murfreesboro.

Opening on September 11, 1911, with a two-year program for training teachers, Middle Tennessee State Normal School evolved into a four-year teachers' college in 1925 with the power of granting the [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. In 1943, the General Assembly designated the institution a state college. This new status marked a sharp departure from the founding purpose and opened the way for expanding curricular offerings and programs. In 1965, the institution was advanced to university status.

During the progressive movement from a two-year normal to a university, several significant milestones may be identified. In 1936, the [[Bachelor of Arts]] program was added. Responding to the expressed needs of the institution's service area, the Graduate School was established in 1951. To effect better communications and improve administrative supervision, the schools concept was introduced in 1962.

As Middle Tennessee State University developed and grew, the [[Doctor of Arts]] program was added in 1970 and the [[Specialist in Education]] in 1974. These two degree programs became attractive centerpieces for other efforts to improve and enhance institutional roles. Library resources were dramatically increased and sophisticated computer services were developed to aid instruction and administration. A highly trained faculty enabled the University to continue growth in program offerings. In 1991, the University's six schoolsâfive undergraduate and the graduate schoolâbecame colleges. In 1998, MTSU's [[Honors course|Honors Program]] became the Honors College, the first in the state. In 2002, approval was granted to redesignate three D.A. programs to Doctor of Philosophy programs, expanding the progressive institution's offerings.  Ph.D. degree offerings now include  Computational Sciences, Mathematics and Science Education (including concentrations in Biology Education, Chemistry Education, Mathematics Education, and Interdisciplinary Science Education), Molecular Biosciences, Economics, English, Human Performance, Public History, and Literacy Studies.

Since 1911, MTSU has graduated more than 100,000 students. Despite the University's growth from a campus of {{convert|100|acre|km2}}, 125 students, and a faculty of 19, to an academic city of over {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, more than 26,000 students, and a faculty of over 900, the institution is still essentially a &quot;people's university&quot; with a concern for the diverse needs of the area that it serves. In the 1980s and 1990s, the institution dedicated resources to become a leader in technology, both in the classroom and in many services to students. In 1986, [[James McGill Buchanan]] ('40) became the first MTSU alumnus to be
awarded the Nobel Prize. Buchanan received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his pioneering role in the development of the field of [[public choice]], a way of studying the behavior of politicians and bureaucrats.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mtsu.edu/rootpage_files/MTSU_DetailedHistory.pdf |title=The History of the University |work=mtsu.edu |accessdate=March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTSU is divided into eight colleges:
[[Image:MTSU James E Walker Library.JPG|right|230px|thumbnail|[[James E. Walker Library]]]]
*College of Basic and Applied Sciences
*College of Education and Behavioral Science
*College of Graduate Studies
*College of Liberal Arts
*College of Mass Communication
*Jennings A. Jones College of Business
*University College
*University Honors College

The College of Graduate Studies offers Master's degrees in nearly forty different areas, the Specialist in Education degree (Administration and Supervision, Curriculum and Instruction in Educational Leadership, Elementary School Education, and School Psychology), and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. MTSU's first Ph.D. was awarded in May 2003, though the university had awarded many Doctor of Arts (D.A.) degrees in the past.

Middle Tennessee State University employs approximately 900 full-time faculty members, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 22:1.

===Department of Recording Industry===
[[Image:MTSU Mass Comm.JPG|150px|thumb|left|The Mass Communications building at MTSU]]
The Department of Recording Industry (often called &quot;RIM&quot; for its former name &quot;Recording Industry Management&quot;) is a department in the College of Mass Communications and the university's most popular program. Due to the large number of students in the program, only a limited number of slots are opened for students to gain candidacy to take upper-division classes. The RIM program is divided into three concentrations: Music Business, Commercial Songwriting, and Production &amp; Technology. Music Business focuses on the marketing, management, and business aspects of the recording, touring, and publishing industries. The Production and Technology concentration focuses on recording, mixing, and mastering techniques, and specific technological trends of the industry. Commercial Songwriting is a blend of music business, songwriting, and music theory classes.

The department boasts five recording studios on campus, each open 24 hours a day.

The ''[[Rolling Stone]] College Guide'' recognized MTSU as having &quot;one of the preeminent music business programs in the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliscu2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Schools That Rock: The Rolling Stone College Guide |publisher=Wenner |location=New York |first=Jenny |last=Eliscu |year=2005 |isbn=1932958533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Aerospace===
The Department of Aerospace offers an aerospace major with five concentrations: professional pilot, administration, technology, flight dispatch, and maintenance management. Each concentration has been accredited by the Aviation Accreditation Board International, and the aerospace program has been accredited since 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtsuaero&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mtsu.edu/aerospace/ |title=MTSU Aerospace |work=MTSU.edu |accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Aerospace has a working agreement with the single-runway Murfreesboro Airport to provide many of its classes on-site. A decommissioned [[Boeing 727]] airliner (number N117FE, donated by [[FedEx]]) is housed at the airport as a teaching tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MTSU's 'classroom with wings' about to land |work=The Tennessean |first=Emily |last=Heffter |date=May 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though no longer considered air-worthy, its engines remain functional, and can be restarted for training purposes. [[American Airlines]] has also donated a 727 cockpit procedure trainer to MTSU, which allows students to receive their flight engineer rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtsusidelines.com/media/storage/paper202/news/2001/02/26/News/Aerospace.Updates.Boeing.727.Trainer-37040.shtml |title=Aerospace updates Boeing 727 trainer |work=Sidelines |first=Jason |last=Cox |date=February 26, 2001 |accessdate=October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the Business &amp; Aerospace Building near the center of campus. The aerospace program's training fleet is made up of [[Diamond DA40]] single-engine aircraft featuring [[glass cockpit]]s, with an assortment of other single- and multi-engine aircraft available.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtsuaero-planes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mtsu.edu/aerospace/airplanes.shtml |title=Airplanes |work=MTSU.edu |accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Department of Aerospace purchased ten radar simulators as well as a one-of-a-kind 360 degree control tower simulator to enhance training for its air traffic control students. These simulators allow students to experience life-like air traffic control scenarios that will aid in preparing them for training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref name=&quot;sidelines100710&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtsusidelines.com/news/mtsu-aerospace-program-lands-multi-million-dollar-contract-1.1497806 |title=MTSU aerospace program lands multi-million dollar contract |work=The Sidelines |first=Ryan |last=Glenn |date=July 10, 2010 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concrete Industry Management===
The Concrete Industry Management program is a four year bachelor of science degree offered through the Engineering Technology and Industrial Studies department in the College of Basic and Applied Sciences. CIM develops graduates that are broadly educated with technical knowledge in addition to a solid business background. Known for its close industry ties and very high job placement rates, CIM has become the fastest growing major on campus and boasts around 300 students. It was started in 1996 by industry professionals and companies to meet the demand for educated professionals in an expanding and changing industry. CIM at MTSU was the first of its kind in the country. Other CIM programs have since started at [[Arizona State University]] and [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]].

==Campus Information==
[[Image:Walnut Grove at MTSU.jpg|135px|thumb|right|Walnut Grove behind the site of the old library building at MTSU]]
The campus, set on 466 acres (1.9&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²), features 109 permanent buildings with 3.8 million square feet (353,000 mÂ²) of space. It is located one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the geographic center of Tennessee, and 1.3 miles (2&amp;nbsp;km) east of downtown Murfreesboro. The campus is mostly flat, much like the landscape of Murfreesboro.

The campus takes the general shape of a rectangle and automobile traffic is mostly confined to the campus perimeter. Its borders, however, are generally defined by four high-traffic Murfreesboro thoroughfares: Greenland Boulevard on the north, Middle Tennessee Boulevard on the west, Rutherford Boulevard on the east, and East Main Street on the south. Parking lots for students border these streets on the outer perimeter of campus.

MTSU has never been linked directly to [[Interstate 24]], though there are two main arteries from the interstate. One is via Exit 80, which connects to New Salem Highway, intersects with Middle Tennessee Boulevard, and eventually leads to campus.  The other is through Exit 81, which connects to Church Street, intersects with Rutherford Boulevard, and leads to the university's main entrance at MTSU Boulevard.

Middle Tennessee State University is a &quot;dry campus,&quot; meaning alcoholic beverages are prohibited at all times.
