'''K9Copy''' is a [[free software|free]], [[open source]] DVD backup and [[DVD authoring]] [[computer program|program]] for [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s such as [[GNU]]/[[Linux kernel|Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]. Licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]], K9Copy is [[free software]].

==Features==
K9Copy facilitates several methods for [[backup|backing up]] a [[DVD]] and uses [[libdvdcss]] to circumvent [[Content Scrambling System|CSS]] [[copy protection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxdotcom&quot;&gt;[http://www.linux.com/feature/144541]{{cite web

The software enables direct backup of a single layer DVD-5 provided the user's computer has a [[DVD recorder]]. Likewise, direct backup of a [[dual layer]] DVD-9 is possible with a dual layer DVD recorder.

K9Copy is able to fit the contents of a dual layer DVD-9 onto a single layer DVD-5. The interface allows a user to explicitly retain or discard any content from the original disc such as video titles, audio tracks, subtitles and the DVD menu. All content selected for backup is [[data compression|compressed]] to a configurable target [[file size|size]] (4400 [[megabyte|MB]] by default) and stored on the user's [[hard drive]] as either an [[ISO 9660|ISO]] [[disk image|image]] file or a DVD [[VIDEO TS]] folder. K9Copy can either transfer the backup data to blank [[DVDÂ±R]] media itself or utilize external DVD authoring software such as [[K3b]] for this task.&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxdotcom&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, an ISO image file produced by K9Copy can be recorded to DVD by any software on any [[Platform (computing)|platform]] capable of recording ISO images to disc.

Functionality for backing up a DVD to a video [[computer file|file]] (such as [[MPEG-4]]) rather than a disc also exists in K9Copy. The interface allows the user to select the preferred [[encoder]] (either [[mencoder|MEncoder]] or [[ffmpeg|FFmpeg]]) and [[codec]] for video and audio compression as well as a target file size or [[bit rate]] for the resulting file.

K9Copy includes basic DVD authoring capabilities.

==Development==
Development of K9Copy was stopped in 2011 with the author citing the fragmentation of Linux as a major issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://k9copy.sourceforge.net/web/index.php/en/nouveautes/12-theend That's it, it's the end!]&lt;/ref&gt;
