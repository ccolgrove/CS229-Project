'''Disney Channel Scandinavia''' is an edition of [[The Walt Disney Company]]-owned [[Disney Channel]] broadcasting to the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Baltic states]]. It is advertising-free and funded by subscription fees.

==History==
The Disney Channel was launched in [[February 28, 2003]], and was then exclusively available through the [[Viasat]] satellite platform (Sirius 4). Later that year, it became available in digital cable networks, such as Swedish [[Com Hem]].

In 2003, the channel also applied for a license to broadcast in the Swedish Digital Terrestrial Television network. They were among the channels recommended by the Swedish Radio and TV Authority, and the government granted the Disney Channel a broadcasting license on [[January 29, 2004]]. The terrestrial transmissions could start on February 15 via the [[Boxer TV Access]] platform. Soon after that, the channel celebrated its first anniversary by dropping encryption for one weekend.

On [[August 1, 2005]], the channel became available to subscribers of the [[Canal Digital]] (Thor 2) satellite platform. Simultaneously, a sister channel called [[Toon Disney Scandinavia|Toon Disney]] was launched. A third sister channel, [[Playhouse Disney Scandinavia|Playhouse Disney]], was launched on October 1, 2006.

In the autumn of 2009, the channel will start broadcasting its first original productions. Among these are a sitcom called ''[[NÃ¥r klokkerne ringer]]'' produced by the Danish productions company [[Nobody]] and the music competition ''[[My Camp Rock]]'' produced by [[Titan Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagensmedia.se/nyheter/article5402.ece|title=Disney Channel stÃ¤rker upp med lokalproduktioner|date=June 5, 2009|publisher=Dagens Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==

{{main|List of programs broadcast by Disney Channel}}

The channel is mainly aimed at children and their families, broadcasting Disney television series throughout the day. Disney feature films are also an important part in the mixture.

Most of the non-live-action content is dubbed into Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish with separate audio streams being available, but on [[Tele2Vision]] you can change the audio into ([[English language|English]]) if you don't want the dubbed version. In addition, subtitles are carried for [[Live action|live-action]] programmes like ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Phil of the Future]]'', ''[[Sam and Friends]]'' and ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', which aren't dubbed. In Sweden, only ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[JONAS]]'' and some episodes of ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]'' are dubbed. In Norway, the channel is criticised for its dubbing.

==Animated programs==
Around the launch, the channel originally only aired animated programs. A lot of them were not Disney Channel Original Series (As they are called in the US). The live-action, which aired in 2005 was [[Smart Guy]].

==Website==
The Disney Channel Scandinavia website has games just like the American one. In 2006 Disney Channel Scandinavia stopped having Halloween games on their website due to sharing with South Africa, the fact that they don't celebrate Halloween there. In 2007 Disney Channel in Scandinavia added video on their website, only Scandinavia can watch them as they are not available to other countries. DC Scandinavia will bring back Halloween-themed episodes and movies October 2011

==Availability==
The Disney Channel is available on satellite from [[Canal Digital]]/[[Thor 5]] and [[Viasat]]/[[Astra 4A]].

In Sweden, it became available through the DTT network via Multiplex 3 in February 2004. It is also available on the [[Faroe Islands]].
