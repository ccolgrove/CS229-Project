Welling played baseball and soccer, but his favorite sport is basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;teenmag.com&quot;/&gt; Welling is one of four children.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmonthly.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/TWelling/TWellingCheaper.html |title=Paul Fischer Interviews Tom Welling |publisher=Filmmonthly.com |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Mark Welling, is also an actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;TV Guide&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
Originally a construction worker, Welling was discovered in 1998 at a party in [[Nantucket]] by a catalog camera scout who suggested he try modeling.&lt;ref name=&quot;TV Guide&quot; /&gt; Welling modeled for Louisa Modeling Agency until 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;teenmag.com&quot;/&gt; when he relocated to Los Angeles. There he modeled for [[Tommy Hilfiger]], [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], and [[Calvin Klein]] while pursuing an acting career.&lt;ref name=&quot;TV Guide&quot; /&gt; Welling has stated that he did not like modeling and that he was not good at it because it was all on the outside or from an external point of view. He pursued acting because he wanted to express a range of emotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmonthly.com&quot;/&gt; In his first major acting role, Welling portrayed karate teacher Rob Meltzer, ''a.k.a'' &quot;Karate Rob&quot;, a younger love interest of [[Amy Brenneman]]'s character on the [[CBS]] series ''[[Judging Amy]]'', which aired in 2001. Welling was originally signed for three episodes; after receiving enthusiastic fan reviews, the producers kept him for three more.&lt;ref name=&quot;teenmag.com&quot;/&gt; Welling also had a small role in [[UPN]]'s ''[[Special Unit 2]]'', and he  appeared in the debut episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] sitcom ''[[Undeclared (TV show)|Undeclared]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;teenmag.com&quot;/&gt;

Welling was cast in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' after a nationwide search for an actor to play [[Clark Kent]]. In an interview with a teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role:  &quot;I was on my way back from the [[Warner Bros.]] studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;teenmag.com&quot;/&gt; The [[Pilot (Smallville)|pilot]] aired in October 2001, and became the highest-rated debut for [[the WB Television Network|The WB]], with 8.4 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271|title=The WB Orders More 'Smallville'|date=2001-10-24| publisher=tv.zap2it.com|accessdate=2006-10-19|unused_data=71462|1|,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welling told ''[[TV Guide]]'' that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like [[Christopher Reeve]], he was not a ''[[Superman]]'' fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read ''Superman'' comics: &quot;I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/cs/cheaperbythedozen/a/cbtdtw121003_2.htm |title=Tom Welling Interview&amp;nbsp;â Cheaper by the Dozen Movie and Smallville |publisher=Movies.about.com |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He did get the chance to meet two previous ''Superman''s: [[Christopher Reeve]], when the actor was invited on ''Smallville'' in the Season 2 episode &quot;[[Smallville (season 2)#Rosetta|Rosetta]]&quot;, and [[Dean Cain]] in the Season 7 episode Cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/twyearbook1.htm |title=Tom Welling Interview from SV Yearbook |publisher=KryptonSite |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welling was named one of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazineâs &quot;Breakthrough Stars of 2001&quot;, and also won the [[Teen Choice Award]] as &quot;Choice Breakout Star (Male)&quot; in 2002 for his role as Clark Kent.&lt;ref name=&quot;cw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Shows&amp;nbsp;â Smallville&amp;nbsp;â Cast&amp;nbsp;â Tom Welling|url=http://cwtv.com/shows/smallville/cast/tom-welling|work=The CW|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the third season, Welling was interviewed by [[Smallville Magazine]] and stated that if he could play one character on the show that was not Clark Kent, it would be the character of [[Lex Luthor]]; &quot;Lex Luthor! I wouldnât mind having my head shaved&amp;nbsp;â as an actor, [it is the ultimate,] getting to play the complete opposite of your character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermantv.net/smallville/Tom_Wellingmagazine.htm |title=Tom Welling Interview |publisher=Supermantv.net |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Welling was approached about starring in the big screen adaptation of Superman when director [[Brett Ratner]] was attached to project. Comic book artist [[Alex Ross]] even did two sketches of Welling as the &quot;[[Superman|Man of Steel]]&quot; to see what the actor would look like in the famous costume.&lt;ref name=&quot;superherohype.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Alex Ross Draws Tom Welling as Superman!|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/articles/85243-exclusive-alex-ross-draws-tom-welling-as-superman|publisher=Alex Ross Art|date=2004-04-16|accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Welling won another [[Teen Choice Award]] as &quot;Choice TV Actor (Action Adventure)&quot; for ''Smallville''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2009-08-10-teen-choice-winners_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Teen Choice Awards winners |publisher=USA Today |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie. I liked what he went through, what he had to go through, and I felt I understood where he was coming from. And I just wanted to be a part of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmonthly.com&quot;/&gt; Welling had always been a fan of [[Steve Martin]]'s and stated that he &quot;absolutely loved&quot; working with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmonthly.com&quot;/&gt; In 2005, Welling appeared as Nick Castle in ''[[The Fog (2005 film)|The Fog]]'', a remake of [[John Carpenter|John Carpenter's]] [[The Fog|1980 film of the same name]] and he reprised his role as Charlie Baker in ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen 2]]''.
