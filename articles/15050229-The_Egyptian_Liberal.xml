'''Islamic Modernism''' is a movement that has been described as &quot;the first Muslim ideological response&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;moaddel&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZNPY3nLPRS4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=islamic+modernism&amp;ots=2ofzBa6vm9&amp;sig=uvFNh124Ra96lB1_idFiDt2CvDI#PPA2,M1 Islamic modernism, nationalism, and fundamentalism By Mansoor Moaddel]&lt;/ref&gt; to the cultural challenges which attempts to reconcile [[Islam]]ic faith with modern values regarding [[nationalism]], [[democracy]], [[civil rights]], [[rationality]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and [[Social progress|progress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt;[''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'', Thompson Gale (2004) &lt;/ref&gt; It featured a &quot;critical reexamination of the classical conceptions and methods of jurisprudence&quot; and a new approach to Islamic theology and Quranic exegesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;moaddel&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==

Some trends in modern Islamic thought include:

* Restricting traditional Islamic law by limiting its basis to the [[Quran]] and authentic [[Sunnah]], limiting the Sunna with radical [[Hadith]] criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad 'Abduh, for example, said a Muslim was obliged to accept only mutawatir hadith, and was free to reject others about which he had doubts - Risalat al-Tawhid, 17th Printing, Cairo: Maktabat al-Qahira, 1379/1960, pp. 201-3; English translation by K. Cragg and I. Masa'ad, The Theology of Unity London: Allen and Unwin, 1966, pp. 155-56. Ahmad Amin, in his popular series on Islamic cultural history, cautiously suggested that there were few if any mutawatir hadith (especially, Fajr al-Islam, 10th edition Cairo: Maktabat al-Nahda al-Misriyya, 1965, p. 218; see also G. H. A. Juynboll, The Authenticity of the Tradition Literature: Discussions in Modern Egypt (Leiden: Brill, 1969), and my Faith of a Modern Muslim Intellectual, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; A few, such as [[Ghulam Ahmed Pervez]] in Pakistan, go further and treat only the Quran as absolutely binding.

* A more or less radical (re)interpretation of the authoritative sources. This is particularly the case with the Quranic texts on [[polygyny]], the [[hadd]] (penal) punishments, [[jihad]], and treatment of unbelievers, which conflict with &quot;modern&quot; views.&lt;ref&gt;See Quran 4:3 on polygyny, 5:38 on cutting off the hand of the thief, 24:2-5 on whipping for fornication (the provision for stoning for adultery is in the Hadith). On jihad and the treatment of unbelievers, the difficult passages for modernists are the so-called &quot;verses of the sword,&quot; such as 9:5 on the Arab pagans and 9:29 on the people of the Book â Shepard, W E, op cit, 1987, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

* An [[apologetic]] which links aspects of the Islamic tradition with Western ideas and practices, and claims Western practices in question were originally derived from Islam.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Modernist apologetic has however been severely criticized by many scholars as superficial, tendentious and even psychologically destructive, so much so that the term &quot;apologetics&quot; has almost become a term of abuse in the literature on modern Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Smith's criticism of Farid Wajdi in Islam in âModern Historyâ, pp. 139-59, and Gibb's complaint about &quot;the intellectual confusions and the paralyzing romanticism which cloud the minds of the modernists of today&quot; - âModern Trends in Islamâ, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947, pp. 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
In relation to the [[Islamic Caliphate]], some Modernists argue there was no glorious history as the first three [[Caliphs]] were assassinated. Furthermore, Spain, Africa and Persia were autonomous at different points in history resulting in there being no one [[Caliphate]] state, contradicting traditional historiography which relates the [[Umayyad]], [[Abbasid]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Caliphates as maintaining general political and territorial integrity with fragmentation and divisions being the exception.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Criticism of Modernism==
{{POV-section|date=December 2008}}

Criticism of Islamic modernism comes mainly from supporters of [[Islamism]] who argue modernist thought is little more than the fusion of Western Secularism with spiritual aspects of Islam.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Other critics have described the modernist positions on politics in Islam as ideological stances.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, E, âIslam and Ideology: Towards a Typologyâ, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 19, No. 3, Aug 1987, Cambridge University Press, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue politics is inherently embedded in Islam, a rejection of the secular principle, &quot;render unto Caesar what is Caesar's&quot;. They claim that there is a consensus in Muslim political jurisprudence, philosophy and practice with regard to the Caliphate form of government with a clear structure comprising a Caliph, assistants (muâawinoon), governors (wulaat), judges (qudaat) and administrators (mudeeroon).&lt;ref&gt;Nabhani, T, &quot;The Islamic Ruling System&quot;, al-Khilafah Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mawardi, &quot;Ahkaam al-Sultaniyyah&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that Muslim jurists have tended to work with the governments of their times. Notable examples are [[Abu Yusuf]], [[Mohammed Ibn al-Hasan]], [[Shafiâi]], [[Yahya bin Said]], [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazali]], [[Ismail bin Yasa]], [[Ibn Tulun]], [[Abu Zura]], [[Abu Hasan al-Mawardi]] and [[Tabari]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq, W, âThe Origins and Evolution of Islamic Lawâ, Cambridge University Press, 2005, pp.173-6, 182-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salahi, A, âPioneers of Islamic Scholarshipâ, The Islamic Foundation, 2006, pp. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent [[theologians]] would counsel the [[Caliph]] in discharging his Islamic duties, often on the request of the incumbent [[Caliph]]. Many rulers provided patronage to scholars across all disciplines, the most famous being the [[Abassids]] who funded extensive translation programmes and the building of libraries.
