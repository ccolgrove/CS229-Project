'''John Gilbert''' (July 10, 1897 &amp;ndash; January 9, 1936) was an American actor and a major star of the [[silent film]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', January 15, 1936, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as &quot;the great lover,&quot; he rivaled even [[Rudolph Valentino]] as a box office draw. Though he was often cited as one of the high profile examples of an actor who was unsuccessful in making the transition to [[talkies]], there was speculation that his decline as a star had to do with studio politics and money and not the sound of his screen voice.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, Kevin ''The Parade's Gone By'', Crown Publishers, Inc., New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life and career==
Born '''John Cecil Pringle''' in [[Logan, Utah]], to stock company actor parents, he struggled through a childhood of abuse and neglect before moving to [[Hollywood]] as a teenager. He first found work as an extra with the [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]] Studios, and soon became a favorite of [[Maurice Tourneur]], who also hired him to write and direct several pictures. He quickly rose through the ranks, building his reputation as an actor in such films as ''Heart o' the Hills'' with [[Mary Pickford]]. In 1921, Gilbert signed a three year contract with [[Fox Film Corporation]], where he was cast as a romantic [[leading man]]. Some of his films for Fox include ''Monte Cristo'', an adaptation of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''; ''St. Elmo'', an adaptation of a popular book of the period; ''[[The Wolf Man (1924 film)|''The Wolf Man'']]'', not a horror film, the story of a man who believes he murdered his fiancee's brother while drunk and many others. At the time, Gilbert did not sport his famous mustache, and this made his features more uneven and a little less handsome, and Fox plainly did not realize what huge potential he had. 

In 1924, he moved to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], where he became a full-fledged star with such high-profile films as ''[[His Hour]]'' directed by [[King Vidor]] and written by [[Elinor Glyn]]; ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'' (1924), co-starring [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] and [[Norma Shearer]], and directed by [[Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m]]; and ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' (1925) directed by [[Erich von Stroheim]] and co-starring [[Mae Murray]]. In 1925, Gilbert was once again directed by Vidor in the war epic ''[[The Big Parade]]'', which became the second highest grossing silent film. His performance in this film made him a major star. The following year, Vidor reunited Gilbert with two of his co-stars from that picture, [[RenÃ©e AdorÃ©e]] and [[Karl Dane]], for the film ''[[La BohÃ¨me]]'' which also starred [[Lillian Gish]].

Gilbert married the successful film actress [[Leatrice Joy]] in 1922. The union produced a daughter, Leatrice Gilbert Fountain, but the tempestuous marriage only lasted two years. The couple divorced in 1924, with Joy charging that Gilbert was a compulsive [[philanderer]].

In 1926, Gilbert made ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'', his first film with [[Greta Garbo]]. They soon began a very public relationship, much to the delight of their fans. Gilbert wanted to marry her, but Garbo continually balked. Legend has it that a wedding was finally planned but Garbo failed to appear at the ceremony. Recent Garbo biographers, however, have questioned the veracity of this story. Despite their rocky off-screen relationship, they continued to generate box-office revenue for the studio, and MGM paired them in two more silents ''[[Love (1927 film)|Love]]'' (1927), a modern adaptation of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', and ''[[A Woman of Affairs]]'' (1928). The former film was slyly advertised by MGM as &quot;Garbo and Gilbert in ''Love''.&quot;

==Career decline==
Throughout his time at MGM, Gilbert frequently clashed with studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] over creative, social and financial matters. It was said that at the apparent double wedding of Garbo and Gilbert and director [[King Vidor]] and actress [[Eleanor Boardman]], Mayer made a crude remark about Garbo to the distraught Gilbert, causing him to physically attack the mogul. This story has been disputed by some historians. Although one eye-witnessâthe bride, Eleanor Boardmanâclaimed to have seen the assault, others deny that it occurred. 

In any case, Mayer apparently detested Gilbert and was disgruntled that the actor had just signed an ironclad contract for six pictures at $250,000 each. It was suggested that Mayer deliberately gave Gilbert bad scripts and ineffective directors in an effort to void the contract.

With the coming of sound, Gilbert's vocal talents made a good first impression in the all-star musical comedy ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'', appearing in a [[Technicolor]] sequence with [[Norma Shearer]]. They played the &quot;balcony scene&quot; from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', first as written, and then repeating the scene in current slang. Reviewers for the film did not note any problems with Gilbert's voice at this time and, in fact, some praised it. 

Audiences awaited Gilbert's first romantic role on the talking screen. The vehicle was the [[Ruritanian]] romance ''[[His Glorious Night]]''. According to film reviews of the day, audiences laughed nervously at Gilbert's performance. The fault was not Gilbert's voice but the awkwardly scripted, overly ardent scenes of lovemaking; in one scene, Gilbert keeps kissing his leading lady ([[Catherine Dale Owen]]) while saying &quot;I love you&quot; over and over again. (This scene was famously parodied in the 1952 MGM musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', where a preview of the fictional ''The Dueling Cavalier'' flops disastrously). Director [[King Vidor]] stated that [[Rudolph Valentino]], Gilbert's main rival in the 1920s for romantic leads, probably would have suffered the same fate in the talkie era, had he lived. 

Gilbert became increasingly depressed by progressively inferior films and idle stretches between productions, but he resolved to thwart Louis B. Mayer's master plan and see the six-picture contract through. Gilbert's fortunes were temporarily restored by MGM's production chief [[Irving Thalberg]]. Thalberg gave Gilbert two projects that were character studies, giving Gilbert an excellent showcase for his versatility. ''The Phantom of Paris,'' originally intended for [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] who died from cancer in 1930, cast Gilbert as a debonair magician and showman who is falsely accused of murder, and uses his mastery of disguise to unmask the real killer. ''[[Downstairs (film)|Downstairs]]'' was based on Gilbert's original story, with the actor playing against type as a scheming, blackmailing chauffeur. The films were well received by critics and fans, but did not return him to the heights of stardom. Shortly after making ''Downstairs'', he married co-star [[Virginia Bruce]]; the couple divorced in 1934. Gilbert played out the contract with one last, unimportant &quot;B&quot; picture, and left the studio in 1933.

Greta Garbo insisted that John Gilbert must return to MGM, to play her leading man in ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]],'' directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]]. Garbo was top-billed, with Gilbert's name beneath the title. The picture also failed to revive his career. [[Columbia Pictures]] gave him a chance for a comeback in 1934; ''[[The Captain Hates the Sea]]'' featured a capable performance by Gilbert as a frustrated playwright, but offscreen the ensemble cast of heavy drinkers did nothing for Gilbert's discipline, and the film turned out to be his last.

==Personal life==
Gilbert was married four times (including once to film and stage actress [[Ina Claire]]), and had two daughters. His daughter Leatrice Gilbert Fountain (from his marriage to silent-film actress [[Leatrice Joy]]), wrote an acclaimed biography of her father's life published in 1985, and continues as a source of information on his life and career. His granddaughter, Lorin Hart, is a musician/folk singer in California.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Vogel ''Children of Hollywood: Accounts of Growing Up As the Sons and Daughters of Stars'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2005, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Death==
By 1934, [[alcoholism]] had severely damaged Gilbert's health; he died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] without ever regaining his former reputation. Toward the end of his life, Gilbert became involved with [[Marlene Dietrich]], and at the time of his death he was slated&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=119963 ''New York Times'' &quot;Desire&quot; review]&lt;/ref&gt; to star opposite her in the film ''[[Desire (1936 film)|Desire]]''. Gilbert's ashes were interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].

Gilbert has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1755 Vine Street and in 1994, he was honored with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of the United States|United States postage stamp]] designed by caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]].
