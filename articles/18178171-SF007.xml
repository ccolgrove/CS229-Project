{{lowercase|about URI scheme}}
'''about''' is an internal [[URI scheme]] (also known as a &quot;[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] scheme&quot; or, erroneously, &quot;[[protocol (computing)|protocol]]&quot;)  in various [[web browser]]s to display certain built-in functions.  It is not an officially registered scheme, and has no standard syntax.

In early versions of [[Netscape Navigator|Netscape]], any address beginning &lt;code&gt;about:&lt;/code&gt; which wasn't recognised as a built-in command would simply result in the text after the colon being displayed. Similarly, in early versions of [[Internet Explorer]], &lt;code&gt;about:&lt;/code&gt; followed by a string of [[HTML]] (e.g. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;about:&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;hello world&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) would render that string as though it were the source of the page - thus providing a similar (though more limited) facility to the [[data: URI scheme]] defined by RFC 2397. Still other versions of Netscape would return various phrases in response to an unknown &lt;code&gt;about&lt;/code&gt; address, including &quot;Whatchew talkin' 'bout, Willis?&quot; (a catch phrase from the TV show ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'') or &quot;Homey don't play dat!&quot; (from a recurring [[Sketch comedy|skit]] on the TV show ''[[In Living Color]]'').

The most commonly implemented &lt;tt&gt;about&lt;/tt&gt; URIs are &lt;code&gt;about:blank&lt;/code&gt;, which displays a blank HTML document, and simply &lt;code&gt;about:&lt;/code&gt;, which may display information about the browser. [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] uses URIs beginning with &lt;tt&gt;opera&lt;/tt&gt; for similar purposes, and many &lt;tt&gt;about&lt;/tt&gt; URIs will be translated into an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;opera&lt;/tt&gt; URI if entered; an exception is &lt;code&gt;about:blank&lt;/code&gt;, which is not translated.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''Note:''' In more recent versions of Internet Explorer, many of the following do not work or have been removed.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Standardisation==
In 2010, and onwards, there were efforts to standardise the about URI scheme, and define the processing requirements for some specific URIs{{ref|abouturischeme}}.  Note that Opera ASA, the proponents, had long used and advocated alternative browser specific URIs{{ref|http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/opera6/}}.  The about URIs that are known to be defined for specific purposes are listed below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Address
!Purpose
|-
!about:blank{{ref|abouturischeme}}
|Returns a blank HTML document with the media type text/html and character encoding UTF-8. This is widely used to load blank pages into browsing contexts, such as iframes within HTML, which may then be modified by scripts.
|-
!about:legacy-compat
|A reserved, though unresolvable address defined within [[HTML5]] intended for use in the DOCTYPE designed for compatibility with some legacy authoring tools, such as XSLT, which may not be capable of outputting the more common, shorter alternative that lacks both the PUBLIC and SYSTEM identifiers.  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM &quot;about:legacy-compat&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
!about:srcdoc
|A reserved, though unresolvable address defined within [[HTML5]] intended to be the address navigated to within iframes whose content comes from the srcdoc attribute

==Opera-specific about: addresses==
about is an alias for opera, therefore all these addresses also work with about prefixed. User [[JavaScript]] is disabled for all addresses in the about or opera URI schemes as a security feature. These pages can, however, be styled using local [[Cascading Style Sheets|stylesheets]].

None of these functions, except the about:blank combination, work in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of the Opera browser, the [[Nintendo DS Browser]].

==Internet Explorer-specific about: addresses==
Internet Explorer about addresses are configurable in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It is therefore possible that some of the listed addresses will not work on a particular computer. For example &quot;[[The Book of Mozilla|about:mozilla]]&quot; was removed in SP2 (although the page can still be found at &quot;res://mshtml.dll/about.moz&quot;). &lt;!-- To configure about addresses, open the Registry Editor and browse to: &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\AboutURLs&quot;. --&gt; These about addresses are sometimes used for spyware and adware, most notably in [[CoolWebSearch]], which made about:blank display advertisements.

==Netscape (historic)==
*Older versions of the [[Netscape]] browser have an &lt;tt&gt;about:people&lt;/tt&gt; URL that was similar to &lt;tt&gt;about:credits&lt;/tt&gt; above, but it would redirect to Netscape's active employee listing.  In addition, &lt;tt&gt;about:''username''&lt;/tt&gt;, where ''username'' is the username of a Netscape employee, would redirect to the Netscape homepage of the employee specified.  For example, &lt;tt&gt;about:jwz&lt;/tt&gt; would redirect to '''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://people.netscape.com/jwz/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' (not an active link) [http://www.yikes.com/netscape/people.html] [http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/blowme.html].
*Not all employee pages were accessible through this scheme.  Only developers who knew which file in the source tree and the encoding scheme used to obfuscate the directory of employee about entries could add their names.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}
*Many other about: easter eggs existed, including the famous about:mozilla, and other less known ones that showed pictures of the Netscape mascot Mozilla in various foreign garb, such as ''about:deutsch'' showing Mozilla in Lederhosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;benoit&quot;&gt;[http://www.rigaut.com/benoit/CERN/about/ The hidden features of Netscape Navigator ouuups Mozilla !]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some versions of Netscape would display the browser history for the &lt;tt&gt;about:global&lt;/tt&gt; address&lt;ref name=&quot;benoit&quot; /&gt;

==Internet Explorer for Mac OS 5 (historic)==
In the [[Internet Explorer for Mac]] 5 was an offline [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]], accessible by typing 'about:[[tasman (layout engine)|tasman]]', showing the [[Acid1]] test with the text replaced by the names of the developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/14448.html|title=Internet Explorer Easter Egg - IE5 Mac Team|publisher=The Easter Egg Archive |date=2000-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can somebody provide a screenshot of that and publish it also in the Acid1 article?--&gt;

==Safari==
Any &lt;code&gt;about&lt;/code&gt; URI is accepted, but only a page with a blank source is returned, as with the &lt;code&gt;about:blank&lt;/code&gt; of other browsers.

==Microsoft Outlook==
In [[Microsoft Outlook]], an additional &lt;code&gt;[[Outlook URI Scheme|outlook:today]]&lt;/code&gt; URI was added, which showed the Outlook Today Screen (it shows messages, tasks and appointments and is also accessible from IE). Also, although about:blank is supported, anything else (including about:about) typed after about: would show that text as a web page in the browser.

==External links==
