'''Shosei Koda''' ({{lang-ja|é¦ç° è¨¼ç, ''KÅda ShÅsei''}}; November 29, 1979 &amp;ndash; October 29, 2004) was a [[Japan]]ese citizen who was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] and later [[Decapitation|beheaded]] in [[Iraq]] on November 3, 2004 while [[tourism|touring]] the country. His parents were members of the [[United Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Death Not in Vain: Son of Japanese Christian Parents Kidnapped and Killed by Militants in Baghdad.&quot; ''[http://ncc-j.org/english/jcan/2004%20Fall-Winter.pdf Japan Christian Activity News Fall/Winter 2004]''. ([http://www.webcitation.org/5x0HHf9EV Archive]) National Christian Council in Japan. ISSN 0021-4353. Number 737 (Northern Hemisphere) Fall/Winter 2004. 6 (6/20). Retrieved on March 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Koda ignored advice not to travel to the country and entered Iraq on October 19, 2004 because he wanted to know what was happening there.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20041030034325/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-10/27/content_386218.htm Japanese hostage in Iraq believed to be civilian traveler].&quot; ''[[China Daily]]''.

Young people have their say]&quot; ''[[The Japan Times]]''. Friday, October 29, 2004. Retrieved on March 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captors demanded that Japan withdraw its forces from Iraq, but the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] refused. Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] firmly rejected that demand, saying he would not give in to terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Joel. &quot;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/30/iraq/main652421.shtml Report: Japanese Hostage Killed].&quot; ''[[CBS News]]''. October 29, 2004. Retrieved on March 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video of his murder, his three captors stand while Koda sits on the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Koda has his hands tied behind his back and is [[blindfold]]ed while a captor, behind him, reads a speech which lasts for two minutes and ten seconds. After that, the captors place him on the ground and hold him down as they begin to [[behead]] him. Throughout the beheading, the captors chant &quot;[[Takbir|AllÄhu Akbar]]&quot; ({{lang-en|&quot;God is great&quot;}}). The video ends with shots of Koda's blood-covered, severed head on top of his body and a few seconds of shots with the banner of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]].  His headless body was placed on top of a blood-soaked American flag.

Koda's body was found in [[Baghdad]] near [[Haifa Street]]. His death prompted mixed response in Japan, with most of the country angered and appalled by the murder, but some criticizing the victim and some blaming the government of Koizumi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simkin&quot;&gt;Simkin, Mark. &quot;[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1232527.htm Mixed reaction to Japanese beheading in Iraq].&quot; ''[[Lateline]]''. November 1, 2004. Retrieved on March 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

KÅda's given name&lt;!--A first name IS a given name--&gt; (ShÅsei) literally means &quot;proof of life&quot; in Japanese. Mark Simkin of ''[[Lateline]]'' said that this was an &quot;awful irony&quot; for people who had prayed for Koda's survival for four days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simkin&quot;/&gt;
