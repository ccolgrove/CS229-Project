==History==
In 1953, the Windward [[Community association|Community Association]] began a campaign for a hospital to be established in [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua, Oahu]], Hawaii. Dr. Robert Chung, a physician and Mrs. Carolyn Rankin, organizer of a womenâs auxiliary, were key leaders in the campaign. Ten acres of land were donated for a [[Construction|building site]], the community raised $170,000 to fund the project and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] donated $600,000. Although support was received from both the Governorâs Hospital Advisory Council and the 30th Territorial Legislature, [[the Board of Health]] refused to designate the area as a separate hospital zone. Their refusal prevented any [[federal funds]] from being available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our History&quot;&gt;[http://www.castlemed.com/history.htm Our History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two incidents emphasized the need for a local hospital. The first involved a collapsed roof that injured five men and forced them to travel to Honolulu to receive medical attention. The second involved a five-year-old girl who choked to death on a pill. Doctors agreed that had surgery facilities been closer, the child might have lived. Within months the State Board of Health gave their approval and access to federal funds became available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our History&quot;/&gt;

On January 16, 1963, Castle Memorial Hospital opened. It was named in honor of [[Harold Kainalu Long Castle]], who donated the land. The $2 million facility opened with 72 beds and 14 bassinets. In 1983, it became known as Castle Medical Center (CMC) due to the growth and success of the outpatient services and programs. CMC joined [[Adventist Health]] on January 28, 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our History&quot;/&gt;

In 1986, a decision was made to expand and a $8.7 million renovation was completed in 1989. This renovation expanded operating suites, equipment was updated and the kitchen, lobby, chapel and [[gift shop]] was enlarged. The stateâs first Labor-Delivery-Recovery-Post Partum rooms were also added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our History&quot;/&gt;
