'''Linux adoption''' refers to new use of the [[Linux]] computer [[operating system]] by homes, organizations, companies, and governments, while '''Linux migration''' refers to the change from using other operating systems to using Linux.

Many factors have resulted in increased use of Linux systems by traditional desktop users as well as operators of server systems, including desire for decreased operating system cost, increased security and support for open-source principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/|title = Why Linux is Better|accessdate = 2009-03-15|last = Cornet|first = Manu|authorlink = |year = undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several national governments have passed policies moving governmental computers to Linux from proprietary systems in the last few years.

In August 2010 Jeffrey Hammond, the principal analyst at [[Forrester Research]] pronounced: &quot;Linux has crossed the chasm to mainstream adoption.&quot; His declaration was based on the huge number of enterprises that had moved to Linux during the [[late-2000s recession]]. In a company survey completed in  the third quarter of 2009, 48% of companies surveyed reported using an open source operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerner12Aug10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3898206/LinuxCon-Analysts-Linux-Is-Winning.htm|title = LinuxCon Analysts: Linux Is Winning|accessdate = 12 August 2010|last = Kerner|first = Sean Michael|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In June 2010 a [[Quebec Superior Court]] Judge Denis Jacques ruled that the provincial government broke the law when it spent [[Canadian dollar|Cdn$]]720,000, starting in the fall of 2006 to migrate 800 government workstations to Microsoft Windows Vista and Office 2007 without carrying out a &quot;serious and documented search&quot; for alternatives. The search for alternatives was legally required for any expenditures over Cdn$25,000. The court case was brought by ''Savoir Faire Linux'', a small [[Montreal]]-based company that had hoped to bid Linux software to replace the government's aging Windows XP. The judge dismissed the government's contention that Microsoft software was chosen because employees were already familiar with Windows and that switching to a different operating system would have cost more.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC03Jun10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/06/03/quebec-microsoft-lawsuit.html|title = Quebec broke law in buying Microsoft software|accessdate = 3 June 2010|last = Nowak|first = Peter|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = June | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measuring desktop adoption====
Because Linux desktop distributions are not usually distributed by retail sale like other operating systems, there are no sales numbers that indicate the number of users. One downloaded file may be used to create many CDs and each CD may be used to install the operating system on multiple computers. On the other hand the file might be used only for a test and the installation erased soon after. Due to these factors estimates of current Linux desktop often rely on webpage hits by computers identifying themselves as running Linux. The use of these statistics has been criticized as unreliable and as underestimating Linux use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Ryan | last=Paul | coauthors= | title=Linux market share set to surpass Win 98, OS X still ahead of Vista | date=2007-09-03 | publisher=Ars Technica, LLC | url =http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070903-linux-marketshare-set-to-surpass-windows-98.html | work =Ars Technica | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxCounter2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://counter.li.org/estimates.php|title = Estimating the number of Linux users|accessdate = 2009-03-18|last = Linux Counter|authorlink = |year = 2005|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using webpage hits as a measure, until 2008 Linux accounted for only about 1% of desktop [[market share]], while [[Comparison of Microsoft Windows versions|Microsoft Windows operating systems]] held more than 90%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Galli | coauthors= | title=Vista Aiding Linux Desktop, Strategist Says | date=2007-08-08 | publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Inc. | url =http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Vista-Aiding-Linux-Desktop-Strategist-Says/ | work =eWEEK | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stan | last=Beer | coauthors= | title=Vista to play second fiddle to XP until 2009: Gartner | date=2007-01-23 | publisher=iTWire | url =http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/8842/53/ | work =iTWire | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=15&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=Y |title=Operating System Marketshare for Year 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-19 |date=2007-11-19 |work=Market Share |publisher=Net Applications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Vista slowly continues its growth; Linux more aggressive than Mac OS during the summer | date=2007-09-24 | publisher=AT Internet/XiTi.com | url =http://www.xitimonitor.com/en-us/internet-users-equipment/operating-systems-august-2007/index-1-2-7-107.html | work =XiTiMonitor | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php |title=Global Web Stats |accessdate=2007-11-19 |date=2007-11-10 |work=W3Counter |publisher=Awio Web Services LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-jun04.html |title=June 2004 Zeitgeist |accessdate=2007-11-19 |date=2004-08-12 |work=Google Press Center |publisher=Google Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This might have been because Linux was not seen at that time as a direct replacement for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-mag.com/id/4357 |title=Is 2008 the Year of the Linux Desktop? |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Brockmeier |first=Joe |date=2007-11-15 |work=Linux Magazine |publisher=QuarterPower Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''W3Counter'' webpage hits the Linux desktop market share increased 62% from 1.32% to 2.13% between mid 2007 and the beginning of 2009, while Windows use fell from 95.52% to 88.77% in the same period, a drop of 7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;W3CstatsJuly2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?date=2007-07-30|title = Global Web Stats|accessdate = 2009-03-13|last = W3Counter|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = July}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;W3CstatsFeb2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php|title = Global Web Stats|accessdate = 2009-03-13|last = W3Counter|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = February}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Linux Counter'' uses an alternate method of estimating adoption, asking users to register and then using a mathematical model to estimate the total number of desktop users. In March 2009 this method estimated 29 million Linux users.&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxCounter2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxCounter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://counter.li.org/|title = The Linux Counter|accessdate = 2009-03-18|last = Linux Counter|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 Aaron Seigo of [[KDE]] indicated that most web-page counter methods produce Linux adoption numbers that are far too low given the system's extensive penetration into non-North American markets, especially China. He stated that the North American-based web-measurement methods produce high Windows numbers and ignore the widespread use of Linux in other parts of the world. In estimating true worldwide desktop adoption and accounting for the Windows-distorted environment in the USA and Canada he indicated that at least 8% of the world desktops run Linux distributions and possibly as high as 10-12% and that the numbers are rising quickly. Other commentators have echoed this same belief, noting that competitors are expending a lot of effort to discredit Linux, which is incongruent with a tiny market share:&lt;ref name=&quot;Byfield04May09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3818696_2/Linux-Desktop-Market-Share-Greater-Than-One-Percent.htm|title = Linux Desktop Market Share: Greater Than One Percent?|accessdate = 2009-05-06|last = Byfield|first = Bruce|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schroder28May09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.linuxtoday.com/blog/2009/05/1-linux-microso.html|title = Tiny 1% Linux = Big Microsoft Terror|accessdate = 2009-05-30|last = Schroder|first = Carla|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I don't believe that the desktop Linux market share is barely 1%. I think it is a lot higher. I have no good data to share; I base my assessment on experience and knowing the industry. There is something else that is even more persuasive, and that is how Microsoft behaves. If Linux is so insignificant, why do they pay so much attention to it?|Carla Schroder, Linux Today&lt;ref name=&quot;Schroder28May09&quot; /&gt;}}

In May 2009 Preston Gralla, contributing editor to [[Computerworld|Computerworld.com]], in reacting to the Net Applications web hit numbers showing that Linux use was over 1%, said that &quot;Linux will never become an important desktop or notebook operating system&quot;. He reasoned that the upsurge in Linux desktop use recently seen was due to Linux netbooks, a trend he saw as already diminishing and which would be further eroded when [[Windows 7]] became available (and indeed, Linux netbooks did fall by the wayside, though whether they were solely responsible for the upsurge in Linux usage is open to question). He concluded: &quot;As a desktop operating system, Linux isn't important enough to think about. For servers, it's top-notch, but you likely won't use it on your desktop -- even though it did finally manage to crack the 1% barrier after 18 years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gralla18May09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=338839|title = Opinion: Why you shouldn't care about Linux on the desktop|accessdate = 2009-05-20|last = Gralla|first = Preston|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] indicated that Linux had a greater desktop market share than Mac, stating that in recent years Linux had &quot;certainly increased its share somewhat&quot;. Just under a third of all [[Dell]] netbook sales in 2009 had Linux installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin07Sep10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/09/debunking-the-1-myth.html|title = Debunking the 1% Myth|accessdate = 14 September 2010|last = Martin|first = Caitlyn|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caitlyn Martin, researching retail market numbers in the summer of 2010 also concluded that the traditional numbers mentioned for Linux desktop adoption were far too low:

{{quote|It seems like almost every day someone in the tech press or someone commenting in a technical forum will claim that Linux adoption on the desktop (including laptops) is insignificant. The number that is thrown around is 1%. These claims are even repeated by some who advocate for Linux adoption. Both the idea that Linux market share on the desktop is insignificant and the 1% figure are simply false and have been for many years...Where does the 1% number come from? There are two sources: very old data and web counters. The problem with using web counters to try and ascertain market share is that they generally only include websites that have paid to be counted. That pretty much guarantees that Windows will be overcounted.|Caitlyn Martin&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin07Sep10&quot; /&gt;}}

====Reasons for adoption====
Reasons to change from other operating systems to Linux include better system stability, better [[Linux malware|malware]] protection, low or no cost, that most distributions come complete with application software and hardware drivers, simplified updates for all installed software, free software licencing, availability of application repositories and access to the [[source code]]. Linux desktop distributions also offer multiple desktop workspaces, greater customization, free and unlimited support through forums, and an operating system that doesn't slow down over time. Environmental reasons are also cited, as Linux operating systems usually do not come in boxes and other retail packaging, but are downloaded via the Internet. The lower system specifications also mean that older hardware can be kept in use instead of being recycled or discarded. Linux distributions also get security vulnerabilities patched much more quickly than non-free operating systems and improvements in Linux have been occurring at a faster rate than those in Windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Siu28Jul06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/the-linux-desktop-myth/|title = The Linux Desktop Myth|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = Siu|first = A.Y.|authorlink = |year = 2006|month = July}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallen03Sep08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://resources.zdnet.co.uk/articles/features/0,1000002000,39483863-1,00.htm|title = Ten key differences between Linux and Windows|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = Wallen|first = Jack.|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallen17Aug08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=256|title = Why would anyone choose Windows over Linux?|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = Wallen|first = Jack.|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investments have been made to improve desktop Linux usability since 2007. A report in [[The Economist]] in December 2007 said: &quot;Linux has swiftly become popular in small businesses and the home. Thatâs largely the doing of Gutsy Gibbon, the code-name for the Ubuntu 7.10 from Canonical. Along with distributions such as Linspire, Mint, Xandros, OpenSUSE and gOS, Ubuntu (and its siblings Kubuntu, Edubuntu and Xubuntu) has smoothed most of Linuxâs geeky edges while polishing it for the desktop. No question, Gutsy Gibbon is the sleekest, best integrated and most user-friendly Linux distribution yet. Itâs now simpler to set up and configure than Windows.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10410912|title = Technology in 2008|accessdate = 2008-04-01 (publicly available December 2007-May 2009, rendered members only in May 2009, quoted at http://web.ncf.ca/fn352/ubuntu.html#Economist)|last = The Economist|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian bulk computer purchaser the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT) started recommending only Linux in June 2008. Following testing they stated: &quot;ELCOT has been using SUSE Linux and Ubuntu Linux operating systems on desktop and laptop computers numbering over 2,000 during the past two years and found them far superior as compared to other operating systems, notably the Microsoft Operating System.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KingmanJune2008&quot; /&gt;

In many developing nations, such as [[China]], where, due to widespread [[software piracy]], [[Microsoft Windows]] can be easily obtained for free, Linux distributions are gaining a high level of adoption. In these countries there is essentially no cost barrier to obtaining proprietary operating systems, but users are adopting Linux based on its merit, rather than on price.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson17Jun09&quot; /&gt;

In January 2001, [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Bill Gates]] explained the attraction of adopting Linux in an internal memo that was released in the ''Comes vs Microsoft'' case. He said:

{{quote|Our most potent Operating System competitor is Linux and the phenomena around Open Source and free software. The same phenomena fuels [sic] competitors to all of our products. The ease of picking up Linux to learn it or to modify some piece of it is very attractive. The academic community, start up companies, foreign governments and many other constituencies are putting their best work into Linux.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroklawComesVsMSExhibit08256&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/8000/PX08256.pdf|title = Comes vs Microsoft E-mail Exhibit|accessdate = 2009-06-29|last = Gates|first = Bill|authorlink = |year = 2001|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Barriers to adoption====
The greatest barrier to Linux desktop adoption is probably that few desktop PCs come with it from the factory. A.Y. Siu asserted in 2006 that most people use Windows simply because most PCs come with Windows pre-installed; they didn't choose it. Linux has much lower market penetration because in most cases users have to install it themselves, a task that is beyond the capabilities of many PC users: &quot;Most users wonât even use Windows restore CDs, let alone install Windows from scratch. Why would they install an unfamiliar operating system on their computers?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Siu28Jul06&quot; /&gt;

[[TechRepublic]] writer Jack Wallen expands on this barrier, saying in August 2008:&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallen17Aug08&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|Why would anyone choose Windows over Linux?...In my seriously biased opinion, I think this question is answered with a simple conspiracy theory: Microsoft is doing everything it can to keep the public blind to Linux. Think about it? Remember the whole Wintel conspiracy where MS and Intel played off of each other to continue their strangle-hold monopoly in the PC industry? That era played a huge part in the blinding of consumers. Top that with the business practices MS forces upon big box shops to insure ''[sic]'' their operating system is sold on nearly every PC sold and you can see that conspiracy is more of a reality than one might think.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallen17Aug08&quot; /&gt; }}

In an [[openSUSE]] survey conducted in 2007, 69.5% of respondents said they [[dual boot]]ed a [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system in addition to a Linux operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/6/6c/Opensuse_survey_102_data_final.pdf |title=openSUSE 10.2 Survey Results |accessdate=2007-11-19 |date=2007-05-04 |format=PDF |work=openSUSE |publisher=openSUSE }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2007 Bill Whyman, an analyst at Precursor Advisors, noted that &quot;there still isn't a compelling alternative to the [[Microsoft]] infrastructure on the desktop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert A. | last=Guth | coauthors= | title=Linux Starts to Find Home on Desktops | date=2007-03-13 | publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. | url =http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB117374336173334742-lMyQjAxMDE3NzEzMzcxNDMzWj.html | work =The Wall Street Journal Online | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Application support, the quality of peripheral support, and end user support were at one time seen as the biggest obstacles to desktop Linux adoption. According to a 2006 survey by The [[Linux Foundation]], these factors were seen as a &quot;major obstacle&quot; for 56%, 49%, and 33% of respondents respectively at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1462899608;fp;4194304;fpid;1 |title=Living (and dying) with Linux in the workplace |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Machlis |first=Sharon |date=2007-03-22 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG Communications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=420 |title=Five crucial things the Linux community doesnât understand about the average computer user |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Kingsley-Hughes |first=Adrian |date=2007-05-21 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS6087894103.html |title=Why Windows wins and Linux loses |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Vaughan-Nichols |first= Steven J. |date=2007-01-03 |work=DesktopLinux.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACM&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Desktop Linux: Where Art Thou?|journal=ACM Queue|month=May | year=2004|first=Bart|last=Decrem|coauthors=|volume=2|issue=3|pages=48â56|doi= 10.1145/1005062.1005067|url=http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=155|format=|accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS9755856281.html |title=Who are the Linux desktop users? |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Vaughan-Nichols |first= Steven J. |date=2007-05-06 |work=DesktopLinux.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Dell to use Ubuntu on Linux PCs | date=2007-05-01 | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6610901.stm | work =BBC News | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Antone | last=Gonsalves | coauthors= | title=Study: Lack Of App Support Stunting Linux | date=2005-12-01 | publisher=CMP Media LLC | url =http://www.techweb.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174403447 | work =TechWeb | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dell Ubuntu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn |title=Ubuntu |accessdate=2007-11-19 |work=Dell Home &amp; Home Office |publisher=Dell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSDL 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux-foundation.org/images/a/a9/2006survey-analysis.pdf |title=2006 Desktop Linux Client Survey: Analysis |accessdate=2007-11-19 |year=2006 |format=PDF |work=OSDL Desktop Linux Working Group |publisher=Linux Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Application support=====
&lt;!--{{See also|Virtual machine}}--&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rellink boilerplate seealso&quot;&gt;See also: [[Virtual machine]] (allows most Windows software to run &quot;on top of&quot; Linux)&lt;/div&gt;

The November 2006 ''Desktop Linux Client Survey'' identified the foremost barrier for deploying Linux desktops was that users were accustomed to Windows applications which had not been ported to Linux and which they &quot;just can't live without&quot;. These included [[Microsoft Office]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Autodesk]] [[AutoCAD]], [[Microsoft Project]], [[Visio]] and [[Intuit]] [[QuickBooks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OSDL 2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Steven J. | last=Vaughan-Nichols | coauthors= | title=Where are the American Linux desktop users? | date=2007-10-23 | publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc. | url =http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS2619861157.html | work =DesktopLinux.com | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a DesktopLinux.com survey conducted in 2007, 72% of respondents said they used ways to run Windows applications on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=archive&amp;id=0813200712407 |title=2007 Desktop Linux Market survey |accessdate=2007-12-11 |date=2007-08-21 |work=DesktopLinux.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

51% of respondents to the 2006 Linux Foundation survey believed that cross-distribution Linux desktop standards should be the top priority for the Linux desktop community, highlighting the fact that the fragmented Linux market is preventing application vendors from developing, distributing and supporting the operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSDL 2006&quot; /&gt; In May 2008, [[Gartner]] predicted that &quot;version control and incompatibilities will continue to plague open-source OSs and associated middleware&quot; in the 2013 timeframe.&lt;ref name=&quot;'ZDNet Gartner'&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2216 |title=Gartner report forecasts bad news, good news for open source |accessdate=2008-04-07 |last=Rooney |first=Paula |date=2008-04-01 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008 the design of Linux applications and the porting of Windows and Apple applications had progressed to the point where it was difficult to find an application that did not have an equivalent for Linux, providing adequate or better capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alternatives&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://linuxappfinder.com/alternatives|title = Windows and OS X Software Alternatives|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = Linux App Finder |authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TuxSoftware&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tuxsoftware.com/home/|title = Linux Software Search|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = TuxSoftware.com|authorlink = |year = undated |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822001523/http://www.tuxsoftware.com/home/ |archivedate = August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of application progress can be seen comparing the main productivity suite for Linux, [[OpenOffice.org]], to [[Microsoft Office]]. With the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 in October 2008 [[Ars Technica]] assessed the two:&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul13Oct08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/openoffice-org-3-0-officially-released.ars|title = OpenOffice.org 3.0 officially released|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = Paul|first = Ryan|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Although OpenOffice.org has not yet reached full parity with Microsoft Office, it is maturing at a rapid pace and is already capable of meeting the basic needs of many average computer users. It is an ideal choice for schools and is an increasingly viable choice for small businesses and home users that don't rely on the more advanced capabilities of Microsoft's office suite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul13Oct08&quot; /&gt;  }}

=====Peripheral support=====
In the past the availability and quality of open source [[device driver]]s were issues for Linux desktops. Particular areas which were lacking drivers included printers as well as wireless and audio cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSDL 2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSDL 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux-foundation.org/images/3/3b/DTL_Survey_Report_Nov2005.pdf |title=2005 Desktop Linux Client Survey Report |accessdate=2007-11-19 |year=2005 |format=PDF |work=OSDL Desktop Linux Working Group |publisher=Linux Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in early 2007, [[Dell]] did not sell specific hardware and software with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 7.04 computers, including printers, projectors, [[Bluetooth]] keyboards and mice, [[TV tuner card|TV tuners]] and [[remote control]]s, desktop [[modem]]s and [[Blu-ray disc]] drives, due to incompatibilities at that time, as well as legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&amp;dl=false&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;docid=33C0764C597FC6CCE040A68F5B2872A3&amp;doclang=en |title=Hardware and Software Not Sold on Dell Ubuntu 7.04 Computers |accessdate=2007-11-19 |date=2007-07-26 |work=Dell USA |publisher=Dell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008 most Linux hardware support and driver issues had been adequately addressed. In September 2008 Jack Wallen's assessment was:

{{quote|Years ago, if you wanted to install Linux on a machine you had to make sure you hand-picked each piece of hardware or your installation would not work 100 percent...This is not so much the case now. You can grab a PC (or laptop) and most likely get one or more Linux distributions to install and work nearly 100 percent. But there are still some exceptions; for instance, hibernate/suspend remains a problem with many laptops, although it has come a long way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallen03Sep08&quot; /&gt; }}

=====End-user support=====
Some critics have stated that compared to Windows, Linux is lacking in end-user support. Linux has traditionally been seen as requiring much more technical expertise.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ Mossberg&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Walter S. | last=Mossberg | coauthors= | title=Linux's Free System Is Now Easier to Use, But Not for Everyone | date=2007-09-13 | publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. | url =http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118963540721725614-FnJzx_wcNlkRFOef4cgq74PBW3g_20080912.html?mod=rss_personal_technology | work =The Wall Street Journal Online | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/software/190900617 |title=A Linux OS For All |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Ohlhorst |first=Frank J. |date=2006-07-21 |work=CRN |publisher= CMP Media LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dell]]'s website describes open source software as requiring intermediate or advanced knowledge to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dell Ubuntu&quot; /&gt; In September 2007, the founder of the Ubuntu project, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented that &quot;it would be reasonable to say that this is not ready for the mass market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ Mossberg&quot; /&gt;

In October 2004 [[Chief technical officer|Chief Technical Officer]] of Adeptiva Linux, Stephan February, noted at that time that Linux was a very technical software product, and few people outside the technical community were able to support consumers. Windows users are able to rely on friends and  family for help, but Linux users generally use discussion boards, which can be uncomfortable for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Geoffrey P. | last=Ramos | coauthors= | title=Linux not ready for mass market | date=2004-10-29 | publisher=IDG | url =http://www.techworld.com/opsys/news/index.cfm?NewsID=2510 | work =Techworld | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=424 |title=Three more things that the Linux community doesnât get |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Kingsley-Hughes |first=Adrian |date=2007-05-23 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Dominic Humphries summarized the difference in user tech support:&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm|title = Linux is Not Windows|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = Humphries|first = Dominic|authorlink = |year = 2005|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Windows users are more or less in a customer-supplier relationship: They pay for software, for warranties, for support, and so on. They expect software to have a certain level of usability. They are therefore used to having rights with their software: They have paid for technical support and have every right to demand that they receive it. They are also used to dealing with entities rather than people: Their contracts are with a company, not with a person.

Linux users are in more of a community. They don't have to buy the software, they don't have to pay for technical support. They download software for free &amp; use Instant Messaging and web-based forums to get help. They deal with people, not corporations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphries&quot; /&gt; }}

More recently critics have found that the Linux user support model, using community-based forum support, has greatly improved. In 2008 Jack Wallen stated:&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallen03Sep08&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|With Linux, you have the support of a huge community via forums, online search, and plenty of dedicated websites. And of course, if you feel the need, you can purchase support contracts from some of the bigger Linux companies (Red Hat and Novell, for instance).

However, when you use the peer support inherent in Linux, you do take a chance with time. You could have an issue with something, send out email to a mailing list or post on a forum, and within 10 minutes be flooded with suggestions. Or these suggestions could take hours or days to come in. It seems all up to chance sometimes.

Yet generally speaking, most problems with Linux have been encountered and documented, so the chances are good you'll find your solution fairly quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallen03Sep08&quot; /&gt; }}

In addressing the question of user support, Manu Cornet said:

{{quote|One of the great assets of the Open Source community (and Linux in particular), is that it's a real community. Users and developers really are out there, on web forums, on mailing lists, on IRC channels, helping out new users. They're all happy to see more and more people switch to Linux, and they're happy to help them get a grip on their new system...you'll find literally thousands of places where nice people will answer you and walk you out of your problem most of the time&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornet&quot; /&gt; }}

=====Other factors=====
Linux's credibility has also been under attack at times, but as Ron Miller of LinuxPlanet points out:&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxPlanet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/5401/1/ |title=Linux Criticism Revs Up |accessdate=2007-11-19 |last=Miller |first=Ron |date=2004-05-20 |work=LinuxPlanet |publisher=Jupitermedia Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...the fact that Linux is being criticized is probably a good thing.

First of all, it shows that Linux is making headway in the enterprise and beginning to have an impact on competitors and they are reacting to that. Secondly, it's healthy to take a long look at any solution and analyze its strengths and weaknesses and the economic ramifications of one choice over another.

Ultimately, consumers and decision makers need to look carefully at the data including the sources of the data and the criticism and decide if Linux is the right decision, but as more people choose Linux and it finds its place in the market, it is bound to wear a target. That's simply the price you pay for success in the marketplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxPlanet&quot; /&gt;   }}

Sterling Ball, CEO of [[Ernie Ball]], the world's leading maker of premium guitar strings and a 2003 Linux adopter, said of total cost of ownership arguments: &quot;I think that's propaganda...What about the cost of dealing with a virus?

In the [[SCO-Linux controversies]], the [[SCO Group]] had alleged that [[UNIX]] source code donated by IBM was illegally incorporated into Linux. The threat that SCO might be able to legally assert ownership of Linux initially caused some potential Linux adopters to delay that move. The court cases bankrupted SCO in 2007 after it lost its four-year court battle over the ownership of the UNIX copyrights. SCO's case had hinged on showing that Linux included intellectual property that had been misappropriated from UNIX, but the case failed when the court discovered that [[Novell]] and not SCO was the rightful owner of the copyrights. During the legal process, it was revealed that SCO's claims about Linux were fraudulent and that SCO's internal source code audits had showed no evidence of infringement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxPlanet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul12Jan09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/01/sco-aims-to-reorganize-fight-on-with-corporate-garage-sale.ars|title = SCO aims to reorganize, fight on with corporate garage sale|accessdate = 2009-03-19|last = Paul|first = Ryan|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Army does not agree that Linux is a security problem. Brigadier General Nick Justice, the Deputy Program Officer for the Army's Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications Tactical (PEO C3T), said in April 2007:&lt;ref name=&quot;DoD&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|Our job is to provide accurate and timely information to the soldier in the field so they can perform their mission. Open source software is part of the integrated network fabric which connects and enables our command and control system to work effectively, as people's lives depend on it.

===Supercomputers===
Linux is the most popular operating system among [[supercomputer]]s due to its superior performance, flexibility, speed  and lower costs. In November 2008 Linux held an 87.8 percent share of the world's top 500 supercomputers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.top500.org/stats/list/34/osfam Operating system Family share for 11/2009 | TOP500 Supercomputing Sites&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Top500_OS.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CW23Nov09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.computerworld.com/linux_it_doesnt_get_any_faster|title = Linux: It doesn't get any faster|accessdate = 2009-06-24|last = Vaughn-Nichols|first = Steven J.|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PT13Jun08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://practical-tech.com/infrastructure/linux-computer-smashes-petaflop-supercomputer-barrier/ |title = Linux Computer Smashes Petaflop Supercomputer Barrier|accessdate = 2009-10-15|last = Practical Technology|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;InTech01Sep03&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=InTech&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=29241 |title = Linux elbows into super-computer turf |accessdate = 2009-10-15|last = Strothman |first = Jim |authorlink = |year = 2003|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2010 the operating systems used on the world's top 500 supercomputers were:&lt;ref name=&quot;CW23Nov09&quot; /&gt;

In January 2010 Weiwu Hu, chief architect of the [[Loongson]] family of CPUs at the Institute of Computing Technology, which is part of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], confirmed that the new Dawning 6000 supercomputer will use Chinese-made Loongson processors and will run Linux as its operating system. The most recent supercomputer the organization built, the Dawning 5000a, which was first run in 2008, utilized AMD chips and ran [[Windows HPC Server 2008]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mims19Jan10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/24374/?a=f|title = China Details Homemade Supercomputer Plans|accessdate = 2010-01-20|last = Mims|first = Christopher|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devices===

Linux is often used in various single- or multi-purpose [[computer appliance]]s and [[embedded systems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4936596231.html The Linux Devices Showcase&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance the [[Palm webOS]], [[Palm, Inc.]]'s flagship [[mobile operating system]] runs on the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of webOS |url=http://developer.palm.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1761&amp;Itemid=42 |work= |publisher=[[Palm, Inc.]] |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
Many organizations advocate for Linux adoption. The foremost of these is the [[Linux Foundation]] which hosts and sponsors the key kernel developers, manages the Linux trademark, manages the Open Source Developer Travel Fund, provides legal aid to open source developers and companies through the Linux Legal Defense Fund, sponsors kernel.org and also hosts the Patent Commons Project.

The [[International Free and Open Source Software Foundation]] (iFOSSF) is a nonprofit organization based in [[Michigan]], USA dedicated to accelerating and promoting the adoption of FOSS worldwide through research and civil society partnership networks.

The [[Open Invention Network]] was formed to protect vendors and customers from patent royalty fees while using [[Open-source software|OSS]].

Other advocates for Linux include:

*[[IBM]] through its Linux Marketing Strategy
*[[Linux User Group]]s
*[[Asian Open Source Centre]] (AsiaOSC)
*[[Brazil|The Brazilian government]], under president [[Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A lei Ã© digitalizar|url=http://www.softwarelivre.gov.br|publisher=softwarelivre.gov.br|accessdate=2008-03-23}} {{Language icon|pt|Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
