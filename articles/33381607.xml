==Background==

On May 30, 2011, a leader in the [[2011 Spanish protests|Spanish Indignants movement]], inspired by the [[Arab Spring]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Frayer19052011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;From Europe to the US, protesters are inspired by Arab spring&quot;/&gt; made a call for [[15 October 2011 global protests|a worldwide protest on October 15]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Democracia Real Ya prepara una convocatoria mundial para el 15 de octubre&quot;/&gt; In mid-2011, the Canadian-based group [[Adbusters Media Foundation]], best known for its advertisement-free [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] magazine ''[[Adbusters]]'', proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, address a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent [[global financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Fleming|first=Andrew|title=Adbusters sparks Wall Street protest Vancouver-based activists behind street actions in the U.S|url=http://www.vancourier.com/Adbusters+sparks+Wall+Street+protest/5466332/story.html|publisher=The Vancouver Courier|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the senior editor of the magazine, &quot;[they] basically floated the idea in mid-July into our [email list] and it was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world, it just kind of snowballed from there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming&quot;/&gt; One of the inspirations for the movement was the [[Democracy Village]] set up in 2010, outside the [[British Parliament]] in [[London]].

In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%.  Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%.

==Aims==
Initially, journalists such as Shannon Bond for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' had said it was hard to discern a unified aim for the movement, though by later October Adbusters had been trying to &quot;rally it around a single, clear demand&quot; for a [[Robin Hood tax]], with a global march in support of the tax planned for October 29.&lt;ref name = &quot;Obamasupports&quot; &gt;{{cite news

[[Naomi Wolf]] has argued that the impression created by much of the media that the protestors do not have clear demands is false. Wolf argues they do have clear demands including a desire to end what they see as the corrupting effect of money on politics.

According to [[Bloomberg Businessweek]], protesters want more and better jobs, more equal distribution of income, bank reform, and a reduction of the influence of corporations on politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/occupy-wall-street-its-not-a-hippie-thing-10272011.html Occupy Wall Street: Itâs Not a Hippie Thing] By Roger Lowenstein, [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] October 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In late November 2011, the aims of US protestors were incorporated into a fuller list which includes eleven &quot;demands&quot;: 1) campaign finance reform, 2) media democratization: &quot;that media companies be owned and managed by their staff,&quot; 3) the creation of &quot;citizen boards&quot; to influence corporate regulation and deter [[regulatory capture]], 4) &quot;[[expropriation]] of the health insurance industry,&quot; 5) &quot;immediate review&quot; of the [[constitutionality]] of the [[Patriot Act]], 6) immediate student loan reform and &quot;gradual implementation of a publicly funded...education system,&quot; 7) &quot;restoration of the [[social safety net]],&quot; 8) &quot;an end to imperialistic wars&quot; 9) &quot;employee ownership plans&quot; be required of private corporations, 10) investigation of crimes of the existing financial industry and replacement of that industry by &quot;publicly owned, worked-managed&quot; institutions, and 11) a truly democratic &quot;economy and political system that works for the 99%.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristjanson-Gural|first=David|title=I Am the Spokesperson for #OWS: These Are Our Demands|url=http://www.laprogressive.com/progressive-issues/occupy-demands/|work=LA Progressive|publisher=Dick Price and Sharon Kyle|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in late November, the London contingent of the Occupy movement released their first statement on Corporations, where they called for measures to end [[Tax evasion]] by wealthy firms. The reason for the delay in articulating a clear demand was given as the time it takes to reach a consensus with the sometimes slow processes of ''participatory democracy''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:OccupyHandSignals.pdf|thumb|asamblea hand signals]]

A November article published in the [[Financial Times]] argued that a lack of unified aims is still preventing the movement having much influence on the political mainstream, with recent events at the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit]] suggesting the banks will succeed in forestalling the implementation of a &quot;Robin Hood&quot; style transaction tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The director of the Human Rights Coalition (Australia) believes the Occupy Movement must have a simple and ethical objective that can achieve mass support or it will fail. Namely the introduction of Swiss style [[direct democracy]] ([[Initiative|citizen initiated referenda]]) to ensure governments are more democratically accountable. He believes the world needs more democracy to counteract fiscal irresponsibility, not socialism or fascism.&lt;ref name = &quot;HRCA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Adbusters have been encouraging protesters to use [[tactical frivolity]] by improvising theatrics, pranks and &quot;subversive performances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobinHood&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
The movement has been compared to the [[Situationist International|Situationists]] and the [[Protests of 1968]], although according to Adbusters co-founder [[Kalle Lasn]], this time the &quot;stakes are much higher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Indeed, the movement has gone further to create a diverse, multi-media culture of art production and distribution, which is being archived and gathered by institutions such as the [[National Museum of American History]] and [[New York Historical Society]]. The purpose of much of the art produced is to visually impact the mainstream through imagery to create solidarity and unity among the 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Activists have used web technologies and social media like [[IRC]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Meetup]] to coordinate the events.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn7102011&quot;/&gt; [[Indymedia]] have been helping the movement with communications, saying there have been conference calls on [[Skype]] with participants from up to 80 locations. Interactive [[live streams]] of events by [[independent journalists]] such as [[Tim Pool]] have been used to augment [[Mainstream media]] coverage. The progressive provider [[May First/People Link]] offered cost-free memberships for dozens of groups, including in Iran and Germany, to host websites, emails, and email lists securely.

The movement has been described as having an &quot;overriding commitment&quot; to [[Participatory democracy]]. &lt;ref name = &quot;NYtimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Much of the movement's democratic process occurs in &quot;working groups,&quot; where any protestor is able to have their say. Important decisions are often taken at &quot;General assemblies&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;asamblea&quot;, the [[Spanish]] word for assembly, is a common term often used instead of &quot;general assembly&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, which can themselves be informed by the findings of multiple working groups. General assemblies take place at most Occupy sites every evening at 7PM. Decisions are made using the [[consensus]] model of direct democracy, waving hands in various simple signals and operating with discussion facilitators rather than leaders, a system that may have originated in the [[Quaker]] movement several centuries ago. &lt;ref name=&quot;byConcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Penny |first=Laura |title=Protest By Consensus |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2011/10/spain-movement-square-world |accessdate=11 November 2011 |newspaper=New Statesman |date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the assemblies, working group proposals are made to meeting participants, who comment upon them using a process called a &quot;stack,&quot; a queue of speakers that anyone can join. In New York, Occupy Wall Street uses what is called a [[progressive stack]], in which people from [[marginalized groups]] are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, with [[facilitator]]s, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to &quot;step forward, or step back&quot; based on which group they belong to, meaning that women and minorities get to go to the front of the line, while white males must often wait for a turn to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Seltzer |first=Sarah |title=Where Are the Women at Occupy Wall Street? |url=http://www.truth-out.org/where-are-women-occupy-wall-street/1319895284|accessdate=11 November 2011 |newspaper=The Nation |date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;byConcensus&quot;/&gt; The progressive stack concept has been criticized by some outside of the movement as &quot;forced equality&quot; and &quot;unfair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hinkle |first=A.

==Chronology of events==
{{see also|Timeline of Occupy Wall Street}}

The [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests began in [[New York City]] on September 17, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jake Zamansky |url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ejff45lg/september-17-2011 |title=Occupy Wal Street |date=September 17, 2011 |author=Jake Zamansky |publisher=Forbes |date=2011-09-17 |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2011, activists in cities in over 25 countries made calls for [[15 October 2011 global protests|global protests on 15 October]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn7102011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;15october&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;takethesquare&quot;/&gt; A list of events for October 15 included 951  cities in 82  countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;afp&quot;/&gt; On October 15 events were held in many cities worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;bangkokpost&quot;/&gt;

=== Weeks 1 - 4 (September 17 â October 14) ===
On September 17, 1,000 protesters marched through the streets, with an estimated 100 to 200 staying overnight in cardboard boxes. By September 19, seven people had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marcinek |first=Laura |title=Wall Street Areas Blocked as Police Arrest Seven in Protest |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-19/wall-street-areas-blocked-as-police-arrest-seven-in-protest.html |accessdate=19 September 2011 |newspaper=Bloomsberg Businessweek |date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Anthony Bologna}}
At least 80 arrests were made on September 24, after protesters started marching uptown and forcing the closure of several streets. Most of the 80 arrests were for blocking traffic, though some were also charged with [[disorderly conduct]] and resisting arrest. Police officers have also been using a technique called [[kettling]] which involves using orange nets to isolate protesters into smaller groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moynihan|first=Colin|title=80 Arrested as Financial District Protest Moves North |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/80-arrested-as-financial-district-protest-moves-north/ |accessdate=24 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Videos which showed several penned-in female demonstrators being hit with [[pepper spray]] by a police official were widely disseminated, sparking controversy. That police official, later identified as [[Inspector#United States|Deputy Inspector]] Anthony Bologna, was shown in other videos hitting a photographer with a burst of spray.

[[File:Wallst14occupy.jpg|right|thumb|Protesters rallying near New York police headquarters, [[St. Andrew's Church (New York City)|St. Andrew's Church]] in the background.]]

Initially Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] and a representative for Bologna defended his actions, while decrying the disclosure of his personal information. After growing public furor, Kelly announced that [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] and the Civilian Complaint Review Board were opening investigations, again criticizing Anonymous for &quot;[trying] to intimidate, putting the names of children, where children go to school,&quot; and adding that this tactic was &quot;totally inappropriate, despicable.&quot; Meanwhile, Manhattan [[District Attorney]] [[Cyrus Vance, Jr.]] started his own inquiry.

Public attention to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern that was to be repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police. [[Clyde Haberman]], writing in [[The New York Times]], said that &quot;If the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever choose to recognize a person who gave their cause its biggest boost, they may want to pay tribute to Anthony Bologna,&quot; calling the event &quot;vital&quot; for the still nascent movement. &quot;After Ron Kuby, an attorney for one of the protesters, demanded Mr. Bolognaâs arrest, [Bologna] was instead docked 10 vacation days and given a [...] reassignment to Staten Island, where he lives,&quot; according to an account by blogger Daniel Edward Rosen.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Daniel Edward, [http://www.observer.com/2011/11/is-ray-kellys-nypd-spinning-out-of-control/?show=all &quot;Is Ray Kellyâs NYPD Spinning Out of Control?&quot;], ''The [New York] Observer'', 11/01/2011 6:39pm. 2011-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2011, protesters set out to march across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that more than 700 arrests were made. The police used ten buses to carry protesters off the bridge. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across.  Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, âThe cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway.â However, some statements by protesters supported descriptions of the event given by police: for example, one protester Tweeted that &quot;The police didn't lead us on to the bridge. They were backing the fuck up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/02/occupy-wall-street-nypd-tactics |title=Occupy Wall Street protest: NYPD accused of heavy-handed tactics |last=Pilkington|first=Ed|publisher=Guardian.co.uk |year=2011 |date=Oct. 2 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the [[New York Police Department]], Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;700arrest&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=700 Arrested After Wall Street Protest on N.Y.'s Brooklyn Bridge |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/01/500-arrested-after-wall-street-protest-on-nys-brooklyn-bridge/?test=latestnews |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |date=October 1, 2011 |publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2, all but 20 of the arrestees had been released with citations for disorderly conduct and a criminal court summons. On October 4, a group of protesters who were arrested on the bridge filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging that officers had violated their constitutional rights by luring them into a trap and then arresting them; Mayor Bloomberg, commenting previously on the incident, had said that &quot;[t]he police did exactly what they were supposed to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Bridge Lawsuit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Citing Police Trap, Protesters File Suit |author=ELIZABETH A.

On October 5, joined by union members, students, and the unemployed, the demonstration swelled to the largest yet with an estimated 15,000 marchers joining the protest. Smaller protests continue in cities and on college campuses across the country.

Thousands of union workers joined protesters marching through the Financial District. The march was mostly peacefulâuntil after nightfall, when scuffles erupted. About 200 protesters tried to storm barricades blocking them from Wall Street and the Stock Exchange. Police responded with pepper spray and penned the protesters in with orange netting.

Inspired by Occupy Wall Street, British protesters organized an [[OccupyLSX|occupation of the London Stock Exchange]] to bring attention to what they saw as unethical behavior on the part of banks. One of the organizers of the protest said the protests are focused against &quot;increasing social and economic injustice in this country.&quot; In his opinion, &quot;the Government has made sure to maintain the status quo and let the people who caused this crisis get off scot-free, whilst conversely ensuring that the people of this country pay the price, in particular those most vulnerable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian protests london&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sydney morning herald protests london&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;metro attracts facebook&quot;/&gt;

=== Week 5 - 7 (October 15 â November 4) ===
On October 15, tens of thousands of demonstrators staged rallies in 900 cities around the world, including Auckland, Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo, SÃ£o Paulo, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, and many other cities. In Frankfurt, 5,000 people protested at the European Central Bank and in Zurich, Switzerland's financial hub, protesters carried banners reading &quot;We won't bail you out yet again&quot; and &quot;We are the 99 percent.&quot; Protests were largely peaceful, however a protest in Rome that drew thousands turned violent when &quot;a few thousand thugs from all over Italy, and possibly from all over Europe&quot; caused extensive damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/10/15/501364/main20120893.shtml |title=&quot;Occupy&quot; protests go global, turn violent |publisher=CBS News |date=October 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of Occupy Wall Street protesters gathered in [[Times Square]] in New York City and rallied for several hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChicagoSun-Times-WallStreet&quot;&gt;Hawley, Chris (October 16, 2011.)

A street march that afternoon protesting the closure culminated in a confrontation between police and protesters, who sought to re-establish the Ogawa Plaza encampment. During this confrontation, protester Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a tear-gas projectile or smoke canister fired by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gabbatt |first=Adam |title=Scott Olsen injuries prompt review as Occupy Oakland protests continue |publisher=The Guardian |location=United Kingdom |date=2011-10-26 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/26/scott-olsen-occupy-oakland-review |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bender1&quot;/&gt;

By 29 October 2011, there were about 2300 occupied zones around 2000 cities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Occupy Auckland' protest speaks with many voices |author=Chris Barton |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10762353 |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=October 29, 2011 |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, protesters in [[Oakland, California]] shut down the [[Port of Oakland]], the fifth busiest port in the nation.  Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city, however a member of the Occupy movement was quoted by the BBC as estimating as many as 30,000 may have taken part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15568057 |title=BBC News - US Occupy protesters clash with police at Oakland port |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Week 9 - 11 (November 5 â November 25) ===
On November 5th, [[Frankfurt]] took the day of the [[Guy Fawkes Night]] as occasion for an extra loud and long demonstration, and [[Occupy Portland]] made its &quot;Move Your $&quot; campaign. November 11 was another international protest day.

On November 11, [[Remembrance Day]] in Canada, police forcibly removed tents from Victoria Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia and arrested 15 protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arrests as Halifax Cops Evict Occupy protesters|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20111111/occupy-halifax-protesters-evicted-111111/|work=CTV News|publisher=Canadian Television Network|accessdate=20 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the night of 14 November, a coordinated crackdown was undertaken by authorities around the world, with several camps being forcibly cleared. Examples of such camps include Zuccotti Park in New York, Oakland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAW VIDEO: Chopper footage of 100,000+ Occupy Oakland Takes back Highway|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4jYdCaHrjQ|work=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=3 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Occupy Auckland' protest speaks with many voices |author=Chris Barton |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/occupy-police-clear-park-ca-action-14946478#.TsEnKmCo7H8|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denver and Zurich. For some of the other camps such as the one at St Pauls in London, no physical action was taken, but on 15 November authorities stepped up legal action to gain authorization for a forcible eviction. 
Protesters from around the world and commentators such as former ''Financial Times'' editor [[Richard Lambert]] have suggested that the shift to confrontational tactics by authorities is more likely to spur on  the movement rather than cause it to disband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

John Gapper, chief business commentator at the ''FT'', offers a different view. Gapper says even some protestors admit it may be a good thing that camps are being closed down, as they were beginning to alienate even members of the public who were initially fully sympathetic with the movement. Gapper says some of the key intellectual action in the movement is now taking place not in the camps but in the ''Alternative Banking Group'', which was set up by the diplomat [[Carne Ross]] and the rocket scientist Cathy O'Neil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In [[Scotland]] camps have been organised around the financial district of [[St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh]] since 15 October. 

St. Andrews Square is the home of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] headquarters in the [[Dundas House]] mansion. [[Edinburgh City Council]] has officially backed the [[Occupy Edinburgh]] Movement and all Occupy movements worldwide. 

Protesters from [[Occupy Glasgow]] had set up in the civic [[George Square]] on 15 October but moved to [[Kelvingrove Park]] where the council would provide running water, toilets and safety fences after the council obtained a court order.

At least 80 arrests were made on September 24, after protesters started marching uptown and forcing the closure of several streets. Most of the 80 arrests were for blocking traffic, though some were also charged with [[disorderly conduct]] and resisting arrest. Police officers have also been using a technique called [[kettling]] which involves using orange nets to isolate protesters into smaller groups.&lt;ref name=crackdown/&gt;&lt;ref name=times2/&gt;

On October 1, 2011, protesters in New York City set out to march across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that more than 700 arrests were made. The police used ten buses to carry protesters off the bridge. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across.  Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, &quot;The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway.&quot;

On October 25, 2011 during the [[Occupy Oakland]] protests, following multiple violation notices from city officials, police officers in [[riot gear]] from various [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] law enforcement agencies cleared both camp sites during the early hours of the day. Police fired [[tear gas]] canisters at the protestors, allegedly in response to objects being thrown at them.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Protest organizers said that many of the troublemakers were not part of the Occupy movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Egypt]]ian protesters from [[Tahrir Square]] have lent their support of the movement.  A message of solidarity issued by a collective of Cairo-based protesters declared:  &quot;As the interests of government increasingly cater to the interests and comforts of private, transnational capital, our cities and homes have become progressively more abstract and violent places, subject to the casual ravages of the next economic development or urban renewal scheme.  An entire generation across the globe has grown up realizing, rationally and emotionally, that we have no future in the current order of things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArabSpring&quot;/&gt;

It is too soon to gauge the full global impact of this fledgling and multifaceted social movement.

The increased public focus on the growing income gap between economic elites and the middle class and on the importance of the rights of ordinary workers brought about by the Occupy Movement gave a significant boost to organized labor's campaign to repeal anti-[[labor union]] law passed in the State of Ohio known as [[Ohio Senate Bill 5]] (SB5).
