According to legal documents, Kurtz did not protect her rights and interests. Instead, he took action that was for his own interest, at the cost of hers. The lawsuit came about when Aguilera discovered Kurtz used more of her [[Commission (remuneration)|commissionable]] income than he was allotted, and had paid other managers to assist him. She also petitioned the California State Labor Commission to nullify the contract. She revealed while recording her then upcoming album, &quot;I was being overworked.

Describing Aguilera's [[voice]], singing teachers Phyllis Fulford and Michael Mailler said, &quot;The low register is light and tired, the [[Belt (music)|belting register]] is ample and full, but very scratchy because she screams; and [[head voice]] as well as [[whistle register]] are light, pure and bright.

People say she can cover four octaves, but it's not true because below A3, the low notes are forced, unsupported, her belting voice is throaty and forced, for her highest notes she doesn't use head voice but [[falsetto]] or [[whistle register]], they are disconnected registers.

=== Themes and musical style ===
                                                                                                                      
[[File:Dirrty.jpg|left|thumb|Aguilera performing in her Back to Basics Tour in 2006.]]
The constant theme in Aguilera's music and lyrics is love, although she has written on other subjects including spirituality, [[Feminism|female empowerment]], and grief. Aguilera has also written about her childhood in two of her records which dealt with domestic abuse. In an interview Aguilera admitted she feels responsible to reveal her most vulnerable feelings and to share the darker sides of her life adding &quot;People that can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='Basic' Instinct |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002985896 |work=Billboard |date=August 13, 2006 |accessdate=January 3, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been noted to constantly changing her sound in her music and lyrical content. Originally marketed as a bubblegum pop singer during the late 90s pop scene, she quickly departed into a broad range of musical genres for her follow-up album ''Stripped''. A review states, &quot;Clearly afflicted with Premature Serious Artist Syndrome, Aguilera wants to demonstrate the range of her interests â vampy soul, [[Traditional heavy metal|quasi-metal]], piano-bar intimacy, [[Quiet storm|quiet-storm R&amp;B]], bounce-bounce [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and semi-exotic rock, all of it dutifully accomplished.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stripped&quot;/&gt;

The majority of the songs are characterized by Aguilera's loud vocals, though she has used breathy and soft vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Luvy BBC News August 14, 2006 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/4g25/ Christina Aguilera â Back to Basics] BBC Online Pop/Chart Music Review Retrieved on December 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her 2006 release, ''Back to Basics'' included producer [[DJ Premier]].

One of Aguilera's major influences and idol is blues singer [[Etta James]], whose classic song &quot;[[At Last]]&quot; has been covered by Aguilera throughout her career.
