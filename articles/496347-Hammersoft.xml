The '''University of Bridgeport''' is a private, independent, non-sectarian, coeducational university&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews&quot; /&gt; located on the [[Long Island Sound]] in the South End neighborhood of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]]. The University is fully [[Accredited]] by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC-CIHE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ Roster of Institutions - New England Association of Schools and Colleges: Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (CIHE)]&lt;/ref&gt; The University is known for its diverse student population, currently ranking as the eleventh most racially diverse national university in the country by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-campus-ethnic-diversity Best Colleges: Racial Diversity: National Universities] â US News &amp; World Report&lt;/ref&gt;

The University School, a high school, is also on the University's grounds. 

The university had financial troubles in the 1990s and was the subject of controversy when the trustees were obligated to enter into serious negotiations with and subsequently gave control of the institution to the [[Professors World Peace Academy]] (PWPA), an affiliate of the [[Unification Church]], a [[new religious movement]] founded by [[Sun Myung Moon]] in [[Seoul, South Korea]] in 1954, in order to save it from closure.&lt;ref name=&quot;judson&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =Making the Hard Choice at Bridgeport U.: Opting to Stay Alive | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B5 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date = April 17, 1992 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/17/nyregion/making-the-hard-choice-at-bridgeport-u-opting-to-stay-alive.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
===Founding===
The school was founded in 1927 as the '''Junior College of Connecticut''', under a charter by the state legislature. In 1947 it became the University of Bridgeport, when it gained state authority to grant baccalaureate degrees. The university acquired Arnold College, formerly of Milford, Connecticut, in 1953.

===Expansion and decline===
The University grew rapidly in the 1960s by capitalizing on the increased number of people seeking to attend a U.S. college resulting from the [[baby boom]], [[Vietnam War]] veterans eligible for a higher education under the [[G.I. Bill]], and international students who wanted to attend college in the United States. Enrollment peaked at 9100 students in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, Robert ''Illustrated History of Bridgeport'' NY: Wislow Publishing, 1992, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment declined in the 1970s and 1980s after the waves of baby boom and Vietnam era veterans eligible for the G.I. Bill declined. By 1990, the University had cut tuition, room and board fees to $18,000 per year, but the school's reputation had not improved. More than a third of the 50 campus buildings were empty. To cut costs, the university decided to terminate 50 tenured faculty, and asked the other faculty to accept a 30% wage cut.&lt;ref&gt;Davey, Robert âMoon Over Bridgeportâ ''Connecticut Magazine'' (July, 1994), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the University decided to eliminate its liberal arts college, alienating many students.&lt;ref name=&quot;eliminate&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =University To Eliminate Liberal Arts | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B1 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =November 27, 1991 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/27/nyregion/university-to-eliminate-liberal-arts.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eliminate&quot;/&gt; This led to the longest faculty [[strike action|strike]] in the history of American higher education. Dr. Greenwood, the president at the time, quit abruptly, and around 1,000 students left the school, contributing to the cash crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;nearsaccord&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =Bridgeport U.

===PWPA and Sun Myung Moon===
In 1990, discussion began about affiliating or possibly merging the University with either the [[University of New Haven]] or [[Sacred Heart University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;merger&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =[[Associated Press]] | title =Merger of New Haven U. and Bridgeport Proposed | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =63, Section: 1 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =December 8, 1991 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/nyregion/merger-of-new-haven-u-and-bridgeport-proposed.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The University was approached by the [[Professors World Peace Academy]] (PWPA), an affiliate of the [[Unification Church]], but their offer to bail out the University was spurned by the trustees who said the school was &quot;not going to have anything to do with the offer&quot; and were concerned that such an affiliation would damage the University's reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;judson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eliminate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcquiston&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =McQuiston | first =John | title =U. of Bridgeport Refuses Aid From Moon's Group | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B1 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date = October 22, 1991 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/nyregion/u-of-bridgeport-refuses-aid-from-moon-s-group.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems continued to plague the University; enrollment fell to 1,300 in 1991. Debt rose to over $22 million in 1991â92. Serious plans to merge the University with Sacred Heart fell through in 1992; the law school instead wanted to associate with [[Quinnipiac University]], but Sacred Heart maintained that any takeover would have to include the law school.&lt;ref name=&quot;planstakeover&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =University of Bridgeport Plans Takeover by Sacred Heart | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B4 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date = January 17, 1992 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/17/nyregion/university-of-bridgeport-plans-takeover-by-sacred-heart.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other universities willing to take over the school, but were unwilling to take on its debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;judson&quot; /&gt; The University's charter required the trustees to enter into &quot;serious negotiations&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;judson&quot; /&gt; and they accepted the offer, giving the PWPA sixteen spots as trustees, constituting a majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;approvestransfer&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =Bar Group Approves Transfer Of U. of Bridgeport Law School | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B7 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =August 13, 1992 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/13/nyregion/bar-group-approves-transfer-of-u-of-bridgeport-law-school.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PWPA invested $50.5 million in the university on May 30, 1992,&lt;ref name=&quot;closesdeal&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =The New York Times staff | title =Bridgeport U.

A two year faculty strike, started in the midst of the University's financial troubles, intensified when the trustees gave control to the PWPA. Eventually, sixty-six professors and librarians agreed to a &quot;divorce&quot; with the University in return for compensation of up to a year's salary. In a similar move, the law school decided to cut ties with the University,&lt;ref name=&quot;approvestransfer&quot; /&gt; separating from it. In order for the law school to remain open it had to merge with a financially-sound university. The law school faculty and students voted to merge with Quinnipiac University and the name was officially changed to the [[Quinnipiac University School of Law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;approvestransfer&quot; /&gt;

After the PWPA assumed control of the University, the trustees retained the president at the time, Dr. Edwin G. Eigel, Jr. (1932â2008). Eigel served as president till 1995. He was succeeded by distinguished professor and former PWPA president Dr. [[Richard L. Rubenstein]], who served from 1995â1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1bpt.bridgeport.edu/~rlr/CVNOT2003-June.htm Richard Rubenstein: A Brief Biographical Note]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Albert Salonen]], a member of the Unification Church, was the Chairman of the University's Board of Trustees when he was chosen to serve as ninth University president in 1999. He had earlier managed several Unification Church related organizations, and had served as President of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] from 1973 to 1980, and as Chairman of the [[List of Unification Church affiliated organizations|International Cultural Foundation]], prior to becoming the chief executive of the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theamericanchiropractor.com/articledetail.asp?articleid=437&amp;category=21 Featuring Neil Albert Salonen] in ''The American Chiropractor'', July 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Bridgeport received funding from the PWPA from 1992 until 2002. In 1995 the University awarded an honorary degree to Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60616FA3D550C7B8CDDA00894DD494D81 U. of Bridgeport Honors Rev. Moon, Fiscal Savior], ''[[New York Times]]'', September 8, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2003 the University has been financially independent from PWPA. Members of the Unification Church hold other administrative positions at the University besides the presidency: the University's Board of Trustees includes Gordon L. Anderson and has included [[Chung Hwan Kwak]].  The PWPA considers University of Bridgeport one of its affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pwpa.org/main/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==

==Campus safety==
The University, in the South End of Bridgeport, has had numerous instances where students' safety and security have been threatened. This is true on campus, but especially in surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridgeport.edu&quot;&gt;[Crime Report, https://www.bridgeport.edu/pages/4255.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; To ameliorate this, the University instituted a program whereby students were issued portable alarm units that pinpoint their position and enable campus security to get to them in under two minutes, earning the school the Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;yardley&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Yardley | first =William | title =Does It Work?
