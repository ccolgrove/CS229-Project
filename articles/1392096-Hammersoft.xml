'''Bad faith''' ([[Latin]]: '''''mala fides''''') is double mindedness or double heartedness in [[duplicity]], [[fraud]], or [[deception]].&lt;ref name=WD1913&gt;''&quot;of two hearts... a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another; bad faith&quot;'', Webster's Dictionary, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[intentionality|intentional]] deceit of others, or [[self deception|''self'' deception]].

The expression âbad faithâ is associated with âdouble heartednessâ,&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; which is also translated as âdouble mindednessâ.&lt;ref name=J1.8W/&gt;&lt;ref name=J3:16JFBBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=P119:113/&gt; A bad faith belief may be formed through self deception, being double minded, or &quot;of two minds&quot;, which is associated with faith, belief, [[attitude]], and [[loyalty]]. In the 1913 ''Websterâs Dictionary'', bad faith was equated with being double hearted, &quot;of two hearts&quot;, or âa sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by anotherâ.&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; The concept is similar to [[perfidy]], or being &quot;without faith&quot;, in which deception is achieved when one side in a conflict promises to act in good faith (e.g. by raising a flag of surrender) with the intention of breaking that promise once the enemy has exposed himself. After [[Jean Paul Sartre]]âs analysis of the concepts of self deception and bad faith, bad faith has been examined in specialized fields as it pertains to self deception as two semi-independently acting minds within one mind, with one deceiving the other.

Some examples of bad faith include: a scientist who holds metaphysical beliefs which are not consistent with the findings of science, but puts forth his belief system as though they were;&lt;ref&gt;''Should Creationism be Taught in the Public Schools?'', Robert T. Pennock, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; a company representative who negotiates with union workers while having no intent of compromising;&lt;ref name=&quot;BFN&quot;&gt;&quot;Bad Faith Negotiation,&quot; Union Voice, [http://unitas.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/bad-faith-negotiation/].&lt;/ref&gt; a person who edits an online encyclopedia to be consistent with their point of view rather than verifiable facts; a prosecutor who argues a legal position that he knows to be false;&lt;ref name=HPBF/&gt; an insurer who uses language and reasoning which are deliberately misleading in order to deny a claim.&lt;ref name=HPBF /&gt;

Bad faith may be viewed in some cases to not involve deception, as in some kinds of [[hypochondria]] with actual physical manifestations. There is a question about the truth or falsity of statements made in bad faith self deception; for example, if hypochondriac makes a complaint about their psychological health, is it true or false?&lt;ref name=PMREN/&gt; 

Bad faith has been used as a term of art in diverse areas involving [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;'The Look' as Bad Faith&quot;'', ''Philosophy Today'' 36, 3 (1992), , Debra B.

== General use ==
In ordinary usage, bad faith is equated with being of &quot;of two hearts&quot;, or âa sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by anotherâ,&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; and is synonymous with double mindedness, with disloyalty, double dealing, hypocrisy, infidelity, breach of contract, unfaithfulness, pharisaicism (emphasizing or observing the letter but not the spirit of the law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic Your Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Doctrine of absurdity]]), tartuffery (a show or expression of feelings or beliefs one does not actually hold or possess,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GHCX9Z0p2-gC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=tartuffery+definition+%22A+show+or+expression+of+feelings+or+beliefs+one+does+not+actually+hold+or+possess%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YFV2ZBMao5&amp;sig=l68xAwYCzlfayr8c-Yn--SgRtTw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wlVcTeLjNYG-sQPJnOn7AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Roget's II: the new thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt; affectation, bigotry, and lip service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/bad+faith Thesaurus.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==
Various commentators and translators have discussed being of two [[beliefs]] or [[faiths]] in being double hearted or double minded.&lt;ref name=J1.8W/&gt;&lt;ref name=J3:16JFBBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=P119:113/&gt; ''Webster's Dictionary'' equates bad faith with &quot;being of two hearts&quot;.&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; &quot;Double hearted&quot; is translated also as &quot;double minded&quot;, or âof two heartsâ or &quot;of two minds&quot; or souls, two beliefs, [[attitude|two attitudes]], [[loyalty|two loyalties]], [[mind|two thinkings]], [[belief|two beliefs]], or being as [[Soul (spirit)|two souls]] at the same time. It was originally used as a [[pejorative]] in the Christian Bible. In Psalms 119:113, one translation is ''âI hate double-minded men, but I love your lawâ''.&lt;ref name=P119:113&gt;[http://bible.cc/psalms/119-113.htm Psalms 119:113]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is related to self-deception, where one Biblical translation is that a person &quot;perpetually [[self deception|disagrees with ''himself'']]&quot;.&lt;ref name=J1.8W&gt;[http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm James 3:16, Wesley's notes]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Taking the Lord's name in vain&quot;, bad faith justifies actions known to be wrong by claiming a direction from God or religious authority to take unethical positions or untrue beliefs, when a person ''should'' know otherwise&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Religion and Morality,&quot; Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/].&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[hypocrisy]].&lt;ref name=J3:16JFBBC&gt;[http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm James 3:16, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with divided loyalty, when translated as ''âI hate those with divided loyalties, but I love your instructions.â''&lt;ref name=P119.113&gt;[http://bible.cc/psalms/119-113.htm Psalms 119:113, New Living Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] does not consider everyone with heretical views to have bad faith: for example, people who earnestly seek the truth and lead exemplary lives.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies'', Orlando O. EspÃ­n and James B. Nickoloff, p.551, [http://books.google.com/books?id=k85JKr1OXcQC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+Theology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=31M2KNLajc&amp;sig=PKjISREYwlrVOR941GCeTtlbeHs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y4RATbipCo_CsAPN6qyUCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of two beliefs: Double hearted and double minded ===
[[Clarke's commentary on the Bible]] commented on Deuteronomy 26:17 and [[Jewish theology]] regarding being double hearted, in that [[Tanchum bar Chanilai|Rabbi Tanchum]] (fol. 84) remarked, &quot;Behold, the Scripture exhorts the Israelites, and tells them when they pray, that they should not have two hearts, one for the holy blessed God, and one for something else.&quot;&lt;ref name=CCB/&gt; Clarke's comments that &quot;James refers to those Jews who were endeavoring to incorporate the law with the Gospel, who were divided in their minds and affections, not willing to give up the Levitical rites, and yet unwilling to renounce the Gospel. Such persons could make no progress in Divine things.&quot;&lt;ref name=CCB/&gt;

In James 1.8, it denotes instability of a cognitive [[attitude]], &quot;he is a double-minded man, unstable in attitude&quot;. In the translation in the [[God's Word Translation]], &quot;a person who has doubts is thinking about two different things at the same time and can't make up his mind about anything&quot;.&lt;ref name=J1.8&gt;[http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm James 1.8]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Young's Literal Translation]] translates this as being &quot;two souled&quot;.&lt;ref name=J1.8/&gt; In Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, a double-minded man is one of two souls in that one is for earth, and the other for heaven, wishing to secure both worlds at once.&lt;ref name=CCB&gt;[http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm James 1:8, Clarke's Commentary on the Bible]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gill (theologian)|Gill's]] exposition of the Bible refers to asking for one thing and meaning another, honoring in word but not in heart, confused in the mind.&lt;ref name=J1.8G&gt;[http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm James 1:8, Gill's exposition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relation to hypocrisy ====
Commenting on double mindedness in James 1:6, James 1:7, and its relation to [[hypocrisy]] in Matthew 6:22, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary says &quot;double-minded-literally, 'double-souled', the one soul directed towards God, the other to something else... It is not a hypocrite that is meant, but a fickle, 'wavering' man, as the context shows&quot;.&lt;ref name=J1.8W/&gt; [[Henry Alford|Alford's]] translation of the Bible uses the ancient Greek literature's &quot;waverer&quot; to express &quot;double minded&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;J3:16JFBBC&quot; /&gt;

==In philosophy, psychology, psychoanalysis, and social sciences==
A person may hold beliefs in their mind even though they are directly contradicted by facts.  These are beliefs held in bad faith.  But there is debate as  to whether this self deception is [[intentional]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;intentional structure of bad-faith&quot;'', ''Good Faith and other essays'', Joseph S. Catalano, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===How is bad faith self deception possible?===
{{quote|&quot;In bad faith, it is from myself that I am hiding the truth&quot; â Jean Paul Sartre, ''Being and Nothingness''}}  The fundamental question about bad faith self deception is how it is possible.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Self Deception and the Nature of Mind&quot;'', ''Tropisms and Reason'', Perspectives on self-deception, Brian P. McLaughlin editor, [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=p6Psh4rXKTEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+psychology&amp;ots=H2xGSnT0gC&amp;sig=UozPd8c6ijIz4CPyN9FZm5WnAnw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  In order for a liar to successfully lie to the victim of the lie, the liar must know that what is being said is false.  In order to be successful at lying, the victim must believe the lie to be true.  When a person is in bad faith self deception, the person is both the liar and the victim of the lie.  So at the same time the liar, as liar, believes the lie to be false, and as victim believes it to be true. So there is a contradiction in that a person in bad faith self deception believes something to be true and false at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Self Deception pp. 207-227&quot;&gt;âSelf Deception and Bad Faithâ, Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood, pp. 207-227&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', [[Jean Paul Sartre]] states the problem this way&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness, Jeane Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt; - {{quote|â¦bad faithâ¦ the one to whom the lie is told and the one who lies are one and the same person, which means that I must know my capacity as deceiver the truth which is hidden from me in my capacity as the one deceived.}}{{quote|âââI must as deceiver know the truth that is masked for me as the one deceived.  Better yet, I must know that truth very precisely, in order to hide it from myself the more carefullyâand this not at two different moments of temporality...}}

===Freudian psychoanalysis===
[[Freudian psychoanalysis]] answers how bad faith self deception is made possible by postulating an unconscious dimension of our being that is amoral, whereas the [[conscious]] is in fact regulated by morality, law, and custom, accomplished by what Freud calls [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Self Deception pp. 207-227&quot;/&gt;  The true desires of the subconscious express themselves as [[wish fulfillment]] in dreams, or as an ethical position unconsciously taken to satisfy the wishes of the unconscious mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Self Deception pp. 207-227&quot;/&gt;

===Ethics, phenomenology, existentialism ===
{{See|Ethics of belief|Authenticity (philosophy)|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
Bad faith [[wish fulfillment]] is central to the [[ethics of belief]], which discusses questions at the intersection of [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], Freudian [[psychoanalysis]], and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, Journal of Value Inquiry 91, 339â347, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Irony and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, SUNY, Albany, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;âpsychological strategies such asâ¦ âbad faithââ¦ become germane in the ethics of beliefâ, ''Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception Unmasked'', Alfred R. Mele , Princeton, NJ: Princeton, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is not lying to themself is [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]].  &quot;Authenticity&quot; is being faithful to internal rather than external ideas.

Bad faith in ethics may be when an unethical position is taken as ethical, and justified by appeal to being forced to that belief as an excuse, e.g., by God or by that person's natural disposition due to genetics, even though facts disconfirm that belief and [[honesty]] would require it.&lt;ref&gt;''ââ¦required by honesty, and to hide this from ourselves is âbad faithâ. One form of bad faith is to pretend that there is a God who is giving us our tasks. Another is to pretend that there is a âhuman natureâ that is doing the same thingâ'', ''Religion and Morality'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philospohy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] plays a role leading to discussions of bad faith.  It has a role in ethics by an analyses of the structure of [[Will (philosophy)|will]], valuing, happiness, and care for others (in [[empathy]] and [[sympathy]]).   Phenomenologist [[Heidegger]] discussed care, [[conscience]], and [[guilt]], moving to â[[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]â, which in turn led to the [[feminism]] of [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and existentialism of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], both based on phenomenology's considerations of authenticity and its role in bad faith. Sartre analyzed the logical problem of âbad faithâ as it relates to authenticity, and where he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in [[good faith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ ''Phenomenolgy'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into existentialism]]
Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|existentialism]], using the concepts of bad faith and &quot;authenticity&quot; in the ethics of belief.&lt;ref&gt;''âThe âethics of beliefâ refers to a cluster of questions at the intersection of epistemology, philosophy of mind, psychology, and ethicsâ¦ centralâ¦ is ... bad faith wish-fulfillmentâ¦â'', ''The Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Being and Nothingness]], Sarte begins his discussion of bad faith by rasing the question of how bad faith self delusion is possible.&lt;ref name=BN /&gt;  Sartre calls âbad faithâ a kind of project of self-deception. In order to produce excuses, bad faith first takes a third-person stance toward itself. When it becomes necessary to elude this stance it has made of itself, it then adopts the first-person perspective.  In neither case can the deception fully succeed.  Without these two facets of existence, if [[consciousness]] was unitary and not divisiable, as in the indivisible âIâ in â[[I think, therefore I am]]â, it would be impossible to explain how the very project of self-deception could be possible.  The Freudian theory of the unconscious is viewed by Sartre as based on an incoherent view of consciousness, but the project of psychoanalysis as an uncovering of the âfundamental projectâ of an individual's life is considered to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/notes.html ''Notes to Existentialism'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existentialist]] philosopher Jean Paul Sartre called the belief that there is something intrinsically good in itself, which is inherent in the world as absolute value and is discoverable by people, the â[[spirit of seriousness]]ââ, which he argued leads to bad faith. He argued that people fall into the spirit of [[seriousness]] because they take their values too seriously, and forget that values are contingent, chosen and assigned subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;âSpirit of Seriousnessâ, The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt; In Sartreâs words, âthe spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] â'givensââ,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of âdesirableâ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution.â&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, Jean Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Central to [[feminism]] is that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] to this subordination, e.g., acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God; Simone de Beauvoir labels such women &quot;mutilated&quot; and &quot;[[immanent]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Look as Bad Faith'', Debra B. Bergoffen, Philosophy Today 36, 3 (1992), 221-227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It argues, with Simone de Beauvoir, that patriarchal marriage is both a perversion of the meaning of the couple and an institution in transition&quot;'', Marriage, Autonomy, and the Feminine Protest'', Hypatia, Volume 14, Number 4, Fall 1999, pp. 18-35, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/hypatia/v014/14.4bergoffen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;mutilated... immanent...''&quot;, ''The Second Sex'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]], H.M. Parshley (Trans), Vintage Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ââ¦ women are systematically subordinatedâ¦ de Beauvoir labels women âmutilatedâ and âimmanentââ¦  women succumb to âbad faithâ and surrender their agencyâ¦â, Feminist Perspectives on the Self, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;  Simone de Beauvoir developed modern conceptions of bad faith and modern feminism together in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]''.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/ref&gt;

====Love====
A lifeâs project to be in love may result in bad faith; love is an example of bad faith given by both Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre (who were in love with each other).&lt;ref&gt;''Tete-a-Tete: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre'', Hazel Rowley&lt;/ref&gt;  A woman in love may in bad faith allow herself to be subjugated by her lover, who has created a dependency of the woman on him, allowed by the woman in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Love becomes for her a religion. In order to pursue this apparent ... She may employ 'bad faith' in an attempt to resolve this paradox...&quot;'', ''Revolutions of the Heart: gender, power and the delusions of love'', Wendy Langford&lt;/ref&gt; bad faith created by the both parties.

===Psychology===
Psychologists have proposed answers as to how bad faith self delusion can be possible.&lt;ref&gt;âSelf Deception and Bad Faithâ, Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

A âtropismâ is an action done without conscious thought.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;action done without cognitive thought&quot;'', Websters Dictionary Online, [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Tropism?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Tropism&amp;sa=Search#922]&lt;/ref&gt;  While self deception may be a tropism, not consciously done, it may be guided by âprojectsâ one may set for oneâs life, such as a desire for personal pleasure, wealth, power, or to get into heaven.  For example, a creationist has a project to get into heaven, and a racist with feelings of personal inadequacy may have a project to be superior or to have power over some others.  The project may create self deception without conscious thought, as a tropism creates action without conscious thought.  A project may be selfish, and overwhelm reason from facts, though its consequences are not directly intentional.  But the project itself may be intentionally sought, and in a selfish way, whence bad faith arises, as a result of selfish or bad intention in choice of project.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDNM&quot;&gt;''&quot;Self Deception and the Nature of Mind&quot;'', ''Tropisms and Reason'', Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P.

A [[homunculus]] is a little person (or map of the person) inside a person, and homuncularism is the theory in psychology that there are subsystems of the mind performing different operations; the homuncularist answer to the question as to how bad faith is possible is that one such subunit deceives the other.&lt;ref&gt;''âThere is a natural homuncularist response to this surface paradox of self deception.Distinct subsystems that play the distinct role of deceiver and deceived are located within the self deceiver.

Bad faith is important to the concept of [[original position]] in [[John Rawls]]â [[theory of justice]], where mutual commitment of the parties requires that the parties cannot choose and agree to principles in bad faith, in that they have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice; a party cannot take risks with principles he knows he will have difficulty voluntarily complying with, or they would be making an agreement in bad faith which is ruled out by the conditions of the original position.&lt;ref&gt;''âRawlsâ¦ partiesâ¦ cannot choose and agree to principles in âbad faithâ... have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justiceâ¦â'', ''Original Position'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In pseudosciences===

The [[pseudoscience]] of [[racist eugenics]] is explained by some to be a result of racism as a kind of bad faith that promotes their own desires for superiority over at least ''someone''; e.g., some whites believe in bad faith that blacks are inferior.&lt;ref&gt;''ââ¦ bad faith can be defined as fleeing a displeasing truth for a pleasing falsehood. Thus, constructing black people as inferior to whites is a âpleasing falsehood of antiblack racism.â'', ''Measured Lies: The Bell Curve Examined'', Joe L.

[[Creation science]]'s &quot;scientific research&quot; about the age of the earth, against [[paleontology]] and [[evolution]] and in the face of overwhelming evidence, has been called bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;''â...to teach creationism or whatever... Is it not 'bad faith' to misrepresent the findings of science in what is purported to be a science class?&quot;'',''Should Creationism be Taught in the Public Schools?'', Robert T. Pennock, Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalty and patriotism===
Bad faith is associated with being double minded, or of divided loyalty. (See theology section above.)

The philosophy of [[loyalty]] examines unchosen loyalties, e.g., one does not choose one's family or country, but when there is excessive wrongdoing, there is a general unwillingness to question these unchosen loyalties, and this exhibits bad faith as a type of lack of [[integrity]]; once we have such loyalties, we are resistant to their scrutiny and self-defensively discount challenges to them in bad faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBF&quot;&gt;''âPatriotism as Bad Faith&quot;'',''Ethics'', 115, Simon Keller, pp. 563â92, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/loyalty/ ''Loyalty'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the philosophy of [[patriotism]] (loyalty to one's country) bad faith is hiding from oneself the true source of some of oneâs patriotic beliefs, such as when one fights for a racist [[totalitarian dictatorship]] against a free and [[egalitarian]] democracy.&lt;ref name=PBF /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;This leads her to hide from herself the true source of some of the beliefs involved. This is bad faith.&quot;'', Patriotism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation theory===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-27106-0001, Paris, Verhandlungen Ã¼ber NATO-Beitritt.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used an &quot;inherent bad faith&quot; model when negotiating with the Soviet Union in International relations.]]

Bad faith is a concept in [[negotiation theory]] whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.&lt;ref name=BFN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;negotiating in bad faith&quot;'', example of use of &quot;bad faith&quot; from definition in Oxford Online Dictionary, [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bad+faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad faith in [[political science]] and [[political psychology]] refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddictionaries.com&quot;/&gt;  The &quot;[[inherent bad faith model]]&quot; of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]]â beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;The 'Inherent Bad Fatih Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger&quot;'', ''Political Psychology'', Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSP&quot;&gt;''ââ¦the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of oneâs opponent...&quot;'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;  A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored.  They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness.  Examples are John Foster Dullesâ position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israelâs initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref name=HSP /&gt;

===Zen Buddhism===
Persons practicing [[Zen]] claim not to be subject to the âbad faithâ in âself-deceptionâ, since they do not explain a motivation for action as a [[rationalist]] would; a rationalist must rationalize an irrational desire that is actually rooted in the body and the unconscious as if it were not.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy&quot;'', ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical philosophy and the error theory of moral statements===

For philosophers in the Anglo-American [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] tradition statements involving moral values have caused concern because of their similarity to statements about objects and events in the physical world. Compare:
# Littering is commonplace in Chiang Mai
# Littering is wrong

Both have the same grammatical structure, but the way we might verify the first is quite different from the way we might want verify the second. We can verify the first statement by observations made in the physical world, but, according to [[David Hume]], no amount of physical world observation can verify statements of the second type. Hume's view is summarized as âyou can not derive ought from isâ. Whereas statements of the first type must be true or false, some philosophers have argued that moral statement are neither true nor false. [[Richard M. Hare]], for example, argues that moral statements are in fact imperatives (commands). For him the statement âlittering is wrongâ means âdo not litterâ, and âdo not litterâ is neither true nor false.

In sharp contrast to people like Hare, [[J. L. Mackie]] contended that moral statements are false. Mackie's view discomforts [[Crispin Wright]] who says that it ârelegates moral discourse to bad faithâ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism/ Miller, Alexander ''Realism'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright is not saying that all moral statements are bad faith. What he is saying is that if Mackie is correct, and somebody believes that Mackie is correct, then that person will be guilty of bad faith whenever he makes a moral statement.

== In law==
[[File:Villainc.svg|thumb|right|100px|Legal definition - '''&quot;Bad faith refers to a subjective state of mindâ¦ motivated by... '''sinister purposesâ.&quot;''']]
In law, there are inconsistent definitions of bad faith, with one definition much more broad than used in other fields of study discussed in the above sections.  [[Black's Law Dictionary]] equates [[fraud]] with bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;definition of &quot;bad faith&quot;, Blackâs Law Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  But one goes to jail for fraud, and not necessarily for bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocking Chair Plaza v Brampton'', 1988 29 CPC 2d 82, Duhaime online Legal Dictionary, [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Duhaime online law dictionary similarly defines bad faith broadly as &quot;intent to deceive&quot;, and &quot;a person who intentionally tries to deceive or mislead another in order to gain some advantage&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx definition of &quot;bad faith&quot;, Duhaime online Legal Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Canadian labor arbitrator wrote, in one case, that bad faith is related to rationality in reasoning, as it is used in other fields, but is ill defined in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx 1992, Re Alcan Wire, 26 LAC 4th 93, Ontario]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The concept of bad faith is likely not capable of precise calibration and certainly has not been defined in the same way by all adjudicators.  At its core, bad faith implies malice or '''ill will'''. A decision made in bad faith is '''grounded, not on a rational connection between the circumstances and the outcome, but on antipathy toward the individual for non-rational reasons'''... The absence of a rational basis for the decision implies that factors other than those relevant were considered. In that sense, a decision in bad faith is also arbitrary. These comments are not intended to put to rest the debate over the definition of bad faith. Rather, it is to point out that bad faith, which has its core in malice and ill will, at least touches, if not wholly embraces, the related concepts of '''unreasonableness''', discrimination and arbitrariness.}}
What was called &quot;Canada's best judicial definition of 'bad faith'&quot; by Duhaime's Legal Dictionary is similarly more consistent with use in other fields discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins v Transport &amp; Allied Worker's Union'', 1991, 6 CPC 3d 206, Newfoundland, Duhaime Legal Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Good faith and its opposite, bad faith, imports a '''subjective state of mind''', the former '''motivated by''' honesty of purpose and the latter by '''ill-will'''.}}

Duhaime also refers to another description, &quot;...bad faith refers to a subjective state of mindâ¦ motivated by ill will ... or even '''sinister purposes'''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx Duhaime Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insurance bad faith ===
{{Main|Insurance bad faith}}
[[Insurance bad faith]] is a [[tort]] claim that an insured may have against an insurer for its bad acts, e.g. intentionally denying a claim by giving spurious citations of exemptions in the policy to mislead an insured, adjusting the claim in a dishonest manner, failing to quickly process a claim,  or other intentional misconduct in claims processing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The tort of bad faith in first-party insurance transactions after two decades,&quot; Roger C. Henderson, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/arz37&amp;div=64&amp;id=&amp;page=].&lt;/ref&gt;  Insurance bad faith has been broadened beyond use in other fields to include total inaction, a refusal to respond to a claim in any way.&lt;ref name=HPBF /&gt;

====Punitive and exemplary damages====
Courts can award punitive or exemplary damages, over and above the claim, against any insurance company which is found to have adjusted a claim in bad faith; the damages may be awarded with the aim of deterring such behavior among insurers in general, and may far exceed the amount of the damage due under the [[insurance policy]].&lt;ref&gt;California Fair Claims Settlement Regulations, [http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0100-consumers/0060-information-guides/0040-residential/fair-claims-settlement-regs.cfm].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], one case of this type resulted in a record punitive award of $1 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] when an [[insurance company]] pressed a claim for [[arson]] even after its own experts and adjusters had come to the conclusion that the fire was accidental; the company was advised by legal counsel that the desperate insured parties would be willing to settle for much less than what they were owed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc18/2002scc18.html ''Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.'', 2002 SCC 18]&lt;/ref&gt;
