'''Lois Griffin''' (nÃ©e '''Pewterschmidt''')&lt;!-- She goes by her married name, not &quot;Pewterschmidt&quot; --&gt; is a character from the [[List of animated television series|animated television]] series ''[[Family Guy]]''. She is voiced by writer [[Alex Borstein]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the family in the 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Lois was created and designed by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] based on ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|Larry and Steve]]'', a short made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared on the episode &quot;[[Death Has a Shadow]]&quot;.

Lois is the mother of the Griffin family. With her husband [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], she has had three children: [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]. Lois is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother, despite her admitted drug use, [[meth]] addiction, prior [[problem gambling|gambling addiction]] and obvious [[kleptomania]]. She has appeared in other media relating to ''Family Guy''âincluding a [[Family Guy Video Game!|video game]], commercials and booksâand inspired an entire line of merchandise. Lois's distinctive [[New York dialect|New York accent]] originated from a character in a stage show that Alex Borstein had performed in, which was largely inspired by a relative who grew up in [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York]].

==Role in ''Family Guy''==
Lois Griffin was born to affluent [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] parents, Carter and Barbara Pewterschmidt.  It is revealed in the episode &quot;[[Family Goy]]&quot; &lt;!-- &quot;Goy&quot; is not a typo; it's the name of an episode --&gt; that her mother is actually a [[Holocaust survivor]] who concealed her Judaism, [[retcon]]ing her apparently Jewish [[Long Island]] and [[New York dialect|New York accent]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishtimes.com/index.php/jewishtimes/celebrities/jt/celebrities/lois_griffin/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/08/13/2009-08-13_seth_macfarlane_outs_baby_stewie_in_family_guy_hes_gay_macfarlane_says_in_playbo.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Elliptical vs. treadmill: Which will give you the better workout?}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though she was raised Christian. Lois is the wife of [[Peter Griffin]] and the mother of [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] Griffin. Lois and the rest of the Griffins live in the fictional town of [[Quahog, Rhode Island]] which is modeled after [[Cranston, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Family Guy writer at Bryant|journal=The Providence Journal|date= 2008-09-24|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Family'' funny business|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|first=Michael|last=Hines|date=2007-09-15|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first=Caryn|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E1DD1E39F93AA15752C0A96F958260|title=TV Weekend; Where Matricide Is a Family Value|publisher=New York Times|date=1999-01-29|accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois primarily works as a [[housewife]] throughout the series, though she did give piano lessons in early episodes of the series. Lois has also had various jobs in single episodes such as in &quot;[[FOX-y Lady]]&quot;, were she becomes the new reporter for [[Fox News Channel]] and in &quot;[[It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One]]&quot;, Lois is elected the mayor of Quahog.

''Family Guy'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters do not age much, so the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. However, several of the characters, such as [[Meg Griffin]], have aged two to three years since the show's [[Death Has a Shadow|pilot episode]], while others, such as [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], have remained the same age.&lt;ref name= book&gt;{{cite book|title=Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide, Seasons 1â3|author=Callaghan, Steve|isbn=006083305X|chapter=A Hero Sits Next Door|page=32|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=[[New York City]], [[New York]]|year=2005|authorlink=Steve Callaghan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.

==Character==
===Creation===
When he was still in college, ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] created a cartoon short called ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve#The Life of Larry (1995)|The Life of Larry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2006-11-05|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/05.11/03-classday.html |title=''Family Guy'' Seth MacFarlane to speak at Class Day|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate= 2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short centered around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatReporter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/|title = Seth MacFarlane&amp;nbsp;â heâs the âFamily Guyâ|accessdate = 2009-10-18|last = Bartlett|first = James|date =  2007-03-12|work = The Great Reporter|publisher = Presswire Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a sequel called ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry %26 Steve#Larry .26 Steve .281997.29|Larry &amp; Steve]]'', which [[Cartoon Network]] broadcast in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoonist MacFarlane funny guy of Fox's 'Family' Subversive voice of series is his|date=1999-01-29|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Graham, Jefferson|page=7E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, MacFarlane was working for [[Hanna-Barbara Studios]], writing for shows such as ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', and ''[[Cow and Chicken]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoovid&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=MacFarlane, Seth|year=2006|url=http://au.video.yahoo.com/watch/1929627/2891929 |title=Inside Media at MTR (2006): ''Family Guy'' 2 |work=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Video]]|publisher=[[The Paley Center for Media]]|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short caught the eye of [[20th Century Fox]] representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatReporter&quot;/&gt; MacFarlane received a [[US$]]50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was about one twentieth of what most pilots cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoovid&quot;/&gt; MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[All in the Family]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Road to&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/429/429628p10.html|title=Interview with Seth MacFarlane|work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December&amp;nbsp;9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s [[Saturday morning cartoons]] he watched as a child, namely ''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'', and ''[[Rubik, the Amazing Cube]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarlaneTIME&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1844711,00.html|title=Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane|author=Cruz, Gilbert|date=2008-09-26|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In three months, MacFarlane created the Griffin family and developed a pilot for the show he called ''Family Guy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;FastCompany&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|author=Dean, Josh|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/130/family-values.html?page=0%2C3|title=Seth MacFarlaneâs $2 Billion Family Guy Empire|date=2008-10-13|accessdate= 2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian's character was largely based on Steve from the ''Larry and Steve'' cartoon, with Larry serving as the primary basis of the Peter character.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/news/events/cartoon-network-pilots-screened-asifa-east-nycs-school-visual-arts|title=Cartoon Network Pilots Screened by ASIFA East at NYC's School of Visual Arts|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=2007-02-13|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The character's personality was also partially inspired by a friend of his father who rudely fell asleep while watching the 1993 film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinraub&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Young Guy of 'Family Guy'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/arts/television/07SETH.html?th=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Weinraub, Bernard|date=2004-07-07|accessdate=2009-10-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network executives were impressed with the pilot and ordered thirteen episodes, giving MacFarlane a 2 million dollar per-season contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;FastCompany&quot;/&gt;

===Voice===
[[File:Alex Borstein by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|alt=A caucasian woman with black hair tied back, smiling into a microphone, with a vague symbol behind her.|thumb|180px|Alex Borstein is the voice of Lois Griffin.]]
Lois Griffin is voiced by [[Television producer|producer]] and staff writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/celebrities/alex-borstein/14744926 |title=Alex Borstein from Family Guy |work=[[Film.com]] |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Borstein]], who also voices recurring characters such as [[Asia]]n reporter [[Tricia Takanawa]], [[Loretta Brown]] and Lois' mother [[Barbara Pewterschmidt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MetromixLois&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newyork.metromix.com/events/article/q-and-a-alex/782347/content|title=Q&amp;A: Alex Borstein|author=Miller, Kirk|date=November 19, 2008|work=[[Metromix]]|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borstein has been part of the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, as well she has been voicing Lois from the start.&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;{{quote box|align= left|width=30em|quote=&quot;I was asked to audition for the show and at the time I was playing a character in a stage show, so I brought that over and it was very slow, it was based on my cousin from Rhode Island and Seth said that &quot;It would be a four hour show if I talked at that pace so could you make it quicker and raise it&quot;.

&quot;Over the years you can notice that it started lower and slower and it's gotten higher and higher and quicker and quicker.&quot;|source=Alex Borstein, on Lois Griffin's Origins, Interview with ''[[IGN]]''.&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/dor/objects/824085/familyguy/videos/fg_alex_int_tagged_1200.html|title=Family Guy TV Behind the Scenes - Alex Borstein As Lois Griffin |work=[[IGN]]|author=Haque, Ahsan|date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the time ''Family Guy'' was being developed, Borstein was working in the [[sketch comedy]], [[MADtv]].&lt;ref name=inter/&gt; She was asked to audition by a member of the MADtv staff who was helping MacFarlane develop the show. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any artwork and said it was &quot;really sight unseen&quot;.&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGLois&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Alex-Borstein-Lois-36289.aspx |title=Alex Borstein (Lois) Laughs at the Once-Dead ''Family Guy''{{'}}s Longevity |date=November 13, 2006 |work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, she was doing a stage show in [[Los Angeles]], in which she played a redhead mother, whose voice she had based on one of her cousins from Rhode Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;MetromixLois&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGLois&quot;/&gt; She took the voice of the character to the set and use it for Lois. The voice was originally slower, when MacFarlane heard it, he asked her to make it faster and higher. Borstein has noted that the voice of Lois has been changing from the slower original voice to the quicker up tempo voice of the present episodes.&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;

There have been occasions were Borstein does not voice Lois, such as in the episode &quot;[[Road to the Multiverse]]&quot;, where Lois is not voiced by Borstein in a scene and instead was voiced by Japanese actress Kei Ogawa, who was required for a scene where everything in the world was Japanese (she also did the voice of Meg for the scene).&lt;ref name=&quot;cast&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.yahoo.com/episode/217820/castcrew |title= Family Guy&amp;nbsp;â Road to the Multiverse&amp;nbsp;â Cast and Crew |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Lois's personality has evolved throughout the episodes. Lois is commonly the voice of reason to Peter's shenanigans. But in some episodes she can act darker than normal and sometimes shows a taste for sadomasochism. In the episode &quot;[[The Son Also Draws]]&quot;, Lois showed a [[gambling]] addiction when the family went to an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] [[casino]] and lost the family car. In the episode &quot;[[Model Misbehavior]]&quot;, Lois becomes a [[bulimic]] model. &quot;[[Stuck Together, Torn Apart]]&quot; shows Peter and Lois splitting up because of Peter's jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw of jealousy and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;glue&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Stuck Together, Torn Apart|episodelink=Stuck Together, Torn Apart|series=Family Guy|credits=Writ.: Hentemann, Mark; Dir.: DiMartino, Michael Dante|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]|airdate=f2002-01-31|season=3|number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also hinted at or been shown using drugs. In the most recent episodes, Lois has been known to have more of a cold-hearted personality, such as laughing at people during serious moments, usually towards Brian or Meg.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quagmire's Dad]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lois is somewhat [[promiscuous]]: she had an extramarital affair with former President [[Bill Clinton]], which resulted in a temporary separation from Peter, although the relationship was later rekindled after Peter himself engaged in a sexual liaison with Clinton. She has also been shown to have a large number of ex-boyfriends, including [[Gene Simmons]] of the band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] and a friend of Peter's named Jerome â both of whom have given her the nickname &quot;Loose Lois&quot;. In the episode [[And I'm Joyce Kinney]], it was revealed that Lois had participated in a pornographic film called &quot;Quest For Fur&quot; to pay for her cocaine addiction which further cemented her being promiscuous. In one episode, it's implied that her treatment by both her father and Peter has left her mildly sexist: when Peter reveals that his boss molested him, Lois refuses to believe it, saying only men are capable of molesting, not the other way around. In one episode, she shows a violent personality after learning martial arts, which leads to the whole family fighting.

Many episodes have hinted that Lois is [[bisexual]]. In an interview, Borstein stated that Lois became &quot;a little more snarky and sassy and sexual&quot; since the first season to challenge &quot;those sitcom rules that a woman is supposed to be a total wet blanket and not like sex and is no fun&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGLois&quot;/&gt; In the first straight-to-DVD feature, ''Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story'', Lois also states, &quot;Women are such teases. That's why I went back to men.&quot;
