'''Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya''' ({{lang-ar|Ø§ÙØ¬ÙØ§Ø¹Ø© Ø§ÙØ¥Ø³ÙØ§ÙÙØ©}}; '''al-jamÄÊ»aÄ§ al-Ê¼islÄmiyyaÄ§''')  ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] for &quot;the Islamic Group&quot;; also transliterated  '''El Gama'a El Islamiyya'''. Also called &quot;Islamic Groups&quot; and transliterated  '''Gamaat Islamiya''', '''al Jamaat al Islamiya''') is an [[Egypt]]ian [[Islamist]] movement, and is considered a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization by the [[United States]], [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_340/l_34020051223en00640066.pdf THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, COUNCIL DECISION of 21 December 2005] on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Egypt]]ian governments. The group is (or was) dedicated to the overthrow of the Egyptian government and replacing it with an [[Islamic republic|Islamic state]].

The group(s) is said to have constituted &quot;the Islamicist movement's only genuine mass organizations&quot; in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.129&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; The group is reported to be responsible for the killing of hundreds of Egyptian policemen and soldiers, civilians, and dozens of tourists in a violent campaign in the 1990s.  While the assassination of the Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981 is generally thought to have been carried out by another Islamist group, [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], some have suggested al-Gamaa was responsible for or at least related to the assassination. In 2003 the imprisoned leadership of the group renounced bloodshed, and a series of high-ranking members have since been released by Egyptian authorities, and the group has been allowed to resume semi-legal peaceful activities.  The now imprisoned cleric [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] was a spiritual leader of the movement.

== History ==
===Origins in universities===
Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya began as an umbrella organization for Egyptian [[militant]] student groups, formed, like the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], after the leadership of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] renounced violence in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.129&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days, the group was primarily active on university campuses, and was mainly composed of university students. Originally they were a minority in the Egyptian student movement which was dominated by leftist [[Nasserist]]s and [[Marxist]]s. The leftists  were strongly critical of the new [[Sadat era#Early years|Sadat government]], and urged Egypt to fight a war of revenge against Israel, while President Sadat wanted to wait and rebuild the military.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.132&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; However, with some &quot;discrete, tactical collaboration&quot; with the government,&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.133&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; who sought a &quot;useful counterweight&quot; to its leftist opponents,&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.134&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; the group(s) began to grow in influence in 1973.

The Gama'at spread quite rapidly on campuses and won up to one-third of all student union elections. These victories provided a platform from which the associations campaigned for Islamic dress, the veiling of women, and the [[Sex segregation|segregation]] of classes by gender. [[Secular]] university administrators opposed these goals.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt;
By march 1976 they were &quot;dominant force&quot;&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.141&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; in the student movement and by 1977 &quot;they were in complete control of the universities and had driven the left organizations underground.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.129/&gt;

===Expansion===
Having once been favored by the Egyptian government of [[Anwar Sadat]] they now threatened it, passionately opposing what they believed was a &quot;shameful peace with the Jews,&quot; aka the [[Camp David Accords]] with Israel.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.149/&gt; By 1979 they began to be harassed by the government but their numbers grew steadily.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.149&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Sadat sought to diminish the influence of the associations through a law that transferred most of the authority of the student unions to professors and administrators. During the 1980s, however, Islamists gradually penetrated college faculties. At [[Asyut University]], which was the scene of some of the most intense clashes between Islamists and their opponents (including security forces, [[secularist]]s, and [[Copts]]), the president and other top administrators â who were Islamists â supported Gama'at demands to end mixed-sex classes and to reduce total female enrollment.&lt;ref name=Metz&gt;[http://www.higginsctc.org/terrorism/Egypt%20-%20Islamic%20Political%20Movements.htm Islamic Political Movements]. from Helen Chapin Metz, ed. ''Egypt: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other universities Gama'at also forbade the mixing of genders, films, concerts, and dances, and enforced their bans with clubs and iron bars.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.151&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; From the universities the groups reached out to make new recruits, preaching in poor neighbourhoods of cities, and to rural areas.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.149/&gt; and after a crackdown against them, inmates of Egyptian jails.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In April 1981 the group became involved in what was probably started as a clan feud/vendetta about livestock or property lines between [[Copts|Coptic]] and Muslim Egyptians in the vicinity of [[Minya, Egypt]]. The group believed in the position of tributary or [[dhimmi]] for Christians in Egypt and opposed any signs of Coptic &quot;arrogance&quot; (istikbar), such as Christian cultural identity and opposition to an Islamic state. The group distributed a leaflet accusing Egypt's one Christian provincial governor (appointed by the government) of providing automatic weapons to Christians to attack Muslims, and the Sadat administration of following orders given by the United States.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.156&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.156-66&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Crackdown===
In June 1981, a brutal sectarian Muslim-Copt fight broke out in the poor [[al-Zawaiyya Al Hamra]] district of [[Cairo]]. &quot;Men and women were slaughtered; babies thrown from windows, their bodies crushed on the pavement below; there was looting, killing and arson.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.166&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic Group(s) were accused of participating in the incident and in September 1981, one month before the assassination of Sadat, the Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya were dissolved by the state (although they had never been legally registered in the first place), their infrastructure was destroyed and their leaders arrested.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.129/&gt;

=== Assassination of president Anwar Sadat in 1981 ===
Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya may have been indirectly involved in the assassination of president [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981. [[Karam Zuhdi]], group leader of Al-Jamaa Islamiya, expressed regret for conspiring with [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. He was among the 900 militants who were set free in April 2006 by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/05/zawahiri.tape/index.html |title=Al-Zawahiri: Egyptian militant group joins al Qaeda|publisher=CNN.com |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Omar Abdel-Rahman ===
The cleric [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] is the spiritual leader of the movement. He was accused of participating in the [[World Trade Center 1993 bombings]] conspiracy, and was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his espousal of a subsequent conspiracy to [[New York City landmark bomb plot|bomb New York City landmarks]], including the [[United Nations]] and [[FBI]] offices. The Islamic Group has publicly threatened to retaliate against the United States unless Rahman is released from prison. However, the group later renounced violence and their leaders and members were released from prison in Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== 1990s terrorism campaign ===
While the Islamic group had originally been an amorphous movement of local groups centered in [[mosque]]s without offices or membership roll, by the late 1980s it became more organized and &quot;even adopted an official logo: an upright sword standing on an open Qur'an with an orange sun rising in the background,&quot; encircled by the [[Qur'an]]ic verse that Abdel Rahman had quoted at his trials while trying to explain [[jihad]] to the judges:
&lt;blockquote&gt;ÙÙÙÙØ§ØªÙÙÙÙÙÙÙÙ Ø­ÙØªÙÙÙ ÙØ§Ù ØªÙÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙØªÙÙÙØ©Ù ÙÙÙÙÙÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¯ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙØ¥ÙÙÙ Ø§ÙØªÙÙÙÙØ§Ù ÙÙÙØ§Ù Ø¹ÙØ¯ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙ Ø¥ÙÙØ§ÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¸ÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙÙÙ
&lt;BR&gt;
Fight them on until there is no more Tumult, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the official motto of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Caryle. ''Passion for Islam: Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience''  by Caryle Murphy, (2002), p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya engage in an extended campaign of violence, from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals, to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners. Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt's economy -- tourism&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Solidly ahead of oil, Suez Canal revenues, and remittances, tourism is Egypt's main hard currency earner at $6.5 billion per year.&quot; (in 2005) [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/741/eg1.htm ... concerns over tourism's future]. Retrieved 27 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; -- and in turn to the government, but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depends for support.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of campaign against the Egyptian state from 1992-1997 totaled more than 1200&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), p.258&lt;/ref&gt; and included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a speaker of parliament ([[Rifaat al-Mahgoub]]), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/timeline_egypt.html |title=Timeline of modern Egypt |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 killing of the group's leader, Ala Mohieddin, presumably by security forces, led Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya to murder Egypt's speaker of parliament in retaliation. In June 1995, working together with [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], the group staged a carefully planned attempt on the life of president Mubarak, led by Mustafa Hamza, a senior Egyptian member of the Al-Qaeda and commander of the military branch of the Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. Mubarak escaped unharmed and retaliated with a massive and ruthless crackdown on GI members and their families in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), p.213-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taalat Fouad Qassem]] was arrested in Croatia in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayer&quot;&gt;[[Jane Mayer|Mayer, Jane]], &quot;[[The Dark Side (book)|The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals]]&quot;, 2008. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonviolence Initiative ===
By 1997 the movement had become paralyzed. 20,000 Islamists were in custody in Egypt and thousands more had been cut down by the security forces. In July of that year, Islamist lawyer Montassir al-Zayyat brokered a deal between the Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya and the Egyptian government, called the Nonviolence Initiative, whereby the movement formally renounced violence. The next year the government released 2,000 members of the Islamic Group. After the initiative was declared Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman also gave his approval from his prison cell in the United States, though he later withdrew it.

The initiative divided the Islamic Group between members in Egypt who supported it and those in exile who wanted the attacks to continue. Leading the opposition was EIJ leader [[Ayman Zawahiri]] who termed it &quot;surrender&quot; in angry letters to the London newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), p.255-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Temple of Hatshepsut attack ====
{{main|November 1997 Luxor massacre}}

Zawahiri enlisted [[Mustafa Hamza]], the new emir of Islamic Groups and its military leader, [[Rifai Ahmed Taha]], both exiles in Afghanistan with him, to sabotage the initiative with a massive terrorism attack that would provoke the government into repression.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), p.256-7&lt;/ref&gt;  So on November 17, 1997 Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya killing campaign climaxed with the attack at the Temple of [[Hatshepsut]] ([[Deir el-Bahri]]) in [[Luxor]], in which a band of six men dressed in police uniforms machine-gunned and hacked to death with knives 58 foreign tourists and four [[Egyptians]]. &quot;The killing went on for 45 minutes, until the floors streamed with blood. The dead included a five-year-old British child and four Japanese couples on their honeymoons.&quot; Altogether 71 people were killed. The attack stunned Egyptian society, devastated the tourist industry for a number of years, and consequently sapped a large segment of popular support for violent Islamism in Egypt.

The revulsion of Egyptians and rejection of jihadi terrorism was so complete, the attack's supporters backpedaled. The day after the attack, Rifai Taha claimed the attackers intended only to take the tourists hostage, despite the evidence of the systematic nature of the slaughter. Others denied Islamist involvement completely. Sheikh [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] blamed Israelis for the killings, and Zawahiri maintaining the Egyptian police had done it.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), p.257-8&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rifai Taha signed the al-Qaeda fatwa &quot;International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders&quot; to kill Crusaders and Jews on behalf of the Islamic Group, he was &quot;forced to withdraw his name&quot; from the fatwa, lamely explaining to fellow members ... than he had &quot;only been asked over the telephone to join in a statement of support for the Iraqi people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zayyat, Nontassir, ''The Road to al-Qaeda: the story of bin Laden's right-hand Man,'' Pluto Press, (2004), p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also responsible for a spate of tourist shootings (trains and cruise ships sprayed with bullets) in middle and upper Egypt during the early 1990s. As a result of those attacks, cruise ships ceased sailing between [[Cairo]] and [[Luxor]].

=== Renouncing terror ===
[[File:Members of al-Gamaa al-Islamiyya.jpg|thumb|Members of al-Gamaa al-Islamiyya]]
After spending more than two decades in prison and after intense debates and discussions with [[Al-Azhar]] scholars, most of the leaders of Al-Gama'a Al-Islamiyya have written several books renouncing their ideology of violence and some of them went as far as calling ex-Egyptian president [[Sadat]], whom they assassinated, a martyr.

Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya renounced bloodshed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=21972 |title=Egypt frees 900 Islamist militants |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 2003 Egypt freed more than 1,000 members, citing what Interior Minister [[Habib el-Adli]] called the group's stated &quot;commitment to rejecting violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2006&quot;/&gt;

Harsh repressive measures by the Egyptian government and the unpopularity of the killing of foreign tourists have reduced the group's profile in recent years but the movement retains popular support among Egyptian Islamists who disapprove of the secular nature of Egypt's society and peace treaty with [[Israel]].

In April 2006 the Egyptian government released approximately 1200 members, including a founder, Najeh Ibrahim, from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=www.memri.org |url=http://memri.org/bin/opener.cgi?Page=archives&amp;ID=SP130106 |title=Al-Gama'a Al-Islamiyya vs. Al-Qaeda |publisher=Memri.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/Articles/2006/04/12/22789.htm News from Al-Arabiya]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, there have been &quot;only two instances where members showed signs of returning to their former violent ways, and in both cases they were betrayed by informers in their own group.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;lawyer Montasser al-Zayyat in [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/02/080602fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all The Rebellion Within, An Al Qaeda mastermind questions terrorism. by Lawrence Wright, June 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 Revolution===
Following the 2011 Revolution, Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya is working to establish a political party, the [[Building and Development Party]]. In August 2011, it presented 6,700 proxies (signatures) to the Egyptian political parties' committee on behalf of its party.  In a statement the Gamaa said that any legislation drafted in Egypt after the revolution must refer to the [[sharia]] of God, âwho blessed us with this revolution. We believe that the suffering we endured during the past years was due to neglecting religion and putting those who don't fear [God] in power.â It also stated that &quot;Islam can contain everyone and respects the freedom of followers of other religions to refer to their own sharia in private affairs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailynewsegypt.com/egypt/al-gamaa-al-islamiya-calls-for-unity-says-minority-rights-guaranteed.html Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya calls for unity, says minority rights guaranteed]| By  Tamim Elyan| Daily News Egypt| September 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
One scholar studying the group ([[Gilles Kepel]]) found a the group repeatedly used the name of radical Islamist theorist [[Sayyid Qutb]], and often quoted from his manifesto, ''[[Ma'alim fi al-Tariq]]'' (Milestones), in their leaflets and newsletters. They emphasized the right to legislate belongs to God alone; and that divine unity ([[tawhid]]) in Islam signifies liberation (tahrir) from all that is corrupt in thought -- including the liberation of all that is inherited or conventional, like customs and traditions.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.155&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.155-6&lt;/ref&gt;  

There was a scant supply of any writing by the groups members, but some issues leading writer(s) of the gama'at thought worth mentioning included: 
*Youth must be taught that Islam was ''nizam kamil wa shamil'' (a complete and perfect system) and must regulate government and war, the judicial system and the economy.  
*Egypt's disastrous 1967 War was the result of following [[Arab nationalism]] rather than Islam. 
*Signs of the growth of an Islamic movement were the wearing of the veil by women and the white gallabieh and untrimmed beard by men, early marriage, and attendance at public prayers on the major Muslim festivals, [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-adha]].&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.154&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.153-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

While secularist social analyses of Egypt's socioeconomic problems maintained that poverty was caused by overpopulation or high defense expenditures, Al-Gama'at saw the cause in the populace's spiritual failures -- laxness, secularism, and corruption. The solution was a return to the simplicity, hard work, and self-reliance of earlier Muslim life.&lt;ref name=Metz&gt;[http://www.higginsctc.org/terrorism/Egypt%20-%20Islamic%20Political%20Movements.htm Islamic Political Movements]. from Helen Chapin Metz, ed. ''Egypt: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members allegedly allying with al-Qaeda ==
Deputy leader of al-Qaeda [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] announced a new alliance with a faction of Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. In a video released on the internet on 5 August 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2006&quot;/&gt; Zawahiri said &quot;We bring good tidings to the Muslim nation about a big faction of the knights of Al-Gama'a Islamiyya uniting with Al-Qaeda,&quot; and the move aimed to help &quot;rally the Muslim nation's capabilities in a unified rank in the face of the most severe crusader campaign against Islam in its history.&quot; An Al-Gama'a leader, [[Mohammad Hasan Khalil al-Hakim|Muhammad al-Hukaymah]], appeared in the video and confirmed the unity move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=74536 Lebanon Daily Star] about the Zawahiri/Hukaymah video&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hukaymah acknowledged that other Al-Gama'a members had &quot;backslid&quot; from the militant course he was keeping to, and some Al-Gama'a representatives also denied that they were joining forces with the international Al-Qaeda network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vinsinfo |url=http://themedialine.org/news/news_detail.asp?NewsID=14657 |title=Egyptian Group Denies Al-Qaâida Ties |publisher=The Media Line |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikh Abdel Akhar Hammad, a former Al-Gama'a leader, told Al-Jazeera: &quot;If [some] brothers have joined, then this is their own personal view and I don't think that most Al-Gama'a members share that same opinion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/5B082741-DEE6-4FB2-808D-85EF704BC7FA.htm Al Jazeera - Egyptian group denies Al-Qaeda tie-up]&lt;/ref&gt;
