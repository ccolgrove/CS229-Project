The '''April 6 Youth Movement''' ''({{lang-ar|Ø­Ø±ÙØ© Ø´Ø¨Ø§Ø¨ 6 Ø£Ø¨Ø±ÙÙ}})'' is an [[Egypt]]ian [[Facebook]] group started in Spring 2008 to support the workers in [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]], an industrial town, who were planning to strike on April 6.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-11/ff_facebookegypt |title= Cairo Activists Use Facebook to Rattle Regime |date=October 20, 2008 |first=David |last=Wolman |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[CondÃ© Nast Publications]] |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nat&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliament is burning, and the watching crowd is laughing |first=Hamida |last=Ghafour |date=August 25, 2008 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |publisher=[[Martin Newland]]|url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080825/OPINION/235828560/1080&amp;template=opinion |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dne&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15325 |work=[[Daily News Egypt]] |title=Protestors say Agrium plant is like Nazi gas chambers |first=Abdel-Rahman |last=Hussein |date=July 27, 2008 |publisher=Egyptian Media Services |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Daily News Egypt |title=April 6 youth detainees still in custody despite release order|publisher=Egyptian Media Services |first=Sarah |last=Carr |date=July 30, 2008 |url=http://dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15407 |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16577 |work=Daily News Egypt|title=Emaar accused of culpability in Duweiqa rockslide|publisher=Egyptian Media Services |first=Abdel-Rahman |last=Hussein |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Focus: The Dilemma of Egyptâs Liberals |first=Khalil |last=Al-Anani |date=September 2, 2008|publisher=Egyptian Media Services |work=Daily News Egypt|url=http://dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16173 |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists called on participants to wear black and stay home on the day of the strike. Bloggers and citizen journalists used [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Flickr]], blogs and other new media tools to report on the strike, alert their networks about police activity, organize legal protection and draw attention to their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/?article=692|work=Arab Media &amp; Society|title=Core to Commonplace: The evolution of Egypt's blogosphere|publisher=American University of Cairo |first=Courtney |last=Radsch |date=Fall 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' has identified the movement as the political Facebook group in Egypt with the most dynamic debates.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25bloggers-t.html |title=Revolution, Facebook-Style |first=Samantha M |last=Shapiro |work=The New York Times |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|January 2009}}, it had 70,000 predominantly young and educated members, most of whom had not been politically active before; their core concerns include [[free speech]], [[nepotism]] in government and the country's stagnant economy.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Their discussion forum on Facebook features intense and heated discussions, and is constantly updated with new postings. 

The April 6 movement is using the same [[raised fist]] symbol as the [[Otpor!]] movement from [[Serbia]], that helped bring down the regime of [[Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ]] and whose nonviolent tactics were later used in [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

* [[Asmaa Mahfouz]] posted a video blog that went [[Viral video|viral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2011/02/02/egypt-the-viral-vlog.html Egypt: The viral vlog of Asmaa Mahfouz]&lt;/ref&gt; She urged the Egyptian people to join her in a protest on January 25, in [[Tahrir Square]] to bring down Mubarakâs regime&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/middleeast/02iht-letter02.html?_r=1 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; and urged people not to be afraid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadiancharger.com/page.php?id=5&amp;a=774 The Canadian Charger]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public activism and arrests==
Aside from discussing the state of the nation online, members of the group have organized public rallies to free imprisoned journalists and engaged in protests concerning the [[2008â2009 IsraelâGaza conflict]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In its official pronouncements, the group stresses that it is not a [[political party]]. Ahmed Maher, one of the founders of the group, was arrested by the Egyptian authorities in May 2008 in an attempt to shut it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/05/17/ST2008051702711.html|title=Fledgling Rebellion on Facebook Is Struck Down by Force in Egypt|author=Ellen Knickmeyer|publisher=Washington Post|date=2008-05-18|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2008, Maher was again arrested, along with 14 other members of the group, and charged with &quot;incitement against the regime&quot;. He also claimed that Egyptian state security officers threatened to rape him in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0730/p04s04-wome.html|title=Egypt detains Facebook activists â again|author=Liam Stack|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=2008-07-30|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2009 the group was subjected to attacks, suspected to have been orchestrated by the Egyptian government. Several websites supporting the group were hacked simultaneously, and protests in Cairo were confronted by plain clothed Egyptian policemen and numerous arrests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/ Egyptian Chronicles].

On January 29, 2011 a [[WikiLeaks]] document was revealed which showed that the United States considered the movement to be &quot;outside (the)
mainstream of opposition politicians and activists&quot; and described the goals of the movement for democracy as &quot;unrealistic&quot; yet still supported it in various ways, including pressing &quot;the MFA for the release of April 6 activists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8289698/Egypt-protests-secret-US-document-discloses-support-for-protesters.html Egypt protests: secret US document discloses support for protesters]. Telegraph (2011-01-28). Retrieved on 2011-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 31, 2011 the movement promoted participation of at least a million in a march on Tuesday, February 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;anon., [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/20111316148317175.html &quot;Egypt protesters increase pressure: Opposition movement calls for &quot;march of millions&quot;] on Tuesday in a bid to topple president Hosni Mubarak.&quot;  (Jan. 31, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

On Feb 03, 2011 the [[Hisham Mubarak Law Center]] which was providing meeting space for the April 6 Youth Movement as well as providing medical and legal aid to the protesters was raided by security forces who arrested Amal Sharaf and other members of April 6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4d590d711a.html &quot;Egypt: Investigate Arrests of Activists, Journalists&quot;] ''UN HCR'', 9 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
