'''openSUSE''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|oÊ|p|Én|Ë|s|uË|z|É}}) is a general purpose [[operating system]] built on top of the [[Linux kernel]], developed by the community-supported [[openSUSE Project]] and sponsored by SUSE. After [[Novell]] acquired SUSE Linux in January 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/item.jsp?id=24&amp;locale=en_US | title=Novell Completes Acquisition of SUSE LINUX | date=January 13, 2004 | work=Novell Press Release | accessdate=2006-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novell]] decided to release the SUSE Linux Professional product as a 100% [[open source]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://os.newsforge.com/os/05/08/03/1246236.shtml | title=Novell frees SUSE Professional under new branding | author=Tina Gasperson | date=August 3, 2005 | work=NewsForge | accessdate=2006-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial release of the community project was a beta version of SUSE Linux 10.0, and as of November 16, 2011 the current stable release is openSUSE 12.1.

== Overview ==
In openSUSE the [[openSUSE Project]] community, sponsored by [[SUSE]], develops and maintains [[SUSE Linux distributions]] components.  OpenSUSE is the successor to &quot;SuSE Linux Professional&quot;.

Beyond the distribution, the openSUSE Project provides a web portal for community involvement. The community assists in developing openSUSE collaboratively with representatives from Novell by contributing code through the [[openSUSE Build Service]], writing documentation, designing artwork, fostering discussion on open [[mailing list]]s and in [[Internet Relay Chat]] channels, and improving the openSUSE site through its [[wiki]] interface. Novell markets openSUSE as the best, easiest distribution for all users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.opensuse.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions | title=Frequently Asked Questions | work=opensuse.org | accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most Linux distributions, openSUSE includes both a default [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and a [[command line interface]] option. During installation, the user may choose among [[KDE Software Compilation 4|KDE SC]], [[GNOME]], [[LXDE]] and [[Xfce]] GUIs. openSUSE supports thousands of software packages across the full range of [[Free software]] / [[open source]] development.

== History ==
=== Company history ===
{{See|SUSE Linux distributions#History}}

=== Product history ===
In the past, the SUSE Linux company had focused on releasing the '''SuSE Linux Personal''' and '''SuSE Linux Professional''' box sets which included extensive printed documentation that was available for sale in retail stores. The company's ability to sell an open source product was largely due to the closed-source development process used. Although SUSE Linux had always been open product licensed with the GPL, it was only freely possible to retrieve the source code of the next release 2 months after it was ready for purchase. SUSE Linux strategy was to create a technically superior Linux distribution with the large number of employed engineers, that would make users willing to pay for their distribution in retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://janfredrik.wordpress.com/master-thesis/ Managing Firm-Sponsored Open Source Communities] masters thesis&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the acquisition by [[Novell]] in 2003 and with the advent of openSUSE this has been reversed: starting with version 9.2, an unsupported 1 DVD [[ISO image]] of SUSE Professional was made available for download as well as a bootable [[Live DVD]] evaluation. The FTP server continues to operate and has the advantage of &quot;streamlined&quot; installs: Only downloading packages the user feels they need. The ISO has the advantages of an easy install package, the ability to operate even if the user's network card does not work &quot;out of the box&quot;, and less experience needed (i.e., an inexperienced Linux user may not know whether or not to install a certain package, and the ISO offers several preselected sets of packages).

The initial stable release from the openSUSE Project, SUSE Linux 10.0, was available for download just before the retail release of SUSE Linux 10.0. In addition, Novell discontinued the Personal version, renaming the Professional version to simply &quot;SUSE Linux&quot;, and repricing &quot;SUSE Linux&quot; to about the same as the old Personal version. As of version 10.2, the [[SUSE Linux]] distribution was officially renamed to openSUSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUSE Linux 10.2 Alpha2 Release - and distribution rename|url=http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2006-07/msg00001.html|publisher=opensuse.org|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SUSE Linux Becomes openSUSE|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/13/1547257|publisher=slashdot.org|accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, SuSE Linux has gone from a status of a distribution which includes proprietary software, with restrictive, delayed publications (2 months of waiting for those who had not bought the box, without ISOs available, but installation available via FTP) and a closed development model to a free distribution model with immediate and freely availability for all and transparent and open development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opensuse.org/Guiding_Principles openSUSE Guiding Principles]&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity continues to grow: as of May 2010, for example, patch download statistics show more than two million unique installations of openSUSE 11.1 and 11.2 alone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opensuse.org/Statistics openSUSE statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; with the largest numbers located in Germany (28%) and the United States (14%).

On April 27, 2011 Attachmate completed its acquisition of Novell. Attachmate split Novell into two autonomous business units, Novell and SUSE. Attachmate has no plans to change the relationship between SUSE (formerly Novell) and the openSUSE project.

== Distribution ==
openSUSE is fully and freely available for immediate download, and is also sold in retail box to the general public. It comes in several editions for the [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] architectures (as for version 11.4):
* openSUSE '''Download Edition''': This is the freely downloadable ISO version, available from the openSUSE downloads page. It is available as a Live-CD version (KDE4 or GNOME) which can be installed on the hard disk, or as a more complete single layer DVD-5. A CD containing additional proprietary software and an additional CD containing files for internationalization (less common languages) are also available. This version does not include any technical assistance, nor printed manuals.
* openSUSE '''Retail Edition or openSUSE Box''': Users are able to purchase openSUSE box from [http://www.open-slx.com www.open-slx.com]. The box can be ordered at [http://www.open-slx.com/en/?Order open-slx.com] It contains a [[DVD-9]] (dual-layer) comprising the 32-bit and 64, which detects the right architecture during boot time. The second DVD is a KDE-live-system for testing and rescue and also provides the non-open-source software. The box is delivered with printed documentation and with 90 days user support via email or phone. Since 2009 open-slx is producing the '''Retail Edition''' also named '''openSUSE Box'''. open-slx includes balsam extensions. DVD2 comes as 32 bit KDE Live-DVD, also including the non-oss addon repositories. 
* openSUSE '''FTP''': There is also a small ISO to install openSUSE directly from FTP (network install). There are mirrors on the two different FTP trees: one for open-source packages (OSS), a second for non-open-source packages or whose license is restrictive (non-oss). The FTP can be used to complement the Download and Retail editions.
* openSUSE '''[[Factory (computing)|Factory]]''': This is the continuous ongoing development version, from which the development team take out regular snapshots (Milestones and RC) to get the stable openSUSE.
* openSUSE '''Tumbleweed''': [[Rolling release]], in which new stable versions of packages are made available as soon as they are released.

== Features ==
=== YaST Control Center ===
{{Main|YaST}}
SUSE includes an installation and administration program called YaST which handles hard disk partitioning, system setup, RPM package management, online updates, network and [[firewall (networking)|firewall]] configuration, user administration and more in an integrated interface. YaST also integrates with [[SaX2]] to help users handle their graphics card and monitor, touch displays, and even additional monitors with [[Xinerama]]. In more recent times, many more YaST modules have been added, including one for [[Bluetooth]] support.it is also control all software application

=== AutoYaST ===
{{Main|YaST}}
[http://www.suse.com/~ug AutoYaST] is part of YaST2 and is used for automatic installation. The configuration is stored in an XML file and the installation happens without user interaction.

=== ZYpp package management ===
{{Main|ZYpp}}
ZYpp (or libzypp) is a Linux software management engine which has a powerful dependency resolver and a convenient package management API.

=== Build Service ===
{{Main|openSUSE Build Service}}
The [[openSUSE Build Service]] provides software developers with a tool to compile, release and publish their software for many distributions, including [[Mandriva]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[Debian]]. It typically simplifies the packaging process, so developers can more easily package a single program for many distributions, and many openSUSE releases, making more packages available to users regardless of what distribution version they use. It is published under the [[GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2007-01/msg00002.html &amp;#91;opensuse-announce&amp;#93; Complete openSUSE Build Service under GPL available&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Desktop innovation ===
==== Xgl and Compiz ====
On January 2, 2006, SUSE developer [[David Reveman]] announced [[Xgl]], an [[X Window System|X server]] architecture designed to take advantage of modern graphics cards via their [[OpenGL]] drivers, layered on top of OpenGL via [[Glitz (software)|glitz]]. Compiz, one of the first [[compositing window manager]]s for the X Window System that is able to take advantage of this OpenGL-acceleration, was also released.

==== KDE Desktop innovations ====
SUSE has been a leading contributor to the KDE project for many years, and now SUSE sponsors more developers to work directly within KDE than any other distribution. Hence, SUSEâs contributions in this area have been very wide-ranging, and affecting many parts of KDE such as [[kdelibs]] and [[KDEBase]], [[Kontact]], and kdenetwork. Other notable projects include:
* [http://en.opensuse.org/Projects/KNetworkManager KNetworkManager] â a front-end to [[NetworkManager]].
* [http://old-en.opensuse.org/Kickoff Kickoff] â a new K menu for KDE Plasma Desktop.

==== GNOME innovations ====
The [[Ximian]] group became part of Novell, and in turn made and continued several contributions to GNOME with applications such as [[F-Spot]], [[Novell Evolution]] and [[Banshee (music player)|Banshee]].
The GNOME desktop now uses the ''slab'' instead of the classic double-panelled GNOME menu bars.

== Releases ==
=== 10.x Series ===
The initial stable release from the openSUSE Project was SUSE Linux 10.0, released on October 6, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/06/2157223 | title=SUSE 10.0 OSS Released | author=CowboyNeal | date=October 5, 2006 | work=Slashdot | accessdate=2007-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was released as a freely downloadable [[ISO image]] and as a boxed retail package, with certain bundled software only included in the retail package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tip/16015.html | title=Packages on the retail version and not the OSS version of SUSE Linux 10.0 | author=Joe Harmon | date=September 19, 2005 | work=Novell.com | accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2006, the [[openSUSE Project]] released SUSE Linux 10.1, with the mailing list announcement identifying [[Xgl]], [[NetworkManager]], AppArmor and Xen as prominent features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-announce/2006-May/msg00002.html | title=SUSE Linux 10.1 Release | author=Andreas Jaeger | date=May 11, 2006 | work=opensuse-announce mailing list | accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their third release, the openSUSE Project renamed their distribution, releasing openSUSE 10.2 on December 7, 2006. Several areas that developers focused their efforts on were reworking the menus used to launch programs in KDE and GNOME, moving to [[ext3]] as the default [[file system]], providing support for internal readers of [[Secure Digital card]]s commonly used in [[digital camera]]s, improving [[power management]] framework (more computers can enter [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|suspended]] states instead of [[Shutdown (computing)|shutting down]] and [[booting|starting up]]) and the [[package management system]]. This release also featured version 2.0 of [[Mozilla Firefox]].

The fourth release, openSUSE 10.3, was made available as a stable version on October 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.opensuse.org/?p=400 | title=Announcing openSUSE 10.3 GM | author=Francis Giannaros | date=October 4, 2007 | work=openSUSE News | accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overhaul of the software package management system (including support for [[1-Click-Install]]), legal MP3 support from [[Fluendo]] and improved boot-time are some of the areas focused on for this release.

=== 11.x Series ===
openSUSE 11.0 was released on June 19, 2008. It includes the latest version of GNOME and two versions of KDE (the older, stable 3.5.9 and the newer 4.0.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=openSUSE 11.0 KDE4 inclusion|url=http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/bweber/entry/opensuse_110_kde4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KDE with Stephan Binner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=KDE with Stephan Binner|url=http://news.opensuse.org/2008/06/17/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-kde-with-stephan-binner/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes in three freely downloadable versions: a complete installation DVD (including GNOME, KDE3, and KDE4), and two [[Live CD]]s (GNOME, and KDE4 respectively). A KDE3 Live CD was not produced, however, due to limited resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;KDE with Stephan Binner&quot;/&gt; Package management and installation were made significantly faster with [[Zypper|ZYpp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sneak Peeks at openSUSE 11.0: Package Management|url=http://news.opensuse.org/2008/06/06/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-package-management-with-duncan-mac-vicar/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Version history ===
The openSUSE project aims to release a new version every eight months. It supports each release with critical updates for two years from the release date. Starting with version 11.2, critical updates will be provided for two releases plus two months, which at the current release cycle of 8 months would result in a support lifetime of 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loeffler (August 14, 2009). &quot;[http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2009-08/msg00009.html Change in maintenance for openSUSE 11.2 and future versions]&quot;. opensuse-announce mailing list.

== System requirements ==
openSUSE 11.3 has full support for [[32-bit]] i586 and [[64-bit]] x86-64 [[Personal computer|PC]] hardware. Official support for [[PowerPC]] (PPC) processors was dropped after openSUSE 11.1,&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=suse DistroWatch: openSUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; though an automatid PPC build is still made from Factory snapshots. The basic requirements for non-PPC hardware is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/products/opensuse/sysreqs.html OpenSUSE 11.3: Hardware Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]]: Intel [[Pentium compatible processor|Pentium]] 1â4 or [[Xeon]]; AMD [[Duron]], [[Athlon]], [[Athlon XP]], [[Athlon MP]], [[Athlon 64]], [[Sempron]] or [[Opteron]]
* [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]: 256 [[Megabyte|MB]] minimum, 512 MB recommended
* Hard drive: 500 MB for minimal system; 2.5 [[Gigabyte|GB]] recommended for standard system

The actually achievable minimum specs differ. Older processors that still belong to the i586 family are usable, for example the [[AMD K6-2]]. When excess language/translation files and documentation are removed and X is not needed, decent console-based router systems can be made using 300 MB disk space. Most console workloads also cope with 128 MB RAM at the cost of increased swap activity in tight situations.
