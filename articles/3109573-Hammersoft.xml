==Awards==
* The [[Brownlow Medal]] was awarded to [[Shane Crawford]] of [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]].
* The [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]] as the AFL's most valuable player was awarded to [[Shane Crawford]] of [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]].
* The [[Coleman Medal]] was awarded to [[Scott Cummings]] of the [[West Coast Eagles]].
* The [[Norm Smith Medal]] was awarded to [[Shannon Grant]] of the [[North Melbourne Football Club|Kangaroos]]
* The [[AFL Rising Star award]] was awarded to [[Adam Goodes]] of the  [[Sydney Swans]].
* The wooden Spoon was &quot;awarded&quot; to [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]].

==Notes==
* Richmond and Adelaide played in torrential and stormy conditions at [[Football Park]] in round 9. Under new laws that were introduced following the power outage which interrupted a game at [[Waverley Park]] in [[1996 AFL season|1996]], the captains met in the centre to decide whether to call the game off at three quarter time (accepting the progress score as final), due to the thunder and lightning having put out two light towers during half time. At that stage, Adelaide led by a point, but the captains agreed to carry on with the game. Richmond ended up winning by 9 points.
* Two weeks later, {{AFL Ric}} once again played in heavy and unyielding rain at [[Football Park]], this time against {{AFL PA}}. Port Adelaide won by the score of 4.8 (32) to 3.12 (30). It was Port Adelaide's lowest score (giving them the unique distinction of recording a victory with their lowest score) until Round 10 of 2010 (which, coincidentally, was also against Richmond at Football Park in wet weather). The match remains the last time a team has won with four or fewer goals, and remains the fifth-lowest winning score since 1912.
* [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]]'s half-time score of 21.5 (131) against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] set the new and enduring record for the highest half-time score in [[VFL/AFL]] history.
* In their round 12 game, [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] trailed [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] by 63 points early in the second quarter before recovering to win by thirteen points. This set a new record for the largest ever comeback in a [[VFL/AFL]] game, a record which would stand until [[2001 AFL season|2001]].
* The start of the Round 22 game between [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|M.C.G.]] was delayed by about half an hour after the scoreboard at the city end caught fire ten minutes before the scheduled bounce down. Players returned to the rooms, and much of the Ponsford stand was evacuated onto the playing arena.
* Tim Watson became coach of St. Kilda. They'd lose his first game as coach by 89 points. The same match marked [[Leigh Matthews]]' first match as coach of the [[Brisbane Lions]]. Brisbane's first round win put them on top of the ladder, a season after winning the wooden spoon.
* Collingwood had lost 13 straight games in a row. They finally won against Fremantle in round 8.
* [[Waverley Park]] and [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]] both hosted their final AFL games in Round 22; their absence would the following year be replaced by [[Colonial Stadium]].
