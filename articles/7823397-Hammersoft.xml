He won his regional competition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=/content/events/200102/ugl/juvboys.htm 2002 Upper Great Lakes Regional Championships Juvenile Boys]&lt;/ref&gt; the Upper Great Lakes Regional Championship, to qualify at the Juvenile level for the 2002 U.S. Junior Championships, where he placed 6th in his qualifying group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=/content/events/200102/jrnats/juvboys1c.htm 2002 U.S. Junior Figure Skating Championships Juvenile Boys Qualifying Group C]&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to place 18th overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=/content/events/200102/jrnats/juvboys-free.htm 2002 U.S. Junior Figure Skating Championships Juvenile Boys Final Standings]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2003â2004 season, Mroz moved up to the Novice level.

At Sectionals, Mroz placed fourth in the short program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=/content/events/200304/sectionals-mids/novmen-short.htm 2004 Midwestern Sectional Championships Novice Men Short Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and second in the free skate to win the silver medal overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=/content/events/200304/sectionals-mids/novmen-free.htm 2004 Midwestern Sectional Championships Novice Men Free Skate and Final Results]&lt;/ref&gt; With this medal he qualified for the [[2004 United States Figure Skating Championships|2004 U.S. Championships]] at the Novice level. At Nationals, Mroz placed 7th in the short program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200304/uschamps/novice/novmen-short.asp 2004 State Farm U.S. Figure Skating Championships Novice Men Short Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and the free skate to place 7th overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200304/uschamps/novice/novmen-free.htm 2004 State Farm U.S. Figure Skating Championships Novice Men Free Skate and Final Results]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the event, Mroz competed at the 2004 [[Copenhagen Trophy]], where he won the novice men's competition after winning both segments of the competition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiskunstlauf-ecke.de/archiv/2003-04/copenhagen_trophy_2004.shtml 2004 Copenhagen Trophy Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004â2005 season, Mroz remained on the Novice level. At his regional championships, he placed second in the short program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200405/regionals-ugl/novmen-sp.htm 2005 Upper Great Lakes Regional Championships Novice Men Short Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the free skate to win the silver medal overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200405/regionals-ugl/novmen-free.htm 2005 Upper Great Lakes Regional Championships Novice Men Free Skate and Final Standings]&lt;/ref&gt; This medal qualified him for the Midwestern Sectional Championships where he placed 8th in the short program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200405/sectionals-mid/novmen-short.htm 2005 Midwestern Sectional Championships Novice Men Short Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and 5th in the free skate to place 6th overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200405/sectionals-mid/novmen-final.htm 2005 Midwestern Sectional Championships Novice Men Free Skate and Final Standings]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this placement, he did not qualify for the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|2005 U.S. Championships]].

In the 2005â2006 season, Mroz remained on the Novice level for a third and final season. He had moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] for his training, and represented the [[Broadmoor Skating Club]] there. A switch of club meant a change of region. Competing at the Southwestern Regional Championship, Mroz won the short program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200506/regionals-sw/novicemen-short.html 2006 Southwestern Regional Championships Novice Men Short Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and the free skate to win the gold medal overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=content/events/200506/regionals-sw/novicemen-final.html 2006 Southwestern Regional Championships Novice Men Free Skate and Final Results]&lt;/ref&gt; This win qualified him for the 2006 Midwestern Sectionals where Mroz competed for the first time under the [[ISU Judging System]].

These two medals qualified Mroz for the [[2006â2007 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix Final]], to which he was the fourth-ranked qualifier overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isufs.org/events/jgp2006/jgpsmen.htm Junior Grand Prix of Figure Skating 2006 / 2007 Junior Men Final Standings]&lt;/ref&gt; By qualifying for the event, Mroz also earned a bye to the national championships and so did not need to compete at qualifying events.

These two medals qualified Mroz for the [[2007â2008 ISU Junior Grand Prix|2007â2008 Junior Grand Prix Final]], for which he was the highest-ranked qualifier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isufs.org/events/jgp2007/jgpsmen.htm Junior Grand Prix of Figure Skating 2007 / 2008 Junior Men Final Standings]&lt;/ref&gt; At the JGP Final, Mroz placed second in both segments of the competition to win the silver medal overall, placing 15.86 points behind champion [[Adam Rippon]] and 5.30 points ahead of bronze medalist [[Armin Mahbanoozadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isufs.org/results/jgpf0708/CAT001RS.HTM 2007â2008 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final Result]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that the United States had swept the Junior Grand Prix Final men's podium.

By qualifying for the JGP Final, Mroz received a bye to the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]]. At Nationals, Mroz competed for the second time on the junior level. He placed 3rd in the short program and 2nd in the free skate to win the silver medal overall, 10.13 points behind champion Rippon.
