'''Prairie View A&amp;M University''' is a [[Historically Black colleges and universities|historically black university]] located in [[Prairie View, Texas|Prairie View]], [[Texas]] (Northwest of [[Houston]]) and is a member of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]]. PVAMU offers baccalaureate degrees in 50 academic majors, 37 masterâs degrees and four doctoral degree programs through nine colleges and schools. PVAMU is one of Texas' [[land grant college|land grant universities]].

== History ==
Founded in 1876, Prairie View A&amp;M University is the second oldest state-sponsored institution of higher education in Texas.

In 1876, the [[Fifteenth Texas Legislature]], consistent with terms of the federal [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], which provided public lands for the establishment of colleges, authorized an &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Benefit of Colored Youth&quot; as part of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now [[Texas A&amp;M University]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/kcp6.html|title=Handbook of Texas Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor [[Richard B. Hubbard|Richard Hubbard]] appointed a three-man commission, including [[Ashbel Smith]], a long-time supporter of public education.  The Commissioners bought Alta Vista Plantation, near Hempstead in [[Waller County, Texas]] for $15,000, and turned the school over to the A&amp;M board. Texas A&amp;M President Thomas S. Gathright selected L. W. Minor of Mississippi as the first principal, and on March 11, 1878, eight young African-American men enrolled in the short-lived Alta Vista Agricultural College.  They were charged tuition of $130 which included nine months of instruction, board, and one uniform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt; In 1879, as the institution was struggling to find resources to continue, Governor [[Oran Roberts]] suggested closing the college.  But Barnas Sears, an agent for the Peabody Fund, persuaded the [[Sixteenth Texas Legislature]] to issue charters two [[normal school]]s for the training of teachers, one of which would be called Prairie View Normal Institute. The Texas A&amp;M College board met at Hempstead in August 1879, and established thirteen elementary and secondary subjects, and founded the coeducational institution. Women were housed in the plantation house called Kirby Hall (no longer exists), and boys were housed in a combination chapel-dormitory called Pickett Hall. Among the first faculty appointed to the new normal school was E. H. Anderson. In 1882, a strong storm damaged Pickett Hall. This came at the same time as state funds ran out. State Comptroller William M. Brown refused to continue paying the school's debts from the state's university fund, so Governor Roberts had to solicit money from merchants. E. H. Anderson died in 1885, and his brother L. C. Anderson became the principal of Prairie View.  A longstanding dispute as to the mission of the school was resolved in 1887 when the legislature added an agricultural and mechanical department, thus returning the college to its original mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt;  Historian Dr. George Wolfok wrote, ''Prairie View, A Study In Public Conscience'' 1962) âPrairie View is an institutionâa public institution. But an institution is an empty thing without the beating hearts and yearning souls of mortal men. And down the seventy-five years of Prairie Viewâs existence, men have lived and dreamed here until every blade of grass and every rock, in that wise primordial way in which the primitive earth knows and cares, has joined the choir invisible to bless their memory. For every man whose foot has touched this hallowed soil, has found a spirit, and has broadened and deepened it until what started out as an ambitionless meandering stream has become a purposeful river upon whose tide, now turbulent, now tranquil, floats the destiny of countless human hopes and dreams.â

In 1945, the name of the institution was changed from Prairie View Normal and Industrial College to Prairie View University, and the school was authorized to offer, &quot;as need arises,&quot; all courses offered at the University of Texas. In 1947, the Texas Legislature changed the name to Prairie View A&amp;M College of Texas and provided that &quot;courses be offered in agriculture, the mechanics arts, engineering, and the natural sciences connected therewith, together with any other courses authorized at Prairie View at the time of passage of this act, all of which shall be equivalent to those offered at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas at Bryan.&quot; On August 27, 1973, the name of the institution was changed to Prairie View A&amp;M University, and its status as an independent unit of the Texas A&amp;M University System was confirmed.

In 1981, the Texas Legislature acknowledged the University's rich tradition of service and identified various statewide needs which the University should address including the assistance of students of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds to realize their full potential, and assistance of small and medium-sized communities and businesses in their growth and development.

In 1983, the Texas Legislature proposed a constitutional amendment to restructure the Permanent University Fund to include Prairie View A&amp;M University as a beneficiary of its proceeds. The Permanent University Fund is a perpetual endowment fund originally established in the Constitution of 1876 for the sole benefit of Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas. The 1983 amendment also dedicated the University to enhancement as an &quot;institution of the first class&quot; under the governing board of the Texas A&amp;M University System. The constitutional amendment was approved by the voters on November 6, 1984.

In January 1985, the Board of Regents of the Texas A&amp;M University System responded to the 1984 Constitutional Amendment by stating its intention that Prairie View A&amp;M University become &quot;an institution nationally recognized in its areas of education and research.&quot; The Board also resolved that the University receive its share of the Available University Fund, as previously agreed to by Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas.

In October 2000, the Governor of Texas signed the Priority Plan, an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights to make Prairie View A&amp;M University an educational asset accessible by all Texans. The Priority Plan mandates creation of many new educational programs, including graduate degrees in engineering and education, and facilities like the state-of-the-art Don Clark Juvenile Justice and Psychology building. It also requires removing language from the Institutional Mission Statement which might give the impression of excluding any Texan from attending Prairie View A&amp;M University.

Around 2004, Oliver Kitzman, the district attorney of Waller County, attempted to challenge the voting rights of PVAMU students. As a result, the [[United States Department of Justice]] opened a civil rights investigation about Kitzman. Geoffrey Connor, the [[Texas Secretary of State]], said that PVAMU students, like other university students, have the right to vote for officials in the university's voting districts as long as they are registered to vote there.&lt;ref&gt;Kliewer, Terry. &quot;[http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Rights-probe-begins-in-student-vote-flap-1968838.php Rights probe begins in student vote flap].&quot; ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''.

==Traditions==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2011}}
Prairie View A&amp;M's traditions are deeply rooted in its heritage as Texas's oldest historically black University. One of the premier traditions is marked by student gatherings at the Abner Davis Memorial and fountain. Abner Davis, a member of the varsity football team, met with an accident in a game with Texas College in Tyler on November 4, 1927. Davis sustained a broken neck in tackling a Texas College player. He tackled low, and the playerâs knee struck his head at the base of the neck. Abner was paralyzed from his neck and shoulders down and died after an illness of seven or eight days.  Abnerâs classmates and the supervisor of the class erected a monument and plaque in his memory in the middle of the campus. Today, students and faculty still gather at the memorial to commemorate important activities on campus. 

Honorâs Week is designated for students who have achieved outstanding accomplishments during the school year. Recognition for scholarship, student leadership, citizenship and athletic prowess are among the achievements recognized. The week culminates in a special convocation.  Founderâs Day is celebrated annually by the Prairie View A&amp;M University community on March 11. Although the 15th Legislature passed an act to establish the University on Aug. 14, 1876, the University did not open its doors until March 11, 1878. In 2006, PVAMU celebrated its 130-year anniversary.  Homecoming . . . a time for welcome and celebration . . . a time to reflect on the traditions and heritage of a great University. . . a time for the return of âLoyal Panthersâ to their alma mater to embrace the current University administration, faculty, staff, students, families and friends. The focal points of this week are the football game, homecoming University family. Springfest is held each year during the spring semester after the mid-semester examination period. A variety of cultural and social events are held throughout the week for students, staff and faculty. Highlights of the weekâs activities are the Greek step show and âafter party.â
