[[Continental Airlines]] is a major American airline with a history that goes back to 1934.

==History==
=== Early history (1931â1958) ===

[[File:VarneyOrion.jpg|thumb||Varney Speed Lines [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion]] in [[Burbank, California]].]]

Continental Airlines began service in 1934 as '''Varney Speed Lines''' (named after one of its initial owners, [[Walter T. Varney]], who was also a founder of [[United Airlines]]) operating out of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and extending through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and Las Vegas, NM to [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], CO. The airline commenced operations with the [[Lockheed Vega]], a single-engine plane that carried four passengers. The airline later flew other Lockheed planes, including the [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion]], the [[Lockheed Electra Junior]], and the [[Lockheed Lodestar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;&gt;Serling, Robert J., Maverick: The story of Robert Six and Continental Airlines (ISBN 0-385-04057-1), Doubleday &amp; Company, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Following cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts by the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration in 1934, [[Robert Six]] learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines, which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as Chairman of the Board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. The carrier was renamed '''Continental Air Lines''' on July 8, 1937. (&quot;Air Lines&quot; was later changed to &quot;Airlines&quot;.) Six relocated the airline's headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in [[Denver]] in October, 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;&gt;Davies, R.E.G., Continental Airlines : the first fifty years, 1934â1984, Pioneer Publications, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Six changed the name to &quot;Continental&quot; because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;COFacts&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts Continental Facts].&quot; Continental Magazine.

[[Robert Six|Robert F. Six]] was one of the colorful group of innovators, pioneers, and visionaries (including [[Juan Trippe]], [[William A. Patterson]], [[Jack Frye]], [[C.R. Smith]], and [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]) who established and built the U.S. airline industry. Throughout his life, Six had a reputation as a combative and risk-taking executive who presided forcefully over the airline that was largely forged in his image for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;&gt;Christian, J. Scott, former Continental employee and manager, Bring Songs to the Sky: Recollections of Continental Airlines, 1970â1986, Quadran Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

During World War II, Continental's Denver maintenance facilities became a conversion center where the airline converted [[B-17]]s, [[B-29]]s and [[P-51 Mustang|P-51s]] for the United States [[Army Air Force]]. Profits from military transportation and aircraft conversion enabled Continental to contemplate expansion and acquisition of new aircraft types which became available following the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;  Among those types were the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], the [[Convair 240]] and the [[Convair 340]]. Some of the DC-3s were acquired as surplus military aircraft following World War II. The Convairs were the first aircraft operated by Continental that were [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;

[[File:1254 CAL DC7B.jpg|thumb|A [[Douglas DC-7]] in flight, 1958]]

The airline's early route network was limited to the original [[El Paso]] to Denver route, with routes being added during the Second World War from Denver and Albuquerque across Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1946, Continental had expanded new routes from Denver to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and to [[Tulsa]]/[[Oklahoma City]], and from [[El Paso]] and [[Albuquerque]] to [[San Antonio]]. Each of these routes included intermediate stops in several of 22 smaller cities. In 1953, Continental achieved its first major expansion by merging with [[Pioneer Airlines]], gaining access to 16 additional cities in Texas and [[New Mexico]]. These Pioneer destinations integrated well with Continental's post-World War II routes, and provided impetus for the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB), the industry regulator, to subsequently streamline CAL's routes from Denver to the principal traffic points in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. However, Continental was, like most US carriers of the day, essentially a limited regional operation. Bob Six was highly dissatisfied with this situation. He vigorously petitioned the CAB for longer-haul routes to larger cities, a part of his plan to transform the regional into a trunkline like [[United Airlines|United]], [[TWA]], and [[American Airlines|American]]. Simultaneously, he was quietly discussing with [[Boeing]] for Continental to become one of the first among the world's airlines to operate the soon-to-be-launched [[Boeing 707|707]] jet aircraft. The timing was crucial, since the new routes would justify the 707s, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;

===The &quot;Airline that needed to grow&quot; (1959â1969)===
[[File:corfsix.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Six]], in 1969.]]
By the end of the 1950s, Six's strategy had succeeded. Continental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes, thanks to a responsive [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAB]] and persistent efforts by Six, who frequently referred to his company as, &quot;the Airline that needs to grow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; In 1957, it flew for the first time from Chicago to Los Angeles (both nonstop, and via Denver); and nonstop from Denver and Los Angeles to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Continental Airlines introduced turboprop service with the [[Vickers Viscount]] on the new medium haul routes. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many of the smaller cities on the system, enabling the carrier's new aircraft to operate more economically between points with longer lengths-of-haul. Prior to the introduction of its Boeing 707 jets, Continental acquired the popular [[Douglas DC-7|DC-7s]] to operate its nonstop route from Los Angeles to Chicago, as well as Denver-Los Angeles and Chicago-Kansas City (see photos).&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

During the late 1950s and early 1960s Six was the airline industry's leading advocate of lower fares. He correctly predicted that increased traffic, not higher fares, was the answer to the airline industry's problems. Six stunned the industry when he introduced the [[Economy class#Economy class|economy fare]] on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which brought air travel to many who otherwise could not have afforded it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

As Six had planned, Continental was one of the earliest operators of the [[Boeing 707]], taking delivery of its first of five 707-124s in spring of 1959 and starting Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Continental's small 707 fleet required radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. Continental developed an industry first: the &quot;progressive maintenance&quot; program enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, 16 hours a day, achieving the greatest jet utilization of any airline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} (The March 1961 OAG shows CO's five 707s flying seven round trips a day between Los Angeles and Chicago (not all nonstop); the only other jet service was a Continental/American interchange 707 Houston-El Paso-Los Angeles and back.)

Six, not being satisfied with 707 service alone, introduced exclusive innovations and luxe cuisine with Continental's 707 operations which were described as, &quot;... nothing short of luxurious&quot; by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and, &quot;... clearly, the finest in the airline industry&quot; by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

[[File:83476 CAL B707 LAX proctor.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 707]] at Los Angeles, 1967]]

Beginning in the early 1960s, Continental added routes from Los Angeles to [[Houston]], both nonstop and with 1- and 2-stop services to Houston via [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Tucson]], [[El Paso]], [[Midland-Odessa]], [[Austin]], and [[San Antonio]]. New service was also inaugurated from Denver to [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Houston]] (to Houston: both nonstop, and with 1- and 2-stop services via [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]/[[Tulsa]]/[[Oklahoma City]]). In 1963, the company's headquarters were moved from Denver to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

During the late 1960s, the company disposed of the last of its turboprop and piston-powered aircraftâone of the first U.S. airlines to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt; Continental replaced the Viscount fleet with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9s]] from Douglas Aircraft and began an aggressive acquisition of [[Boeing 727]] aircraft. These two types (DC-9 and B-727) were to become the workhorses of the Continental fleet from the late 1960s, and for the next twenty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt; The DC-9s were phased out and by the mid to late seventies, Continental used the 727 for its narrow body fleet. In 1968, a new systemwide Continental Airlines [[livery]] was launched, the orange and gold [[cheatline]]s adorned with a black &quot;jetstream&quot; logo (by Six's friend, the noted graphic designer [[Saul Bass]]) on the jets' tails (logo was later altered to red; see photo of 747). The marketing slogans adopted in 1968 and employed for about a decade were, &quot;The Airline That Pride Built&quot; and, &quot;The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Continental had been awarded routes to New Zealand and Australia, in the Transpacific Case, but were cancelled by the Nixon Administration.

Throughout the [[Vietnam War]], Continental provided extensive cargo and troop transportation for [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] forces to Asian and the Pacific bases.; in 1967 Continental's unscheduled passenger traffic exceeded its scheduled traffic by 50%. Continental's 707s were the most common non-military aircraft transiting [[Saigon]] [[Tan Son Nhat]] airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; As a result of Continental's experience in Pacific operations, the carrier formed subsidiary [[Air Micronesia]] in May 1968, inaugurating [[island hopping]] routes between [[Yap]]/[[Saipan]]/[[Guam]], [[Majuro]], Rota, [[Truk]], Ponape ([[Pohnpei]]) and Honolulu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;  &quot;Air Mike&quot;, as it was known, initially operated with [[Boeing 727-100]] aircraft specially outfitted with open-ocean survival gear, doppler radar, and a large complement of spare parts (including tires).&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt; A senior mechanic flew aboard every Air Mike flight until the late 1970s. Air Micronesia now operates as subsidiary [[Continental Micronesia]].

September 1969 saw the realization of a long-cherished goal: introduction of Continental service from Los Angeles to [[Honolulu]]/[[Hilo]]; and in 1970, Continental was awarded routes from Seattle and Portland to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Hollywood-Burbank Airport]], and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], Californiaâall rapidly growing airline markets. Nonstop San Francisco to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Dallas]] services were added in the same year .&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;

====First African-American pilot====
In 1963, Continental was forced to hire the first African-American pilot to work for any major carrier in the United States, [[Marlon Green|Marlon D. Green]]. Although Continental Airlines first denied him a position as a pilot, after a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision allowed a [[Colorado]] anti-discrimination law to be applied to his case against Continental.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court, '''COLORADO COMM'N v. CONTINENTAL, 372 U.S. 714 (1963) 372 U.S. 714 COLORADO ANTI-DISCRIMINATION COMMISSION ET AL. v. CONTINENTAL AIR LINES, INC.''' CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO. No. 146. Argued March 28, 1963. Decided April 22, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Green flew with Continental Airlines for 13 years, between 1965 until his retirement in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;COFacts&quot;/&gt; Continental's hiring of Marlon Green paved the way for the hiring of minority pilots by all U.S. carriers, an industry milestone which was finally realized in 1977 after [[Southern Airways]] and [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont]] hired their first minority pilots.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Continental and the widebody era (1970â1976)===
[[File:Continental Airlines B747 Polynesian Pub.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Polynesian Pub, 1972]]
At Six's insistence, Continental (with [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Trans World Airlines]]) was a launch airline for the [[Boeing 747]] aircraft. On June 26, 1970, Continental became the second carrier (after TWA) to put the 747 into U.S. domestic service. Its upper-deck first class lounge and main deck &quot;Polynesian Pub&quot; won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental's Cordon Bleu-trained executive chef, Lucien DeKeyser.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;  Continental's 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; When asked by one Denver customer service agent in 1974 why he flew Continental wherever he could, Hollywood legend [[Henry Fonda]] remarked, &quot;This operation is class; strictly class!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

On June 1, 1972, Continental's widebody [[DC-10]] service began. Six had insisted that Continental place a large order for DC-10s with manufacturer [[McDonnell Douglas]]. This decision again proved prescient, since the publicity associated with Continental's splashy 747 service in the Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles-Honolulu backbone corridor had stimulated not only increased market share, but increased traffic for all carriers in the markets. Additionally Denver, [[Houston]] and [[Seattle]] were experiencing very rapid growth. The DC-10s quickly assumed most of the duties of flying between Denver and Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle (and between Houston-Los Angeles).&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

[[File:7845 CAL FAs c1972.jpg|thumb|left|Flight attendant uniforms, 1972]]

During the 1970s, Denver continued to be the central hub of the Continental system. The 747s were focused on the Chicago-Los Angeles-Honolulu routes, with a single daily round trip through Denver. The DC-10 aircraft operated in large inter-city markets (usually from Los Angeles to Chicago, Denver, Houston and Honolulu; and from Denver to Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston). DC-9 and B-727 types predominated over the rest of the system, as well as supplementing frequencies in the DC-10 markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Next to [[Braniff]], Continental operated fewer aircraft types (four: the [[Boeing 747|B-747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]], [[Boeing 727|B-727-200]], and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC9-10]]) during this period than any U.S. trunkline, affording substantial savings in parts, maintenance, and crew training logistics and costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

The DC-10 enabled the airline to capitalize on the burgeoning traffic growth in western U.S. markets. Continental saw market share grow annually in each DC-10 market through the 1970s, until relative market parity was achieved with United, the principal competitor on most of the DC-10 routes. The same service innovations introduced to the 747 fleet were initially implemented on the DC-10s, including the &quot;Polynesian Pub&quot;; although after the [[1973 oil crisis]]-induced fuel price increases, higher [[seating capacity]] was needed to achieve profitable economics, and the DC-10 pubs would be removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Continental phased out its 747s in favor of the DC-10s. From the mid seventies until it was merged with Texas International, the airline operated just two types of aircraft, the DC-10 and the 727.

According to Six biographer Robert Serling, quality was the watchword in every detail of Continental's operations in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt; In one anecdotal indication of Six's passion for premium customer service, every page of the airline's Customer Service Manual was inscribed with these words: &quot;Nothing in this manual supersedes common sense.&quot; Bob Six relentlessly prowled the Continental system, as well as competitors' flights, to assure tight quality standards and to search for ideas that could be adopted to Continental's network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; The airline credits Six with instituting a culture promoting customer service.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Continental Airlines Ranked No. 1 World's Most Admired Airline by FORTUNE Magazine&quot;. Reuters (2008-03-11). Retrieved on 2008-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1961 to 1982, Continental was headquartered at the western end of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] property. The facility included the general offices, flight control, central maintenance facility, flight kitchen, and Los Angeles crew bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;''World Airline Directory''.

===Deregulation and expansion (1977â1980)===
[[File:Continental 747., Los Angeles, 1987.jpg|thumb|Continental 747 at Los Angeles in the 1980s]]

In 1974, after years of delays and legal proceedings, Continental inaugurated service between [[Houston]] and Miami, and on May 21, 1976, Continental was authorized to operate between [[San Diego]] and [[Denver]]âboth routes had been long-sought, and signaled a new era of rapid growth for Continental. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] chairman [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry (see [[Airline Deregulation Act]]), which would dissolve the CAB and for the first time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge for their services. In this context, 1977 was an historic year for Continental and the industry at large, as the CAB began to loosen its regulatory grip. Continental began service from Denver to Miami/[[Ft. Lauderdale]] and [[Tampa]]/St. Petersburg.  In that same year, President [[Jimmy Carter]] authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between [[Air Micronesia]] destination [[Saipan]] and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via [[Honolulu]], [[American Samoa]], [[Fiji]], [[New Zealand]] and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

After the 1978 passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], Continental embarked on an aggressive program of route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to [[Houston]] and Denver, and from Denver to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;  That same month, Continental inaugurated DC-10 service between Los Angeles and [[Taipei]], via Honolulu and [[Guam]]. Service between [[Houston]] and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979, Continental linked [[Denver]] with Washington, D.C., [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], San Francisco and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and also began [[Houston]]-[[Tampa]] service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Given that Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, and the rapid expansion in the air was answered with large-scale facilities expansions at each of these airports.  In Denver, Continental's very rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new [[Denver International Airport]], which would be completed almost fifteen years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Continental Airlines DC-10-10 N68042.jpg|thumb|left|Continental DC-10 at Narita Airport, Japan]]

During 1978, Continental explored the possibility of a merger with [[Western Airlines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Western was also headquartered at Los Angeles International Airport ([[LAX]]) and operated a fleet consisting predominantly of the same B-727 and DC-10 aircraft types as Continental. The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; because, although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the [[Great Plains]] states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, [[Alaska]], [[Mexico]], and the [[intermountain West]]. Both airlines served the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Rocky Mountain]] states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, [[Denver]], San Francisco, [[Seattle]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. This merger was not consummated, however, and industry changes were to take Continental down a very different path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

Unlike some airlines (notably [[Braniff]] whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's rate of expansion following passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] seems, in retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, and formed a strong financial base for the wrenching challenges which the company would face between 1982 and 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;

===Acquisition by Texas Air Corporation (1981â1982)===
[[File:FAA Frank Lorenzo 6336.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lorenzo]], Continental CEO, 1981â1990]]

In 1981 [[Texas Air Corporation]], an airline holding company controlled by U.S. aviation entrepreneur and raider [[Frank Lorenzo]], acquired Continental after a contentious battle with Continental's management who were determined to resist Lorenzo. Continental's labor unions also fiercely resisted, fearing what they termed as, &quot;Lorenzo's deregulation tactics,&quot; which meant that he wanted to make Continental a non-union airline.  During this struggle, Continental Airlines President, A. L. Feldman, committed suicide, on August 9, 1981, in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Texas Air Corp. prevailed. Frank Lorenzo became Continental's new Chairman and CEO. On October 31, 1982 Continental merged with [[Texas International]] (the merged carrier retained the Continental name, brand, and identity; the TI brand and identity disappeared), offering service to four continents (North and South America, Asia and Australia) with a fleet of 112 aircraft.  The &quot;new Continental&quot; relocated its headquarters to Texas Air's base in Houston, Texas. The merger resulted in a large expansion of Continental's hub at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston Intercontinental Airport]] and extensive new routes to Mexico and the south central U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckley|first=William F. Jr.|volume=5|first2=Frank|last2=Lorenzo|journal=National Review|date=September 17, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airline unions fought Lorenzo and Continental at every step. In the Federal courts, they unsuccessfully sued to stop the company's reorganization. They were successful in working to persuade Congress to pass a new bankruptcy law preventing bankrupt companies from terminating contracts as Continental had successfully done. The law was too late to affect Continental and the  cost cutting and changes that had rescued it from liquidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Delaney|first=Kevin J.|title=Strategic Bankruptcy: How Corporations and Creditors Use Chapter 11 to Their Advantage|isbn=0-520-07359-2|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First bankruptcy &amp; labor relations (1983â1984)===
Frank Lorenzo took Continental into [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] on September 23, 1983, after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a lower pay rate with labor unions.   Rebuilding the company began immediately.  Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreement on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline's labor costs at the cost of employee morale.&lt;ref&gt;Moss Kanter, Rosabeth, Confidence â How Winning Streaks and Losing Streaks Begin and End (ISBN 1-4000-5290-4), Crown Business, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This move made Continental vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S., but had notable negative impact on employee attitudes and loyalty. In financial terms, the airline's decision to take bankruptcy workedâby the end of 1984, Continental recorded a $50 million profit. On June 30, 1986, Continental emerged from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;/&gt;  Continental has the distinction of being the first U.S. airline to fly through bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;/&gt;

===Consolidation causes rapid growth (1985â1989)===

On April 28, 1985, Continental began its rebound, as signaled by the inauguration of its first ever scheduled service to Europe with flights from [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] and [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]] to [[London Gatwick Airport|London]].  Soon thereafter, services to Paris, [[Frankfurt]], [[Madrid]] and [[Munich]] were added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]], opening a bidding war with [[People Express]], which was headed by Lorenzo's former TI associate [[Donald Burr|Don Burr]]. PeopleExpress paid a substantial premium for Frontier's high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view, but was in the opinion of most industry analysts rather an attempt by Burr to best his former boss, Frank Lorenzo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;/&gt;

On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With People Express hemorrhaging cash, Texas Air acquired PeopleExpress on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier whose strong network in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental's already formidable Denver hub. Because it had been the largest airline operating in the New York market, the PeopleExpress hub at Newark would permit Continental to expand its east coast services dramatically for the first time in its history.  Continental soon became the third-largest airline in the U.S., and the predominant force in the New York, Denver and Houston airline markets. Continental emerged from bankruptcy in 1986 with improved asset and cash flow positions and a more competitive route structure with routes radiating to every large U.S. city from major hubs at Denver and Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;/&gt;

On February 1, 1987, [[People Express]], [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier]], [[New York Air]], and several commuter carriers were merged into Continental Airlines to create the third-largest U.S. airline (and sixth largest airline in the world).  In so doing, Continental became an even larger player in the northeastern markets. 1987 saw the creation of Continental's OnePass frequent flier program (jointly with [[Eastern Airlines]]); and, in 1988 Continental formed its first strategic partnership (and the first international [[airline alliance]] of its kind) with [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

===Second bankruptcy &amp; new management success (1990â1997)===
[[File:Continentalarena002.jpg|thumb|Continental's reemergence from its second bankruptcy was signaled by its taking on the naming rights to New Jersey's [[Continental Airlines Arena]], which it held until 2007.]]

In 1990, Frank Lorenzo retired after 18 years at the helm of Texas International and later Texas Air and Continental Airlines, selling the majority of his Jet Capital Corporation to [[Scandinavian Airlines System|Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS)]]. According to [[William F. Buckley]], in his September 17, 1990 article on ''[[National Review]]'', the sale to SAS was conditioned on Lorenzo leaving the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;/&gt;

On December 3, 1990, Continental filed for its second bankruptcy in a decade. Circumstances behind the second bankruptcy included:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/business/continental-bankruptcy-study-seen.html | work=The New York Times | title=Continental Bankruptcy Study Seen | first=Eric | last=Weiner | date=October 24, 1990 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lorenzo had dedicated himself almost full time to [[Eastern Air Lines]] acquisition and labor relations issues;
* the 1990 [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] and the resultant [[Gulf War]] had prompted a dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel
* People Express had been highly leveraged at the time of its merger with Continental, having purchased [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]] just two years before.

In addition to Lorenzo embarking on deals which saddled the airline with other carriers' debts, he also began consolidating the different airlines into one system. That resulted in a fleet comprising numerous aircraft types, evident in the patchwork array of liveries in the Continental fleet that lasted until Gordon Bethune ordered all planes to be painted into the current livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/112407683.html?dids=112407683:112407683&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+30%2C+1993&amp;author=Suzanne+Wooton&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Despite+foes%2C+Lorenzo+applies+to+start+Friendship+Airlines&amp;pqatl=google |title=Despite foes, Lorenzo applies to start Friendship Airlines |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1993-03-30 |accessdate=2010-05-04 | first=Suzanne | last=Wooton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, following a dramatic reduction of service by [[United Airlines]] and an unsuccessful attempt by [[USAir]] to establish point-to-point service, Continental expanded at [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and established what would become its third-largest system hub. Continental quickly gained nearly all of the gates in the airport's C concourse (once dominated by United), and later expanded that concourse in addition to constructing a new Concourse D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53656072.html |title=Continental Airlines to Expand Cleveland Hub. â Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News &amp;#124; HighBeam Research â FREE trial |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=1999-01-27 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:continental b757-200 n18119 landing arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] in 1991âcurrent livery]]

On February 12, 1991, Continental unveiled its new and current blue and gray livery and the &quot;globe&quot; logo.  These continue to be the identity for Continental's fleet and facilities identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5469475_ITM |title=Article: Strategy, not failure.

In 1993 [[Air Canada]], [[Air Partners]] and [[Texas Pacific Group]], enabled Continental to emerge from bankruptcy by investing $450 million in the airline.  Under the leadership of former Boeing executive [[Gordon Bethune]], who became President in October 1994, Continental began a successful transformation project.&lt;ref&gt;Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009, Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees, Cornell University Press, Ithaca: Chapter 6: www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup_detail.taf?ti_id=5284.&lt;/ref&gt; When Bethune took over in 1994 as COO and President of Continental Airlines the troubled airline had twice faced bankruptcy and was again headed that direction. A search firm hired by Continental's board of directors suggested Bethune, who had recently completed an Advanced Management Course at the Harvard Business School, to salvage the company.

Bethune quickly made his mark on the carrier recognizing that a good airline was defined by customer satisfaction, not just cost per available seat mile. Bethune ascended to the role of CEO and was elected chairman of the board of directors in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22519369.html |title=CONTINENTAL CEO IS NOW CHAIRMAN, TOO â The Record (Bergen County, NJ) &amp;#124; HighBeam Research â FREE trial |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=1996-10-02 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continental went from being ranked last in every measurable performance category to winning more J.D. Power and Associates awards for Customer Satisfaction than any other airline in the world. BusinessWeek magazine named Bethune one of the top 25 Global Managers in 1996 and 1997. Under his leadership Continental's stock price rose from $2 to over $50 per share. Fortune magazine named Continental among the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America for six consecutive years. In his final year piloting the airline Fortune magazine ranked Continental 2004's No. 1 Most Admired Global Airline, a title it earned again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.[1] Bethune released his book, ''[[From Worst to First]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Bethune, Gordon, From Worst to First: Behind the scenes of Continental's remarkable comeback (ISBN 978-0471356523), Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 detailing his success at that carrier.[2]

[[File:Continental b777-200 n69020 arp.jpg|thumb||The [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]], Continental's long-haul flagship{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;!--Needs a source saying that the airline considers the equipment to be a flagship--&gt;]]

While at Continental, Mr. Bethune created the Go-Forward plan, to fix problems with the airline, which included employee morale, the quality of the product, and the route structure, among others. He is credited, along with his management team, for saving Continental from extinction.[3]
Bethune began by ordering new aircraft in an effort to convert to an all-[[Boeing]] fleet. After the opening of [[Denver International Airport]] on February 28, 1995, Continental management decided that the [[Denver]] hub â its historic operational base and heart of the system for almost 60 years â would be abruptly reduced to spoke status (with service only to Houston, Newark, and Cleveland). This decision centered on cost-reductions, since DIA charges and landing fees were substantially higher than those at [[Stapleton International Airport|Stapleton]], which DIA had replaced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Between [[1993]] and [[1995]], Continental experimented with an 'airline within an airline' by launching CALite, later renamed [[Continental Lite]], which provided all-economy, low-fare, no-frills service between primarily leisure destinations.  Continental Lite operated with a dedicated fleet of 100 [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] and [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] aircraft, each repainted with the 'Lite' livery and stripped of its first class cabin.  (The Continental Lite experiment was rumored to be the result of &quot;extra&quot; aircraft on hand following the closure of Continental's Denver hub.)  This service was based primarily at Continental's existing hub in [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport|Cleveland]] as well as a new hub established in [[Piedmont Triad International Airport|Greensboro, NC]].  The experiment, which had been developed and launched by Bethune's predecessor, Robert Ferguson, proved unsuccessful and the brand was dissolved in 1995.  Continental's short-lived [[Piedmont Triad International Airport|Greensboro]] hub was dismantled in the process.  

On March 26, 1996 Continental launched the first phase of its website.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18130509.html CONTINENTAL AIRLINES FLIES ONTO THE INTERNET].&quot; ''PR Newswire''. March 26, 1996. Retrieved on May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period Continental was the subject of hostile takeover bids submitted by then Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. The final deal struck, as described by Bethune in his book, with Northwest allowed Continental to keep its corporate identity but all major decisions, mergers and alliances, were controlled by means of a &quot;golden share&quot; owned by Northwest Airlines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===International expansion begins (1997â2007)===
Beginning in 1998, Continental again embarked on a program to expand its international operations. In that year it inaugurated services to [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], and in October 1998 the airline received its first [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] aircraft, allowing non-stop flights from Newark and Houston to [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo, Japan]], and from Newark to [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Tel Aviv, Israel]]. Continental in the same year launched partnerships with [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Copa Airlines]], [[Avant Airlines]], [[Transbrasil]], and [[Cape Air]], and Continental and [[America West Airlines]] became the first two US airlines to launch interline electronic ticketing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/company/history/1991-2000.aspx].&quot; ''Continental Airlines Expands''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Continental Airlines started service between Newark and Zurich, Switzerland, and from Cleveland to London. The Cleveland to London originally flew from Cleveland Hopkins International to London's Gatwick Airport, but moved in 2009 to London Heathrow. Due to the economic situation, this flight was suspended.

On March 1, 2001, Continental launched non-stop service from Newark to [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]], operating over the North circumpolar route.  This service was the first non-stop long-haul route for any airline with flying duration exceeding 16 hours. The [[SARS]] outbreak in Asia caused service to be suspended until August 1, 2003. The launch in 2001 initiated a brief battle between Continental, [[United Airlines]] and [[Cathay Pacific]] over rights to non-stop flights between Hong Kong and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/30/opinion/from-newark-over-the-north-pole.html | work=The New York Times | title=From Newark Over the North Pole | date=March 30, 2001 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 non-stop daily services were started between Newark and Geneva, Switzerland and between Newark and Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. On September 13, 2004 Continental entered [[SkyTeam]] alliance along with Northwest/KLM and CSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2004/09/13/daily3.html |title=Continental joins SkyTeam Alliance â Houston Business Journal: |publisher=Houston.bizjournals.com |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continental introduced new non-stop services to [[Oslo]], Norway and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] in 2004.  In 2005, Continental expanded service from Newark to Beijing after being awarded the China route. During the same year, five new European destinations were added: [[Stockholm-Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]] in Sweden, [[Belfast International Airport|Belfast]] and  [[Bristol International Airport|Bristol]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg]] and [[Tegel Airport|Berlin]] in Germany. Services were added to [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] and [[Cologne]], Germany in 2006, and to [[Athens]], Greece in 2007.  Among U.S. airlines, only Delta (with its extensive network of legacy routes dating from Delta's acquisition of Pan American's European network) serves more European destinations than Continental.

In 2005 service to Asia was expanded as Continental introduced daily nonstop service between Newark and New Delhi, India.  The success of this Newark-New Delhi route presaged establishment of a second gateway in India with the announcement of daily nonstop service to [[Mumbai]].  With the establishment of Mumbai service, Continental offers the most nonstop flights by any carrier from the United States to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=smh |url=http://www.asiatraveltips.com/news05/64-Delhi.shtml |title=Continental Airlines to launch non-stop Flights between New York and New Delhi |publisher=Asiatraveltips.com |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2006, the carrier's passenger traffic surpassed that of [[Northwest Airlines]], and Continental became the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, the first change in the top-five passenger enplanement rankings since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-05-30-nwa-no5_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Trimmer Northwest now flies as No. 5 | first1=Jewel | last1=Gopwani | first2=Detroit | last2=Free | date=May 30, 2006 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on December 12, 2007 that Continental was in merger discussions with [[United Airlines]]. Of issue would be Continental's [[golden share]] held by [[Northwest Airlines]], dating from a stakeholding relationship during the late 1990s, and the divestiture of Continental's Guamanian hub.

'''January 2009''' â Continental was the first commercial carrier to successfully demonstrate the use of sustainable biofuel to power an aircraft in North America. During the demonstration flight, Continentalâs test pilots successfully conducted a number of flight maneuvers, and the biofuel met all performance requirements as compared to traditional jet fuel. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants, both sustainable, second-generation sources that do not impact food crops or water resources or contribute to deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2009/01/12/news/business/doc4967d159ca7b0632086096.txt|title=Continental Airlines Continental Airlines tests biofuel in flight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
