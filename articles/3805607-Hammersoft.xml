'''Dallas Christian College (DCC)''' is a four-year undergraduate institution affiliated with the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ|Christian Church]].  Despite its name it is located in the suburb of [[Farmers Branch, Texas]].

== History ==
On 10 May 1949, Vernon Newland met with 40 concerned Texas church leaders to discuss establishing a [[Bible college]] in the [[Dallas]] area to train men and women for the [[Religious ministry (Christian)|ministry]]. Dallas Christian College opened for classes in [[Downtown Dallas]] on September 12, 1950. The present [[campus]] is located in Farmers Branch, a suburb just north of Dallas. The school has grown much and has trained more than 2,000 students for the ministry. It is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association for Biblical Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org CHEA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
DCC has menâs and womenâs basketball and soccer teams as well as the addition of a men's baseball team as of fall 2009. They compete in the [[NCCAA]] and the [[Association of Christian College Athletics|ACCA]].

== Concert Choir ==
They go on an annual choir tour where they sing at community churches across the country. In 2006 they joined the [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] Meadows Choir to sing at the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in Dallas.

== Quote from the President ==
''Dallas Christian College has been a place where men and women have come to dream about their places in the kingdom...it has been a place where they were actually equipped to fulfill those dreams'' -President Dustin D. Rubeck &lt;ref&gt;[http://dallas.edu/About/president.cfm Quotation on Dallas Christian website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
''Educating and Mentoring Students to Be People of Influence, Under Godâs Influence, For a Life of Influence''
