===Pre-season coaching changes===

On November 21, the day after Kent State's seventh loss of the season assured them of a losing record, Doug Martin announced that he would resign at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.kentstatesports.com/sports/fball/2010-11/releases/20101121unj5js |title=Doug Martin To Step Down Following Fridayâs Game With Ohio |date=2010-11-21 |accessdate=2010-12-20 |publisher=Kent State University |quote=Kent State University head football coach Doug Martin announced today that he is resigning following the Golden Flashes' game this Friday (Nov. 26) with Ohio in Dix Stadium. Martin informed Director of Athletics Joel Nielsen of his decision Sunday afternoon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, Kent State athletic director [[Joel Nielsen]] introduced former Ohio State receivers coach [[Darrell Hazell]] as the new head coach for the Golden Flashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5939930 |title=Kent State hires Darrell Hazell |publisher=ESPN |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazell was the first Ohio State assistant coach to leave for a head coaching job in six years; the last was [[Mark Snyder]], who was hired by Marshall in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/21246/tressel-statement-on-hazells-departure |title=Tressel statement on Hazell's departure |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2010-12-21 |quote=Amazingly, Hazell is the first Tressel assistant to leave Ohio State for a head-coaching position since defensive coordinator Mark Snyder left for Marshall after the 2004 season.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, three days after Ball State concluded its season with a 4-8 record, Ball State athletic director [[Tom Collins (athletic director)|Tom Collins]] announced the firing of Stan Parrish, saying, &quot;As we evaluated the on-field performance and the football program in its entirety, we decided it was time for a change in direction in the leadership of the program&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5845421 |title=Stan Parrish out at Ball State |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2010-12-20 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, Collins announced that he had hired [[Pete Lembo]], formerly the head coach at [[Elon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/35689/pete-lembo-hired-as-ball-state-coach |title=Pete Lembo hired as Ball State coach |last=Adelson |first=Andrea |date=2010-12-19 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, Northern Illinois head coach Jerry Kill accepted the position of head coach for the [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota Golden Gophers]].  His announcement came less than two weeks before the Huskies were scheduled to play in the [[2010 Humanitarian Bowl|Humanitarian Bowl]].  Leaving the team in the manner he did (many teammates learned about his new job via [[Twitter]] instead of from Kill himself&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2010/12/13/sahly-huskies-handle-new-coach-hire-with-class/axivg1h/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=December 2010}}) dealt an emotional blow to the members of the team; star quarterback Chandler Harnish saying about Kill's departure, &quot;I have a horrible taste in my mouth&quot;.  Additionally, besides the emotional impact, [[USA Today]] noted &quot;The timing of the announcement further hurts the program due to Kill most likely taking the bulk of his staff to Minnesota.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/mac/nillinois.htm |title=Northern Illinois - Team Notes |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23 |work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 9, linebackers coach [[Tom Matukewicz]] was announced as the interim head coach for the Huskies bowl game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.niu.edu/2010/12/07/12132/ |title=Tom Matukewicz named NIU football interim head coach |publisher=Northern Illinois University |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 13, the university hired [[Wisconsin Badgers]] defensive coordinator [[Dave Doeren]] as the head coach, to begin after the Humanitarian Bowl.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

On December 12, [[ESPN]] reported that Al Golden was offered and accepted the head coaching job at the University of Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5912786 |title=Source: Al Golden accepts offer to coach at Miami making $1,500,000 per year. |publisher=ESPN |first=Bruce |last=Feldman |date=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2010 season, provisions requiring bowls to pick teams with seven or more wins if available before picking six-win teams were eliminated from NCAA bylaws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D111.pdf |title=Bylaw 18.7.2 Postseason Football Championship and Postseason Bowl Licensing. |work=2010â11 NCAA Division I Manual |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |format=PDF |page=316â17}} Note that there is no provision in this rule that gives any preference to teams with seven or more wins over 6â6 teams.&lt;/ref&gt; and Temple was the first team go uninvited under the rule change, despite going 8â4 including a win over eventual [[Big East Conference|Big East]] BCS representative [[2010 Connecticut Huskies football team|Connecticut]].
