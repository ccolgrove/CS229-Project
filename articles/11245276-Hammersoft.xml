{{Music of Final Fantasy}}
The music of the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' was composed by [[Naoshi Mizuta]] along with regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] and [[Kumi Tanioka]]. The ''Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack'', a compilation of almost all of the music in the game, was released by [[DigiCube]] in 2002, and subsequently re-released by [[Square Enix]] in 2004. ''Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart Original Soundtrack'' was released by DigiCube in 2003 after the release of the ''Rise of the Zilart'' expansion for ''Final Fantasy XI'', and re-released by Square Enix in 2004. ''Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Original Soundtrack'' was produced by Square Enix in 2004 after the release of the ''Chains of Promathia'' expansion, and in 2005 Square Enix published ''Music from the Other Side of Vana'diel'', a collection of [[arrangement|arranged]] tracks from the game performed by ''The Star Onions'', a group composed of Square Enix composers including Naoshi Mizuta, Kumi Tanioka and Hidenori Iwasaki. ''Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Aht Urhgan Original Soundtrack'' was released by Square Enix in 2006 for the ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan'' expansion.  

In 2007, Square Enix released the ''Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack Premium Box'', a collection of all of the previously released albums, as well as the as yet unreleased ''Final Fantasy XI Unreleased Tracks'' and ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy XI'', an album of unreleased music from the game and its expansions and an album of [[piano]] arrangements of music from the game, respectively.  After the release of the fourth expansion for the game, ''Final Fantasy XI Wings of the Goddess Original Soundtrack'' was released in 2008 by Square Enix. Additionally, in summer 2008 another ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy XI'' album, completely separate from the previous piano collections album, will be released by Square Enix.

The music has received mixed reviews; while reviewers have praised some of the associated albums such as ''Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart Original Soundtrack'' and ''Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Aht Urhgan Original Soundtrack'', other albums, such as ''Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Original Soundtrack'' and ''Music from the Other Side of Vana'diel'', were not as universally liked. Several songs, especially &quot;Distant Worlds&quot;, remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series, as well as been published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups.

==Creation and influence==
The music of ''Final Fantasy XI'' was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Kumi Tanioka.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFROTZ&quot;/&gt; Composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] was also asked to contribute, but he was busy scoring ''[[Xenosaga]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;esper&quot;/&gt; The expansion packs were scored by Mizuta alone after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix, although their names remain in the credits for those albums due to the inclusion of versions of songs they had previously composed for the game. The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;esper&quot;/&gt; According to Uematsu, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers' hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation. He also noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline, a major change from the previous ''Final Fantasy'' games. It was the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square employee.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-1&quot;/&gt; New music has been employed for special events, such as a holiday score titled ''Jeuno -Starlight Celebration-'' which can be heard in the city of Jeuno each mid to late December since 2004. Some of the game's music has been released on [[iTunes]] for download, such as the vocal &quot;Distant Worlds&quot;, which was released on the Japanese iTunes Music Store on September 13, 2005, having been put in the game in a July 2005 patch.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-2&quot;/&gt;
