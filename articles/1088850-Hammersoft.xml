{{Campaignbox Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon}}
The '''1978 South Lebanon conflict''' (code-named '''Operation ''Litani''''' by Israel) was an invasion in [[Lebanon]] up to the [[Litani River]] carried out by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in 1978. It was a military success for the Israeli Defense Forces, as [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] forces were pushed north of the river. However, objections from the Lebanese government led to the creation of the [[United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon|UNIFIL]] peacekeeping force and a partial [[Israel]]i withdrawal.

== Background ==
{{main|IsraeliâLebanese conflict}}
Though it took the form of an Israeli military incursion into [[Southern Lebanon]], Operation Litani was grounded in the long-running [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. From 1968 on, the [[PLO]], [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and other [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] groups established a quasi-state in southern Lebanon, using it as a base for raids on civilian targets in northern Israel. This was exacerbated by an influx of 3,000 PLO militants fleeing a defeat in the [[Black September in Jordan|Jordanian civil war]] and regrouping in southern Lebanon. Israel responded with damaging attacks against PLO bases. 

During Israeli raids from 1968 to 1977, some of the Palestinian towns and camps in the area were totally leveled. According to estimations, by October 1977 about 300.000 refugees, mainly Shiite Muslims, fled South Lebanon.&lt;ref name = &quot;C91&quot;&gt;Chomsky. 1983 p.191&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 1977 Israeli initiated exchange of fire, that led to the death of several people from both sides of the border and finally Israeli bombing of the targets in South Lebanon during which 70 people, mainly Lebanese, were killed.&lt;ref name = &quot;C91&quot;/&gt;

Violence escalated, eventually culminating in the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the ejection of the PLO from the country.

On 11 March 1978, 11 [[Fatah]] members led by the 18-year old female [[Dalal Mughrabi]] travelled from Lebanon and killed an American tourist on the beach. They then hijacked a bus on the coastal road near [[Haifa]], and en route to [[Tel Aviv]] commandeered a second bus. After a lengthy chase and shootout, 37 Israelis were killed and 76 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1977-1979/133%20Statement%20to%20the%20press%20by%20Prime%20Minister%20Begin Statement to the press by Prime Minister Begin on the massacre of Israelis on the Haifa-Tel Aviv Road].  Historical Documents Archive: 12 March 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[Coastal Road Massacre]], was the proximate cause of the Israeli invasion three days later. (Cobban, p.&amp;nbsp;94, Shlaim p.&amp;nbsp;369), though the raiders came not from the area that was invaded, but from the area relatively far to the north from it.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chomsk&quot;/&gt;
The PLO-Israeli conflict increased political tensions between [[Maronite]] Christians and [[Druze]] to the [[Muslim]]s, adding to the factors behind the 1975â1990 [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Course of fighting ==
On March 14, 1978, Israel launched Operation Litani, occupying the area south of the [[Litani River]], excepting [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], with over 25,000 soldiers. Its stated goals were to push Palestinian militant groups, particularly the [[PLO]], away from the border with Israel, and to bolster Israel's ally at the time, the [[South Lebanon Army]] because of the attacks against Lebanese Christians and Jews and because of the relentless shelling into Northern Israel. During the 7-day offensive, the Israeli Defence Forces first captured a belt of land approximately 10&amp;nbsp;kilometres deep, but later expanded north to the Litani river. 20 Israeli soldiers and 1,100â2,000 PLO fighters{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} were killed . According to other source about 2000 Lebanese and Palestinian were killed and some 250,000 refugees fled the area.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chomsk&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The [[PLO]] retreated north of the Litani River, continuing to fire at the Israelis.

== Outcome of the war ==
[[File:BlueLine.jpg|thumb|Map showing the Blue Line demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel, established by the UN after the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 1978]]
In response to the invasion, the UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 426|Resolution 426]] calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon ([[United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon|UNIFIL]]) was created to enforce this mandate, and restore peace and sovereignty to Lebanon. UNIFIL forces arrived in Lebanon on 23 March 1978, setting up headquarters in [[Naqoura]].

Israeli forces withdrew later in 1978, turning over positions inside Lebanon to their ally, the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) militia under the leadership of Maj. [[Saad Haddad]]. On 19 April 1978, the SLA shelled UNIFIL headquarters, killing 8 UN soldiers. (Fisk, 138). In April 1980, three
Irish UN soldiers Privates Barrett, Smallhorne and O'Mahoney were kidnapped and two of them murdered by Christian gunmen, Private O'Mahoney survived (being shot by sub-machine gun during the incident) in SLA territory and another Irish soldier Private S. Griffen was shot by Haddad's men, and was medivaced to Israel where he subsequently died during medical treatment. The Israeli press at the time, particularly the [[Jerusalem Post]], accused the Irish of pro-PLO bias. (Fisk, 152â154). However, Palestinian factions also attacked UNIFIL, kidnapping an Irish UNIFIL soldier in 1981 and continuing to occupy areas in southern Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Private Kevin Joyce was kidnapped and is presumed dead.  See Guardian article here [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,486689,00.html 20-year hunt for kidnapped Irish soldier almost over | UK news | The Observer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostilities continued, and as the Lebanese civil war escalated, the fighting intensified in the south again, with a [[1982 Lebanon War|second Israeli invasion]] in 1982 resulting in [[South Lebanon conflict (1982â2000)|a 1982 flare-up]] that persisted over the next decade.

== Resolution 425 ==
[[File:UNIFIL in lebanon 1981.jpg|thumb|[[UNIFIL]] road block in Lebanon, 1981]]
In 2000, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] concluded that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html SECURITY COUNCIL ENDORSES SECRETARY-GENERALâS CONCLUSION ON ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM LEBANON AS OF 16 JUNE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon has not extended control over [[south Lebanon]], though it was called on to do so by [[UN Resolution 1391]] of 2002 and urged by UN Resolution [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/7e93b8efbe9e9723c1256d9000289335?Opendocument 1496]. Israel has lodged multiple complaints regarding Lebanon's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/22f431edb91c6f548525678a0051be1d/bb095796d02d589785256b910058cc00!OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon's claim that Israel has not fully withdrawn (see [[Shebaa Farms]]) was explicitly rejected by the UN's Secretary-General's report which led to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1583|UN Security Council Resolution 1583]]. The [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]] led to [[UN Security Council Resolution 1559]] demanding the remaining 14,000 (of 50,000 originally) Syrian troop withdrawal and the dismantling of [[Hezbollah]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militias. On April 26, 2005, after 29 years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon, the last of the Syrian troops withdrew in accordance with the resolution.
