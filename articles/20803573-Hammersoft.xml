[[Ron Saggers]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team of 1948, which toured England]] and went undefeated in their 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.

The team's reserve [[wicket-keeper]], Saggers played in only the [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth]] of five [[Test cricket|Tests]], due to an injury to first-choice gloveman [[Don Tallon]]. The match was Saggers's Test debut and he scored five in his only [[innings#Cricket|innings]] with the bat and took three catches. Despite being the second-choice gloveman, Saggers conceded [[bye (cricket)|byes]] at a lower rate than Tallon did during the English summer. During the Fourth Test, Saggers conceded only six byes as England amassed a match total of 861, the lowest percentage of byes conceded by Australia in a match during the tour. Despite this, Tallon remained the favoured gloveman, as Bradman deemed him to be faster and more athletic.

Bradman rotated the two glovemen during the tour, and Saggers played in 17 of the 31 [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], taking 23 [[catch (cricket)|catches]] and 20 [[stumping]]s. Due to Australia's powerful batting line-up, Saggers had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 209 runs at an [[batting average|average]] of 23.22, including his only [[century (cricket)|century]] at first-class level, 104 [[not out]] against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]].

== Background ==
Saggers started the tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as [[Don Tallon]] had played in each of Australia's 11 Tests since the resumption of cricket after the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Saggers made his first-class debut shortly before the start of the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months aborad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.&lt;ref name=az/&gt; 

== Early tour ==

Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=haigh&gt;{{cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=26 May 2007| accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Tallon was selected as the wicket-keeper for the match. Tallon scored six, made five dismissals and conceded 11 byes as Australia crushed the hosts by an innings and 17 runs.&lt;ref name=sched&gt;{{cite web|title=Matches, Australia tour of England, Apr-September 1948 |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/invincibles/engine/series/61329.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{cite web

Tallon was then rested and Saggers took his place for the next [[County cricket|county]] match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=leics&gt;{{cite web

Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted steadily with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite web

He was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p197&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Tallon nursed a bruised finger, Saggers played in three successive tour matches.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], he made two stumpings and took one catch, and was not required to bat as Australia won by an innings. He then played in the match against Essex where Australia scored 721&amp;nbsp;runs on the first day to set a new world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket. Saggers made his highest first-class score, 104 [[not out]]&amp;mdash;the only first-class [[century (cricket)|century]] of his career&amp;mdash;in a [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 166&amp;nbsp;runs in 65&amp;nbsp;minutes of batting with [[Sam Loxton]]. This made him the fourth century-maker for the innings after [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]], Bradman and Loxton.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/statsguru/content/story/242365.html |title=Rubbing their noses in it &amp;#124;|publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Saggers's innings, former Test batsman [[Jack Fingleton]] said that &quot;he reminded me at times of [[Alan Kippax]] in his artistry. He plays all the strokes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Saggers took one catch as Australia won by [[result (cricket)|an innings and 451 runs]], their largest winning margin of the season.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

He then faced [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]], scoring six runs and taking one catch in another innings victory.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Saggers conceded six, eight and 14 byes respectively in the three matches. Up to this point, Saggers had conceded only 34 byes in his four tour matches, while Tallon had conceded 46 in three.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|Saggers|1|a}}

The next match was against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] at [[Lord's]]. The MCC fielded seven players who went on to represent England in the Tests,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|MCC|2|a}} and were basically a full-strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for players from both countries to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Test matches, and Tallon was selected ahead of Saggers despite conceding byes at a higher rate in the opening tour matches. Saggers looked on as Tallon conceded 26 byes and Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt;

There were four more [[county cricket|county fixtures]] before the First Test, against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]. Australia drew the first two before winning the latter pair by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Saggers played in all but the Nottinghamshire match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], Saggers came in at 6/145 and held up his end, making an unbeaten 22 as Australia reached 204.

He came to the crease with Australia having scored 98 runs for the loss of seven wickets (7/98) and was last man out for 17, one of only four players to pass five,&lt;ref name=hants/&gt; as Australia made 117 and conceded a first innings lead for the first time in the season.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=hants&gt;{{cite web

He did not concede a bye and took a catch in the first innings.

== Test debut ==
{{main|Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
As a result of Tallon's finger injury, Saggers made his Test debut in the Fourth Test, which started at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] on 22 July 1948.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; As England made 496&amp;nbsp;runs in their first innings, Saggers took catches to remove [[Denis Compton]] for 23, caught down the [[leg side]],&lt;ref name=f158&gt;Fingleton, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jim Laker]] for four.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; During the innings, Saggers was noted by Fingleton for maintaining a quiet presence behind the stumps, whereas Tallon was characteristically known for loudly [[appeal (cricket)|appealing]] in concert with the bowler when he was playing. Fingleton felt that Saggers' failure to appeal dampened the morale of the bowlers, who were vocally supported by Tallon in the other four Tests.&lt;ref name=f152&gt;Fingleton, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia conceded 496 runs but Saggers leaked only two byes.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt;

Australia replied with 458, but Saggers was unable to make a substantial contribution, stumped by England's wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] off the bowling of Laker for only five runs. England's second innings reached 8/365, as Saggers took one catch to secure the wicket of [[Ken Cranston]] and conceded four byes. This left Australia needing a world record Test run chase of 404 for victory. However, an innings of 182&amp;nbsp;runs from [[Arthur Morris]] and 173 not out from Bradman meant that Saggers was not required to bat in the second innings; Australia defeated England by seven wickets,&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; and set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase.&lt;ref name=report4&gt;{{Cite web|title= Fourth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saggers's six byes out of England's match total of 861 runs was the lowest percentage of byes conceded by Australia in a match on the tour.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|Australia|4|a}}

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the [[H. D. G. Leveson-Gower|Leveson-Gower's]] [[11 (number)#In sports|XI]]. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts.&lt;ref name=plg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 207&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman then fielded a first-choice team;&lt;ref name=plg&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]]'s inclusion at the expense of [[Doug Ring]]. Saggers was left out as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{cite web

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. In the first match, Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket. Saggers scored only eight in Australia's 236 and then took two catches, three stumpings and conceded 13 byes in the innings victory.&lt;ref name=scot1&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Ron Saggers graph 1948.png|300px|right|thumb|A chart showing Saggers's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings.

The reserve wicket-keeper, Saggers played in 17 first-class matches and scored 209&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of 23.22,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; including a career high score of 104 not out against Essex,&lt;ref name=az&gt;Cashman, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; 23 catches and 20 stumpings, also career records for one season.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; This compared with the first-choice gloveman Tallon, who scored 283 runs at 25.72.&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, Apr-Sep 1948 &amp;ndash; First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all his matches on tour, Tallon missed 249 byes as Australia conceded 5331 runs, a bye percentage of 4.67%. In contrast, Saggers conceded 221 byes from the 6190 runs scored against Australia when he was behind the stumps, a percentage of 3.57%.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|stumps|4|d}} In his 1950 book ''Farewell to cricket'', Bradman said of Saggers, &quot;[he] had not quite the speed or agility of Tallon but could always be relied on for a solid performance. A most polished and unostentatious player.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farewell&quot;&gt;Bradman, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, Saggers had few opportunities with the bat, generally batting between [[batting order (cricket)|No. 8 and No. 10]],&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|stumps|4|d}} because Australia's frontline bowlers included the likes of [[Ray Lindwall]], [[Colin McCool]], [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Doug Ring]], who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 152, 175, 199, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;
