{{main|Timeline of the 2011 Egyptian revolution}}

The following is a chronological summary of the major events that took place during the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] before [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s resignation as the [[List of Presidents of Egypt|fourth]] [[President of Egypt]].

From 1981 to 2011, Hosni Mubarak was in power under [[emergency law]] with his son [[Gamal Mubarak|Gamal]] appearing the likely successor to the presidency. In December 2010 protests in [[Tunisia]] sparked by the death of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] turned into [[Tunisian revolution|a revolution]]. The death of [[Khaled Saeed]] in June 2010 became a similar rallying point for activists in Egypt. Increasing use of social media among activists centered around plans for a nationwide protest on 25 January 2011.

Millions turned out to major cities in Egypt on the 25th, especially in Cairo's [[Tahrir Square]]. At first tensions were high between the police and protesters with violence breaking out in [[Suez]] and [[Alexandria]]. The government took a hard line, using riot-control tactics, and shutting down communications. But by the 28th the protests were continuing and the police had retreated. The security role was taken over by the military, and from then on the situation remained almost entirely peaceful. As pressure rose on Mubarak, the scale of the protests continued to grow, especially on specially organized Friday rallies. 

Mubarak initially made small changes such as dissolving the parliament, agreeing to oversee a process of reform, and not to run for reelection in September 2011. Protesters were not satisfied and by February 8 there were widespread calls for Mubarak's resignation. On the night of 10 February, Mubarak gave a speech in which people expected he would step down. Anger erupted when he only stated plans to delegate some of his power. By the next day, 11 February 2011, he had resigned.

A delegation led by the chief of staff of Egypt's armed forces, Lt. Gen. [[Sami Hafez Enan]], was in Washington, D.C., although the visit was truncated due to the protests. The sessions, an annual country-to-country military coordination, were being led for the U.S. by Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs [[Alexander Vershbow]]. A meeting with Adm. [[Mike Mullen]], chairman of the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and other talks had been planned to extend to 2&amp;nbsp;February.

The organizers of the &quot;Day of Revolt&quot;, &quot;Friday of Anger&quot;, &quot;March of the Millions&quot; and &quot;Friday of Departure&quot; called for a protest in what was dubbed the &quot;'''Sunday of Martyrs'''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/5046/Egypt/Politics-/Protesters-plan-Coptic-mass-on-Martyrs-Sunday.aspx|title=Protesters plan Coptic mass on 'Martyrs' Sunday'|publisher=[[Al-Ahram]]|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|Ø£Ø­Ø¯ Ø§ÙØ´ÙØ¯Ø§Ø¡}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2011/february/6/pray_quddas.aspx?ref=extraclip|title=ØµÙØ§Ø© ÙÙØºØ§Ø¦Ø¨ ÙØªØ±Ø§ÙÙÙ ÙØ¨Ø·ÙØ© Ø¨ÙÙØ¯Ø§ÙÙØ¶ÙØ¨ Ø§ÙØªØ­Ø±ÙØ± ÙÙ (Ø£Ø­Ø¯ Ø§ÙØ´ÙØ¯Ø§Ø¡)|publisher=Masrawy|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night of 5â6 February, protesters continued to camp out in Tahrir Square and Alexandria. However, [[gunshot|gunfire]] was heard in the early hours of the day in Cairo.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazbloglive6feb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/02/05/live-blog-feb-6-egypt-protests |title=Live Blog Feb&amp;nbsp;6 â Egypt Protests |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date= |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian Christians held mass in the morning in Tahrir Square to counter claims by state television that most of the anti-Mubarak protesters were members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Copts wanted to show that they were a part of Egypt's popular uprising and shared the grievances. Christians started their Sunday Mass in Cairo's Tahrir Square as Muslim protesters formed a ring around them to protect them during the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/africa/450890-egypt-christians-muslims-unite-in-tahrir.html|title=Egypt Christians, Muslims Unite in Tahrir|publisher=On Islam|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds in Tahrir Square chanted &quot;We are one, we are one&quot; ahead of prayers held at noon for those killed during the protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazbloglive6feb&quot; /&gt;

Finance Minister Samir Radwan announced a 15 per cent raise in pensions and salaries for government employees at a cost of 6.5 billion [[Egyptian pounds]] (US$960 million).

In his television statement, Mubarak said that he would penalise those responsible for the violence and had a clear vision on how to end the crisis, but was satisfied with what he had offered.
