'''Mammals''' (formally '''Mammalia''' {{IPA-en|mÉËmeÉªli.É|}}) are members of a [[class (biology)|class]] of air-breathing [[vertebrate]] [[animal]]s characterised by the possession of [[endothermy]], [[hair]], three [[middle ear]] [[bone]]s, and [[mammary glands]] functional in mothers with young.  Most mammals also possess [[sweat glands]] and specialised [[teeth]],  and the largest group of mammals, the [[Eutheria|placentals]], have a [[placenta]] which feeds the offspring during gestation.  The mammalian brain, with its characteristic [[neocortex]], regulates [[warm-blooded|endothermic]] and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, the latter featuring [[Erythrocyte|red blood cells]] lacking [[Nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] and a large four-chambered [[heart]] maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have.  Mammals range in size from the 30â40 millimeter (1- to 1.5-inch) [[Bumblebee Bat]] to the 33-meter (108-foot) [[Blue Whale]].

The word &quot;mammal&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;mamma&quot; meaning &quot;breast&quot;.  All female mammals nurse their young with milk which comes out from special glands called mammary glands.
According to ''Mammal Species of the World'', which is updated through periodic editions, 5676 [[species]] were known in 2005, distributed in 1,229 [[genus|genera]], 153 [[family (biology)|families]] and 29 [[order (biology)|orders]].&lt;ref name=MSW3intro&gt;{{MSW3|heading=Preface and introductory material|page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] completed a 5-year, 17,000 scientist Global Mammal Assessment for its [[IUCN Red List]], which counted 5488 accepted species at the end of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Initiatives |  work=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species | date=April, 2010 | publisher=IUCN | url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class is divided into two subclasses (not counting fossils): the [[Prototheria]] (order of [[monotremes|Monotremata]]) and the [[Theria]], the latter containing the infraclasses [[Metatheria]] (including [[marsupials]]) and [[Eutheria]] (the [[placentals]]). The [[Mammal classification|classification of mammals]] between the relatively stable class and family levels having changed often, different treatments of subclass, infraclass and order appear in contemporaneous literature, especially for [[Marsupialia]].

Except for the five species of [[monotreme]]s (which lay eggs), all living mammals give birth to live young.  Most mammals, including the six most species-rich orders, belong to the [[placental]] group. The three largest orders, in descending order, are [[Rodentia]] (mice, rats, porcupines, beavers, capybaras, and other gnawing mammals), [[Chiroptera]] (bats), and [[Soricomorpha]] (shrews, moles and solenodons). The next three largest orders, depending on [[biological classification|classification scheme]], include the [[Primates]], to which the [[human]] species belongs, the [[Cetartiodactyla]] (including the even-toed hoofed mammals and the whales) and the [[Carnivora]] ([[dogs]], [[cats]], weasels, bears, seals, and their relatives).&lt;ref name=MSW3intro/&gt;

The early [[synapsid]] mammalian ancestors, a group which included [[pelycosaur]]s such as ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', diverged from the [[amniote]] line that would lead to [[reptile]]s at the end of the [[Carboniferous]] period.  Preceded by many diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids (sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles), the first true mammals appeared 220 million years ago in the [[Triassic]] period. Modern mammalian orders appeared in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]] epochs of the [[Palaeogene]] period.  [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetically]], the [[clade]] Mammalia is defined as all descendants of the [[most recent common ancestor]] of monotremes (e.g., [[echidna]]s and [[platypus]]es) and therian mammals ([[marsupial]]s and placentals).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | author=Rose, Kenneth D. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The beginning of the age of mammals | year=2006 | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | location=Baltimore | isbn=0-8018-8472-1 | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that some extinct groups of &quot;mammals&quot; are not members of the [[crown group]] Mammalia, even though most of them have all the characteristics that traditionally would have classified them as mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKennaBell1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | author=McKenna, Malcolm C.; Bell, Susan Groag | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Classification of Mammals | year=1997 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location= | isbn=0-231-11013-8 | page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; These &quot;mammals&quot; are now usually placed in the unranked clade [[Mammaliaformes]].

==Distinguishing features== 
Living mammal species can be identified by the presence of sweat glands, including [[nipple|those that are specialized]] to [[Lactation|produce]] [[milk]]. However, other features are required when classifying [[fossil]]s, since soft tissue glands and some other features are not visible in fossils. [[paleontology|Paleontologists]] use a distinguishing feature that is shared by all living mammals (including [[monotremes]]), but is not present in any of the early [[Triassic]] synapsids: mammals use two bones for hearing that were used for eating by their ancestors. The earliest synapsids had a jaw joint composed of the [[articular]] (a small bone at the back of the lower jaw) and the [[quadrate bone|quadrate]] (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw). Most reptiles including [[lizards]], [[crocodilians]], [[dinosaur]]s use this system, as did non-mammalian synapsids such as [[therapsid]]s. Mammals have a different jaw joint, however, composed only of the [[dentary]] (the lower jaw bone which carries the teeth) and the [[squamosal]] (another small skull bone). In mammals the quadrate and articular bones have become the [[incus]] and [[malleus]] bones in the [[middle ear]].

Mammals also have a double [[occipital condyle]]: they have two knobs at the base of the skull which fit into the topmost neck vertebra, and other [[vertebrates]] have a single occipital condyle. Paleontologists use only the jaw joint and middle ear as criteria for identifying fossil mammals, since it would be confusing if they found a fossil that had one feature, but not the other.

==Classification==
{{Main|Mammal classification}}
[[Image:Mammal species pie chart.png|thumb|300px|Over 70% of mammal species are in the orders [[Rodent]]ia (blue), [[Chiroptera]] (red), and [[Soricomorpha]] (yellow)]]

[[George Gaylord Simpson]]'s &quot;Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals&quot; (AMNH ''Bulletin'' v. 85, 1945) was the original source for the taxonomy listed here. Simpson laid out a systematics of mammal origins and relationships that was universally taught until the end of the 20th century. Since Simpson's classification, the [[fossil record|paleontological record]] has been recalibrated, and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself, partly through the new concept of [[cladistics]]. Though field work gradually made Simpson's classification outdated, it remained the closest thing to an official classification of mammals.

===Standardized textbook classification===
A somewhat standardized classification system has been adopted by most current [[mammalogy]] classroom textbooks. The following taxonomy of extant and recently extinct mammals is from [[#References|Vaughan et al. (2000)]].

'''Class Mammalia'''
*'''Subclass [[Prototheria]]''': monotremes: [[platypus]]es and [[echidna]]s. 
*'''Subclass [[Theria]]''': live-bearing mammals
**Infraclass [[Metatheria]]: marsupials
**Infraclass [[Eutheria]]: placentals

===McKenna/Bell classification===
In 1997, the mammals were comprehensively revised by [[Malcolm McKenna|Malcolm C. McKenna]] and Susan K. Bell, which has resulted in the &quot;McKenna/Bell classification&quot;. Their 1997 book, ''Classification of Mammals: Above the species level'',&lt;ref name=&quot;McKennaBell1997&quot;/&gt; is the most comprehensive work to date on the systematics, relationships, and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus. The new McKenna/Bell classification was quickly accepted by paleontologists, though recent molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors work together as [[paleontologist]]s at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York]]. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia.

The McKenna/Bell hierarchical listing of all of the terms used for mammal groups above the species includes extinct mammals as well as modern groups, and introduces some fine distinctions such as [[legion (biology)|legions]] and [[sublegion]]s (ranks which fall between classes and orders) that are likely to be glossed over by the nonprofessionals.

The published re-classification forms both a comprehensive and authoritative record of approved names and classifications and a list of invalid names.

[[Extinct]] groups are represented by a [[Dagger (typography)|dagger]] (â ).

===Molecular classification of placentals===
Molecular studies based on [[DNA]] analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families over the last few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by [[retrotransposon]] [[retrotransposon marker|presence/absence data]]. The most recent classification systems based on molecular studies have proposed four groups or lineages of [[placental mammals]]. [[Molecular clock]]s suggest that these clades diverged from early common ancestors in the [[Cretaceous]], but [[fossils]] have not yet been found to corroborate this hypothesis. These molecular findings are consistent with mammal [[zoogeography]]:

Following molecular DNA sequence analyses, the first divergence was that of the [[Afrotheria]] 110â100 million years ago. The Afrotheria proceeded to evolve and diversify in the isolation of the African-Arabian continent. The [[Xenarthra]], isolated in [[South America]], diverged from the [[Boreoeutheria]] approximately 100â95 million years ago. According to an alternative view, the Xenarthra has the Afrotheria as closest allies, forming the [[Atlantogenata]] as sistergroup to Boreoeutheria. The Boreoeutheria split into the [[Laurasiatheria]] and [[Euarchontoglires]] between 95 and 85 mya; both of these groups evolved on the northern continent of [[Laurasia]]. After tens of millions of years of relative isolation, Africa-Arabia collided with Eurasia, exchanging Afrotheria and Boreoeutheria. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] linked [[South America]] and [[North America]], which facilitated the exchange of mammal species in the [[Great American Interchange]]. The traditional view that no placental mammals reached [[Australasia]] until about 5 million years ago when bats and [[Murinae|murine]] rodents arrived has been challenged by recent evidence and may need to be reassessed. These molecular results are still controversial because they are not reflected by [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] data, and thus not accepted by many systematists. Further there is some indication from retrotransposon presence/absence data that the traditional [[Epitheria]] hypothesis, suggesting [[Xenarthra]] as the first divergence, might be true. With the old order [[Insectivora]] shown to be [[polyphyly|polyphylectic]] and more properly subdivided (as [[Afrosoricida]], [[Erinaceidae|Erinaceomorpha]], and [[Soricomorpha]]), the following classification for placental mammals contains 21 orders:

[[Synapsida]], the group which contains mammals and their extinct relatives, originated during the [[Pennsylvanian]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], when they split from the lineage that led to [[Reptilia|reptiles]] and [[Aves|birds]]. Non-mammalian synapsids were once called &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot;, although they are usually no longer considered reptiles. Mammals evolved from non-mammalian synapsids during the Early [[Jurassic]].

===Evolution from amniotes in the Paleozoic===
[[Image:Skull synapsida 1.png|thumb|230 px|The original synapsid skull structure contains one [[temporal fenestrae|temporal opening]] behind the [[eye socket|orbitals]], in a fairly low position on the skull (lower right in this image). This might have assisted in the containing the jaw muscles of these organisms that could have increased their biting strength.]]
 
The first fully terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s were [[amniote]]s. Like their [[amphibian]] predecessors, they have lungs and limbs. Amniotes' eggs, however, have internal membranes which allow the developing [[embryo]] to breathe but keep water in. Hence amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.

The first amniotes apparently arose in the [[Pennsylvanian|late]] [[Carboniferous]]. They descended from earlier [[Reptiliomorpha|reptiliomorph]] amphibians,&lt;ref name=&quot;AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
| author=Ahlberg, P. E. and Milner, A. R. | month=April | year=1994

Within a few million years two important amniote lineages became distinct: the [[synapsid]]s, which include mammals; and the [[sauropsid]]s, which include [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[crocodilian]]s, [[dinosaur]]s and [[bird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.palaeos.org/Amniota | title = Amniota â Palaeos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synapsids have a single hole ([[temporal fenestra]]) low on each side of the skull.

One synapsid group, the [[pelycosaur]]s, were the most common land vertebrates of the early [[Permian]] and included the largest land animals of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/Unit390/000.html | title=Synapsida overview â Palaeos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Therapsid]]s descended from pelycosaurs in the middle [[Permian]], about 260M years ago, and took over their position as the dominant land vertebrates. They differ from pelycosaurs in several features of the skull and jaws, including: larger [[temporal fenestrae]] and [[incisor]]s which are equal in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/400Therapsida/100.html | title=Therapsida â Palaeos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapsids went through a series of stages, beginning with animals which were very like their pelycosaur ancestors and ending with the Triassic [[cynodont]]s, some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals. Those stages were characterized by:
*gradual development of a bony secondary [[hard palate|palate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kermack1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Kermack | last2=Kermack | title=The evolution of mammalian characters | publisher=Croom Helm | year=1984 | isbn=079915349 |first =D.M.|first2= K.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*progress towards an erect limb posture, which would increase the animals' stamina by avoiding [[Carrier's constraint]]. But this process was slow and erratic â for example: all herbivorous non-mammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semi-erect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semi-sprawling hindlimbs. In fact modern [[monotreme]]s still have semi-sprawling limbs.
*the [[dentary]] gradually becoming the main bone of the lower jaw; and in the [[Triassic]], progress towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the jaws of Reptiles)
*there is possible evidence of hair in Triassic therapsids, but none for Permian therapsids.
*some scientists have argued that some Triassic therapsids show signs of [[lactation]].

===True mammals evolve in the Triassic===
The [[PermianâTriassic extinction event]], which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of the therapsids. In the Early Triassic all the medium to large land animal niches were taken over by early [[archosaurs]], which over an extended period of time (35 million years) evolved into [[crocodilian]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[dinosaur]]s and [[bird]]s. After this &quot;Triassic Takeover&quot; the [[cynodonts]] and their [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] could only survive as small, mainly [[nocturnal]] [[insectivore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/410Cynodontia/410.000.html | title=Cynodontia: Overview â Palaeos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true mammals appeared in the Late [[Triassic Period|Triassic]] (ca. 200 million years ago), over 70 million years after the first therapsids and approximately 30 million years after the first mammaliaformes. The rat-like ''[[Hadrocodium]]'' appears to be in the middle of the transition to true mammal status â it had a mammalian jaw joint (formed by the dentary and squamosal bones), but there is some debate about whether its [[middle ear]] was fully mammalian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/Unit420/420.300.html | title=Symmetrodonta â Palaeos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the mammal species that existed in the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]] were characterized by [[Multituberculates]].

The earliest known [[monotreme]] is ''[[Teinolophos]]'', which lived about 123M years ago in [[Australia]]. [[Monotremes]] have some features which may be inherited from the original [[amniote]]s:
*they use the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (&quot;monotreme&quot; means &quot;one hole&quot;) â as lizards and birds also do.
*they lay [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] which are leathery and uncalcified, like those of lizards, turtles and crocodilians.
Unlike other mammals, female monotremes do not have [[nipples]] and feed their young by &quot;sweating&quot; milk from patches on their bellies.

The oldest known [[marsupial]] is ''[[Sinodelphys]]'', found in 125M-year old early [[Cretaceous]] [[shale]] in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/12/1215_031215_oldestmarsupial.html | title=Oldest Marsupial Fossil Found in China | date=December 15, 2003 | publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:giant ground sloth Iowa.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction based on ''[[Megalonyx]] jeffersonii'', [[Iowa Museum of Natural History]], University of Iowa]]
The living [[Eutheria]] (&quot;true beasts&quot;) are all [[placentals]]. An early eutherian, ''[[Eomaia]]'', found in China and dated to 125M years ago, obtained some features which are more like those of [[marsupials]], which suggested it was perhaps a transitional fossil that eventually gave rise to the placental lineage (the surviving [[metatherian]]s):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evolutionpages.com/Eomaia%20scansoria.htm | title=Eomaia scansoria: discovery of oldest known placental mammal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Epipubic bones]] extending forwards from the pelvis, which are not found in any modern placental, but are found in marsupials, [[monotreme]]s and [[mammaliformes]] such as [[multituberculates]]. In other words, they appear to be an ancestral feature which subsequently disappeared in the placental lineage. These epipubic bones seem to function by stiffening the muscles of these animals during locomotion, reducing the amount of space being presented, which placentals require to contain their [[fetus]] during gestation periods.
*A narrow pelvic outlet, which indicates that the young were very small at birth and therefore pregnancy was short, as in modern marsupials. This suggests that the placenta was a later development.
Now the discovery of a partial skeleton of a small, shrewlike mammal, described online in ''Nature'' in August of 2011, pushes back the date of the divergence by 30 million years, to 160 million years ago. Found in the famous fossil beds of Liaoning, China, the newly discovered little mammal has been named ''Juramaia sinensis'', or &quot;Jurassic mother from China.&quot;

It is not certain when true placental mammals evolved â the earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early [[Paleocene]], after the extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.nationalgeographic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070620-mammals-dinos.html |title=Dinosaur Extinction Spurred Rise of Modern Mammals |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals and near-mammals expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid Jurassic onwards â for example ''[[Castorocauda]]'' had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0223_060223_beaver.html | title=Jurassic &quot;Beaver&quot; Found; Rewrites History of Mammals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to dominance in the Cenozoic===
Mammals took over the medium- to large-sized ecological niches in the [[Cenozoic]], after the [[CretaceousâTertiary extinction event]] emptied ecological space once filled by reptiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544â547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then mammals diversified very quickly, both birds and mammals show an exponential rise in diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates&quot;/&gt; An example is that the earliest known bat dates from about 50M years ago, only 15M years after the extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996647 |title=Rogue finger gene got bats airborne |publisher=Newscientist.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cenozoic]] several groups of mammals appeared which were much larger than their nearest modern equivalents â but none was even close to the size of the largest dinosaurs with similar feeding habits.

===Earliest appearances of features===
''[[Hadrocodium]]'', whose fossils date from the early [[Jurassic]] (approx. 195 million years ago), provides the first clear evidence of fully mammalian jaw joints.

It has been suggested that the original function of lactation (milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on [[monotremes]] (egg-laying mammals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oftedal | first=O.T. | title=The mammary gland and its origin during synapsid evolution | journal=Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=225â252 |year=2002 | doi=10.1023/A:1022896515287 | pmid=12751889 }}

The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of ''[[Castorocauda]]'', from 164M years ago in the mid [[Jurassic]]. From 1955 onwards some scientists have interpreted the foramina (passages) in the [[maxilla]]e (upper jaws) and [[premaxilla]]e (small bones in front of the maxillae) of [[cynodont]]s as channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers), and suggested that this was evidence of hair or fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brink1955&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Brink | first=A.S. | title=A study on the skeleton of ''Diademodon'' | journal=Palaeontologia Africana | volume=3 | pages=3â39 |year=1955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Kemp | first=T.S. | title=Mammal-like reptiles and the origin of mammals | publisher=Academic Press | year=1982 | location=London | page=363 | isbn=0124041205}}&lt;/ref&gt; But foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae â for example the modern lizard ''Tupinambis'' has foramina which are almost identical to those found in the non-mammalian cynodont [[Thrinaxodon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, A.

The evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete â living and fossil [[monotremes]] have sprawling limbs. In fact some scientists think that the parasagittal (non-sprawling) limb posture is a [[synapomorphy]] (distinguishing characteristic) of the [[Mammal classification|Boreosphenida]], a group which contains the [[Theria]] and therefore includes the last common ancestor of modern marsupial and placentals â and therefore that all earlier mammals had sprawling limbs.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last=KielanâJaworowska | first=Z. | last2=Hurum | first2=J.H.. | title=Limb posture in early mammals: Sprawling or parasagittal | journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume=51 | issue=3 | pages=10237â10239 |year=2006 | url=http://www.app.pan.pl/acta51/app51-393.pdf| format= â&lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AKielan%E2%88%92Jaworowska+intitle%3ALimb+posture+in+early+mammals%3A+Sprawling+or+parasagittal&amp;as_publication=Acta+Palaeontologica+Polonica&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; }} {{Dead link|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sinodelphys]]'' (the earliest known marsupial) and ''[[Eomaia]]'' (the earliest known [[eutheria]]n) lived about 125M years ago, so erect limbs must have evolved before then.

It is currently very difficult to be confident when [[endothermy]] first appeared in the evolution of mammals. Modern [[monotremes]] have a lower body temperature and more variable metabolic rate than marsupials and placentals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Paul | first=G.S. | title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1988| location=New York | page=464 | isbn=0671619462}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the main question is when a monotreme-like metabolism evolved in mammals. The evidence found so far suggests [[Triassic]] [[cynodont]]s may have had fairly high metabolic rates, but is not conclusive. In particular it is difficult to see how small animals can maintain a high and stable body temperature without fur.

==Anatomy and morphology==
===Skeletal system===
The majority of mammals have seven [[cervical vertebrae]] (bones in the [[neck]]); this includes [[bat]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[human]]s. The few exceptions include the [[manatee]] and the [[two-toed sloth]], which have only six cervical [[vertebrae]], and the [[three-toed sloth]] with nine cervical vertebrae.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=FIIgDk9i_GkC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=mammal+cervical+vertebrae+sloth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=awhUXef5uS&amp;sig=fisiFeMccFCbEGLkKE91m2QU7e0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8jqvTKH-C8L38Ab1uNCoCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiratory system===
The lungs of mammals have a spongy texture and are honeycombed with [[epithelium]] having a much larger surface area in total than the outer surface area of the lung itself. The [[human lung|lungs of humans]] are typical of this type of lung.

Breathing is largely driven by the muscular [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome with its convexity towards the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and [[bronchi]] and expands the [[alveoli]]. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall [[Muscle contraction|contracts]], increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The [[rib cage]] itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a '''bellows lung''' as it resembles a blacksmith's [[bellows]]. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and discard carbon dioxide.

===Nervous system===
All mammalian brains possess a [[neocortex]], a brain region that is unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a [[corpus callosum]] unlike monotremes and marsupials. The size and number of cortical areas ([[Brodmann]]'s areas) is least in monotremes (about 8-10) and most in placentals (up to 50).

===Integumentary system===
The [[skin|integumentary system]] is made up of three layers: the outermost [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], the [[dermis]], and the [[hypodermis]].

The [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is typically ten to thirty cells thick, its main function being to provide a waterproof layer. Its outermost cells are constantly lost; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward. The middle layer, the dermis, is fifteen to forty times thicker than the epidermis. The dermis is made up of many components such as bony structures and blood vessels. The hypodermis is made up of [[adipose tissue]]. Its job is to store lipids, and to provide cushioning and insulation. The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species.

Although mammals and other animals have [[cilia]] that superficially may resemble it, no other animals except mammals have [[hair]]. It is a definitive characteristic of the class. Some mammals have very little, but nonetheless, careful examination reveals the characteristic, often in obscure parts of their bodies. None are known to have hair that naturally is blue or green in color {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} although some cetaceans, along with the [[mandrill]]s, appear to have shades of blue skin. Many mammals are indicated as having blue hair or fur, but in all known cases, it has been found to be a shade of gray. The [[two-toed sloth]] and the [[polar bear]] may seem to have green fur, but this color is caused by [[algae]] growths.

===Reproductive system===
[[Image:Goat family.jpg|thumb|[[Goat]] kids will stay with their mother until they are weaned.]]
Most mammals give birth to live young ([[vivipary]]), but a few, namely the [[monotremes]], lay [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. The [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]] present a [[platypus#Evolution|particular]] [[Sex-determination system|sex determination system]] that is different from other vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, M.C., Waters, P.D., Delbridge, M.L., Kirby, P.J., Pask, A.J., GrÃ¼tzner, F., Rens, W., Ferguson-Smith, M.A., and Graves, J.A.M. (December 2007). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/7762202337g24344 Sex determination in platypus and echidna: autosomal location of SOX3 confirms the absence of SRY from monotremes]. ''Chromosome Research'' '''15'''(8): 949â959. ISSN 0967-3849 (Print) 1573â6849 (Online). doi:10.1007/s10577-007-1185-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain glands of mammals known as [[mammary gland]]s are specialized to produce [[milk]], a liquid used by [[newborn]]s as their primary source of nutrition. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the [[nipple]]s seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands.

Viviparous mammals are classified into the subclass Theria and are divided into two infraclasses: [[Metatheria]] (of which only the [[Marsupialia]] survive), and Eutheria. Marsupialia, or [[marsupial]]s, have short [[gestation]] periods and give birth to undeveloped young which are contained within a pouch-like sac, ([[Pouch (marsupial)|marsupium]]), located in the front of the mothers' [[abdomen]]. Eutherians, commonly known as [[placental]]s, are mammals that give birth to complete and fully developed young. This is usually characterized by long [[gestation]] periods. The majority of mammal species are classified as eutherians.

==Physiology==
===Endothermy===
Nearly all mammals are endothermic (&quot;[[warm-blooded]]&quot;). Most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in cold weather and climates where non-avian reptiles and large insects cannot.

Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so pound for pound mammals eat more food than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size.

A rare exception, the [[naked mole rat]] produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational [[poikilotherm]]. [[Bird]]s are also endothermic, so endothermy is not a defining mammalian feature.

===Intelligence===
[[File:Skelet mens &amp; gorilla vooraanzicht.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Skeletons of [[human]] and [[gorilla]] in the MIAT museum â front view, [[Ghent|Gent]], [[Belgium]]]]
[[Image:TheCheethcat.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A Cheetah sitting|The fastest land animal, the [[cheetah]] can reach 120 kmh (75 mph)]]
[[Image:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|thumb|Townsend's Big-eared Bat, ''[[Corynorhinus townsendii]]'']]

In intelligent mammals, such as [[primates]], the [[cerebrum]] is larger relative to the rest of the brain. [[Intelligence]] itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. [[Rats]], for example, are considered to be highly intelligent as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh [[biome|habitat]]. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a [[deer]] feeding on [[plant]]s has a [[brain]] smaller than a [[cat]], which must think to outwit its prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian_Animal&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Social structure===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Locomotion===
{{See also|Animal locomotion}}
Mammals evolved from four-legged ancestors. They use their limbs to walk, climb, swim, and fly. Some land mammals have toes that produce claws and [[hooves]] for climbing and running. Aquatic mammals such as whales and dolphins have flippers which evolved from legs.

====Terrestrial====
{{See also|Terrestrial locomotion}}

====Arboreal====
{{See also|Arboreal locomotion}}
[[Sloth]]s travel slowly along branches rather than swinging energetically like monkeys.

====Aquatic====
Buoyed by their aquatic environment, [[whales]] have evolved into the largest mammals and indeed the largest animals ever.

====Aerial====
{{See also|Aerial locomotion}}

===Feeding===
To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive â mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different [[species]] have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals â this is a [[carnivore|carnivorous]] diet (and includes [[insectivore|insectivorous]] diets). Other mammals, called [[herbivores]], eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes sub-types such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An [[omnivore]] eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple [[digestive system|digestive tract]], because the [[proteins]], [[lipids]], and [[minerals]] found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex [[carbohydrates]], such as [[cellulose]]. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to [[bacteria]] that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multi-chambered [[stomach]] or in a large [[cecum]]. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high-energy requirements and a high [[metabolism|metabolic rate]]. Mammals that weigh less than about 18&amp;nbsp;oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals on the other hand generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18&amp;nbsp;oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough [[insects]] during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects ([[ants]] or [[termites]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian_Animal&quot;/&gt;

Specializations in herbivory include:
Granivory &quot;seed eating&quot;, folivory &quot;leaf eating&quot;, fruivory &quot;fruit eating&quot;, nectivory &quot;nectar eating&quot;, gumivory &quot;gum eating&quot;, and mycophagy &quot;fungus eating&quot;.
