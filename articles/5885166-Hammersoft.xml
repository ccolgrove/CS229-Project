<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="5885166" ns="0" title="50 home run club"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''50 home run club''' is an informal term applied to the group of players who have hit 50 or more [[home run]]s in a single season.  The 50 Home Run Club was &quot;founded&quot; by [[Babe Ruth]] in [[1920 in sports|1920]].  At the time, he became the first player to hit not only 50 home runs in a season, but 40 and 30 as well, breaking his own single season record of 29 from the {{By|1919}} season.

Mentioned less frequently are the 60 Home Run Club and the 70 Home Run Club, which have five and two members respectively.  These &quot;clubs&quot; have become more populated since the [[1998 in sports|1998]] season, which saw membership in the 60 Home Run Club double. That year, [[Mark McGwire]] became the founding member of the 70 Home Run Club when he set a new single-season record. He has since been surpassed by [[Barry Bonds]], the only other current member of the 70 Home Run Club.

==List==
As of the [[2010 Major League Baseball season|2010 season]], 26 players have hit 50-or-more home runs in a single season, a total of 42 times.

==Notes on the Club==

===Cross-membership===
Ten members of the club are also members of the [[500 home run club]] (Bonds, Foxx, Griffey, Mantle, Mays, McGwire, Rodriguez, Ruth, Sosa, and Thome), while Bonds, Griffey, Mays, Rodriguez, Ruth, Sosa, and Thome are seven of the eight members of the 600-homer club.  Conversely, three retired members of the club hit fewer than 300 career home runs: Anderson with 210, Wilson with 244, and Maris with 275.  [[Hank Aaron]], with the second [[List of top 300 Major League Baseball home run hitters#List|most career home runs]] (755), is not a member of the 50 home run club, never having hit more than 47 home runs in a single season.

Ten players have won their League's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award#Baseball Writers Association of America's Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] award during the season in which they hit 50-or-more home runs: Foxx (1938), Mantle (1956), Maris (1961), Mays (1965), Foster (1977), Griffey (1997), Sosa (1998), Bonds (2001), Howard (2006), and Rodriguez (2007).  No pair of MVP award winners have ever hit 50-or-more home runs in the same season, nor have consecutive MVPs in the same League.  As no rookie has ever hit 50 home runs, no 50-home-run-hitter has ever won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award; the closest any rookie has come to hitting 50 was in 1987, when McGwire hit 49 (and was named AL Rookie of the Year).

Mickey Mantle is the only batter ever to have claimed a [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] during his 50-home-run season, having led the American League with a .353 batting average and 130 RBI in 1956.  That season, Mantle also claimed the rarer Major League Triple Crown, having led both leagues in all three statistical categories.

Four batters have hit 50 or more home runs for a team that went on to win a [[World Series|world championship]] in the same season: Babe Ruth's New York Yankees won in [[1927 World Series|1927]] and [[1928 World Series|1928]], Mickey Mantle's Yankees won in [[1956 World Series|1956]], while Mantle and Roger Maris's Yankees won in [[1961 World Series|1961]], and Luis Gonzalez's Arizona Diamondbacks won in [[2001 World Series|2001]].  Albert Belle went to the World Series immediately following his 50-home-run season, though the Cleveland Indians lost to the Atlanta Braves in [[1995 World Series|1995]].

Belle is also the only member of the Club to have hit 50 or more doubles in the same season, creating a unique 50â50 Club by leading the American League (along with [[Edgar Martinez]]) with 52 doubles along with his 50 home runs in 1995.

Cecil Fielder (1990) and Prince Fielder (2007) are the only father-son combination among the members of the 50 home run club.

===Home run frequency===
Ruth was the first batter to average fewer than nine [[at bats per home run|at-bats per home run]] over a season, hitting his 54 home runs of the 1920 season in 457 at-bats for an average of 8.463.  Seventy-eight years later, McGwire became the first batter to average fewer than eight AB/HR, hitting his 70 home runs of the 1998 season in 509 at-bats for an average of 7.2714.  Three years later, Bonds became the first batter to average fewer than seven AB/HR, setting the Major League record by hitting his 73 home runs of the 2001 season in 476 at-bats for an average of 6.5205.

Ruth, McGwire and Bonds are the only batters in history to average nine or fewer AB/HR over a season, having done so nine times:
