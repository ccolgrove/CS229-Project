'''Jim Fanning''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Octopussy]]''.  He is an [[art]] expert and is portrayed by [[Douglas Wilmer]].

===Biography===
Jim Fanning is an Art Expert whose knowledge revolves art history and jewelry. He often works with [[MI6]] and is appointed to attend an art auction where the fake of a priceless [[FabergÃ© Egg]] is being auctioned - unfortunately for him he is accompanying [[007]].

===Film Biography===
Jim Fanning is first seen in [[M (James Bond)|Mâs]] office with [[Sir Fredrick Gray]].  They talk to Bond about a FabergÃ© Egg.  Bond knows all the things about the egg, except that is a fake, something that Fanning found out.  Fanning then discusses the real egg and thinks the seller was a Russian.  He then asks Bond will go to the auction to spot the seller.  We next see him with Bond at the auction.  He tells Bond a few things about what the price of the egg should go for.  They find out the buyer of the egg, who is [[Kamal Khan]] alongside [[Magda (James Bond)|Magda]].  Fanning tells him that Khan is normally a seller but this time he is buying.  Bond then realises that Khan will go to any price to get the egg.  To Fanningâs surprise, Bond bids for the egg, which a distressed Fanning to ask
*Fanning: Have you gone mad?
*Bond: Letâs see how badly he wants it.
Fanning is then horrified that Bond has bid again.  When Khan bids over the top (after Bond has switched the real with the fake egg), he doesnât bid again and Fanning is slightly relieved.

It is unknown what happens to Jim Fanning after that.

Fanning seems to be based on an art critic and government consultant named &quot;Fanshawe&quot; who plays a similar role in the Ian Fleming short story &quot;The Property of a Lady,&quot; which provides the FabergÃ© and Sotheby's background for the movie.
