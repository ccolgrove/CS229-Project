==Schedule==
The service operates year round, 24 hours a day, the only STM bus route to do so.&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/cuts+travel+time+Trudeau+airport/2741025/story.html |title=New 747 bus cuts travel time to Trudeau airport |author=Anne Sutherland |date=29 March 2010 |work= |publisher= Montreal Gazette |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When service first started buses ran every 30 minutes during off-peak hours and at 20-minute intervals during the afternoon rush hour, but due to increasing demand buses now run every 10â12 minutes from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m, every 30 minutes from 5:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., and every hour from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m.&lt;ref name=STM&gt;http://www.stm.info/english/info/comm-10/a-co100610b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles==
The route is operated using distinctively branded 2010 (29-149 to 29-156) and 2011 (31-001 to 31-008) [[Nova Bus|Nova Bus LFS]] equipped with luggage racks. These buses have a modified livery to indicate they operate the 747 service, with a blue chevron logo with an aircraft pictogram in the centre of the chevron near the rear, replacing the standard STM one. Due to the demand additional conventionally decorated Nova Bus LFS are also used on this route. Buses numbered 31-001 to 31-008 also have air conditioning.
