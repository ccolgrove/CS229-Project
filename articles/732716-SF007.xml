<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="732716" ns="0" title="List of open-source video games"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">This is a selected '''list of open-source video games'''. [[Open source video game]]s are games assembled from and are themselves [[open source software]], including [[public domain]] games with published source code. This list includes games in which the game engine is open-source but the game content (media and levels, for example) is under a different license.

&lt;!--READ BEFORE ADDING A GAME TO THE TABLE:
 This is not an exhaustive directory. Games listed here need to show how they are notable.
 This should usually be done by at least making a stub article and showing where the game has received extensive coverage.

 Games should only appear here if their game engine uses an Open Source license. Just having source code available does not suffice. Many games have source code available but do not use an Open Source license; for instance, they may prohibit modifications, or allow only educational or non-commercial use.  Do not include such games on this page.

 Do not list a game's license as &quot;Other&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, or blank. If the game uses a standard Open Source license, name that license and link to its page on Wikipedia; if it was non-trivial to find the license, add a reference to a page showing the license. If the game uses a non-standard Open Source license, add a reference to a page showing the full license text. If the game uses a proprietary license, or you don't know what license it uses, do not list it on this page, even if it has source code available.
