The '''New Mexico State Aggies Basketball''' team is the basketball team that represents [[New Mexico State University]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], [[New Mexico]]. Founded in 1904, the Aggies currently compete in the [[Western Athletic Conference]] and last played in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]]. The Aggies hold the distinction of being one of 34 college basketball teams with multiple [[NBA retired jerseys]] from former players (Sam Lacey &amp; John Williamson) and a team that reached the NCAA Final Four (in 1970). The team plays home games in the [[Pan American Center]]. The Aggies are currently coached by [[Marvin Menzies]].

A [[Lou Henson]]-coached team gained national attention during the [[1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] by advancing to the [[Final Four]]. And in 1992 a [[Neil McCarthy (basketball coach)|Neil McCarthy]]-coached team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. Aggie Basketball has seen 18 NCAA Tournament appearances, 5 NIT Tournament appearances and 14 conference championships.

==History==
NMSU Basketball has seen much success throughout the years, reaching the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] in 1970, the &quot;[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]]&quot; in 1992 among their 18 tournament appearances. Their two most successful coaches were [[Lou Henson]] and [[Neil McCarthy (basketball coach)|Neil McCarthy]].

===Jerry Hines Era (1929-40,46)===
[[Jerry Hines]] was one of the most exceptional Aggies. He was an outstanding two-sport athlete, the head basketball and head football coach, and the athletic director, each with success.  During the later 1930s, the Aggie football team was 31-10-6 and the basketball team was 102-36 under Hines. The Aggie basketball team went to several postseason tournaments during this time, including the [[1938 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], and the [[1939 NIT tournament]] in New York City. The Hines era ended at the onset of [[World War II]] when he was called to duty in September 1940 as a member of a [[New Mexico National Guard]] unit assigned to the [[45 Infantry Division]]. Hines did return for one more Aggie basketball season in 1946-47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bleedcrimson.net/jerryhines_ringofhonor |title= Aggie History With Walter Hines: Jerry Hines, 2009 Men's Basketball Ring of Honor Inductee |first= Walter |last= Hines |date= 26 Jan 2009 |work= www.bleedcrimson.net | publisher = www.bleedcrimson.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lou Henson Era (1966-75)===
[[Lou Henson]] played for the Aggies in the 1950s, coached at [[Las Cruces High School]], and came from [[Hardin-Simmons University]] to become the head coach. His tenure was the most successful in Aggie history. His 1970 team reached the [[1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four, losing to a [[John Wooden]]-coached and eventual champion, [[UCLA]].

Henson led the Aggies to the NCAA tournament in six of his nine years. He left in 1975 for a successful 21-year run at [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]].

===Neil McCarthy (1985-1997)===
[[Neil McCarthy (basketball coach)|Neil McCarthy]] came to Las Cruces in 1985 following a successful 10-year run at [[Weber State Wildcats men's basketball|Weber State]].  He'd built Weber State into a regional power, and was equally successful at New Mexico State.  For most of McCarthy's tenure, the Aggies were the second-best team in the Big West, behind [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels|UNLV]].  After the Rebels hit the skids in the early 1990s, McCarthy led the Aggies to four straight regular season and tournament titles, including the 1992 Sweet Sixteen run.

However, the 1992 Sweet Sixteen run, along with two other NCAA runs in the early 1990s, was scrubbed from the books in 1996 when the NCAA found several players from that team received help on correspondence courses from a coach.  Without those courses, the players would not have been eligible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&amp;key=26&amp;publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED 1996 NCAA infraction report]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The McCarthy era came to a sudden and abrupt end just weeks before the 1997-98 season when new athletic director Jim Paul stripped him of coaching duties, citing the team's poor academic performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/101797/LQ2663.htm McCarthy out as coach; NMSU turns to Henson]. [[Associated Press]], 1997-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCarthy was originally supposed to serve as an assistant athletic director for the balance of his contract, but instead sued NMSU for wrongful terminationâa move that would come back to haunt the school later.&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;&gt;Herrerra, Pete. [http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/college_basketball/20010620-1512-bkc-ncaa-new.html NCAA places New Mexico St. on four years' probation]. [[Associated Press]] via [[San Diego Union-Tribune]], 2001-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lou Henson's 2nd Run (1997-2004)===
Henson was lured from retirement to coach the team on an interim basis for the 1997-98 season after McCarthy's ouster. Henson wanted to donate his time, but state law forbade him from coaching the program for free.  He ultimately settled for $1 per month. The following season Henson agreed to stay on as head coach on a permanent basis, leading the Aggies back to the [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] in 1999.

In 2000, the Aggies were rocked again by a scandal from the McCarthy era.  McCarthy had promised to hire a junior college coach as an assistant coach in return for bringing two of his top players to Las Cruces.  That coach, in turn, helped the players with coursework and exams.  The school placed the basketball program on two years' probation and withdrew from postseason consideration during the 2000-2001 season.  The NCAA imposed an additional four years' probation and forced the Aggies to vacate McCarthy's last season and the first season of Henson's second stint.  The NCAA said that the penalties would have been even harsher if the school's former president, the former athletic director and McCarthy had still been at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&amp;key=516&amp;publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED 2001 NCAA infraction report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson continued to coach the Aggies until being sidelined by [[Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma]] prior to the 2004-05 season. Due to Henson's illness the Aggies were led that year by assistant coach [[Tony Stubblefield]], who guided the squad to a dismal 6-24 record, by far the school's worst season in twenty years. Henson officially announced his retirement from coaching in January 2005, and Stubblefield remained interim head coach for the remainder of the season.

===The Louisville Connection (2005-Present)===
On March 31, 2005, NMSU hired 13-year NBA veteran [[Reggie Theus]], then an assistant at [[University of Louisville|Louisville]] under [[Rick Pitino]], as head men's basketball coach.  In his first season, Theus turned the Aggies from a 6-24 squad in 2004-05 to a 16-14 team in the 2005-06 season as the Aggies moved from the [[Sun Belt Conference]] to the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. In Theus' second year the Aggies finished the regular season at 22-8, won the WAC Tournament on their home floor, and earn an automatic bid to the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|2007 NCAA Tournament]]. Following the tournament Theus left NMSU to take over the head coaching position of the  [[National Basketball Association|NBA's]] [[Sacramento Kings]]. [[Marvin Menzies]] was named as the successor, and like Theus before him, came to NMSU after having been an assistant to [[Rick Pitino|Pitino]], and had no previous Division I head coaching experience. In 2010 the Aggies again advanced to the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]].
