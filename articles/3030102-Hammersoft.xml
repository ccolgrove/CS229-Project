'''Leicestershire County Council''' is the [[county council]] for the English [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Leicestershire]]. It was originally formed in 1889 by the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. The county is divided into 52 [[electoral division]]s, which return a total of 55 councillors. The council is controlled by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and is led by David Parsons. The headquarters of the council is County Hall at [[Glenfield]], just outside the city of [[Leicester]].

== History ==
From its establishment in 1889 to 1974 the county council covered the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Leicestershire, excluding [[Leicester]]. In 1974 the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act]] reconstituted Leicestershire County Council, adding the former [[county borough]] of Leicester, and the small county of [[Rutland]] to the area. On 1 April 1997 these were removed from the County Council area again, to become [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]].

==Districts and Boroughs==
Leicestershire has three tiers of local government. These tiers are the county council, seven [[Non-metropolitan district|district or borough]] councils and [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]]. In urban areas the work of the [[civil parish|parish]] council is likely to be undertaken by the county or district council. The seven district councils in Leicestershire are &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leics.gov.uk/index/your_council/local_democracy/council_local_gov.htm Leicestershire County Council site]&lt;/ref&gt;:
* [[Blaby (district)|Blaby District Council]]
* [[Charnwood (borough)|Charnwood Borough Council]]
* [[Harborough (district)|Harborough District Council]]
* [[Hinckley and Bosworth|Hinckley &amp; Bosworth Borough Council]]
* [[Melton (district)|Melton Borough Council]]
* [[North West Leicestershire|North West Leicestershire District Council]]
* [[Oadby and Wigston|Oadby &amp; Wigston Borough Council]]
These district councils are responsible for [[planning permission|local planning]] and [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|building control]], local roads, [[council housing]], [[environmental health]], markets and fairs, [[refuse collection]] and [[recycling]], [[cemeteries]] and [[crematoria]], leisure services, parks, and tourism&lt;ref name=lc&gt;[http://tellmeabout.thelocalchannel.co.uk/home.aspx?p=0&amp;m=86 The Local Channel accessed 20 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

They leave the subjects of [[Local Education Authority|education]], [[social services]], [[library|libraries]], main roads, [[public transport]] policy and  [[fire service]]s, [[Trading Standards|trading standards]], [[waste disposal]] and strategic planning for Leicestershire to the County Council.&lt;ref name=lc/&gt;

== Political control ==
The most recent election was the [[Leicestershire County Council election, 2009|June 2009 elections]], where all seats were up for re-election.  Leicestershire County Council consists of 55 elected members.

Elections were held for the reconstituted county council (including Leicester and Rutland) in 1973, leading to [[no overall control]]. 1977 saw the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] take control, but they lost it again in 1981. Elections in 1985, 1989, 1993 and 1997 continued No Overall Control. The Conservatives took control in 2001, helped in part by the removal of the strongly Labour-voting Leicester from the county.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/locals/html/3867.stm Local election results: Leicestershire, BBC, May 2005] accessed June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departments ==

There are five departments:

*Corporate Resources (including Property, Financial Services and ICT Services)
*Environment and Transport
*Adults and Communities
*Children and Young People's Services
*Chief Executive's (Policy, publicity)

Increasingly governance is breaking away from the departmental structure and becoming programme-based. There are currently six major programmes:

*Organisational Efficiency (mostly financial projects)
*People and Performance (human resources)
*Customer First (service shops and call centres)
*Work Well (mobile and flexible working)
*Highways Service Efficiency
*Waste Strategy
