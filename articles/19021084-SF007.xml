'''Ubuntu Mobile Internet Device Edition''' was an [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] distribution planned to run on the [[Intel Mobile Internet Device]] platform, [[x86]] mobile computers based on the [[Intel Atom]] [[CPU|processor]]. It was planned to use the [[GNOME]] framework [[Hildon]] as the basis for its [[GUI]].

Equipment producers would have been able to customize their distributions, including options such as [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], or custom interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubuntu.com/products/mobile Ubuntu Mobile Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
According to Canonical, it would provide an uncompromised [[Web 2.0]] experience: Web browsing, email, media, camera, [[VoIP]], instant messaging, [[GPS]], [[blogging]], [[digital TV]], [[Video game|games]], contacts, dates/calendar, simple software updates will be available periodically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubuntu.com/products/mobile Ubuntu Mobile Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Ubuntu Mobile Edition will only need a touchscreen device and a finger for navigation.

==Release history==
In June 2008, Ubuntu MID Edition 8.04 was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.canonical.com/?p=13 Canonical Blog Â» Blog Archive Â» Ubuntu MID Edition 8.04 achieves its first public release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=ubuntu_mid_804 [Phoronix&amp;#93; Ubuntu MID Edition 8.04&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ubuntu MID Edition ended active development after 9.10 Alpha 6.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileTeam/Mobile?action=show&amp;redirect=MobileAndEmbedded Ubuntu Mobile Team Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of MID has stopped, but Ubuntu continues to work on mobile distributions such as [[Kubuntu Mobile]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileTeam/UbuntuLiquid kubuntu mobile.]&lt;/ref&gt;, or the ARM version of ubuntu.

== Kubuntu Mobile ==
Kubuntu Mobile is available for i386 and ARM platforms and uses the [[KDE]] Plasma Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kubuntu.org/news/10.10-release |title=Kubuntu 10.10 | Kubuntu |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma Mobile is targeted at smartphones and small tablet devices that are mainly used via touch input. It is still being developed with the first stable release expected to be due in 2011, although individual KDE applications may be released earlier as part of the porting effort to MeeGo. Preview releases of the Kontact applications and a document viewer based on KOffice are already available.
