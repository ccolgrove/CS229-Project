'''St George's Shopping Centre''', formerly ''The Mall Preston'' and ''The Mall St George'', is a [[shopping centre]] in the city of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], England.

== History ==
[[Image:Pedestrian zone outside St George's Shopping Centre - geograph.org.uk - 55583.jpg |thumb|alt=The Friargate entrance in 2002|The Friargate entrance in 2002]]
The shopping centre opened on 22 March 1966 as ''St George's Shopping Centre''. It was originally an open-air centre and was roofed over during refurbishment in 1981. It was further refurbished in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, P. (1996) ''Nostalgic Preston'', True North Publishing, Halifax, ISBN 1-900-463-50-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

When [[The Mall Company]] took over the centre, they were greeted with an aging shopping centre.  The shopping centre was rebranded as ''The Mall'', and a massive development scheme was planned.  Small stalls, main shops, cafes, restaurants, toilets, and escalators were overhauled. The introduction of [[Plasma display|television screens]] in the shopping centre has given information and news to the shoppers in the centre. The Mall Company also put 'Ask Me' points in the centre, so that shoppers could ask members of staff directions and other information.

In 2010, the shopping centre was acquired by [[Aviva Investors]] for Â£87m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Preston-city-shopping-centre-sold.6133359.jp | title=Preston city shopping centre sold for Â£87m | first1=Ben | last1=Robinson | first2=David | last2=Coates | work=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] | publisher=[[Johnston Press]] | date=2010-03-09 | accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shopping-centre.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/3387/Mall_sells_St_George_s_shopping_centre,_Preston.html Mall sells St George's shopping centre, Preston]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, The Mall was rebranded under its original name ''St George's Shopping Centre''.

== Centre information ==

The centre is arranged around a large circular glass-roofed rotunda in the centre, where there is a [[Costa Coffee]] cafe, which was originally known as &quot;The Bullring&quot; when it was open air.

Radiating from the rotunda are large halls and promenades, lined with shops and stalls. Glass roofs and walls are also evident in the centre. A two-floor hall leads to Friargate, with another hall leading to Fishergate on the upper floor, and a third route leading to Lune Street on the lower floor. The rotunda also has a third floor with offices and access to the centre's car park.

== Transport links ==

St George's is located between the city's two main shopping streets of Fishergate and Friargate, and runs its own multi-storey car park above the centre, which can be accessed from Lune Street.  There is a [[Preston Park &amp; Ride]] bus stop outside the centre's Lune Street entrance, and Fishergate is served by several bus routes.  The centre is within half a mile of [[Preston railway station]] and [[Preston bus station]].
