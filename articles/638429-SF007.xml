[[Image:20020730092044 - FreePascal IDE.jpg|right|240px|thumbnail|The Free Pascal IDE for Linux. The computer was being prepared for use in the 2002 [[National Olympiad in Informatics, China]]]]

'''Free Pascal''' Compiler ('''FPC''' for short, and formerly known as '''FPK Pascal'''&lt;ref&gt;Free Pascal used to be known as '''FPK Pascal''', where ''FPK'' stands for the author [[Florian Paul KlÃ¤mpfl]].  The name of the project was changed to ''Free Pascal Compiler'' at the end of 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[free software|free]] [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] and [[Object Pascal]] [[compiler]].

In addition to its own [[Object Pascal]] dialect, Free Pascal supports, to varying degrees, the dialects of several other compilers, including those of [[Turbo Pascal]], [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]], and some historical [[Macintosh]] compilers.  Dialect is selected on a [[Modular programming|per-unit (module)]] basis, and more than one dialects can be used to produce a single program.

A member of the ''[[write once, compile anywhere]]'' campaign, Free Pascal is available for many [[CPU architecture|architectures]] and [[operating system]]s (see [[#Targets|Targets]]).  It has an excellent support for integration of [[assembly language]], and supports internal assembler in a number of dialects.

Separate projects exist to facilitate the development of [[cross-platform]] [[GUI|graphical]] applications, the most prominent one being the [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]] [[Integrated development environment|IDE]].

==Supported dialects==
Free Pascal adopted the ''de facto'' standard dialect of Pascal programmers, [[Borland]] Pascal and, later, Delphi.  From version 2.0 on, the Delphi 7 compatibility has been continuously implemented or improved.

In fact, the project has a '''compilation mode''' concept, and the developers made it clear that they would incorporate working patches for the [[ANSI]]/[[ISO]] standardized dialects to create a standards-compliant mode.

A small effort has been made to support some of the [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] Pascal syntax, to ease interfacing to [[Mac OS]] and [[Mac OS X]]. Since the Apple dialect implements some Standard Pascal features that Turbo Pascal and Delphi omit, Free Pascal is a bit more ISO-compatible than these.

The 2.2.''x'' series does not significantly change the dialect objectives beyond Delphi 7, instead they aim for closer compatibility. The project still lacks the Delphi functionality of compiler-supported exporting of classes from shared libraries, which is for example useful for [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], which implements packages of components.

{{As of|2011}} in the current development branch several Delphi 2006-specific features have been added, and some of the starting work for the features new in Delphi 2009 (most notably the addition of the &lt;code&gt;UnicodeString&lt;/code&gt; type) has been done.  The development branch also features an âObjective-Pascalâ extension for [[Objective-C]] ([[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]) interfacing.

The current trunk (2.5.1) version implements basic ISO Pascal mode, though many things such as &lt;code&gt;Get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; procedure and file buffer variable concept for file handling are still missing.

==History==
===The early years===
Free Pascal emerged when [[Borland]] made it clear that [[Borland Pascal]] development for MS-DOS would stop with version 7, to be replaced by a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-only product (which became Delphi later on).

Student Florian Paul KlÃ¤mpfl started developing his own compiler, written in the Turbo Pascal dialect, and produced [[32-bit]] code for the go32v1 [[DOS extender|extender]], which was used and developed by the [[DJGPP|DJGPP project]] at that time.

Originally, the compiler itself was a [[16-bit]] DOS executable compiled by [[Turbo Pascal]]. After two years the compiler was able to [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|compile itself]], and became a 32-bit executable.

===Expansion===
The initial 32-bit compiler was published on the [[Internet]], and the first contributors joined the project. Later a [[Linux]] port was made by Michael van Canneyt, five years before [[Kylix programming tool|Kylix]] became available.

The DOS port was adapted for use in [[OS/2]] using the [[EMX extender]] which made OS/2 the second supported compilation target - apart from support of Florian KlÃ¤mpfl as the original author, DaniÃ«l Mantione contributed significantly to make this happen and provide the original port of the run-time library to OS/2 / EMX. The compiler improved gradually, and the [[MS-DOS]] version migrated to the go32v2 extender. This culminated in release 0.99.5, which was much more widely used than previous versions, and was the last release aiming only for Turbo Pascal complianceâlater releases added a Delphi compatibility mode. This release was also ported to systems using a [[Motorola 68000 family|680x0]] processor.

With release 0.99.8 the [[Win32]] target was added, and a start was made with incorporating some Delphi features. Stabilizing for a non-beta release began, and version 1.0  was released in July 2000. The 1.0.''x'' series &lt;!--and the bug-fix/stabilization releases that followed, last, 1.0.10 in July 2003--&gt; was widely used, both as an enterprise and educational tool. For the 1.0.''x'' releases, the port to 68k CPU was redone, and the compiler produced stable code for a number of 68k [[Unix-like|Unix]] and [[AmigaOS]] operating systems.

===The second generation===
During the stabilization of what would become 1.0.''x'', and specially when porting to the [[Motorola]] 68k systems, it was clear that the design of the code generator was far too limited in many ways. The principal problems were that adding processors basically meant rewriting the code generator, and that the register allocation was based on the principle of always keeping three free registers between building blocks, which was inflexible and hard to maintain.

For these reasons, the 1.1.''x'' [[Branching (software)|branched]] from the 1.0.''x'' main branch in December 1999. At first, changes were mostly clean-ups and rewrite/design to all parts of the compiler, and then the code generator and register allocator were rewritten. As a bonus, remaining missing Delphi compatibility was added.

The work on 1.1.x continued slowly but steadily, and in late 2003 a working [[PowerPC]] port became available, followed by an [[ARM architecture|ARM]] port in summer 2004, a [[SPARC]] port in fall 2004, and an [[AMD64]] port&amp;mdash;which made the compiler available for a 64-bit platform&amp;mdash;in early 2004.

In November 2003 a first [[Beta testing|beta]] release of the 1.1.''x'' branch was packaged and numbered 1.9.0. These were quickly followed by versions 1.9.2 and 1.9.4; version 1.9.4 introduced Mac OS X support. The work continued with version 1.9.6  (January 2005), 1.9.8 (late February 2005), 2.0.0 (May 2005), 2.0.2 (December 2005), and 2.0.4 (August 2006).

===Consolidation: the 2.2 series===
In 2006 some of the major reworks planned for 2.2, such as the rewrite of the unit system, had not started, and it was decided to start stabilizing the already implemented features. &lt;!--This to allow a 2.2 release, and push the unimplemented features to a future 2.3 and 2.4 branch.  (???) --&gt;

Some of the motivations for this [[plan|roadmap]] change were the needs of the [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]] project, particularly the internal linker, support for [[Win64]], [[Windows CE]], and Mac OS X on [[x86]], and related features like [[DWARF]].  After betas 2.1.2 and 2.1.4, version 2.2.0 was released in September 2007, followed by version 2.2.2 in August 2008  and version 2.2.4 in March 2009.

The 2.2.''x'' series vastly improved the [[ActiveX]]/[[Component Object Model|COM]], [[Interface (computer science)|interface]], and [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] support, though bugs are still being found. The delegation to interface using the &lt;code&gt;implements&lt;/code&gt; keyword is partially implemented, but was not complete {{As of|2011|3|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://bugs.freepascal.org/view.php?id=8951&lt;/ref&gt; Library support for ActiveX was also improved.

Another major highlight was the internal linker for Win32, Win64, and Windows CE, which much improves linking time and memory use, and makes the compile-link-run cycle in Lazarus much faster. The efficiency for smart-linking, or dead code elimination, has also been improved.

Minor new features are improved DWARF (2/3) debug format support, and optimizations such as [[tail recursion]], omission of unneeded [[stack frame]]s and register-based [[Common subexpression elimination|CSE optimization]]. A first implementation of [[Generic programming|generics]] support is also available, but only for exploration purposes.

==The 2.4.''x'' series==
The 2.4.''x'' series had a less clear set of goals than earlier releases. The unit system rewrite was postponed again, and the branch that became 2.4 was created to keep risky commits from 2.2 to stabilize it. Mostly these risky commits were more involved improvements to the new platforms, Mac [[PowerPC]] 64, Mac [[x86-64]], iPhone, and many fixes to the ARM and x86-64 architectures in general, as well as [[DWARF]].

Other compiler improvements included [[whole program optimization]] (WPO) and devirtualization and ARM [[EABI]] support.

Later, during the 2.2 cycle, a more [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]]-like resource support (based on special sections in the binary instead of Pascal constants) was added; this feature, direly needed by [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], became the main highlight of the branch.

Other more minor points were a [[memory manager]] that improved [[Dynamic memory allocation|heap]] manager performance in [[Thread (computer science)|threaded]] environments, small improvements in Delphi compatibility such as &lt;code&gt;OleVariant&lt;/code&gt;, and improvements in [[interface (computer science)|interface]] [[delegation (programming)|delegation]].

Free Pascal 2.4.0 was released on January 1, 2010, followed by bug fix release 2.4.2 on November 13, 2010, containing support for &lt;code&gt;for..in&lt;/code&gt; loops, and &lt;code&gt;sealed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt; classes, and other changes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://wiki.freepascal.org/User_Changes_2.4.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

As of version 3.0, Free Pascal will also support byte code generation for the [[Java Virtual Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_JVM freepascal wiki: FPC JVM]. Seen on August 23rd, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrated development environments (IDEs)==

Like most modern compilers, Free Pascal can be used with an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE).

===Lazarus===
{{Main|Lazarus (IDE)}}

[[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]] is the most popular IDE used by Free&amp;nbsp;Pascal programmers.  It provides a Delphi-like development experience, and can be used to create [[console application|console]] and [[graphical user interface|graphical]] applications.

Lazarus provides a cross-platform user interface framework, called [[Lazarus (IDE)#Lazarus Component Library|Lazarus Component Library]] (LCL).  Graphical applications created with LCL can be ported to another platform [[Write once, compile anywhere|with a recompilation]].

===MSEide===

[http://www.msegui.org/ MSEide] is another Free&amp;nbsp;Pascal-based IDE that is {{cn-span|aimed at building lightweight applications|date=October 2011}}.   MSEgui, like LCL to Lazarus, is the class library that comes with MSEide.  It communicates directly with [[X11]] via [[Xlib]] on [[Linux]], and [[WinAPI|gdi32]] under [[Windows]], with support for [[multiple document interface]] (MDI) and visual form [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]].
