==Background and development==
In 2006, Children's BBC expressed an interest in producing a ''Doctor Who'' spin-off. Their initial idea was &quot;a drama based on the idea of a young ''Doctor Who''&quot;, but Russell T Davies vetoed this.  &quot;Somehow, the idea of a fourteen-year-old [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], on [[Gallifrey]] inventing [[sonic screwdriver]]s, takes away from the mystery and intrigue of who he is and where he came from,&quot; said Davies. He suggested instead a series based on the Doctor's former [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Sarah Jane Smith.&lt;ref name=insidestory&gt;{{cite book

 |page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Sarah Jane Smith, played by Sladen, appeared in ''Doctor Who'' from 1973 to 1976, alongside [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]] and later [[Tom Baker]] as the [[Fourth Doctor]]. A pilot episode for another ''Doctor Who'' spin-off series, ''[[K-9 and Company]]'', made in 1981, featured Sarah Jane and the robot dog [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]]; however, a full series was never commissioned. Sarah Jane and K-9 returned to ''Doctor Who'' in various media many times over the years, most notably in the 20th anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' (1983), and in episodes &quot;[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]&quot; (2006), &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot; (2008), &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot; (2008) and ''[[The End of Time]]'' (2010).

Sarah Jane is frequently voted the most popular ''Doctor Who'' companion by both ''Doctor Who'' fans and members of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prospect of a new television series focusing on Sarah Jane was first rumoured in ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' in March 2006, prior to the airing of &quot;School Reunion&quot;; the report at that time suggested that Sarah Jane and K-9 would both appear in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of The Sarah Jane Adventures serials}}

''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' was first seen by its original British audience in the form of a 60-minute New Year's Day special in 2007, titled &quot;[[Invasion of the Bane]]&quot;, which was co-written by Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWM373&quot; /&gt; Though it may{{OR|date=October 2011}} have appeared so to the viewing audience, &quot;Bane&quot; was not a pilot. Instead, it was a [[List of Christmas Specials#Examples of British Christmas television special|holiday special]]. Nevertheless, because of the atypical broadcast order â holiday specials in Britain typically air ''after'' the regular run of the series to which they're attached â the story had many conventional introductory elements common to pilots. Creator Russell T Davies has commented upon the exceptional broadcast situation, saying &quot;''Sarah Jane Adventures'' is slightly unusual in that it was commissioned before we'd written the script. If we'd written a load of rubbish, they'd still have had to make it.&quot; He refers to &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot; simply as the &quot;first episode&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dwmjan2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Series one of the show aired in September of that year, consisting of five two-part half-hour stories. Individual half-hour episodes aired once a week on [[BBC One]], with episodes airing a week ahead on children's digital channel [[CBBC Channel|CBBC]]. The final part aired in November 2007. The second season started in September 2008 using the same format, with six stories instead of five, ending the season in December. The third season started 15 October 2009, twice weekly (Thursdays and Fridays) on BBC One from 15 October to 20 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monday, 28 September 2009, 7:02&amp;nbsp;pm EDT |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/cult/a176657/elisabeth-sladen-sarah-jane-adventures.html |title=Elisabeth Sladen ('Sarah Jane Adventures') â Sarah Jane Adventures Interview â British TV |publisher=Digital Spy |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novelisations===
''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' merchandising revived the concept of the episode novelisation, which had been part of the ''Doctor Who'' franchise from the 1970s to the 1990s. The first season and most of the second were adapted in this way, but later seasons saw only a few releases and a transition from print to e-books.
