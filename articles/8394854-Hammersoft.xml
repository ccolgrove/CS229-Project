== History ==

UMHB's history dates to the time before Texas became a state. Its original charter was granted by the Republic of Texas (prior to statehood) in 1845 as the female division of Baylor College (present-day [[Baylor University]]). Classes began in May, 1846, in a small wooden building on a hillside at [[Independence, Texas|Independence]] in Washington County. The first class consisted of twenty-four male and female students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baylor.edu/about/index.php?id=47601|title=About Baylor: Henry Lee Graves, Baylor President 1846-1851|accessdate=2008-05-18|publisher=Baylor.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Law&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.baylor.edu/History/university.htm|title=History of Baylor University|accessdate=2008-05-18|publisher=Baylor Law |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514190930/http://law.baylor.edu/History/university.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was a coeducational institution, the classes were still separated by gender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/UU/kbu5.html|title=University of Mary Hardin-Baylor|accessdate=2008-05-18|publisher=[[Handbook of Texas Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baylor Collegeâs coeducation lasted only until 1851 when it was divided into a Female Department and a Male Department.&lt;ref name=&quot;OurHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/parents/gettoknow/our_history.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Our History|accessdate=2008-05-18|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each began occupying separate buildings approximately a mile apart at the Independence campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Law&quot; /&gt;

The changing demography of Texas and relocation of the local railroad made it increasingly difficult for college students to get transportation to Independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;OurHistory&quot; /&gt; Both colleges were relocated in 1886 to their permanent homes in Central Texas: the women's division relocated to Belton where operations continued as Baylor Female College; the men's division moved to Waco, merged with coeducational Waco University, and continued as Baylor University.&lt;ref name=&quot;OurHistory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Law&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt;

The Cottage Home System, the first work-study program for women in a college west of the Mississippi, was instituted on the new Belton campus in 1893 by Elli Moore Townsend, wife of the serving president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt; Its aim was to provide more affordable housing for women students who could not meet the expense of dormitories. The women students earned financial assistance by growing vegetables, raising livestock, and hand making crafts and quality clothing items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2342&amp;srcid=2362|title=Pair of frontier Texas Baptists advance cause of women, historians learn|accessdate=2008-05-18|publisher=[[Baptist General Convention of Texas]]|last=Camp|first=Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the cottages were modest wood frame residences. In 1905, a permanent residence hall for the Cottage Home System was built by the residents themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt;

Beginning in 1922, a few male students, known as &quot;Campus Boys,&quot; were allowed to attend classes and work on campus through their junior year, at which time they transferred to Baylor University or another college for their senior year and graduation.&lt;ref name=&quot;70s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temple-telegram.com/story/2007/08/26/43116|title=The 1970s: The 'we' decade|accessdate=2008-05-19|publisher=''[[Temple Daily Telegram]]''|last=Coppedge|first=Clay}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Campus Boys&quot; did work that was deemed unsuitable for the young ladies. They maintained the grounds, unloaded coal from rail cars, milked cows, fed hogs, served as night watchmen, and unstopped drains. They lived on the second floor of a carpenter shop in quarters dubbed &quot;The Shack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdtnews.com/story/2009/05/04/57685/|title=Back Roads: UMHBâs âcampus boysâ faced 20-1 ratio in classes|last=Romer|first=Paul A.|date=2009-05-04|work=[[Temple Daily Telegram]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Baylor Female College was renamed Baylor College for Women. A year later in 1926, it was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Universities (now SACS), being the first Texas Baptist college to do so. Then in 1927, it received accreditation from the American Association of Colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;OurHistory&quot; /&gt; In 1925, enrollment peaked at 2,372 which forced the college to start a costly building project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt; That, in addition to a devastating campus fire in 1929, required immediate construction of even more buildings and, with the help of the [[Great Depression]], brought the college to the edge of bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt; It was saved by a generous gift from Mary and John G. Hardin. In gratitude, the college changed its name to Mary Hardin-Baylor College in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;OurHistory&quot; /&gt;

In 1968, the [[University of Mary Hardin-Baylor#Scott and White College of Nursing|Scott &amp; White College of Nursing]], named for the [[Scott &amp; White Memorial Hospital]] located in nearby [[Temple, Texas|Temple]], became a part of Mary Hardin-Baylor College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/nursing/deans_welcome.html|title=Scott &amp; White College of Nursing - About Us|accessdate=2008-05-19|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Hardin-Baylor College once again became fully co-educational in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;70s&quot; /&gt; With the inauguration in 1978 of its first graduate program, a Master of Education, the college achieved status as a university with five schools: Arts and Sciences, Creative Arts, Business, Education, and Nursing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot; /&gt; It was renamed the University of Mary HardinâBaylor.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRL&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OurHistory&quot; /&gt;

== Academics ==
There are 12 undergraduate majors and 13 graduate degree programs, including several Master's degree and one doctoral program.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRL&quot; /&gt; Qualified students can participate in engaged learning through [[internship]]s with businesses and industries. Study abroad programs are offered on 3 continents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Provost&quot; /&gt;

UMHB comprises eight colleges:  College of Business, College of Christian Studies, College of Education, College of Humanities, Scott and White College of Nursing, College of Sciences, College of Visual and Performing Arts.

== Traditions ==
=== Easter Pageant ===

For 70 consecutive years&lt;ref name=&quot;Pageant&quot; /&gt; the University of Mary HardinâBaylor has produced an outdoor reproduction of the [[Holy Week]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/students/gettoknow/traditions/easter_pageant.html|title=Easter Pageant|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year the pageant takes place on the Wednesday afternoon before [[Easter]] and is performed on campus in front of Luther Memorial. The Easter Pageant is fully produced by the students of UMHB themselves, including directing, costumes and performances and draws nearly 5,000 viewers each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pageant&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwtx.com/iwitness/headlines/16352991.html|title=UMHB Sixty-Ninth Annual Easter Pageant|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=[[KWTX-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charter Day ===

Charter Day is an annual tradition that celebrates the charter signing on February 1, 1845. The event is held during chapel service on the first Wednesday in February. During the service, seniors sing the alumni/senior song, &quot;[[University of Mary Hardin-Baylor#&quot;Up with the Purple&quot;|Up with the Purple]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/prospective/gettoknow/traditions/charter_day.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Traditions - Charter Day|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the service, it is tradition for seniors to place a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Judge R.E.B. Baylor]], located in the courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/onlinebells/article/7587|title=Charter Day celebrates university past, future|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=The Bells Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Candlelighting ===

The Candlelighting Ceremony was started in 1939 by the Alumni Association to encourage a closer relationship between alumnae, students and the college. During the ceremony, those in attendance are handed a candle at which time the seniors light a smaller candle from the Alumni Association president's larger candle, and the seniors then proceed to light the others in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/prospective/gettoknow/traditions/candlelighting.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Traditions - Candlelighting|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Midnight March ===

At midnight on the Saturday of Homecoming Weekend, seniors in [[Academic dress|regalia]] march with lighted candles around Vann Circle Drive. As they sing the senior/alumni song, &quot;Up With the Purple,&quot; they stop to light the candles of special friends and alumni.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/prospective/gettoknow/traditions/midnight_march.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Traditions - Midnight March|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the Midnight March, the dormitory residents would witness the March inside of their dark rooms. Later during the ceremony, the residents would migrate into the hallway so senior friends could light their candles. Due to fire codes, however, the March was moved outdoors.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot; /&gt;

=== Robing ===

Believed to be held as early as 1902, Robing was initially associated with graduation weekend in which juniors and seniors marched to the front of the Wilson Administration Building, the future site of the Sanderford Administration Complex, possessing a chain of daisies given by the sophomores. The juniors were then honored by having the senior's academic regalia passed on to them, symbolizing the transfer of student leadership. It also marked the first time the juniors were allowed to sing &quot;Up with the Purple&quot;. The ceremony is now a part of chapel service known as Robing Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/prospective/gettoknow/traditions/robing.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Traditions - Robing|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dubbing Ceremony ===

The Dubbing Ceremony started in 1995 at the request of students who wanted a more emotional attachment to the university. Thus, the next Fall and every fall thereafter, all new students were honored, or &quot;dubbed,&quot; with a ceremonial sword from the university president pronouncing them as &quot;Crusaders Forever.&quot; Starting in 1999, a similar dubbing ceremony was started specially for alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/prospective/gettoknow/traditions/dubbing_ceremony.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Traditions - Dubbing Ceremony|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hanging of the Green ===

Following the school's annual Christmas Dinner, representatives of different campus organizations are led by the Residence Hall Association in hanging wreaths on all buildings facing the quadrangle. The event includes singing Christmas carols and reading the story of the birth of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/prospective/gettoknow/traditions/hanging_of_the_green.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Traditions|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &quot;Up with the Purple&quot; ==

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;
''Up with the Purple, the Gold and the White
High o'er the college tower
Forth from her portals we step in her might,
Men and women great in power.
Yes, we come from old Baylor,
Her loyal sons and her daughters true,
And proudly each one hails the memory
Of Baylor College, for we love you.

All hail to thee, old Baylor,
Proud daughter of the South
With heart and voice we praise thee
As we go marching forth.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

== UMHB Alma Mater ==

The current Alma Mater was sung for the first time in February 1994 with the lyrics written by two students and the music written by two graduates of the university. Former school songs included &quot;Centennial Song,&quot; &quot;Old Baylor,&quot; &quot;Mary Hardin-Baylor College,&quot; &quot;Old Baylor Is Marching,&quot; &quot;Slinga da Ink,&quot; and &quot;Swing Song.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhb.edu/prospective/gettoknow/traditions/school_song.html|title=Get to Know UMHB: Traditions - School Song|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=UMHB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;
''Dear Mary Hardin-Baylor, who stands ever proud and strong.
With courage, boldness and loyalty, our Crusader leads us on.
We will keep you high in honor, forever through our days.
With endless time and wonder, our love will never fade.
Ever thankful for our past, into the future we will go.
With faithfulness and devotion to you. Our Purple, White, and Gold.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

== UMHB Fight Song ==

Though it's rarely sung, there are words to the UMHB fight song which is played at most sporting events throughout the year.
&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;
''March on, Crusaders!
We're gonna fight, with all our might,
And it will give us the victory.
We are the Purple, Gold, and White! (Go 'Saders)
Proud our tradition â in faith and loyalty
Come on, let's cheer for the 'Saders,
For 'ole UMHB!''
&lt;/poem&gt;
* Music â Carl Cooper
* Words â Erin Cooper (Class of 1996) and Carl Cooper
