'''PolicyKit''' is an operating system component for controlling system-wide privileges in [[Unix-like]] operating systems.  It provides an organized way for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged ones.  In contrast to systems such as [[sudo]], it does not grant [[Superuser|root]] permission to an entire process, but rather allows a finer level of control of centralized system policy. It is developed and maintained by David Zeuthen from [[Red Hat]] and  hosted by the [[freedesktop.org]] project.

[[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] was the first distribution to include PolicyKit and it has since been used in various other distributions including [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] since 8.04  and [[OpenSUSE]] since 10.3.

It is also possible to use PolicyKit to execute commands with elevated privileges using the command ''pkexec'' followed by the command intended to be executed with root permissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://hal.freedesktop.org/docs/polkit/pkexec.1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
