A '''loaded march''' is a rapid march over distance carrying weight. The ability to complete loaded marches is a core military skill in many countries. However in certain climates loaded marches are not practiced since they would result in high casualties through [[heat exhaustion]]. 

A loaded march is known as a &quot;Tab&quot; in the British Army and a &quot;Yomp&quot; in [[Royal Marines]] [[slang]].

==In the Roman Army==
During the four month initial training of a Roman legionary, loaded marches were a core part of the training. Standards varied over time, but normally recruits were first required to complete 20 Roman miles (29.62km or 18.405 modern miles) with 20.5kg in five summer hours (the Roman day was divided into 12 hours regardless of season), which was known as &quot;the regular step&quot;. They then progressed to the &quot;faster step&quot; and were required to complete 24 Roman miles (35.544 km or 22.086 modern miles) in five summer hours loaded with 20.5kg. 

Training also included some forced marches of 20-30 miles, often followed by the construction of basic defenses for an overnight position.

==In the British Armed Forces==
In the British Army loaded marching is considered a core skill and is tested annually in an eight mile (12.9km) [[Combat Fitness Test]] carrying 15â25&amp;nbsp;kg depending on the arm. The term ''tab'' has its roots in an [[acronym]], being an abbreviation of Tactical Advance to Battle.

The most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. After disembarking from ships at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] on [[East Falkland]], on 21 May 1982, Royal Marines and members of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering {{convert|56|mi|km}}&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 21 The Bridgehead and Beyond: &quot;There were two considerations. First, the distance between Stanley and San Carlos was some '''56''' miles and given the problems posed by the terrain it would take at least eight days to cover the ground. Movement would be 'under constant enemy fire from the air, in an area without cover, wood, drinking water or means of subsistence'. When his men arrived, worn out by the long trek, they would have to go into immediate action against an enemy well prepared and supported by field artillery.&quot; - [[Lawrence Freedman]], ''Signals of War, The Falklands Conflict of 1982'', 1990, Faber and Faber-London, ISBN 0-571-14116-1&lt;/ref&gt;  in three days carrying {{convert|80|lb|kg}}&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Land Combat'', 1987, editor Bernard Fitzsimons, Salamander Books Ltd., ISBN 1-85501-165-4&lt;/ref&gt; loads.

Media coverage of this war saw the term ''yomp'' become well known and in general use. A computer game called ''[[Yomp (video game)|Yomp]]'' was produced by Virgin Games shortly after the Falklands conflict. However, the term has since faded somewhat from general use in the decades since the end of the Falklands war.

It has been suggested that the term ''YOMP'' is an acronym (or [[backronym]]) for ''Your Own Marching Pace'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Your+Own+Marching+Pace+(England's+Royal+Marines+slang) &quot;Yomp&quot; at The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The image of &quot;the Yomper&quot; became one of the iconic images of the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref&gt;

After landing with 40 Commando at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]], Holdgate accompanied British forces across the Falklands War zone taking hundreds of photographs.

==In the French Foreign Legion==
To complete training, legionnaires trainees must complete the &quot;Combatant's Course&quot; of 8 km loaded with 15 kg, and a night march of 25 km in 3 hours with a load of 18 kg. Various marches of much longer distance are also a part of training.
