'''Dr. Sean Kenniff''' (born November 27, 1969) is an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] who appeared on the first season of the television show ''Survivor'' (later called ''[[Survivor: Borneo]]''), filmed and broadcast in 2000.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448513/|title= Sean Kenniff|publisher= IMDb|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenniff was born in [[Massapequa, New York]]; his father was a [[firefighter]]. He graduated from [[Massapequa High School]] and received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in biology at [[Binghamton University]] in 1991. He received an M.D. at [[New York Medical College]] in 1995, and did a three year residency followed by a year as Chief Resident in [[neurology]] at [[Long Island Jewish Medical Center]], which is affiliated with [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]].

He was the twelfth of sixteen contestants to be eliminated and was dubbed &quot;The Alphabet Killer&quot; for his famous &quot;Alphabet Voting&quot; strategy, in which he cast his votes based on the order of contestants' names in the alphabet.&lt;ref name=reality&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?article=article3691.art&amp;page=2|title= The Doctor Is Still In: An Interview with Sean Kenniff of the Original Survivor|last1= Schuman|first1= Andrea|work= Reality News Online |publisher= Reality News Online|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that he chose the system as a way to vote off members of the opposing Pagong tribe, (whose names were all earlier alphabetically than his own tribe) while appearing to do so in a non-deliberate manner.

He has said that he wants to be a writer; after appearing on ''Survivor'' he has made acting appearances on ''[[The Guiding Light]]'' and has appeared as a medical [[correspondent]] on various [[news]] programs. He currently was on the news staff of the television station [[WFOR-TV]], a [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Miami, Florida]]. He was also a CBS Healthwatch Network Medical Correspondent from 2004-2008. He had a weekly 1-minute segment on CBS radio until 2008. In 2000 Dr. Kenniff was a [[radio syndication|syndicated]] radio columnist for [[Winstar]] Radio (his &quot;Survivor Minute&quot; is heard on 200 stations worldwide), and he contributed a weekly health column to the [[Miami Herald]] for several years.

Kenniff established a health news website in 2008, healthapalooza.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthapalooza.com |title=Health News You Can Use |publisher=Healthapalooza |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenniff began the Dr. Sean Show in 2009, a weekly Saturday medical call-in show on WFTL 850 AM Radio in South Florida.

In May 2010, Kenniff's novel, ''[[Etre the Cow]]'', was published, and has received some positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etrethecow.com |title=ETRE the COW |publisher=ETRE the COW |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
