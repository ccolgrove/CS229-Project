[[Image:Abu-ghraib-leash.jpg|thumb|[[Lynndie England]] holding a leash attached to a prisoner, known to the guards as &quot;Gus&quot;, who is lying on the floor]]
[[File:AbuGhraibAbuse-standing-on-box.jpg|thumb|This image of a prisoner being tortured has become famous internationally, eventually making it onto the cover of ''[[The Economist]]'' (see &quot;[[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse#Media|Media]]&quot; below).]]
Revealed in the [[Taguba Report]], an initial criminal investigation by the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command]] had already been underway, where soldiers of the 320th Military Police Battalion had been charged under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] with [[prisoner abuse]]. In 2004, articles describing the abuse, including pictures showing military personnel appearing to abuse prisoners, came to public attention, when a ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' news report (April 28) and an article by [[Seymour M. Hersh]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine (posted online on April 30 and published days later in the May 10 issue) reported the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040510fa_fact Annals of National Security: Torture at Abu Ghraib: The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense]] removed seventeen soldiers and officers from duty, and eleven soldiers were charged with [[dereliction of duty]], [[physical abuse|maltreatment]], [[aggravated assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. Between May 2004 and March 2006, eleven soldiers were convicted in [[courts martial]], sentenced to military prison, and [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]] from service. Two soldiers, Specialist [[Charles Graner]], and his former fiancÃ©e, Specialist [[Lynndie England]], were sentenced to ten years and three years in prison, respectively, in trials ending on January 14, 2005 and September 26, 2005. The commanding officer of all Iraq detention facilities, [[Brigadier General]] [[Janis Karpinski]], was reprimanded for dereliction of duty and then demoted to the rank of [[Colonel]] on May 5, 2005.  Col. Karpinski has denied knowledge of the abuses, claiming that the interrogations were authorized by her superiors and performed by subcontractors, and that she was not even allowed entry into the [[interrogation]] rooms.

The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib was in part the reason that on April 12, 2006, the [[United States Army]] activated the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion, the first of four joint interrogation battalions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2006/20060417_4843.html Army Activates First Interrogation Battalion], an April 2006 [[press release]] from the [[American Forces Press Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Manadel al-Jamadi===
{{Main|Manadel al-Jamadi}}

The prisoner Manadel al-Jamadi died in Abu Ghraib prison after being interrogated and tortured by a CIA officer and a private contractor. The torture included physical violence and [[strappado]] hanging, whereby the victim is hung from the wrists with the hands tied behind the back. His death has been labeled a [[homicide]] by the US military,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6988054/ &quot;Reports detail Abu Ghraib prison death; was it torture?&quot;], MSNBC&lt;/ref&gt; but neither of the two men who caused his death have been charged.

==Media coverage==
[[US media]] initially showed little interest when the US military first reported abuse.  On January 16, 2004, [[United States Central Command]] informed the media that an official investigation had begun involving abuse and [[humiliation]] of Iraqi detainees by a group of US soldiers.  On February 24, it was reported that 17 soldiers had been suspended.  The military announced again, on March 21, 2004, that the first charges had been filed against six soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP2004May8Getler&quot;&gt;[[Michael Getler|Getler, Michael]], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A11271-2004May8 The Images Are Getting Darker], ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20040321Shanker&quot;&gt;[[Thom Shanker|Shanker, Tom]], [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/international/middleeast/21IRAQ.html 6 G.I.'s in Iraq Are Charged With Mistreating Prisoners], ''The New York Times'', March 21, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until late April 2004 that [[United States|U.S.]] television news-magazine ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' broadcast a story on the abuse. The story included photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;main614063.shtml&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/27/60II/main614063.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Abuse Of Iraqi POWs By GIs Probed | date=April 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news segment had been delayed by two weeks at the request of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Gen. [[Richard Myers]]. In the CBS report, [[Dan Rather]] interviewed then-deputy director of Coalition operations in Iraq Brig. Gen [[Mark Kimmitt]] who said:

{{Quote|The first thing Iâd say is weâre appalled as well. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day, and they represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down [...] Our soldiers could be taken prisoner as well. And we expect our soldiers to be treated well by the adversary, by the enemy. And if we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect [...] We can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers as well. [...] So what would I tell the people of Iraq? This is wrong. This is reprehensible. But this is not representative of the 150,000 soldiers that are over here [...] I'd say the same thing to the American people ... Don't judge your army based on the actions of a few.|Gen [[Mark Kimmitt]]|''&lt;ref name=&quot;main614063.shtml&quot; /&gt;''}}

At the same time, Kimmitt said: &quot;I'd like to sit here and say that these are the only prisoner abuse cases that we're aware of, but we know that there have been some other ones since we've been here in Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;main614063.shtml&quot;/&gt;

Former Marine Lt. Col. Bill Cowan was also interviewed, stating: &quot;We went into Iraq to stop things like this from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage.&quot;

Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sgt. Chip Frederick, a participant in the abuse, whose civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. Frederick stated, &quot;We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations&quot;, says Frederick. &quot;And it just wasn't happening.&quot; Frederick's video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story.

[[Image:Abu Ghraib prison abuse.jpg|thumb|Sgt. [[Ivan Frederick]] sitting on an Iraqi detainee between two stretchers]]
In the diary are listed detailed, dated entries that chronicle abuse and names, for example,

{{Quote|They stressed him out so bad that the man died. The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake I.V. in his arm [to suggest he died under medical care] and took him away. This [[OGA]] (other governmental agency) [prisoner] was never processed and therefore never had a number.|[[Ivan Frederick]]}}

and, &quot;MI (Military Intelligence) has been present and witnessed such activity. MI has encouraged and told us great job [and] that they were now getting positive results and information.&quot; The CBS report did not explain who had taken the photographs showed to viewers, nor was it explained how CBS had come by them. They were not released to CBS by the specialists interviewed, nor was any member of the US armed forces charged with supplying these photographs to the media.

===Hersh ''New Yorker'' article===
A May 2004 article by [[Seymour M. Hersh]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine explored the abuses in detail, and used as its source a copy of the Taguba report.

''The New Yorker'', under the direction of editor [[David Remnick]], posted a report on its website by Hersh, along with a number of graphic and disturbing images of the torture taken by U.S. military prison guards with digital cameras. The article, entitled &quot;Torture at Abu Ghraib&quot;, was followed in the next two weeks by two more articles on the same subject, &quot;Chain of Command&quot; and &quot;The Gray Zone&quot;, also by Mr. Hersh.&lt;ref name=&quot;zmag itemID 7926&quot;&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=7926 ZNet |Iraq | Abu Ghraib&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only after [[CBS]] learned that ''The New Yorker'' planned to publish the pictures in its next issue that they went ahead with their report on April 28.&lt;ref name=&quot;zmag itemID 7926&quot;/&gt;

[[Seymour Hersh]]'s undercover sources claimed that an [[interrogation]] program called &quot;[[Copper Green]]&quot; was an official and systemic misuse of coercive methods which, although deemed &quot;successful&quot; during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], would be heavily criticized in intelligence circles as an improper application to the context of fighting citizen-&quot;[[insurgency|insurgents]]&quot; in Iraq. This theory, and the existence of &quot;Copper Green&quot; itself, has been denied by [[The Pentagon]].

Hersh has a history of exposing war crimes.  His investigative journalism is largely credited with bringing the American public's attention to the 1968 My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bilton, Sim|first=Michael, Kevin|title=Four Hours In My Lai|year=1992|publisher=Penguin Books USA|location=New York|isbn=0-670-84296-6|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More evidence of torture===
According to [[Donald Rumsfeld]], many more pictures and videotapes of the abuse at Abu Ghraib exist.  Photos and videos were revealed by the Pentagon to lawmakers in a private viewing on 12 May 2004.  Lawmakers disagreed over whether the additional photos were worse than those already released, with Senator [[Ron Wyden]] saying the new pictures were &quot;significantly worse than anything that I had anticipated [...] Take the worst case and multiply it several times over.&quot; while Congresswoman [[Ellen Tauscher]] said the pictures were &quot;not dramatically different&quot;.  It was speculated that they depict dogs snarling at cowering prisoners, women forced to expose their breasts, hooded prisoners being forced to masturbate, and violent sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 13, 2004|title=1,800 new pictures add to US disgust|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1215645,00.html | location=London | first1=Dan | last1=Glaister | first2=Julian | last2=Borger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Department of Defense official said that most of the additional photos were pornography involving only US soldiers, and that most did not show abuse of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 8, 2004|title=Rumsfeld Accepts Blame and Offers Apology in Abuse|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/08/politics/08ABUS.html | first1=Thom | last1=Shanker | first2=Eric | last2=Schmitt}}{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AG-8.jpg|thumb|United States soldier Spc. Graner appears to be punching, or pretending to punch, handcuffed Iraqi prisoners]]

''[[The New York Times]]'', in a report on January 12, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kate Zernike | title=Detainees Depict Abuses by Guard in Prison in Iraq|publisher=New York Times|date=12 January 2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/international/12abuse.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported testimony suggesting that the following events had taken place at Abu Ghraib:
*Urinating on detainees
*Jumping on detainee's leg (a limb already wounded by gunfire) with such force that it could not thereafter heal properly
*Continuing by pounding detainee's wounded leg with collapsible metal baton
*Pouring phosphoric acid on detainees
*Sodomization of detainees with a baton
*Tying ropes to the detainees' legs or penises and dragging them across the floor.

In her video diary, a prison guard said that prisoners were shot for minor misbehavior, and claimed to have had venomous [[snake]]s bite prisoners, sometimes resulting in their deaths. By her own admission, that guard was &quot;in trouble&quot; for having thrown rocks at the detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=542742004|work=[[The Scotsman]] | location=Edinburgh | first=Gethin|last=Chamberlain|title=Chilling new evidence of the brutal regime at Iraqi prison|date=May 13, 2004}}{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashem Muhsen, one of the naked men in the human pyramid photo, said they were also made to crawl around the floor naked and that U.S. soldiers rode them like [[donkey]]s.

It was discovered that one prisoner, [[Manadel al-Jamadi]], died as a result of abuse, a death that was ruled a homicide by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exposure: the woman behind the camera at Abu Ghraib |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/24/080324fa_fact_gourevitch |pages=10â12 |work=New Yorker: Annals of War |first=Philip |last=Gourevitch |authorlink=Philip Gourevitch |coauthors=Errol Morris |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2008-03-16 |quote=[We] kind of realized right away that there was no way he died of a heart attack [...] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One detainee claimed he was sodomized. The [[Taguba Report]] found the claim (&quot;Sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broom stick&quot;) to be credible.&lt;ref name=TagubaReportRegarding&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/iraq/tagubarpt.html#ThR1.9 Taguba Report: &quot;Iraq Prisoner Abuse Investigation of the U.S. 800th Military Police Brigade&quot;].

In an appearance on May 2 during a ''[[Face the Nation]]'' interview, Chairman Myers said that he had not yet seen the [[Antonio Taguba|Taguba]] report, although the report was then nearly a month old.

In the documentary film ''[[Ghosts of Abu Ghraib]]'' (2007), former [[US Justice Department]] counsel [[John Yoo]] said that although he does not think the [[Geneva Conventions]] covered the prisoners at Abu Ghraib, he believes the soldiers and their commanding officers felt the interrogation techniques used fell within the Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.netscape.com/2007/01/24/rumsfeld-made-me-do-it-ghosts-of-abu-ghraib/ &quot;Rumsfeld Made Me Do It: Ghosts of Abu Ghraib&quot;], Netscape News, January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
=== Iraqi response ===
''[[AsiaNews|AsiaNews.it]]'' reported that Yahia Said, an Iraqi fellow at the [[London School of Economics]], said:

{{Quote|[T]he reception [of abuse news from Abu Ghraib] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumours and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people have been talking about here the pictures are quite benign. Thereâs nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that thereâs some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point.|Yahia Said|&lt;ref name=iraqreaction1&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=791 &quot;Listening to the Iraqi people&quot;], AsiaNews.it, May 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[CNN]] reporter [[Ben Wedeman]] reported that Iraqi reaction to President Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was &quot;mixed&quot;. Specifically, he said:

{{Quote|Some people react[ed] positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they &amp;ndash; many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from &amp;ndash; it's called &quot;Dar-es-Salaam.&quot; That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture of &amp;ndash; yes, the torture of Iraqi prisoners.|Ben Wedeman|&lt;ref name=cnnreaction&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0405/06/lad.04.html ''Live At Daybreak''], transcript, [[CNN]].com, May 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Response of US government officials===
[[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W. Bush]] claimed the acts were in no way indicative of normal or acceptable practices in the [[United States Army]].

Vice-president [[Dick Cheney]]'s office played a central role in eliminating limits on coercion in US custody, commissioning and defending legal opinions that the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] later portrayed as the initiatives of lower-ranking officials.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, June 25, 2007, http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/pushing_the_enevelope_on_presi/&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Geneva Convention]], which has been ratified by the US and is therefore the law of the land, is explicit and categorical in banning [[torture]], the use of &quot;violence,&quot; &quot;cruel treatment&quot; or &quot;humiliating and degrading treatment&quot; against a detainee &quot;at any time and in any place whatsoever.&quot; The [[War Crimes Act of 1996]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002441----000-.html US CODE: Title 18,2441. War crimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; made any grave breach of those restrictions a U.S. felony.

On May 7, 2004, [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] made the following statements before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]:

On May 26, 2004, [[Al Gore]] gave a sharply critical speech on the Iraq crisis and the [[George W. Bush administration]]. In the speech, Gore called for the resignations of [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], Director of [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[George Tenet]], Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Paul Wolfowitz]], Under Secretary of Defense for Policy [[Douglas J.

Gore also called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan &quot;incompetent&quot; and called [[George W. Bush]] the most dishonest president since [[Richard Nixon]]. Gore commented; &quot;In Iraq, what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples.

From a discussion with [[Jim Lehrer]] of [[PBS]], [[Shibley Telhami]], author of ''The Stakes'' about Arab and Muslim perceptions of U.S. policy toward the Middle East, and [[Fouad Ajami]], director of Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies:

Some of the people angry at Abu Ghraib never uttered a word, never uttered a word in Cairo or Nablus or Amman about anything that Saddam did to the people of Iraq, to the Shia, to the Kurds. They have nothing to say about the massacres and the horrors in the southern Sudan that are committed by the Arab Muslims towards the Christians. It's selective rage. It's really selective rage. They were waiting for us. We simply played into their hands with this episode.

JIM LEHRER: Selective rage, professor?

SHIBLEY TELHAMI: No question that it is. Obviously it is going to be used by militants as a useful tool. But the reality of it is, you know, it is rage &amp;ndash; even if it's selective. The difference is this. Look, we are explaining the war in Iraq on the basis of bringing about democracy and human rights. That has become our primary explanation for what we're doing. So there's a huge difference in explaining what we're doing in those terms and then what we're doing in fact on the ground. That's the problem.

I think when you see these pictures, it reinforces the assumption that people had that this has always been a ... an occupation of an Arab land for different strategic purposes. It's not just the content of the sexual symbols that are in there. So I think there's a difference between, you know, when we are doing it and when Mubarak is doing it.|[[Fouad Ajami]], [[Jim Lehrer]], [[Shibley Telhami]]|&lt;ref name=pbsquotes&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june04/prisoners_5-5.html &quot;Arab Views discussion&quot;], NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, transcript, PBS, May 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From a legal declaration by Ronald Schlicher of the [[US State Department]]:
&quot;The Bahraini English-language ''Daily Tribune'' wrote on May 5, 2004, 'The blood-boiling pictures will make more people inside and outside Iraq determined to carry out attacks against the Americans and British.' The Qatari Arabic-language ''Al-Watan'' predicted on May 3, 2004 that because of the images, 'The Iraqis now feel very angry and that will cause revenge to restore the humiliated dignity.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aclu.org/Files/OpenFile.cfm?id=18838&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2004, [[swastika]]-covered posters of Abu Ghraib abuse photographs were attached to British and Indian graves at the Commonwealth military cemetery in [[Gaza|Gaza City]]. Thirty-two graves of soldiers killed in [[World War I]] were desecrated or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=425770&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContras's%20ID=5&amp;sbSubContras's%20ID=0&amp;listSrc=Y Palestinians destroy graves in Gaza Commonwealth cemetery], ''Associated Press'', May 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008 [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]], the former UK [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]], describing the treatment of Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib, said: &quot;Particularly disturbing to proponents of the rule of law is the cynical lack of concern for international legality among some top officials in the Bush administration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/18/iraq-us-foreign-policy Top judge: US and UK acted as 'vigilantes' in Iraq invasion], ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the release of [[Israel Defense Forces]] photos with [[Palestinian prisoners]], some dead, has brought the treatment and abuse at Abu Ghraib back into the media discussion.  The entrance of new media into such investigations has grown, as pictures are increasingly posted on Facebook and YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2010/aug/17/israel-palestinian-territories#/?picture=365845330&amp;index=1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Israeli soldiers' 'trophy' pictures | date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2002, nine interrogation techniques not approved by military doctrine or included in Army field manuals were added after Chris Mackey and his team turned over the detention unit in Bagram to the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion. Chris Mackey had trained with Wood before she got her command at Bagram. He says that while he was &quot;gravely disappointed&quot; when he found out about her changes to the interrogation rules, he understands what might have been going on. &quot;After she took over, the stakes got very high,&quot; he says. &quot;We went from losing three or four soldiers a month to scores of them.

Interrogators in Iraq, already familiar with the practice of some of these new ideas, implemented them even prior to any policy guidance from CJTF-7. (Combined Joint Task Force Seven headed by LTG Ricardo S. Sanchez) These practices were accepted as SOP by newly arrived interrogators.

COL Pappas's boss, MG Barbara Fast was subsequently appointed as Chief of the US Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca. Pappas and Karpinski were relieved of command but Wojdakowski and Fast became the Chiefs of their respective branches. The senior lawyer for LTG Sanchez and his legal representative on the Detainee Release Boards along with BN Karpinski and MG Fast, COL Marc Warren has since been selected for promotion to Brigadier General.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==US government policy on interrogations and torture==
[[Image:AbuGhraibScandalGraner55.jpg|thumb|upright|Specialist [[Charles Graner]] poses over [[Manadel al-Jamadi]]'s corpse.]]
Reaction from the Bush administration characterized the Abu Ghraib torture scandal as an isolated incident uncharacteristic of US actions in Iraq; this view is widely disputed, notably in Arab countries, but also by organizations such as the [[International Red Cross]], which had been making representations about abuse of prisoners for more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/icrc-report.htm|title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation|publisher=ICRC|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[military intelligence]] officer with experience at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib alleges (see [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse#External links|external link]] â &quot;Cooks and drivers ...&quot;) a systematic failure caused by a combination of inexperienced troops arresting innocent Iraqis, who are then interrogated by inexperienced interrogators determined to break these apparent hard cases. The US military's interrogation techniques and treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib are consistent with its treatment of noncombatants in past conflicts, including the [[Phoenix Program]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and its training of military personnel of US allies at the [[School of the Americas]].

===International law===
The [[United States]] has ratified the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention Against Torture]] and the [[Third Geneva Convention|Third]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]s.  The [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] took the position that, in the words of [[Alberto R. Gonzales]], counsel to the President: &quot;Both the United States and Iraq are parties to the Geneva Conventions. The United States recognizes that these treaties are binding in the war for the 'liberation of Iraq'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Rule of Law and the Rules of War&quot;, ''New York Times'' (op-ed piece), May 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Al-Qaeda detainees would likely not be accorded POW status, but the Conventions still provide explicit protections to all persons held in an international armed conflict, even if they are not entitled to POW status. Such protections include the right to be free from coercive interrogation, to receive a fair trial if charged with a criminal offense, and, in the case of detained civilians, to be able to appeal periodically the security rationale for continued detention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/3 &quot;The Road to Abu Ghraib&quot;, Human Rights Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Convention Against Torture defines [[torture]] in the following terms:

{{Quote|Any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him ... information or a confession, punishing him for an act he ... has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him.|[[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]|(Article 1)}}

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] concluded in its confidential February 2004 report to the Coalition Forces that its investigations had documented &quot;serious violations of International Humanitarian Law relating to the conditions of treatment of the persons deprived of their liberty held by the CF in Iraq. In particular, it establishes that persons deprived of their liberty face the risk of being subjected to a process of physical and psychological coercion, in some cases tantamount to torture, in the early stages of the internment process.&quot; The main violations which were described in the ICRC report included:
:*Brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury.
:*Absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families.
:*Physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information.
:*Prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight.
:*Excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/icrc-report.htm|title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation (section 3.1)|publisher=ICRC|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some legal experts have said that the United States could be obligated to try some of its soldiers for [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nauinfo.blogspot.com/2009/01/un-try-bush-now-for-war-crimes-and.html|title=UN: Try Bush NOW for War Crimes and Torture!date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a &quot;grave breach&quot;. In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army's provost marshal, Maj. Gen. Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Also, legal analysts point to the fact that [[Alberto Gonzales]] and others argued that detainees should be considered &quot;[[unlawful combatant]]s&quot; and as such not protected by the [[Geneva Conventions]] in multiple memoranda, known today as the &quot;torture memos,&quot; regarding these perceived legal gray areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/02/23/yoo/index_np.html Parsing pain] By Walter Shapiro, Salon&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales' observed at the time that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions &quot;substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the [[War Crimes Act of 1996|War Crimes Act]]&quot; suggesting, at the least, an awareness by those involved in crafting policies in this area that US officials are involved in acts that could be seen to be [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050718&amp;s=holtzman Torture and Accountability by Elizabeth Holtzman] article in [[The Nation]] posted June 28, 2005 (July 18, 2005 issue) about The Geneva Convention&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/30/1333214 Former NY Congress member Holtzman Calls For President Bush and His Senior Staff To Be Held Accountable for Abu Ghraib Torture] Thursday, June 30, 2005 on Democracy Now&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4999734/ Memos Reveal War Crimes Warnings] By Michael Isikoff Newsweek May 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/law/2003/0128uslawyers.htm US Lawyers Warn Bush on War Crimes] [http://www.globalpolicy.org/  Global Policy Forum] January 28, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Supreme Court]] challenged the practice of ignoring the Geneva Conventions in [[Hamdan v.

Some of the accused soldiers' families or attorneys have already made clear an intention to argue that the practices at Abu Ghraib were directed by higher-ranking military officers or by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Under the [[Nuremberg Principles|Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal]], this &quot;[[Nuremberg Defense|defense of superior orders]]&quot; is not a defense for war crimes, although it might influence a sentencing authority to lessen the penalty. Under U.S. law, the [[War Crimes Act of 1996]] makes it a federal crime to violate certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions. The Act punishes any American, military or civilian, who commits a &quot;grave breach&quot; of the Geneva Conventions. A grave breach, as defined by the [[Geneva Conventions]], includes the deliberate &quot;killing, torture or inhuman treatment&quot; of detainees.

===Executive Order===
On December 21, 2004, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] released copies of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] internal memos they had obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] concerning alleged torture and abuse at Guantanamo Bay, in [[Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq]]. One memo dated May 22, 2004 was from someone whose name was blanked out but was described in the memo as &quot;On Scene Commander &amp;ndash; Baghdad&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.4940_4941.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He referred explicitly to an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] that sanctioned the use of extraordinary interrogation tactics by U.S. military personnel. The methods explicitly mentioned as being sanctioned are sleep deprivation, [[hooding]] prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees' clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called &quot;stress positions&quot;, and the use of dogs. The author also claimed that [[the Pentagon]] had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the chain of command. The author identifies &quot;physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching&quot; as being outside the Executive Order. This was the first internal evidence since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse affair became public in April 2004 that forms of coercion of captives had been mandated by the [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/19913leg20050712.html American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Interested Persons Memo on FBI documents concerning detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details===

Death certificates repeatedly stated that prisoners had died &quot;during sleep&quot;, and of &quot;natural reasons&quot;. Iraqi doctors were not allowed to investigate even when death certificates were obviously forged. No reports of investigations against U.S. military doctors who forged death certificates have been reported.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

On May 7, 2004, [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] Operations Director [[Pierre KrÃ¤henbÃ¼hl]] stated that the ICRC's inspection visits to Coalition detention centers in Iraq did &quot;not allow us to conclude that what we were dealing with ... were isolated acts of individual members of coalition forces. What we have described is a pattern and a broad system.&quot; He went on to say that some of the incidents they had observed were &quot;tantamount to torture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/040507/325/et2ck.html Darling clashes with rivals in TV debate] {{Dead link|date=June 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3694521.stm | title=Red Cross saw 'widespread abuse' | date=May 8, 2004 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. and UK armed forces are jointly trained in so-called ''[[R2I|resistance to interrogation]] (R2I)'' techniques. These R2I techniques are taught ostensibly to help soldiers cope with or resist torture by the enemy. On May 8, 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that, according to a former British special forces officer, the acts committed by the [[Abu Ghraib Prison]] military personnel resemble the techniques used in R2I training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1212199,00.html | location=London | title=UK forces taught torture methods | date=May 8, 2004 | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Leigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also related are [[pride-and-ego down]] techniques to make captives more willing to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=37858 WorldNetDaily: U.S. losing 'hearts, minds,' despite sensitivity training&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The same report states that:

{{Quote|The U.S. commander in charge of military jails in Iraq, Major General [[Geoffrey Miller (general)|Geoffrey Miller]], has confirmed that a battery of 50-odd special &quot;coercive techniques&quot; can be used against enemy detainees. The general, who previously ran the [[Camp X-ray|prison camp]] at Guantanamo Bay, said his main role was to extract as much intelligence as possible.|''[[The Guardian]]''}}

Most accept the particular acts committed at the prison leading to the initial broadcast report were unauthorized, but as has been shown, they were not isolated incidents. These or similar incidents of torture and humiliation were routine, systemic and widespread, had been occurring for over a year, and some of them were official policy.

[[Alfred W. McCoy]] history professor and author of a book on torture in the Philippine armed forces, has noted similarities in the abusive treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and the techniques described in the CIA's 1963 &quot;[[KUBARK]] Counterintelligence Interrogation&quot; manual and asserts that what he calls &quot;the CIA's no-touch torture methods&quot; have been in continuous use by the CIA and U.S. military intelligence since that time.

A May 25, 2004 article by Hersh in ''The New Yorker'' suggests a connection between the Abu Ghraib incidents and a chain of decisions and events set into play by high administration officials following the 9/11 attacks, specifically to a &quot;special access&quot; or &quot;black ops&quot; program known as [[Copper Green]]. According to Hersh, officials concerned with extracting intelligence information from terrorists stretched the bounds of interrogation to or beyond the extreme legal limits. Subsequently, methods which were originally intended to be used only on high value Taliban and Al-Qaeda &quot;enemy combatants&quot; came to be improperly used on Iraqi prisoners. The Department of Defense immediately characterized Hersh's report as &quot;outlandish, conspiratorial, and filled with error and anonymous conjecture&quot;.

=== Ricardo Sanchez ===
Documents obtained by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the [[ACLU]] show that the senior U.S. military officer in Iraq Lt. Gen. [[Ricardo Sanchez]] authorized the use of military dogs, temperature extremes, reversed sleep patterns and sensory deprivation as interrogation methods in Abu Ghraib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35612-2004Jun11.html | title=General Granted Latitude At Prison | date=June 12, 2004 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also a November 2004 report by Brig Gen Richard Formica found that many troops at the Abu Ghraib prison were only following orders based on a memo from Lt. Gen. [[Ricardo Sanchez]], and that &quot;[she] didn't find cruel and malicious criminals that are out there looking for detainees to abuse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrong advice blamed for US abuse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5090372.stm |work=BBC NEWS AMERICAS |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-06-17 |accessdate=2007-02-03 |language=eng |quote=&quot;[...] most defendants say they were following orders.&quot; | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Gen Sanchez authorised interrogation techniques that were in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions and the army's own standards&quot;, ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in the union's statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US memo shows Iraq jail methods |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4392519.stm |work=BBC NEWS AMERICAS |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2005-03-30 |accessdate=2007-02-03 |language=eng |quote=&quot;The top US general in Iraq authorised interrogation techniques including the use of dogs, stress positions and disorientation, a memo has shown.&quot; | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview for her hometown newspaper ''The Signal'', Gen. Karpinski claimed to have seen unreleased documents from Rumsfeld that authorized these tactics for Iraqi prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Leon Worden |url= http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/iraq/sg070204.htm | title= Karpinski: Rumsfeld OK'd Methods at Abu Ghraib | publisher= [[Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society]] | accessdate=2004-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sanchez and Rumsfeld have denied authorization.

==Ongoing news==
In September 2005, U.S. District Judge [[Alvin Hellerstein|Alvin K. Hellerstein]] ordered the release of new Abu Ghraib torture photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9530938/ Release of Abu Ghraib photos ordered - Conflict in Iraq - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), criticized the US military's practice of holding prisoners in Iraq in its own facilities such as Abu Ghraib prison. In an interview with [[Reuters]],&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Age'', 6 December 2005, http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/america-abusing-mandate-in-iraq/2005/12/05/1133631201911.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pace claimed that Abu Ghraib was not mandated by UN Resolution 1546, according to which the US government has claimed a legal mandate permitting its ongoing occupation of Iraq, including holding prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Pace said,

{{Quote|All except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison.

Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country.|John Pace}}

On March 29, 2006, the government agreed to drop all appeals and release the new set of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/3/28/201138.shtml ACLU: Iraq Prison Photos to Be Released&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegedly Rumsfeld-approved abuses ===
In November 2006, the former US Army Brigadier General [[Janis Karpinski]], in-charge of [[Abu Ghraib]] prison until early 2004, told Spain's ''[[El PaÃ­s (Madrid)|El PaÃ­s]]'' newspaper she had seen a letter apparently signed by [[Donald Rumsfeld]] which allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] during interrogation. &quot;The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques.&quot; He said that this was contrary to the [[Geneva Convention]] and quoted the same &quot;Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind&quot;. According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name and in the same handwriting in the margin was written: &quot;Make sure this is accomplished&quot;. There have been no comments from either [[the Pentagon]] or US Army spokespeople in Iraq on Karpinski's accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3879193a12,00.html &quot;Rumsfeld okayed Abu Ghraib abuses according to former US general&quot; â CBS News] {{Dead link|date=June 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2678756 &quot;Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former U.S. general&quot; â ABC News] {{Dead link|date=June 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25726413.htm â &quot;Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former US Army general&quot; Reuters News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previously unreleased photographs===

In February 2006, previously unreleased photos and videos were broadcast by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], an Australian television network, on its [[Dateline (Australian TV program)|Dateline]] programme. According to initial reports, the Bush administration is attempting to prevent release of the images in the US, arguing that their publication could provoke antagonism towards them. According to BBC World News, the photographs were probably taken around the same time as the previously released photographs, and include some of the same prisoners and convicted soldiers from the earlier images. These newly released photographs depict prisoners crawling on the floor naked, being forced to perform sexual acts, and being covered in feces. Some images also show homicide and corpses, some shot in the head and some with slit throats. BBC World News stated that one of the prisoners, who was reportedly mentally unstable, was considered by prison guards as a 'pet' for torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html# The photos America doesn't want seen - World â smh.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN expressed hope that the pictures would be investigated immediately but the Pentagon stated that the images &quot;have been previously investigated as part of the Abu Ghraib investigation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18166472-26619,00.html Anger at Abu Ghraib photos | NEWS.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Dead link|date=June 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of the newly released pictures can be seen on the ElMundo webpage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/albumes/2006/02/15/torturas_irak/index.html elmundo.es - FotografÃ­a - MÃ¡s pruebas del horror en Abu Ghraib&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; SBS claims not to have published the most shocking pictures due to the degree of their depravity, an example being the sodomy photo.

On March 15, 2006, [[Salon.com]] published the most extensive documentation of the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/introduction/index.html Abu Ghraib Files - Salon.com News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The source who gave the CID material to Salon magazine is familiar with the CID investigation.

The DVD containing the material includes a June 6, 2004, CID investigation report written by Special Agent Seigmund. That report includes the following summary of the material: &quot;A review of all the computer media submitted to this office revealed a total of 1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, 29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts, 20 images of a soldier with a Swastika drawn between his eyes, 37 images of Military Working dogs being used in abuse of detainees and 125 images of questionable acts.&quot;

On May 28, 2009, more alleged pictures were available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5320559/Barack-Obama-attempts-to-block-alleged-torture-photos.html| title=Barack Obama attempts to block alleged torture photos| accessdate=2009-06-01| publisher=Telegraph | location=London | first=Alex | last=Spillius | date=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 grand jury investigation===
In June 2011, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] announced it was opening a grand jury investigation into [[CIA]] torture which killed a prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnj.com/article/20110614/NEWS01/110614017/CIA-errors-falling-under-scrutiny-again &quot;CIA errors falling under scrutiny again&quot;], Daily News Journal.

==''Torture Central: E-mails from Abu Ghraib''==

On October 29, 2007, the memoir of a soldier stationed in Abu Ghraib, Iraq during 2005/2006 was published. ''[[Torture Central]]'' chronicled many events previously unreported in the news media, including torture that continued at Abu Ghraib over a year after the abuse photos were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturecentral.com| title=Torture Central| year=2007| accessdate=2007-11-11| publisher=iUniverse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
In 2009, an additional 21 color photographs surfaced, showing prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq being abused by their U.S. captors.
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) said, &quot;[T]he government had long argued that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was isolated and was an aberration. The new photos would show that the abuse was more widespread.&quot; President [[Barack Obama]] initially indicated he would not fight the release of the photographs, but &quot;reversed course in May and authorized an appeal to the high court.&quot; &quot;The Obama administration believe[d] giving the imminent grant of authority over the release of such pictures to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] would short-circuit a lawsuit filed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] under the Freedom of Information Act.&quot; On Oct 10, 2009 the US &quot;Congress [was] set to allow [[the Pentagon]] to keep new pictures ... from the public&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Congress could thwart bid to view abuse photos |author= Mark Sherman|newspaper= [[Associated Press]]|date= October 10, 2009|url= http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9B8FVF00&amp;show_article=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2010, David A. Larson, an elected official in California who has a relationship with government contract personnel, made disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) alleging that under the Bush Administration, prisoners detained at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, and undisclosed &quot;black sites&quot; were being used as involuntary research subjects for human biomedical experimentation, behavior modification research, and drug-testosterone delivery in a manner similar to past CIA [[Project MKULTRA]] activities investigated in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and Inuoye. The allegation supports information contained in a International Red Cross report relative to the expanded role of CIA medical personnel in torture and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electlarson.com/issues.htm On the Issues, David A. Larson, Candidate and Elected official]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An [[Associated Press]] article said {{quote|Despite Abu Ghraib- or perhaps because of reforms in its wake- prisoners have more recently said they receive far better treatment in American custody than in Iraqi jails.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Sameer | last=Yacoub | title=Changing of the guard at last U.S. run prison | url=| work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 8A | date=15 July 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 [[Amnesty International]] warned in a report titled ''New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq'' that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the US detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime, in which [[human rights]] abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the security forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say that &quot;Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. US authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by US forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation Abuse and torture rife in Iraqi prisons]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2010 nearly 400,000 secret [[US]] army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, [[the Guardian]] and several other [[international]] media organisations through the [[whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]]. Among others, the logs detail how US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, [[torture]], [[rape]] and even [[murder]] by [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] police and soldiers, whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished and that US troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks?utm_source=lalatube+blog&amp;utm_medium=facebook Iraq war logs: secret files show how US ignored torture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HP%2FPolitics+(Politics+on+The+Huffington+Post) WikiLeaks' Iraq War Logs: US Troops Abused Prisoners For Years After Abu Ghraib]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2011 the [[U.S. Supreme Court ]] declined to hear the appeal of lawsuits from a group of 250 Iraqis who wanted to sue the two contractors [[CACI International Inc.]] and [[Titan Corp.]] (now a subsidiary of [[L-3 Communications]]) over claims of abuse by interrogators and translators at the prison.  The suits had been dismissed by the lower courts on the grounds that the companies held a derivative sovereign immunity from suits based on their status as government contractors pursuant to a battle-field preemption doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/national/politico/article/SCOTUS-nixes-Iraqis-lawsuit-1441885.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/06/28/us-supreme-court-refuses-to-allow-abu-ghraib-torture-victims-to-sue-military-contractors/&lt;/ref&gt;
