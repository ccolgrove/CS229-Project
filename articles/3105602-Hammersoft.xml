'''RJTV 29''' (DZRJ-TV) is a UHF, free to air television channel, owned and operated by [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|Rajah Broadcasting Network, Inc.]] owned by [[Ramon Jacinto|Ramon &quot;RJ&quot; Jacinto]]. RJTV 29 broadcast in the greater [[Metro Manila]] area, and is on a âmust carry basisâ on cable service providers. This station studios are located at Ventures I Bldg., Makati Ave. cor. Gen. Luna St., [[Makati City]]. With transmitters at Brgy. San Roque Purok 19, San Lorenzo Ruiz St., [[Antipolo City]]. RJTV operates 24 hours a day.

==Background==
RJTV 29 began its test broadcast in April 1993, with station produced programming which was entertaining mix of music oriented shows, local news, talk show, and the very first local Home TV Shopping program.

In 1995, RJTV 29 went into niche programming and timeless television series, shopping and animation programs for children. At the time, the target market was kids during the day, and baby boomers at night. In 1997, due to the emergence of UHF competitors such as Studio 23 and BEAM Channel 31 (which is also affiliated by [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]] and formerly called as CTV-31), RJTV 29 went from traditional TV programming to specialized programs such as direct response companies and religious sectors. RJTV 29 recognized the advent of specialized television â niche markets that identify specific needs of certain sectors.

On January 1, 2008, as a result of a blocktime agreement of [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]] with various terrestrial networks, RJTV has started carrying shows from Solar's [[2nd Avenue]] channel although during some days of the week, it may pre-empt 2nd Avenue programming for its own programmes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&amp;story_id=102344 Solar joins ABC 5 And RJTV 29]&lt;/ref&gt;
