'''John Charles Waite''' (born 4 July 1952&lt;ref name=&quot;bdate&quot;&gt;Holly George-Warren, Patricia Romanowski, Jon Pareles (2001) ''The Rolling stone encyclopedia of rock &amp; roll'' p. 36. University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[English people|English]] [[rock music|rock]] [[singer]]  and [[musician]].  He was lead vocalist for [[The Babys]] and [[Bad English]]. As a solo artist, he scored several international hits, including 1984's &quot;[[Missing You (John Waite song)|Missing You]]&quot;, a top ten hit on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching #1 in the US.

==Biography==
Waite was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], England. He first came to attention as the lead singer and bassist of [[The Babys]], a British group which had moderate chart success, including two pop hits that both coincidentally peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;Isn't It Time&quot; (1977) and &quot;Everytime I Think Of You&quot; (1979),&lt;ref&gt;[http://allmusic.com/artist/the-babys-p3604/charts-awards/billboard-singles All Music Guide: The Babys: Billboard Singles]&lt;/ref&gt; and a solid following for their concert tours. Over the course of five years, the band produced five albums ending with the final album ''On the Edge'' in October 1980, after which the group broke up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnwaite.com/lifestory/thebabys2.htm Life Story of John Waite - The Babys]&lt;/ref&gt;

Waite subsequently launched his solo career with his 1982 debut album ''Ignition'', which produced the hit single &quot;Change&quot;. The Chrysalis 45 failed to chart on [[Billboard's Hot 100]] during its initial release but was a top track on [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] radio stations as well as a very popular music video on MTV as the 'new' cable channel celebrated its first full year of operation. The pulsating track was written by [[Holly Knight]] (The song was originally recorded in 1981 by Knight's band [[Spider (band)|Spider]])  and in 1985 was included on the Platinum selling ''[[Vision Quest]]'' [[soundtrack]]. (The single was reissued and this time it reached the Top 50 on the Hot 100.) &quot;Going To The Top&quot; was released as the original follow-up single to &quot;Change&quot;.

His next album, ''[[No Brakes]]'', resulted in international attention - and was a Top 10 Billboard album in the US - due to the smash hit &quot;[[Missing You (John Waite song)|Missing You]]&quot; which went to #1 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Bronson (1997) ''The Billboard book of number one hits'' p.594. University of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; It knocked Tina Turner's &quot;What's Love Got To Do With It?&quot; out of #1. For that very reason, Turner later recorded and released Waite's smash song herself. (Turner's single peaked at a disappointing #84 on Billboard's Hot 100 in 1996.) &quot;Missing You&quot; also hit #1 on Billboard's [[Album Rock Tracks]] as well as the Top 10 of Billboard's [[Adult Contemporary]] chart. ''[[No Brakes]]'' sold over a million and a half US copies yet has never been certified above the RIAA Gold standard (a record company must apply to the RIAA for such certification). Two more singles from ''No Brakes'' followed, including &quot;Tears&quot; which was a Top 10 hit on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] charts.

The next album ''Mask of Smiles'' followed in 1985 featuring the hit single &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot;. Another single, &quot;If Anybody Had a Heart&quot;, was released from the soundtrack of the 1986 film ''[[About Last Night...]]'', starring [[Demi Moore]]. In 1987, &quot;Rover's Return&quot; was released with the single &quot;These Times Are Hard For Lovers&quot;. Waite would have another soundtrack appearance in 1990 from ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' with &quot;Deal for Life&quot;, written by [[Martin Page]] and [[Bernie Taupin]].

In 1988, Waite joined former Babys bandmates [[Jonathan Cain]] and [[Ricky Phillips]] along with [[Neal Schon]] from Journey and drummer [[Deen Castronovo]], to form the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Bad English]]. In 1989, the Bad English ballad &quot;[[When I See You Smile]]&quot; (penned by [[Diane Warren]]) went to #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Hot 100 and earned a Gold-certified single. Its parent album reached Billboard's Top Five and sold nearly two million copies in the United States alone. Bad English released two albums before tensions amongst the members led to the band's dissolution by 1992.

Waite returned to solo work and since 1995 has produced five solo albums including his latest album ''Rough And Tumble''. He still tours, including in 2003 with [[Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band]], and as an opening act for [[Journey (band)|Journey]] in 2005.

In 2006, &quot;Missing You&quot; was released as a duet with [[Alison Krauss]] and reached the Top 40 on the Country Charts in the United States. Waite appeared with Krauss on the Tonight Show on February 5, 2007 to perform &quot;Missing You.&quot;

In 2008 he recorded as a guest vocal the track &quot;In God's Shadow&quot; from the [[Keith Reid]] Project's The Common Thread.

Waite appears as himself and performs two songs in the 2010 feature film, ''New Day'', from L'Oiseau Blanc Films.
In 2011  the title track from his tenth solo album &quot; Rough and Tumble &quot; went number one on Classic Rock radio.

==Personal life==
A longtime resident of [[New York City]], Waite currently resides in [[Santa Monica, California]]. He is currently divorced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roughedge.com/features/johnwaite.htm John Waite inverview]&lt;/ref&gt;
