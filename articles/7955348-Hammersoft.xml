The '''UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al'''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.direction.umontreal.ca/recteur/documents/rapport-annuel/rap_an2007en.pdf 2007 Annual Report] {{en}}. UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al Accessed October 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''UdeM''') is a [[Public_university#Canada|public]] [[francophone]] research university in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. It comprises thirteen faculties, more than sixty departments and two&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umontreal.ca/english/overview/overview.html General overview of UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al]&lt;/ref&gt; affiliated schools: the [[Ãcole Polytechnique de MontrÃ©al|Ãcole Polytechnique]] (School of Engineering) and [[HEC MontrÃ©al]] (School of Business). It offers more than 650 undergraduate programmes and graduate programmes, including 71 doctoral programmes.

The university has [[Quebec]]'s largest sponsored research income and the fourth largest in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchinfosource.com/2010-top50-sup.pdf - Canadaâs Top 50 Research Universities 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; allocating close to [[Canadian dollar|$]]447.2 million to research conducted in more than 150 research centres as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direction.umontreal.ca/recteur/documents/rapport-annuel/rap_an2007en.pdf 2007 Annual Report] {{en}}, &quot;Research Income by University&quot;, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; It is also part of the [[U15 (universities)|U15]] universities. More than 55,000 students are enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs, making it the second largest university in Canada in terms of student enrollment.&lt;ref name=stats /&gt;

==History==
===Early years===

As an institution, the university was first founded when the [[UniversitÃ© Laval]] in [[Quebec City]] founded a new branch in MontrÃ©al in 1878, which became known as the UniversitÃ© de Laval Ã  MontrÃ©al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initially went against the wishes of MontrÃ©al's [[prelate]], who advocated an independent university in his city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1878-a.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Certain parts of the institution's educational facilities, such as those of the [[SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec]], had already been established in MontrÃ©al as early as 1876.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008242 The Canadian Encyclopedia - University]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Holy See|Vatican]] granted the university some administrative autonomy in 1889, thus allowing it to choose its own professors and license its own diplomas. However it was not until May 8, 1919 that a papal charter from [[Pope Benedict XV]] granted full autonomy to the university.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003530 The Canadian Encyclopedia - UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al]&lt;/ref&gt;
It thus became an independent Catholic university and adopted UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al as its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1878-f.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laval composed by Wilfrid Beaudry was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. The music for piano was published in QuÃ©bec by J. Beaudry, circa 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Laval http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/c.php?id=16182129&amp;l=eng&amp;s=amicus&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its creation, less than a hundred students were admitted to the university's three faculties, which at that time were located in [[Vieux-MontrÃ©al|Old Montreal]]. These were the faculty of theology (located at the [[Grand sÃ©minaire de MontrÃ©al]]), the faculty of law (hosted by the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice]]) and the faculty of medicine (at the [[ChÃ¢teau Ramezay]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.umontreal.ca/english/overview/brief_history.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - English - Brief History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umontreal.ca/infogen/en_bref/historique.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - Information gÃ©nÃ©rale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graduate school|Graduate training]] based on German-inspired American models of specialized course work and completion of a research thesis was introduced and adopted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
Most of QuÃ©bec's [[secondary education]] establishments employed classic course methods of varying quality. This forced the university to open a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in 1887 to harmonize the education level of its students. Named the &quot;Faculty of Arts&quot;, this school would remain in use until 1972 and was the predecessor of QuÃ©bec's current [[CEGEP]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1878-a.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding by provincial charter===

Although a branch of [[Laval University]] was planned as Montreal's first French-language university, it was not until February 14, 1920, that the first provincial charter founding the university was passed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
The second provincial charter was passed in 1950.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 
The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s (following the [[Quiet Revolution]]) was a response to popular pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals as well as society.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;
The third provincial charter, which was passed in 1967, defined the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al as a public institution, dedicated to higher learning and research, in the administration of which students and teachers would have the right to participate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Campus relocation===
[[Image:Pavillon saintdenis.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Former campus on Rue Saint-Denis.]]
[[Image:UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A view of the present Roger Gaudry building, built in 1943 and designed by [[Ernest Cormier]], on Mont-Royal.]]
From 1876 to 1895, most university classes took place in the [[Grand sÃ©minaire de MontrÃ©al]]. From 1895 to 1942, it was housed in a building at the intersection of [[Rue Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and [[Rue Sainte-Catherine|Sainte-Catherine]] streets in Montreal's eastern downtown [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Quartier Latin]].

Unlike English language universities in MontrÃ©al, such as [[McGill University]], the university suffered a lack of funding for two major reasons: the relative poverty of the [[French Canadian]] population and the complications ensuing from its remote management from [[Quebec City]]. The downtown campus was hit by three different fires between 1919 and 1921, further complicating the university's already precarious finances and forcing it to spend much of its resources on repairing its own infrastructure.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-a.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1930, enough funds had been accumulated to start the construction of a new campus on the north west slope of [[Mount Royal]], adopting new plans designed by [[Ernest Cormier]]. However, the [[Great Depression|financial crisis of the 1930s]] virtually suspended all ongoing construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-d.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many speculated that the university would have to sell off its unfinished building projects in order to ensure its own survival. Not before 1939 did the [[Politics of QuÃ©bec|provincial government]] directly intervene by injecting public funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-f.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Campus construction subsequently resumed and the mountain campus was officially inaugurated on June 3, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1943-a.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The university's former downtown facilities would later serve Montreal's second francophone university, the [[UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al]] (UQAM).

===Nuclear research===

{{Main|MontrÃ©al Laboratory}}

In 1943, the university assisted the [[Western Allies]] by providing laboratory accommodations on its campus. Scientists there worked to develop a nuclear reactor, notably by conducting various [[heavy water]] experiments. The research was part of the larger [[Manhattan Project]], which aimed to develop the first [[atomic bomb]]. Scientists here managed to produce the first [[atomic battery]] to work outside of the [[United States]]. One of the participating [[Quebec|QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] scientists, Pierre Demers, also discovered a series of radioactive elements issued from [[Neptunium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1943-a.html#b UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and expansion===

[[Image:Exterior of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ãcole Polytechnique as it stands today.]]

Two distinct schools eventually became affiliated to the university. The first was the [[Ãcole Polytechnique de MontrÃ©al|Ãcole Polytechnique]], a school of engineering, which was founded in 1873 and became affiliated in 1887. The second was the [[HEC MontrÃ©al|Ãcole des Hautes Ãtudes Commerciales]], or HEC, which was founded in 1907 and became part of the university in 1915.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
The first francophone school of architecture in Canada opened in 1907 at the Ãcole Polytechnique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009565 The Canadian Encyclopedia - Architectural Education]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1920 and 1925, seven new faculties were added to the initial three: Philosophy, Literature, Sciences, Veterinary medicine, Dental surgery, Pharmacy and Social sciences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Notably, the Faculty of Social sciences was founded in 1920 by [[Ãdouard Montpetit]], the first [[LaÃ¯citÃ©|laic]] to lead a faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://125.umontreal.ca/histoire/1919-b.html UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - FÃªtes du 125&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; - 125 ans d'histoire (1878-2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thereafter fulfilled the role of secretary-general until 1950.

In 1965, the appointment of the university's first secular rector, [[Roger Gaudry]], paved the way for modernization. The university established the first adult education degree program offered by a [[French Canadian]] university in 1968.

An important event that marked the university's history was the [[Ãcole Polytechnique massacre]]. On December 6, 1989, a gunman armed with an automatic rifle entered the Ãcole Polytechnique building, killing 14 people, all of whom were women, before taking his own life.

Since 2002, the university has embarked on its largest construction projects since the late 1960s, with five new modern buildings planned for advanced research in pharmacology, engineering, aerospace, cancer studies and biotechnology.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al map2.png|thumb|left|200px|Mont-Royal campus.]]
[[File:Universite-de-Montreal-tower.jpg|thumb|Pavillon Roger-Gaudry.]]
The university's main campus is located on the northern slope of [[Mont-Royal]] in the [[Outremont (borough)|Outremont]] and [[CÃ´te-des-Neiges]] boroughs. Its landmark [[Pavilion (structure)|Pavilion]] [[Roger Gaudry|Roger-Gaudry]] , which was designed by the noted architect [[Ernest Cormier]], can be seen from around the campus and is known for its imposing tower. It is built mainly in the [[Art Deco]] style, with some elements of [[International style (architecture)|International style]].

The campus is served by the [[CÃ´te-des-Neiges (Montreal Metro)|CÃ´te-des-Neiges]], [[UniversitÃ©-de-MontrÃ©al (Montreal Metro)|UniversitÃ©-de-Montreal]], and [[Ãdouard-Montpetit (Montreal Metro)|Ãdouard-Montpetit]] [[Montreal Metro|metro]] stations.

Apart from its main Mont-Royal campus, the university also maintains four regional facilities in [[LanaudiÃ¨re]], [[Laval, QuÃ©bec|Laval]], [[Longueuil]], [[QuÃ©bec City|QuÃ©bec]] and [[Mauricie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campusregionaux.umontreal.ca/ UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - Bureau de l'enseignement rÃ©gional] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus in Laval, just north of MontrÃ©al, was opened in 2006. It is Laval's first university campus, and is located in the area near the [[Montmorency (Montreal Metro)|Montmorency]] metro station. In October 2009, the university announced an expansion to its Laval satellite campus with the commissioning of its six-storey CitÃ© du Savoir complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;CitÃ© du Savoir&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/quebec-canada/education/200910/14/01-911374-nouveau-campus-de-ludm-a-laval.php|title=Nouveau campus de l'UdM Ã  Laval|last=Croteau|first=Martin|date=October 14, 2009|work=La Presse|language=French|accessdate=2009-10-16|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to solve the problem of lack of space on its main campus, the university is also planning to open a new campus in [[Outremont (borough)|Outremont]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteoutremont.umontreal.ca/ UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al - Outremont facility project page] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Centre hospitalier de l'UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al]] (CHUM) and the [[Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine]] are the two teaching hospital networks of the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al's Faculty of Medicine, although the latter is also affiliated with other medical institutions such as the Institut universitaire de gÃ©riatrie de MontrÃ©al, Montreal Heart Institute, HÃ´pital SacrÃ©-Coeur and HÃ´pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont.

===Student life===

There are various student groups, clubs and associations on the university's campus, the largest of them being the [[FAÃCUM]], a federation of [[students' union]]s.

The campus offers various student-run newspapers, the largest being ''Quartier Libre'', a member of the [[Canadian University Press]] (CUP). The campus also has its own student-run radio station, [[CISM-FM]].

The UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al officially recognized one fraternity on the campus: [[Sigma ThÃªta Pi]] .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sae.umontreal.ca/groupes.htm UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al Student Group]&lt;/ref&gt;
