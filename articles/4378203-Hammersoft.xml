'''The High School''' is a [[co-educational]] school located in [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. The school was founded in 1870 in [[Harcourt Street]] before moving to its current location in Rathgar in 1971 and amalgamated with The Diocesan School for Girls in 1974, thereby becoming co-educational.

==Developments==


===Millennium Developments===

The High School began re-developing its campus with the &quot;Millennium Developments&quot; Projects, which were completed in the summer of 1998. The projects involved the creation of three new buildings. The first, the &quot;T Block&quot; contained four new classrooms. Two Home Economics Laboratories, a Foam working Room, and two Technical Graphics gyms. 
The second building combined a music centre, archive room, rugby/cricket pavilion, and meeting rooms. This replaced the old Music Centre behind the school stage, and the 30-year old rugby pavilion.

===Laboratories and ICT project===

In 2004/2005, a second computer room based on a thin-client network was created. Also in this school year plans were created to refurbish the 30-year old school laboratories to modern standards. Among the new features are key-operated gas pressure systems and eye-wash stations. In the summer of 2004/2005, two more laboratories were refurbished.

===Classroom Multimedia===

Beginning in 2005/2006, all of the school classrooms are to be fitted with digital video projectors, with the teachers in those classrooms being supplied with laptop computers for this purpose.
