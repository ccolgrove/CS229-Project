==Relocation to St. Louis==
Under the terms of the Rams' deal with Anaheim, they were to receive the rights to develop plots of land near the Stadium. When nothing came of these plans, and with attendance falling, Georgia Frontiere got permission to relocate the team. This permission was only granted after the building of the Arrowhead Pond (a multi-use sports arena for hockey and basketball) in close proximity to Anaheim Stadium. The Rams agreed to let the Pond be built within miles of Anaheim Stadium with an 'out clause' to pay the City of Anaheim an amount of money in millions to release them from the lease. After an aborted move to [[Baltimore]], the Rams moved from Los Angeles to St. Louis in late 1994, initially playing at [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] until the ([[TWA]]) Trans World Dome (now the [[Edward Jones Dome]]) was completed. The NFL owners originally rejected the moveâuntil Frontiere agreed to share some of the [[Personal seat license|permanent seat license]] revenue she was to receive from St. Louis. That same year the then-[[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] were threatening to relocate as wellâand did, back to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].
