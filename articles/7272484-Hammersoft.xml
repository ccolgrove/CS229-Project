'''Four-star rank''' is a term used to describe a very senior commander in many of the armed services holding a rank described by the [[Ranks and insignia of NATO|NATO OF-9 code]]. The term is also used by some armed forces which are not NATO members. Typically, four-star officers would hold the rank of [[admiral]], [[general]] or in the case of those air forces with a separate rank structure, [[air chief marshal]].

Four maple leaves appear with St. Edward's crown and crossed sabre and baton on epaulettes and shoulder boards. In Canada and when referring to Canadian officers, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;4-leaf&quot; rank, rather than &quot;four-star&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;!-- I doubt it! Supporting evidence please!!! --&gt;

This is the highest rank that is defined in the [[Canadian Forces]] under the current [[National Defence Act]] Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Canada - Department of Justice &quot;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/N-5/page-6.html#anchorsc:1/ Laws of Canada: National Defence Act, Schedule I]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, only one officer carries the rank of full Admiral/ General at any one time: The [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]. In exceptional circumstances, from time-to-time, the minister may authorize additional officers at that level, for instance, Canadian officers in the position of [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]] are usually former Chiefs of the Defence Staff seconded to NATO for that duty.

The [[Monarchy of Canada|Head of State]] holds the position of Commander-in-Chief of the [[Canadian Forces]], bearing no rank.&lt;ref&gt;Canada - Department of Justice &quot;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/2.html/ Constitution Act, 1867, Part III, Section 9, Executive Power.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], since they are not a member of the Canadian Forces, nor in the chain-of-command, also bears no rank.  [[Prince Philip]] holds the four-star rank of admiral in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in an honorary capacity.

Before unification in 1968, the rank of [[air chief marshal]] was the four-star equivalent for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].
