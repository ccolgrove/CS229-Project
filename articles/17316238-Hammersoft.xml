'''ABC Western Queensland ''' is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station based in [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]] broadcasting to the [[Regions of Queensland|Central West, South West and Gulf regions]] of [[Queensland]].  It covers a wide area stretching as far as the towns of [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]], [[Winton Queensland|Winton]] and [[Birdsville, Queensland|Birdsville]].

The station began broadcasting as '''4QL''' in 1947 on 690 AM, originally as a relay of the national program.  Studios were then built and local programs began in 1952.  ABC Western Queensland now broadcasts through the following main [[AM Broadcasting|AM]] transmitters along with a number of low power FM repeaters:

*'''4QL''' 540 AM
*'''4CH''' 603 AM

During the late 1980s the NERR (North East Regional Radio) satellite service was established.  This allowed 'black spots' to be filled in, supplementing the Longreach and Charleville transmitters. Program is fed via satellite to receivers in remote places like Birdsville or Karumba and then re-transmitted via a small FM transmitter to that town.
