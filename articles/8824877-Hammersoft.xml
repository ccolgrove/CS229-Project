[[Image:Joseph Brant 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Brant]], 1786]]

==Before 1800==
* According to all records from local historians, this district was inhabited by the [[Neutral Indians]] who called it '''ATTIWANDARONIA.''' &lt;ref name=SAGA&gt;{{cite book|title=Saga of a City|first=Milton |last=Watson|publisher=The Hamilton Spectator|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1616- Like most of the Americas south of the tree line, the original inhabitants of the Hamilton area were [[First Nations|Indians]]. The first European to visit what is now Hamilton was probably [[Ãtienne BrÃ»lÃ©]] in 1616. Lasalle also visited the area, a fact commemorated at a park in nearby Burlington.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAMBIO1-p143&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hamilton Biography (Vol I, 1791â1875)|first=Thomas Melville |last=Bailey|publisher=W.L. Griffin Ltd|page=143|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1650- The [[Iroquois]] Indians fought the [[Neutral Nation|Neutrals]] in a great battle on the foot of present day ''Emerald Street''. This area was the end of an old Indian trail that led to the Dundas Valley. The Iroquois landed from [[canoes]] and won the battle because they had obtained [[guns]] from the [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], and the Neutrals refused to trade with the whites. So many Neutrals were slain that the mound where they were buried could still be seen after 250 years (1900).&lt;ref name=SAGA/&gt;

* 1780- About the year that both [[Robert Land]] and [[Richard Beasley]] arrived.&lt;ref name=SAGA/&gt;

* 1784- About 10,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] are settled in what is now southern Ontario, chiefly in [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario|Niagara]], around the [[Bay of Quinte]], and along the [[St. Lawrence River]] between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Montreal]]. They are soon followed by many more Americans, some of them not so much ardent loyalists but attracted nonetheless by the availability of cheap, arable land. At the same time large numbers of Iroquois loyal to Britain arrive from the United States and are settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario. Kingston and Hamilton became important settlements as a result of the influx of Loyalists.&lt;ref name=LOYALISTS&gt;{{cite web| title =United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada| url=http://www.uelac.org/

* 1788- (1788â1793) The townships at the [[Head-of-the-Lake]] were surveyed and named. The area was first known as The Head-of-the-Lake for its location at the western end of Lake Ontario.&lt;ref name=headlake&gt;{{cite web| title =Chronology of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Ontario| url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/cultural_landmarks/twps.html| accessdate = 2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1790- Richard Beasley occupied ''Burlington Heights'' (now the site of ''Dundurn'' and ''Harvey Parks'') in 1790 &amp; was granted land by the Crown in 1799. A local entrepreneur, Beasley's business ventures included fur trading, land acquisition and establishment of a grist mill in [[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]]. He was a member of the legislative assembly of [[Upper Canada]] from 1791 to 1804 and was appointed colonel of the 2nd regiment of the York militia in 1809. Financial difficulties forced Beasley to sell lands at Burlington Heights, but it was purchased in 1832 by [[Allan MacNab|Sir Allan Napier MacNab]] who built [[Dundurn Castle]] on foundations of Beasley's brick home.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAMBIO1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hamilton Biography (Vol I, 1791â1875)|first=Thomas Melville |last=Bailey|publisher=W.L.

* 1791- Like [[British North America]] itself, the Six Nations confederacy was torn apart by the [[American Revolution]]. Indians loyal to the Crown, under their leader Captain [[Joseph Brant]], were settled in several nearby areas of what became Upper Canada in 1791 and ultimately Ontario in 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAMBIO1&quot;/&gt;

* 1792- Administratively, the whole area was part of the Nassau District, which was renamed the Home District in 1792. Additionally, parts of the area were separately incorporated into the West Riding of [[York County, Ontario|York County]] and First Riding of [[Lincoln County, Ontario|Lincoln County]]. In 1798, most of the future Hamilton became part of Niagara District while remaining in Lincoln County.&lt;ref name=barton2&gt;{{cite web| title =A History of the city of Hamilton| url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/cultural_landmarks/hamhist.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick, almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth...Bears ate pigs, so settlers warred on bears. Wolves gobbled sheep and geese, so they hunted and trapped wolves. They also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside. There was plenty of game.
