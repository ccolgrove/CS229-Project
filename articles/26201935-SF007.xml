'''Super Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode''' or '''Super AMOLED''' is a display technology (variant from [[AMOLED]]) mainly for use in mobile devices such as mobile phones (see the list below for examples). One of the main differences from other display technologies is that the layer that detects touch is integrated into the screen rather than being overlaid on top.

Compared with the first-generation AMOLED, some of the Super AMOLED advantages are brighter screens, less sunlight reflection and reduced power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samsung.com/au/smartphone/technology/super-amoled.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled&lt;/ref&gt; However, users{{who|date=November 2011}} have complained about noisy lines and blemishes when the display brightness is low.

Super AMOLED Plus, first introduced with the [[Samsung Galaxy S II]] and [[Samsung Droid Charge]] smartphones, is a further development where the [[PenTile]] RGBG pixel matrix (2 subpixels) is replaced with Samsung's &quot;Real Stripe&quot; (3 subpixels) RGB RGB subpixel arrangement.  Which goes from eight to twelve subpixels per group, resulting in finer details. The screen technology is also brighter, thinner and 18% more energy efficient. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled-plus|publisher=OLED-Info|title=http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled-plus|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HD Super AMOLED==

[[File:Galaxy Nexus smartphone.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Galaxy Nexus]], with a HD Super AMOLED screen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/android/GT-I9250TSAXEU&lt;/ref&gt;]]
HD Super AMOLED is a new Super AMOLED type display from Samsung.  The first device to use an HD Super AMOLED is the Galaxy Note: an Android v2.3 phone with a 5.3&quot; 1280x800 display. The phone (and the display) was announced in September 2011. The second HD Super AMOLED device is Samsung's [[Galaxy Nexus]] phone - with a 4.65&quot; display featuring 1280x720 resolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled-hd&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher [[Display resolution|resolution]] and [[Dots per inch|dpi]] were made possible due to a move from the Fine-Metal-Mask (FMM) to Laser-Induced-Thermal-Imaging (LITI) process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled-plus-resolution-further-details|publisher=Oled-Info.com|title=Super AMOLED Plus resolution - further details|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; .  However, the move to LITI required a change back to Pentile RGBG subpixels.

Samsung is expected to develop this screen to the better Samsung &quot;Real Stripe&quot; RGB subpixels along with the LITI technology.  This may be called &quot;HD Super Amoled Plus&quot;.
