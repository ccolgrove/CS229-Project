'''Vincent de Paul PÃ©ricard''' (born 3 October 1982 in Efok, [[Cameroon]]) is a [[France|French]] professional [[association football|football]] player, who played in France with Saint Etienne and in Italy with Juventus before moving to England.  In England he has played for several clubs.  He has also played for the [[France national under-21 football team|France U21 team]]. He is currently keeping fit by training with [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], managed by his former team mate [[Lee Bradbury]]. On 6 October 2011, he signed for [[Havant &amp; Waterlooville F.C.|Havant &amp; Waterlooville]] on a free transfer.

==Career==
===Early days===
PÃ©ricard started his career at [[AS Saint-Ãtienne|St Etienne]] in France but soon came to the attention of [[Italy|Italian]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], who snapped up the promising youngster. After impressing for Juventus against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]], his sole appearance for Juventus in two seasons in [[Turin]], he came to the attention of [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] manager [[Harry Redknapp]].

===Portsmouth===
PÃ©ricard initially moved to Portsmouth on loan for the [[2002-03 in English football|2002&amp;ndash;03 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trio in, three on way |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11674_2238511,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports|date=5 June 2002|accessdate=25 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; PÃ©ricard began his Portsmouth career in superb fashion, scoring on his debut in a 2&amp;ndash;0 win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], although he struggled with injury in the latter half of the season. Despite this, he impressed enough to earn a permanent switch in July 2003, having scored nine times in 32 games as Pompey won the Division One title.

PÃ©ricard was a regular in the squad at the start of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003&amp;ndash;04 season]], but broke down with a torn thigh muscle in late September. He returned to the first team in December, but then badly damaged a cruciate ligament in a reserve comeback game. The injury ended his season. He had an operation on the injury in France in the summer of 2004, and spent the whole of the [[2004â05 in English football|2004&amp;ndash;05]] season in rehabilitation following the surgery. In August 2005, following his recovery, he attended a Cameroon national team training camp for a friendly match against French amateur team Villemomble.

In [[2005â06 in English football|2005&amp;ndash;06]] PÃ©ricard returned to the first-team squad at [[Fratton Park]]. In order to gain match fitness he spent a three month loan spell with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Striker Pericard loaned to Blades |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4246828.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2005|accessdate=25 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring twice against Millwall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Stoke City===
PÃ©ricard was released by Portsmouth at the end of the [[2005â06 in English football|2005&amp;ndash;06 season]], signing a three-year contract with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] on 19 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Striker Pericard signs for Stoke |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/5095918.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 June 2006 |accessdate=25 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; PÃ©ricard was [[Tony Pulis]]' first signing as manager of Stoke City, in Pulis' second spell at the club. At first, PÃ©ricard impressed at Stoke, scoring against promotion winners Derby on his home dÃ©but.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/5248144.stm |title=Stoke 2-0 Derby 
|publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] against [[Darlington F.C|Darlington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/5266386.stm
|title=Stoke 1-2 Darlington |publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the league against Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/6050698.stm |title=Stoke 2-1 Sunderland 
|publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his performances later in the season were relatively poor and his place was taken by another former Portsmouth player, [[Ricardo Fuller]].

On 24 August 2007 Pericard was sentenced to four months in prison after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Speeding striker jailed for lying url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6962376.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=24 August 2007|accessdate=24 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after he lied about being the driver of a car caught speeding at 103&amp;nbsp;mph near [[Plymouth]]. He was released from prison on 20 September 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pericard released from prison |url=http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&amp;cid=96025|publisher=The World Game |date=21 September 2007|accessdate=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, following problems with his electronic tag, he was rearrested on 12 October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Club Statement |url=http://www.stokecityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10310~1133030,00.html|publisher=[[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City FC]]|date=12 October 2007|accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was subsequently re-released later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stoke star Pericard leaves prison |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/7061898.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2007|accessdate=25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2008, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] confirmed the loan signing of Pericard until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pericard Moves On|url=http://www.stokecityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10310~1265236,00.html|publisher=[[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City FC]]|date=14 March 2008|accessdate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Stoke, he scored against Reading in a Carling Cup tie in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7626760.stm |title=Stoke 2-2 Reading (aet) 
|publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pericard made his first [[Premier League]] appearance in 0-0 draw with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 13 December 2008, coming on as a substitute for [[Danny Pugh]]. His first start in the Premier League came against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Pericard, after seeing his first team opportunities disappear at Stoke following their promotion to the Premier League, signed a 93-day loan on 20 February 2009 with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lions close in on Pericard deal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Lions close in on Pericard deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/millwall/7900472.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2008-09 season, PÃ©ricard was released from his contract at Stoke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/8079486.stm Stoke offer new contract to Diao] BBC Sport, 2 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carlisle United===
Following his release, he had short trials with [[Football League Championship|Championship]] sides [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bfc1792349&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blackpoolfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10432~1792349,00.html|title=Pool Include Pericard In Reserves|date=9 September 2009|publisher=[[Blackpool FC]]|accessdate=10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October 2009 PÃ©ricard signed for [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] on a contract until January 2010, making his debut on 17 October against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]].

===Swindon Town===
On 14 January 2010, [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] signed PÃ©ricard on a free transfer until June 2011 after the forward had rejected a new deal from [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/8460136.stm |title=Swindon complete Vincent Pericard signing | publisher=BBC Sport| date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut two days later in a 3â1 win over [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], coming on in the 68th minute for [[Charlie Austin]].
