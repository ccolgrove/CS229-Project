'''EasyPeasy''' (formerly named '''Ubuntu Eee''') is a Linux-based [[operating system]] for [[netbook]]s. EasyPeasy is built upon [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], but is customized for low-powered computers and access to [[web application]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5356978/easy-peasy-is-a-lightweight-linux-distro-optimized-for-netbooks |title=Easy Peasy is a Lightweight Linux Distro Optimized for Netbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; EasyPeasy is maintained as an [[open source]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://launchpad.net/easypeasy |title=easypeasy on launchpad.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;, yet it uses popular web applications or [[proprietary software]] over free and open source software alternatives (e.g. [[Skype]] over [[Ekiga]]) when the functionality offered is deemed better by its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geteasypeasy.com/ |title=easypeasy - for netbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characteristics==
* Uses a recent [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] release as a base&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liliputing.com/2009/01/easy-peasy-ubuntu-based-linux-distro-for-eee-pc-now-available.html |title=Easy Peasy Ubuntu-based Linux Distro for Eee PC now available}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support for many netbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.geteasypeasy.com/Easypeasy_1.6_Compatibility_List |title=Easypeasy 1.6 Compatibility List - Easy Peasy wiki |publisher=Wiki.geteasypeasy.com |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pre-installs some widely used applications and codecs like [[Adobe Flash]] and [[MP3]]
* Uses well known proprietary software, instead of open source alternatives
* Strives to deliver netbook functionality like the Social Desktop and [[file hosting service|automatic file synchronization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonramvi.com/social-desktop/ |title=Social Desktop &amp;#124; Jon Ramvi . com |publisher=Jonramvi.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ubuntu Eee was started by [[Jon Ramvi]] in December [[2007]]. At that time it was only some [[scripting language|script]]s which modified a regular [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] installation to support the [[Asus Eee PC]]s. In June 2008 the project was disbanded as a script and Ubuntu Eee 8.04 was released as a stand-alone [[Linux distribution|distribution]], based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 8.04 with EeePC support installed out of the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liliputing.com/2008/06/ubuntu-eee-804-custom-ubuntu-distro-for.html |title=Ubuntu Eee 8.04: Custom Ubuntu distro for the Eee PC |accessdate=2008-10-05 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5 followed the 8.04.1 version. It used a new Linux kernel, came with a new user interface and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] 10.

It was renamed EasyPeasy in January [[2009]], and has been downloaded well over a million times from the main mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=213463&amp;ugn=ubuntu-eee&amp;type=prdownload&amp;mode=alltime&amp;package_id=0&amp;release_id=0 |title=Download History Statistics |accessdate=2011-05-26 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trademark issues===
On September 10, 2008, [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]] notified [[Jon Ramvi]] by email that the project's use of Canonical's names, URLs, and logos violated Canonical's [[trademark]]s in the original name ''Ubuntu Eee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonramvi.com/mail-from-canonical/ |title=Mail from Canonical |publisher=Jonramvi.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, the owners of the project announced that they would use a new name ''EasyPeasy'' and version 1.0 was released January 5, 2009.
