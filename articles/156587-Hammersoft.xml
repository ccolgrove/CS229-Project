In the fictional world of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, the '''Death Eaters''' constitute a group of wizards and witches, led by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], the chief antagonist of the series, who seek to purify the Wizarding community by eliminating the [[Muggle-born]]s (wizards or witches born to non-magical parents). They also try to create a new order through the [[Ministry of Magic]] and cause fear among the Wizarding community by [[terrorism|terrorising]] and killing important officials and other enemies of the Death Eaters, chiefly the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]].

According to author [[J. K. Rowling]], the original working title for the Death Eaters was &quot;The Knights of Walpurgis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3004456.stm J. K. Rowling interview in full], BBC News, 19 June 2003. Accessed 24 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Death Eaters recognise one another by the [[Dark Mark]] on their left forearm, a [[Spells in Harry Potter#(Protean Charm)|sign]] created by Voldemort to summon him instantly to them or vice-versa. Their typical attire includes black hooded robes and masks. The Death Eaters, as a group, first appeared in the novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', although individual members of the group, such as [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], and [[Severus Snape]], had appeared in earlier books in the series.

==Synopsis==
===Pre-Harry Potter===
The Death Eaters first existed 11 years before the events of the books, torturing and murdering Muggles (non-magical humans) as well as anyone who opposed them or was believed to have information which could aid in or harm their rise to power. They also did this to people who were blood traitors. Around ten years after the Death Eaters first surfaced, a Seer named [[Sybill Trelawney]] made a prophecy about one who would have the power to defeat Voldemort forever. The prophecy could have referred to two different boys, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] or [[Neville Longbottom]]; however, Voldemort chose Harry, as said in the prophecy, that &quot;the Dark Lord would mark him as his equal.&quot; As Voldemort was a half-blood, he chose his &quot;equal,&quot; Harry, whose mother was a muggle-born witch, instead of Neville, who came from a long line of pure-blooded wizards. Acting on information from [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]]'s Secret-Keeper [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], Voldemort attempted to complete the prophecy and kill his infant rival. Due to Harry's mother's sacrifice to save her son, Voldemort's deadly curse rebounded off Harry and disembodied Voldemort.

With Voldemort vanquished after failing to kill Harry, the Death Eaters largely disbanded. The Ministry rounded many of them up and imprisoned them in [[Azkaban]], the Wizarding prison, but some eluded justice by claiming they were bewitched by the [[Spells in Harry Potter#Imperio (Imperius Curse)|Imperius Curse]] (it is implied that Lucius Malfoy did so) or by turning in other Death Eaters, as [[#Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] did; Harry witnesses Karkaroff's testimony against former Death Eaters in [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Pensieve]] during the course of the series. It appears that very few Death Eaters stood for their fallen master and proudly went to Azkaban for him (like [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]), since, in the sixth book, Snape states that if Voldemort had refused to welcome back all those who turned their backs on him when he fell, then he would have very few followers. The Lestranges are the only three Death Eaters known to have willingly sacrificed their freedom for Voldemort. This is something that does not go unnoticed by him, as he claims, when he returns, that they will be recompensed for their loyalty.

===Re-emergence===
Lord Voldemort, having regained his full strength at the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', summoned his followers to him by touching Peter Pettigrew's Dark Mark. Except for those dead, imprisoned, or afraid to return, the majority returned to his service as Lord Voldemort began his second attempt to claim power.

The Minister for Magic ([[Cornelius Fudge]]) deluded himself into believing that Voldemort could not have come back and that it was all a lie cooked up by Dumbledore, whom Fudge believed had designs on his political office. The Death Eaters use this tactical advantage throughout ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' to maintain their secrecy. Because of the Ministry's refusal to remove the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementors]] from Azkaban, which Dumbledore advised immediately following Voldemort's return, the Death Eaters recruited the Dementors to their cause and made similar progress with the giants; the Dementors' revolt against the Ministry of Magic also allowed the Death Eaters to bolster their ranks with the mass break-out of several imprisoned Death Eaters.

In ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Voldemort sent a group of twelve Death Eaters, led by [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], into the Department of Mysteries, where he expected them to secure a Prophecy of vital importance to him: having originally attacked Harry based upon a partial recounting of it, he now wanted to hear the full version in order to better, or even fully, understand the connection between Harry and himself. The raid on the Department failed, however; Harry and his friends delayed the Death Eaters and kept the Prophecy out of their hands, finally destroying it, and were eventually aided by Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore captured eleven of the twelve Death Eaters, sending Voldemort and Bellatrix fleeing after a fierce duel with the former, and ending the Death Eaters' enjoyed secrecy. Lucius, who had been important both to the Death Eaters and within the Ministry, was captured and imprisoned. However, the Death Eaters regrouped, assassinating and kidnapping important wizards, killed [[Muggle]]s, and in general spread terror and chaos through the Wizarding world.

Towards the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts for the first time, leading to the death of Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school's defenders. A second, more deadly attack near the conclusion of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' resulted in over 50 deaths, including Voldemort, who died when the killing curse he threw at Harry rebounded on him. Voldemort's death signalled the end of the Death Eaters.

===Ideology===
While the Death Eaters practice &quot;dark magic&quot;, illegal and dangerous spells, their ideology, such as it is, is a version of racial supremacy. They believe wizards are, as a genealogy book within the story phrases it, &quot;Nature's Nobility&quot;; other beings and races are inferior and should be subjugated. Within the wizarding community, so they believe, only those who are born to wizard parents are worthy of magical power, despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such powers. They categorise wizards according to [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)|blood purity]]; &quot;pure bloods&quot;, or wizard borns, out-rank &quot;half-bloods&quot; (mixed parentage) and &quot;mudbloods&quot;, a derogatory name for those born to non-magical parents (muggles); though mostly they seek complete power and control over the entire Wizarding world, wishing to restrict leadership to a small band of [[Pure-blood|pure-bloods]]. The Death Eaters not only seek the restoration of pure-blood rule over the Wizarding community, but also the eventual subjugation of the Muggle community under Wizarding rule.

In reality, the idea of blood purity is a misnomer â Voldemort himself is a [[Half-blood (Harry Potter)|half-blood]] â and it is unlikely that all of them could be pure-bloods, as very few, if any, such people could exist given the small gene pool. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Rowling depicts the Gaunts as a family who are obsessed with their ancestry and driven to inbreeding to preserve its integrity. Rowling has stated on her website that there are no true pure-blood families left, but that those who call themselves such simply strike Muggles, [[Squib (Harry Potter)|Squibs]], and Half-bloods from their family records.

The Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them. Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as [[Serious Black|Sirius Black]] or the Prewett brothers who were murdered because of their loyalties, or the entire Weasley family. Such people are often called &quot;blood traitors&quot; by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies. On the other hand, Rowling has said that a Muggle-born wizard can become a Death Eater &quot;in rare circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80 J. K. Rowling Official Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also not above recruiting creatures they deem inferior, as proven by [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] [[#Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and the [[Gurg|giant]] clan from continental Europe, as long as they help further the larger Death Eater agenda.

==Death Eaters==
===Regulus Black===
'''Regulus Arcturus Black''' is the younger brother of [[Serious Black|Sirius Black]]. According to ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', he died &quot;some fifteen years previously&quot; as seen from the perspective of August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{HP5ref}}, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; As it is common in the Black family, Regulus is named after a bright star, in this case the brightest star in the constellation [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]]. Before publication of the final volume of the series, Rowling stated that Regulus was dead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm|date=5 March 2004|accessdate=31 May 2007|title=JK Rowling's World Book Day Chat}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not comment on the nature of his demise. She also remarked in an interview: &quot;Regulus got in a little too deep. Like [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]. He was attracted to it, but the reality of what it meant was way too much to handle.&quot;&lt;ref name=jkr-tlc-mn-pt2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm|date=16 July 2005|accessdate=1 January 2007|title=Anelli, Melissa and Emerson Spartz. &quot;The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two&quot;, The Leaky Cauldron, 16 July 2005|publisher=[[Accio Quote!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirius described him as his parents' favourite son because he accepted their ideas about [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)|blood purity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP5}}ch6&quot;&gt;{{HP5}}, chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulus is sorted into the Slytherin House and played Seeker on its [[Quidditch]] team. He joins the Death Eaters at the age of sixteen but later has a change of heart.

The Blacks' house-elf, [[Kreacher]], reveals to Harry and his friends in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' that he was ordered by Regulus to assist Voldemort in hiding a locket. Kreacher was forced to drink the potion protecting the locket to test its effectiveness. The potion (the same one that Dumbledore drank in that same cave) causes horrible memories or thoughts to be relived, intense stomach pain and dehydration. Kreacher was forced to go to the inferi-infested water and drink and was saved only by the fact that house-elf [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Apparition and Disapparition|Apparition]] works differently from wizard Apparition. When Kreacher tells Regulus what has transpired, Regulus forces the elf to take him to the cave. While there, Regulus, instead of forcing Kreacher to drink, drinks the entire potion himself and switches the locket for a fake one. Before being dragged underwater and killed by [[Inferius|Inferi]], Regulus tells Kreacher to destroy the original locket. Regulus deduced that the locket was a Horcrux due to Voldemort dropping various hints about having made them, in his arrogance believing that nobody would hunt them down and destroy them.&lt;ref name=webchat/&gt; Many years after his sacrifice, Kreacher revealed that he was still loyal to Regulus' memory, even leading the House-Elves of Hogwarts in the Battle of Hogwarts in Regulus' name.

Regulus appears in a photograph owned by [[Horace Slughorn]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', played by [[Thomas Moorcroft]].

===Alecto and Amycus Carrow===
'''Alecto''' and '''Amycus Carrow''' (often referred as &quot;'''The Carrows'''&quot;) are siblings who participate in the assault on Hogwarts at the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. Amycus is described as being squat and lumpy, with a lopsided leer and a wheezy giggle; Alecto is described as a &quot;stocky little woman&quot; and shares her brother's squatness and laugh. It is said that after Voldemort's first downfall, they believed that he was gone forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |title=Rowling's website FAQ about Carrows |accessdate=8 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Alecto and Amycus become &quot;teachers&quot; at Hogwarts, severely disciplining students who oppose Voldemort. Amycus teaches [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], but as [[Neville Longbottom]] puts it, it becomes just &quot;[[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|The Dark Arts]]&quot; in which students are forced to perform the [[Cruciatus Curse]] against students who have been assigned to detention. Alecto teaches [[Hogwarts#Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]], which becomes a compulsory subject, and teaches students that [[Muggle]]s are like animals. Right before the Battle of Hogwarts, Alecto waits in Ravenclaw Tower on Voldemort's orders, preparing to capture Harry, but is stunned by [[Luna Lovegood]] after touching her Dark Mark to summon Voldemort. Amycus, after seeing what happened, tries to conspire with [[Minerva McGonagall]] who helped him into the room to offer some Ravenclaw students as sacrifices to Voldemort while planning to use the lie that Ravenclaws had ambushed Alecto and forced her to press her Dark Mark. McGonagall refuses and argues with Amycus, who spits in her face. Enraged at this, Harry casts the [[Cruciatus Curse]], with such power that Amycus passes out. Later, McGonagall places the [[Spells in Harry Potter#Imperio (Imperius Curse)|Imperius Curse]] on him, then binds him with his sister and places him inside a net.

[[Ralph Ineson]] plays Amycus, and [[Suzie Toase]] appears as Alecto.

===Barty Crouch, Jr===
'''Bartemius &quot;Barty&quot; Crouch, Junior''' is a Death Eater who is captured with the [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Lestranges]], who are responsible for torturing Frank and Alice Longbottom, parents of [[Neville Longbottom]]. [[Barty Crouch, Sr.|His father]], who headed the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the time, sentenced him to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. However, Crouch Sr later rescues his son as a favour to his dying wife. When they visit him in Azkaban, Mrs. Crouch used Polyjuice Potion to switch appearances with her son, enabling him to escape while she remains in his place. When she dies, she is buried under his identity.

To prevent him from returning to Voldemort's service, Crouch Sr controls his son with the [[Spells in Harry Potter#Imperio (Imperius Curse)|Imperius Curse]] and keeps him hidden under an [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]]. Crouch Jr is nursed back to health by [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Winky|Winky]], the family's [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#House-elves|house-elf]]. When [[Bertha Jorkins]] discovers the truth, it reaches Voldemort, who rescues Crouch Jr and puts Crouch Sr under the Imperius Curse. Crouch Jr then kidnaps [[Mad-Eye Moody]] and, using Polyjuice Potion, assumes Moody's appearance and position as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher to infiltrate Hogwarts. Despite being an imposter, Crouch does a fair job of teaching the students; even student [[Dean Thomas (Harry Potter)|Dean Thomas]] says that &quot;Moody&quot; is not entirely sane, but the class still learns vast amounts from him. Crouch Sr escapes and reaches Hogwarts to tell Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, but he is exhausted and delirious from escaping the Imperius Curse. His son murders him on Hogwarts grounds.

The revived Triwizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts, and Crouch Jr is tasked with making sure Harry wins. In doing so, he bewitches [[Victor Krum]] to attack [[Cedric Diggory]] in the maze. He also stunned [[Fleur Delacour]]. When Harry, along with [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], touches the Triwizard Cup, it transports them to a graveyard, via [[Portkeys|portkey]]. There, Harry's blood is used in a ritual to bring Voldemort back to power. The plan succeeds, but Harry escapes. When Harry returns to Hogwarts, the still-disguised Crouch hopes to succeed where his master failed, but he also is unable to kill Harry, his plot foiled by Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall. Under the effect of Veritaserum, a powerful truth potion, he recounts his plan to them. Although he is closely guarded so he can later repeat his testimony, Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] has Crouch's soul sucked out by a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementor]] before he can be brought to trial, which prevents him from confirming Voldemort's return. He lives, but few would dare to identify his present condition as &quot;alive&quot; as he has no memories or sense of self.

[[David Tennant]] appears as Barty Crouch, Jr in the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.

===Antonin Dolohov===
'''Antonin Dolohov''' has a long, pale, and twisted face. He is confirmed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' to be one of Voldemort's first Death Eaters, being present at the Hog's Head when Voldemort comes to Hogwarts to request a teaching position and hide the [[diadem]] [[Horcrux]], c. 1956. This makes him at least sixty years old at the time of the battle in the Department of Mysteries. Dolohov is one of the five Death Eaters who murder [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)#Synopsis|Gideon and Fabian Prewett]] ([[Molly Weasley]]'s brothers). He also tortures many [[Muggle]]s and opponents of Voldemort during the first war. Dolohov is imprisoned in Azkaban but escapes during the mass break-out.

He participates in the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]], where he causes damage to Hermione, but is imprisoned again, and returns to [[Azkaban]] prison. He escapes once more some time before the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. He tracks Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a Muggle cafe after they use Voldemort's name (which had recently been made a Taboo). He and his companion Rowle are stunned, and have their memories erased by Hermione and then are punished by Voldemort. Dolohov participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, killing [[Remus Lupin]],&lt;ref name=webchat/&gt; whom [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] last sees fighting with him. He is also seen duelling with [[Dean Thomas (Harry Potter)|Dean Thomas]] until [[Parvati Patil]] uses a body-bind curse on him. Dolohov and Yaxley are later sent to look for Harry, and they mistakenly thought the boy would not give himself up. When the battle recommences, [[Professor Flitwick]] finally defeats him.

He is portrayed by Arben Bajraktaraj in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â Part 1]]''.

===Fenrir Greyback===
'''Fenrir Greyback''' is a [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] who is involved with the Death Eaters, allowed to use their robes but not ranking highly enough to carry the Dark Mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{HP7ref}}, chapter 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as the most savage werewolf ever to live and is greatly feared throughout the wizarding world. He positions himself close to his victims when the moon is almost full. To fulfil his agenda of creating as many werewolves as possible, Greyback has infected scores of people including the young Remus Lupin, when Lupin's father had angered Greyback. Greyback is known for targeting young children. Unlike most werewolves, Greyback thirsts for blood even in his human form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Greyback first appears on the night of Dumbledore's death, when he attacks Harry and badly scars [[Bill Weasley]]. Although Greyback does not transmit his [[lycanthropy]] because he was in human form at the time, Bill is subsequently shown to display a preference for very [[rare meat]].

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Greyback leads a Snatcher gang â Dark wizards looking for [[Muggle-born]]s and &quot;Undesirables&quot; in exchange for gold. When Harry accidentally uses Voldemort's name after it has been made taboo, Greyback is alerted and his gang attacks their camp. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are kidnapped by the Snatchers and are taken to [[Malfoy Manor]]. [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] promises Hermione to Greyback in return for his services, but the prisoners fight their way out and escape, Greyback being hit by a triple [[Stunning Spell]]. Greyback is the main werewolf within the pack that agrees to aid Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Hermione, using a blasting curse, prevents Greyback from attacking injured [[Lavender Brown (Harry Potter)|Lavender Brown]], and a crystal ball thrown by [[Professor Trelawney]] stuns him. He rejoins the battle in time for the Death Eaters' last stand, when [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] combine forces to take him down by magic.

[[Dave Legeno]] portrayed Greyback in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. He reprised the role in both parts of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.

[[Fenrir]] is the name of a powerful wolf in Norse mythology.

===Igor Karkaroff===
''' Igor Karkaroff''' ([[Cyrillic]]: ÐÐ³Ð¾ÑÑ ÐÐ°ÑÐºÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð²) is the Headmaster at [[Durmstrang]] Institute, one of the three schools (together with Hogwarts and [[Beauxbatons]] Academy) that enter the Triwizard Tournament. As Headmaster, Karkaroff is also one of the judges. He is described as a neat, fussy-looking man with an oily voice and manner who sports a small grey goatee. While unctuously pleasant most of the time, he is capable of violent rage. He is also described as a man with yellowish teeth whose smile does not reach his cold stare. Karkaroff is angered and threatens to withdraw from the tournament when Harry is selected as a fourth champion and second representative for Hogwarts.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP4}}ch17&quot;&gt;{{HP4}}, chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is talked down and agrees to stay, he nevertheless shows evident favouritism towards the Durmstrang champion, Bulgarian [[Quidditch]] player [[Viktor Krum]].

[[Serious Black|Sirius Black]] later identifies Karkaroff as a former Death Eater.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP4}}ch19&quot;&gt;{{HP4}}, chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; Karkaroff was captured by [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. Karkaroff later told the [[Ministry of Magic]] that he had seen the error of his ways, and &quot;named names&quot;, putting many people in Azkaban in exchange for his freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP4}}ch30&quot;&gt;{{HP4}}, chapter 30&lt;/ref&gt; Karkaroff is thus also hated by the Death Eaters. Karkaroff's history gives him a connection with [[Severus Snape|Snape]], also a former Death Eater. Karkaroff interrupts a Potions lesson demanding to talk to Snape, and shows him his Dark Mark reappearing.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP4}}ch27&quot;&gt;{{HP4}}, chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the novel, following Voldemort's return, Karkaroff goes into hiding, leaving behind his student charges at Durmstrang. In the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Remus Lupin]] states that Karkaroff was found dead in a shack with the Dark Mark hovering over it, an indication that he was killed by other Death Eaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{HP6ref}}, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Predrag Bjelac]] appeared as Karkaroff in the film adaptation of ''Goblet of Fire''.

===Bellatrix Lestrange===

'''Bellatrix Lestrange''' is the first female Death Eater introduced in the books, and one of the most faithful members of Voldemort's inner circle.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP4}}ch33&quot;&gt;{{HP4}}, chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt; She is described as being highly attractive yet emaciated due to her time in Azkaban and described as having long, curly black hair and dark heavily lidded eyes. Bellatrix is portrayed as paranoid, mentally unstable and fanatically devoted to Voldemort. She takes an obvious pleasure in acts of torture and cruelty. Despite her apparent mental instability, she is a witch of prodigious ability, as demonstrated by all her victories in duels against other characters, and as noted by Harry in the final book.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP7}}ch23&quot;&gt;{{HP7}}, chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellatrix was born Bellatrix Black to Cygnus Black and Druella Rosier in the year 1951 and has two sisters, [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]]. She is also a first cousin to [[Serious Black|Sirius]] and Regulus Black, and an aunt to [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Bellatrix married Rodolphus Lestrange after leaving Hogwarts because it was &quot;expected of her to marry a pure-blood&quot;. However, Rowling stated in an interview that Bellatrix's true love was Voldemort, and she had a non-sexual relationship with him. &lt;ref name=webchat/&gt; In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Rowling uses Dumbledore's [[Pensieve]] as a [[Exposition (literary technique)|plot device]] to reveal that Bellatrix, rather than deserting Voldemort after his downfall like many other Death Eaters, is part of the group of dark wizards â along with Barty Crouch Jr, Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange â that [[torture]]d well-known [[Auror]]s [[Frank and Alice Longbottom]] in an attempt to gain information about Voldemort's location.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP4}}ch30&quot; /&gt; For using the Unforgivable [[Cruciatus Curse]] to torture the Longbottoms to insanity, Bellatrix and her three associates were sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. During the trial, she said Voldemort would rise again and reward them. When Voldemort is raised, he says the Lestranges will be deeply rewarded when Azkaban is broken open.

Fourteen years after Voldemort's fall, Bellatrix is one of the many Death Eaters who escapes Azkaban and rejoins him. She is present at the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]] in the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', in which a group of Death Eaters attempts to steal [[Sybill Trelawney]]'s [[prophecy]] pertaining to Voldemort's downfall. Rowling let Bellatrix prove her magical powers during the mission when she overpowers her niece Tonks and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] in one-on-one duels, kills her cousin Sirius by blasting him through the veil in the Death Chamber, and deflects one of Dumbledore's spells as she makes her escape. Harry attempts to use the Cruciatus Curse on her in revenge for killing Sirius, but the curse is ineffective due to the lack of real cruelty behind it. Before she can do any more, Bellatrix is subdued by Dumbledore in the [[Ministry of Magic]]'s Atrium so he can duel Voldemort. Voldemort however rescues Bellatrix and takes her with him as he [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Apparition and Disapparition|disapparates]].

At the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Bellatrix attempts to keep Narcissa from confiding Draco's secret mission to Snape at [[Spinner's End]]. Rowling used the conversation between Snape and Bellatrix to imply that Voldemort is still furious at Bellatrix's failure in the previous book.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP6}}ch2&quot;&gt;{{HP6}}, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; That conversation also suggests that Bellatrix mistrusts Snape not only because of his low birth, but also for many valid questions about his loyalty to the Dark Lord. Snape surprises Bellatrix by replying to each of her arguments and by agreeing to create an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to assist Draco in his mission to kill [[Dumbledore]]. Later in the book, it is mentioned by Snape that Bellatrix had been teaching [[Occlumency]] to Draco, in an effort to aid him with his mission. In the film, she and Fenrir Greyback arrive at the Burrow (the Weasley house) and burn it down. Harry and Ginny chase after them, with Bellatrix taunting &quot;I killed Sirius Black!&quot;.

The first chapter of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' implies that Voldemort is still angry with Bellatrix, as evidenced when he makes fun of the fact that her niece Tonks married werewolf [[Remus Lupin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP7}}ch1&quot;&gt;{{HP7}}, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, Voldemort gives Bellatrix a chance to &quot;prune&quot; her family tree during the Death Eaters' attempt to capture Harry as the boy departs from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]]' home, during which Bellatrix unsuccessfully tries to kill Tonks.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP7}}ch5&quot;&gt;{{HP7}}, chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Rowling reveals that Bellatrix is the guardian of [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup (though she is unaware of its [[Horcrux|true nature]]), which Voldemort has entrusted the Lestranges to keep in their [[Gringotts]] vault. Bellatrix and the Malfoys detain Harry, Ron, and Hermione at Malfoy Manor, and Hermione is tortured by Bellatrix when she suspects the trio has broken into her vault, but [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]] appears and saves the prisoners, though not before being hit by a knife thrown by Bellatrix as they disapparate to safety. Later in the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione use a stray hair of Bellatrix's to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix using Polyjuice Potion, in order to gain access to the Lestrange's Gringotts vault. Though Voldemort apparently punishes Bellatrix and the Malfoys severely for interrupting his [[Deathly Hallows (objects)#Elder Wand|Elder Wand]] side quest only to have Potter escape and steal the cup, she nevertheless fights for her master in the Battle of Hogwarts towards the end of the novel. Rowling stated in an interview that, during the battle, it was Bellatrix who killed Tonks.&lt;ref name=webchat/&gt; When the battle resumes inside the Great Hall after Harry's supposed death, Bellatrix simultaneously duels with Hermione, [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], none of whom is a match for Bellatrix, who nearly hits Ginny with a [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]]. An enraged [[Molly Weasley]] engages Bellatrix in a duel and fires a curse that hits Bellatrix right over the heart, killing her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/11/19/new-interview-with-j-k-rowling-for-release-of-dutch-edition-of-deathly-hallows New Interview with J.K. Rowling for Release of Dutch Edition of 'Deathly Hallows'].&quot; (18 November 2007). ''[[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]].'' Retrieved 19 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling revealed that, though there was speculation that Neville would kill Bellatrix, she had always intended Molly to do so because the author wanted to match Bellatrix's obsessive love with Molly's maternal love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more|author=Edward|title=J.

In the film series, Bellatrix is played by [[Helena Bonham Carter]].

[[IGN]] listed Bellatrix Lestrange as their tenth top ''Harry Potter'' character, and IGN's Joe Utichi listed Bellatrix as his fourth favourite ''Harry Potter'' character, calling her the &quot;most pitiable&quot; of Voldemort's servants.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Top&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/100/1002569p5.html|title=Top 25 Harry Potter Characters|author=Brian Linder, Phil Pirrello, Eric Goldman, Matt Fowler|date=14 July 2009|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe Top&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/113/1132181p2.html |title=The Top 10 Harry Potter Characters |author=Joe Utichi |date=3 November 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NextMovie.com's ''Harry Potter'' Mega Poll, Bellatrix was voted as the No.&amp;nbsp;1 villain in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;MegaPoll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/harry-potter-poll-results/|title='Harry Potter' Mega Poll: The Mega Results!|author=Scott Harris|date=14 July 2011|work=NextMovie.com|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Draco Malfoy===
{{Main|Draco Malfoy}}

===Lucius Malfoy===
'''Lucius Malfoy''' is a Death Eater and head of a [[Pure-blood|pure-blood]] Wizarding family; he lives with his wife [[Narcissa Malfoy]] (nÃ©e Black) and their son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] at the [[Malfoy Manor]] in Wiltshire. Lucius is a [[trustee|school governor]] of Hogwarts before he is sacked and has very close connections at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. To maintain his reputation and influence, he makes donations to the Ministry, to charity, and to [[St Mungo's (Harry Potter)|St Mungo's Hospital]]. He was educated at Hogwarts, where he was a prefect in Slytherin House.

Just before Draco and Harry's second year at Hogwarts, Lucius plants [[Tom Riddle's diary]] in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s [[Potions Class|potions]] cauldron while she is shopping for school supplies at [[Flourish &amp; Blotts]], in a plot to use her to reopen the [[Chamber of Secrets]], which would lead to attacks on [[Muggle-born]] students. Lucius knows the diary is cleverly enchanted, but is not aware that it contained a [[Horcrux|part]] of Voldemort's soul. Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father, [[Arthur Weasley]], and Dumbledore. Lucius' plans are ultimately thwarted with the help of the Malfoys' [[house-elf]] Dobby, and Harry, but not before the Chamber is opened and Lucius uses the ensuing terror (and threats to attack their families) to influence the school's Board of Governors to discredit and dismiss Dumbledore as Headmaster. Subsequently, Harry tricks Lucius into setting Dobby free. Upon this, Lucius attempts to attack Harry with his wand but Dobby disarms him before he can do any harm. Lucius is ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor. Despite his sacking, he still maintains strong ties with the Ministry of Magic.

Lucius next appears in the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' during the [[Quidditch]] World Cup, sharing prime seats in the Top Box with Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Later in that book, when Voldemort rises again and summons his Death Eaters, Malfoy rejoins him, claiming that he had done everything he could all along to find Voldemort and help him rise again (though Voldemort [[Legilimency|knows]] he is lying). Harry, who witnesses Malfoy's declaration of loyalty to Voldemort, tells Minister Fudge, who refuses to believe him, and the wealthy Malfoy continues to maintain strong ties with the Ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;{{HP4}}ch36&quot;&gt;{{HP4}}, chapter 36&lt;/ref&gt; During the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Malfoy is the leader of the Death Eaters who are to retrieve the prophecy from Harry in the Hall of Prophecy. Lucius tries several ways to get the prophecy from Harry without breaking it, but the boy and his friends manage to escape from the Hall. Malfoy finally meets him in the Death Chamber, where Harry is about to give it to Malfoy when the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] breaks into the Ministry and begins to duel with the Death Eaters. Dumbledore himself arrives at the end of the battle and Malfoy is captured and sent to Azkaban.

By the final book, Voldemort has given Malfoy his freedom, though he looks significantly the worse for wear. Voldemort treats him with great contempt, has hijacked his house for Headquarters, and is forcing his son to do dark deeds against his nature, sparking sympathy for the notorious family for the first time in the series. Voldemort also borrows Lucius's wand which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter. Later in the book, Lucius, along with his wife and sister-in-law, accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor. Voldemort punishes them severely, eventually putting them under house arrest. Despite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort's advocate of pure-blood supremacy, Lucius has decided his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he pleads with Voldemort to let him onto the battlefield to locate his son. He and the rest of his family are reunited at the end of the book. Following Voldemort's death, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco all manage to &quot;''weasel their way out''&quot; of being sent to Azkaban due to Narcissa's aiding Harry in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].&lt;ref name=webchat/&gt;

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, in 2006, Lucius Malfoy was number 12&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS NUMBER. LOOK AT THE SOURCE.--&gt; on their [[Forbes Fictional 15]] list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/20/lucius-malfoy-money-tech-media_cx_de_06fict15_potter.html Forbes Fictional 15, No.&amp;nbsp;12 Malfoy, Lucius]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film series, Lucius is portrayed by [[Jason Isaacs]] as an adult. Scenes with Tony Coburn as a teenage Lucius were cut from the final movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harrypotterspage.com/news.php/2008/05/03/tony-coburn-as-young-lucius-malfoy-in-half-blood-prince123.html Tony Coburn â Young Lucius]&lt;/ref&gt;

IGN listed Lucius as their fifteenth top ''Harry Potter'' character, praising Jason Isaac's portrayal of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Top&quot;/&gt;

===Peter Pettigrew===
{{Redirect|Peter Pettigrew|the Canadian politician|Pierre Pettigrew}}
'''Peter Pettigrew''', nicknamed '''Wormtail''', is the only Death Eater known to have been in a House other than Slytherin (Gryffindor) while at Hogwarts. There, he was a close friend of [[Sirius Black]], [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]] and [[Remus Lupin]], although he was the least intelligent and least talented of the gang. With Sirius and James' help, Pettigrew becomes an [[Animagus]], with the ability to transform at will into a [[rat]]. After leaving Hogwarts, Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort, and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort's spy within the Order of the Phoenix, of which Pettigrew is a member. When the Potters know that their son Harry is Voldemort's target, Sirius suggests to them to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper because he does not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a âweak, talentless thingâ like Pettigrew. Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that leads to James and Lily's death (and ironically, Voldemort's near-destruction). Sirius seeks revenge on Pettigrew, but during the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potters' deaths, murders twelve Muggles, and cuts off his own index finger before transforming into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters, as well as of his own murder and that of the bystanders. Pettigrew is &quot;posthumously&quot; awarded the Order of Merlin, and hides during the next twelve years. Wanting to keep an eye on the wizarding world, he masquerades as a rat, first as [[Percy Weasley]]'s pet, and then as [[Ron Weasley]]'s. They name him &quot;Scabbers&quot;.

Although Pettigrew appears in the first two books in the form of Scabbers, his identity is not revealed until ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' where he serves as the antagonist of the novel. When a photograph of the Weasley family appears in the ''Daily Prophet'' newspaper, Sirius recognises him, prompting Black's escape from Azkaban. The two confront each other in the [[Shrieking Shack]], where Lupin and Black force &quot;Scabbers&quot; to resume his human form. Pettigrew confesses his [[treachery]], claiming to have committed it only to save his own life. With Sirius and Lupin about to take their revenge, Harry begs Sirius to turn Pettigrew over to the Ministry of Magic instead, in order to prove Sirius' innocence. Pettigrew escapes while being led out of the Shack when Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Harry's actions result in Pettigrew owing him a [[life debt]].

Pettigrew returns to the service of Voldemort, seeking him out in the forests of [[Albania]] and helping him to return to a feeble baby's body. He abducts a Ministry of Magic employee named [[Bertha Jorkins]], who is able to provide Voldemort with valuable information. Pettigrew (almost always referred to as &quot;Wormtail&quot; hereafter) assists [[#Barty Crouch, Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr]] in overpowering [[Mad-Eye Moody]], setting up the events in the fourth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. In the climactic confrontation in that book, Wormtail murders [[List of Harry Potter supporting characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] on Voldemort's orders, and performs the complex spell to regenerate Voldemort, severing his hand as a sacrifice. Upon his return to corporeal form, Voldemort replaces Wormtail's severed hand with a silver hand that possesses five intact fingers and great strength. Despite his actions, Wormtail's fortunes remain low; in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' Snape treats him as a servant, and in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' he is tasked with keeping watch over prisoners in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. While Harry and Ron are being kept there, Wormtail checks on the prisoners and is attacked. Wormtail begins strangling Harry with the silver hand, but when reminded by Harry that he once saved his life, Wormtail hesitates for a moment. The silver hand turns against him and strangles him in retribution for his [[pity]].

Pettigrew is portrayed by [[Timothy Spall]] as an adult, and by [[Charles Hughes (actor)|Charles Hughes]] as a teenager in the films. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â Part 1]]'', Pettigrew is not strangled to death in Malfoy Manor as in the book; he is instead struck by Dobby and collapses. He only appears in a flashback in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â Part 2]]''. 
IGN's Joe Utichi also listed him as his 10th top ''Harry Potter'' character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe Top&quot;/&gt;

===Severus Snape===
{{Main|Severus Snape}}

===Yaxley===
'''Yaxley''' (first name unknown) is the brutal-faced Death Eater who is present in the battle in which Snape killed Dumbledore. He is one of the more prominent Death Eaters, and one of Voldemort's spies in the [[Ministry of Magic]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Yaxley is invited to Malfoy Manor to witness the murder of [[Charity Burbage]], and argues with Snape about the correct date of Harry's departure from the Dursleyâs, but [[John Dawlish]], an Auror who is tricked by an Order member, gives him incorrect information. Yaxley announces to an impressed assemblage of Death Eaters that he has placed the [[Spells in Harry Potter#Imperio (Imperius Curse)|Imperius Curse]] upon [[Pius Thicknesse]], the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He uses Thicknesse to Imperius the other major department heads and they allow Voldemort to murder [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]; thus Thicknesse becomes Minister for Magic.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione, disguised as ministry officials, enter the Ministry to find Slytherin's locket, it is revealed that Yaxley has become Head of Magical Law Enforcement. He also assists [[Dolores Umbridge]] in leading the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and the two seem to have a good relationship, together humiliating the Muggle-borns. Both are immobilised by Harry, but Yaxley recovers and grabs Hermione while she is Apparating her friends to safety. Yaxley arrives with them at Grimmauld Place, allowing him to reveal their headquarters to the Death Eaters, but not to the location that the trio subsequently Apparate to. 

He participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he duels with [[Professor Flitwick]] and is later seen among those who wait with Voldemort for Harry Potter to come to him, mistakenly believing that Harry would not come within the allotted time. When the battle resumes, he is defeated by [[Fred and George Weasley|George Weasley]] and [[Lee Jordan (Harry Potter)|Lee Jordan]].

[[Peter Mullan]] plays Yaxley in the film adaptation of ''Deathly Hallows''.
