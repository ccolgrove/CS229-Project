'''Autodesk Maya''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|m|ÉË|j|É}}), commonly shortened to '''Maya''', is [[3D computer graphics software]] that runs on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]] and [[Linux]], originally developed by [[Alias Systems Corporation]] (formerly Alias|Wavefront) and currently owned and developed by [[Autodesk|Autodesk, Inc.]] It is used to create interactive 3D applications, including video games, animated film, TV series, or visual effects. The product is named after the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' ({{lang|sa|à¤®à¤¾à¤¯à¤¾}} ''{{IAST|mÄyÄ}}''), the [[Hindu]] concept of illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/maya.htm |title=Hindu Goddesses : Maya - Hindu Goddess|author=Sangeetha Johari|accessdate=2010-12-10|publisher=sanatansociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Development===
[[Image:Autodesk Maya 2010 App Icon.png|70px|left]]Maya was originally a next-generation animation product under development at Alias Research, Inc. based on code from [[The Advanced Visualizer]], [[PowerAnimator]] and ''Alias Sketch!''. The code was ported to [[IRIX]] and animation features were added. The codename for this porting project was Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayabooks.org/|title=History|accessdate=2010-12-11|publisher=mayabooks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] collaborated closely with Maya's development during its production of ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]''.&lt;ref name=micro&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microfilmmaker.com/reviews/Issue56/Maya11_1.html|date=07-01-2010|title=Microfilmmaker Magazine - Reviews - Software Review: Maya 2011|author=Michael J. Muwanguzi|accessdate=2010-12-11|publisher=microfilmmaker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney requested that the [[User interface]] of the application be customizable so that a personalized workflow could be created. This was a particular influence in the open architecture of Maya, and partly responsible for it becoming so popular in the industry.

After [[Silicon Graphics Inc.]] acquired both Alias and [[Wavefront Technologies|Wavefront Technologies, Inc.]], Wavefront's next-generation technology (then under development) was merged into Maya. SGI's acquisition was a response to [[Microsoft Corporation]] acquiring [[Softimage (company)|Softimage, Co.]]. The new wholly owned subsidiary was named &quot;Alias|Wavefront&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design-engine.com/alias/history.html|title=Alias|Wavefront Discontinued Products and Brands|date=12-13-02|author=Sam Weisbard|accessdate=2010-12-10|publisher=design-engine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of development, Maya started with [[Tcl]] as the scripting language, in order to leverage its similarity to a Unix shell language. But after the merger with Wavefront Sophia, the scripting language in Wavefront's [[Dynamation (software)|Dynamation]], was chosen as the basis of MEL (Maya embedded language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In silico: 3D animation and simulation of cell biology with Maya and MEL|last=Sharpe |first=  Jason Sharpe|coauthors=Charles J. Lumsden, Nicholas Woolridge |year= 2008|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|  page=263|isbn= 0-1237-3655-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya 1.0 was released in February 1998. Following a series of acquisitions, Maya was bought by Autodesk in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techrepublic.com.com/5208-11183-0.html?forumID=9&amp;threadID=182484&amp;start=0|title=Autodesk buys Alias|accessdate=2010-12-11|date=10-09-2005|publisher=techrepublic.com.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Autodesk_to_buy_Alias|title=Autodesk to buy Alias|accessdate=2010-12-11|date=10-07-2005|publisher=en.wikinews.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the name of the new parent company, Maya was renamed Autodesk Maya. However, the name &quot;Maya&quot; continues to be the dominant name used for the product.

===Awards===

On March 1, 2003, Alias was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with an [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]] for scientific and technical achievement for their development of Maya software.

In 2005, while working for Alias|Wavefront, Jos Stam shared an [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]] with Edwin Catmull and Tony DeRose for their invention and application of subdivision surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PIXAR Awards |url=http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/awards.htm|accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2008 Duncan Brinsmead, [[Jos Stam]], Julia Pakalns and [[Martin Werner]] received an [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]] for the design and implementation of the Maya Fluid Effects system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific &amp; Technical Awards Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/scitech/winners/2007.html|date=2003-01-06|accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Achievement Award|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/technical.html|date=2003-01-06|accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Maya is an application used to generate 3D assets for use in film, television, game development and architecture. The software was initially released for the IRIX operating system. However, this support was discontinued in August 2006 after the release of version 6.5. Maya was available in both &quot;Complete&quot; and &quot;Unlimited&quot; editions until August 2008, when it was turned into a single suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/compare/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13583751 |title=Autodesk Maya Features - Compare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users define a virtual workspace (''scene'') to implement and edit media of a particular project. Scenes can be saved in a variety of formats, the default being ''.mb'' (Maya Binary). Maya exposes a [[node graph architecture]]. Scene elements are [[Node (computer science)|node]]-based, each node having its own attributes and customization. As a result, the visual representation of a scene is based entirely on a network of interconnecting nodes, depending on each others information. For the convenience of viewing these networks, there is a [[dependency graph|dependency]] and a [[directed acyclic graph]].

===Components===

Since its consolidation from two distinct packages, Maya and later contain all the features of the now defunct ''Unlimited'' suites.

;Fluid Effects
:A realistic fluid simulator (effective for smoke, fire, clouds and explosions, added in Maya 4.5)
;Classic Cloth
:Cloth simulation to automatically simulate clothing and fabrics moving realistically over an animated character. The Maya Cloth toolset has been upgraded in every version of Maya released after Spider-Man 2. Alias worked with Sony Pictures Imageworks to get Maya Cloth up to scratch for that production, and all those changes have been implemented, although the big studios opted to use third party plugins such as [[Syflex]] instead of the (relatively) cumbersome Maya Cloth.
;Fur
:Animal fur simulation similar to Maya Hair. It can be used to simulate other fur-like objects, such as grass.
;Hair
:A simulator for realistic-looking human hair implemented using curves and Paint Effects. These are also known as dynamic curves.
;Maya Live
:A set of motion tracking tools for CG matching to clean plate footage.
;nCloth
:Added in version 8.5, nCloth is the first implementation of Maya Nucleus, Autodesk's simulation framework. nCloth gives the artist further control of cloth and material simulations.
;nParticle
:Added in version 2009, nParticle is addendum to Maya Nucleus toolset. nParticle is for simulating a wide range of complex 3D effects, including liquids, clouds, smoke, spray, and dust.
;MatchMover
:Added to Maya 2010, this enables compositing of CGI elements with motion data from video and film sequences.
;Composite
:Added to Maya 2010, this was earlier sold as [[Autodesk Toxik]].
;Camera Sequencer:
:Added in Autodesk Maya 2011, Camera Sequencer is used to layout multiple camera shots and manage them in one animation sequence.

===Maya Embedded Language===

Alongside its more recognized visual workflow, Maya is equipped with its very own cross-platform scripting language, fittingly called Maya Embedded Language. MEL, as it is often shortened to, is provided not only for scripting, but also as a means to customize the core functionality of the software, since many of the tools and commands used are written in it. Code can be used to engineer modifications, [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s or be [[Code injection|injected]] into [[Run-time system|runtime]]. Outside these superficial uses of the language, user interaction is recorded in MEL, allowing even inexperienced users to implement [[subroutines]]. Scene information can thus be [[Database dump|dumped]], extension ''.ma'', editable outside Maya in any [[text editor]].

==System requirements==
===Operating systems===

Autodesk supports the Windows, Mac and Linux platforms; [[Windows_XP#Service Pack 3|XP SP3]] or later, respectively. As of Maya 2011, the software is 64-bit under Mac OS X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autodesk Maya 2011|publisher=apple.com|accessdate=12-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Linux, the supported distributions are Red Hat and Fedora, 64-bit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=14959955&amp;linkID=9242259|title=Certified Hardware|accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Autodesk acknowledges that the application is not limited to the aforementioned releases, such as the specific Linux distributions,&lt;ref name=requirements&gt;{{cite web|title=System Requirements|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13583877|publisher=autodesk.com|accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not support them.

===Hardware requirements===

Autodesk has published system requirements to run Maya at adequate performance. Both specifications are identical for both x32 and x64 platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;requirements&quot;/&gt;
