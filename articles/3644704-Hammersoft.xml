'''Vito Spatafore, Sr.''', played by [[Joseph R. Gannascoli]], is a  [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] [[television|TV]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]''. He was a member of the [[DiMeo Crime Family]] and a [[subordinate]] of [[Tony Soprano]]. He was married to Marie Spatafore with two children, Francesca and Vito, Jr., and was a [[closeted homosexual]]. This was revealed in the show's [[List of The Sopranos episodes#Season 5: (2004)|fifth season]], and became one of the more prominent subplots in the [[List of The Sopranos episodes#Season 6: (2006-2007)|sixth season]].

==Fictional character biography==
Although Vito Spatafore wasn't introduced on ''The Sopranos'' until the Season 2 episode &quot;[[The Happy Wanderer (The Sopranos episode)|The Happy Wanderer]]&quot; as a nephew to fellow mobster [[Richie Aprile]] and later a cousin to [[Adriana La Cerva]] and [[Jackie Aprile, Jr]]. Vito is inducted into the Aprile crew upon Richie's release from prison and quickly rises through the ranks to [[caporegime|Capo]] after the deaths of capos Richie Aprile, [[Gigi Cestone]] and [[Ralph Cifaretto]]. Vito's character is based on [[John D'Amato]], who was the acting boss of the [[DeCavalcante crime family]], who was killed after being reported swinging and having sex with other men. Joseph R. Gannascoli . In a clear illustration of the lack of foresight or planing in The Sopranos series &quot;Vito&quot; appears in the Season 1 episode, &quot;[[The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti]]&quot; as pastry shop patron named &quot;Gino&quot;.

==Crimes and rise to capo==
In the season 3 episode &quot;[[Another Toothpick]]&quot;, Vito's brother, Bryan Spatafore, is violently beaten with a golf club by a young hot-head known as [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Salvatore &quot;Mustang Sally&quot; Intile|Salvatore &quot;Mustang Sally&quot; Intile]] and put into a coma. Vito is vindictive and demands someone render Sal's comeuppance. [[Tony Soprano]] enlists in the help of [[Bobby Baccalieri]]'s father, Bobby Baccalieri, Sr., to perform the hit on Mustang Sally.

In 2001, in the season 3 finale episode &quot;[[Army of One (The Sopranos episode)|Army of One]]&quot;, after [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.]] had gone into hiding after he and his friends hit [[Ralph Cifaretto]]'s card game, tragically ending with Jackie, Jr. shooting and killing Ralph's dealer, Sunshine, in a panic, Ralph Cifaretto was pressured by Tony into setting things right by having Ralph order a hit on Jackie despite Ralph's wanting to give him a pass. Vito performs his first on-screen murder by shooting Jackie, Jr. in the back of the head. Although the cover story for Jackie Jr.'s death was being &quot;killed by African-American drug dealers&quot;, his sister doesn't buy the story, given the fact they grew up in the Mafia world and stating, &quot;He was killed by some fat fuck in see-through socks. Take your pick. They all look alike.&quot;

In 2002, in the Season 4 episode &quot;[[Whoever Did This]]&quot;, Tony Soprano brutally strangles and beats Ralph Cifaretto to death after it is believed by Tony that Ralph is responsible for the death of their prized racehorse [[Pie-O-My]]. Vito is subsequently promoted to capo of the Aprile Crew, as he was second-in-command.

In 2006, Vito shoots an unnamed male civilian in the back of the head for intending to call the police and refusing a [[bribery|bribe]] to keep silent after a drunken Vito crashed his automobile into the man's parked car. His dead body landed in the snow, just as Jackie's one, both dying exactly in the same way.

===Weight loss===
By the Season 6 premiere &quot;[[Members Only (The Sopranos episode)|Members Only]]&quot; in 2006, Vito had lost over 160 pounds and appeared in a weight loss commercial. Tony was shot by [[Uncle Junior]] in the same episode, and was in a coma for the next two episodes. While Tony's recovery seemed uncertain, Vito hinted at the idea that he should take over as boss. At the time, Silvio Dante was acting boss, but ended up suffering an asthma attack from the stress. Vito informed DiMeo Family capo [[Larry Boy Barese]] that he was the best candidate for boss since he was the capo of the highest-earning crew in the family. While Tony was comatose, Vito also provided information to Paulie about the location of $1 million in drug money hidden by Colombian drug dealers. Paulie and Vito stole the money, although they were nearly killed by two Colombians guarding the stash. Paulie was seriously injured during the theft when one of the dealers kicked him in the groin, causing serious medical problems. Paulie demanded a higher cut because of his injury. Paulie and Vito also became angry when Silvio demanded a higher percentage of the cut go to Carmela in case Tony did not recover. Tony finally awoke from his coma, which made everyone ecstaticâexcept Vito who was hoping to step in and take Tony's place. His weight problems and attempts to lose weight resemble the health problems which were suffered by [[Colombo Crime Family]] capo [[Gerald Clemenza]].

===Homosexuality===
In 2004, in the Season 5 episode &quot;[[Unidentified Black Males]]&quot;, it is disclosed to viewers Vito is in fact [[homosexual]] after he is caught performing [[oral sex]] on a security guard early one morning at the Esplanade construction site by Meadow's boyfriend, [[Finn De Trolio]]. Vito intimidates Finn into silence, conveying the impression that if Finn lets the word slip that the consequences could result in his own demise.

In the episode &quot;[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Sacrimoni Request]]&quot;, during the wedding of Johnny Sack's daughter, Allegra, Vito claimed he wasn't feeling well. He and his family left the wedding. But back at home, Vito informed his wife he was going to &quot;make some collections&quot;. She found it odd that he would be making collections so late at night. Later, that evening while making a collection at a gay bar, two [[Lupertazzi Family]] associates, one named Sal Iaccuzzo, saw Vito dancing provocatively with a gay man. The Iaccuzzo character was based on real-life Gambino Crime Family capo Matthew Ianniello, who was known to extort and own several nightclubs in New York City that catered to homosexual clientele. Vito tried to play it off as a joke, although the two men were not fooled.
Vito, fearing the consequences of his outing, went home to collect money hidden around his house before going on the run. He also takes a picture of him and Marie from when they were younger.

Petrified of the consequences if his homosexuality were made public, Vito went into hiding. He stayed at a bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire and tried to pursue a new life away from the Mafia. Under the alias &quot;Vince,&quot; he took an interest in antiques and claimed to be writing a book on Italian boxers. He contacted his family only once during a brief phone call. He also began drinking heavily.

He started a relationship with Jim Witowski (aka 'Johnny Cakes'), a short-order cook who worked at the restaurant where Vito regularly stopped for breakfast. Vito was impressed when he found out Jim was a volunteer fireman. When Jim first tried to kiss him, Vito pushed him away, called him a fag, and the two scuffled briefly. Several days later, Vito went back to the restaurant and apologized, saying, &quot;Sometimes you tell a lie so long, you don't know when to stop.&quot; The two men reconciled. They drove on their motorcycles to a secluded spot by a nearby lake, where they picnicked and [[made love]]. Vito moved in with Jim shortly thereafter.

Vito continued to spend time with Jim, but Jim eventually saw through his story about being a writer. Vito confessed to some of his past but continued to lie, claiming he was a divorced construction worker. Jim arranged for Vito to work as a handyman, but Vito soon tired of the tedium of a working life. Vito's drinking worsened. Finally, Vito decided to return to his former life in New Jersey. He cooked a dinner for Jim and left the next morning while Jim slept.

===Return to New Jersey===
Vito eventually approaches [[Tony Soprano]] at a mall, while Vito's brother, Bryan, kept watch. Vito claimed that his homosexual behavior had been caused by medication. Wanting to &quot;buy himself back&quot; into the business, he offered Tony $200,000 and said he would run the family's [[Atlantic City]] prostitution and drug businesses. Tony was tempted by the offer, but realized this would bring him into open war with the Lupertazzis. Lupertazzi crime family boss [[Phil Leotardo]], a virulent [[homophobe]], demanded Vito's death, so Tony quietly arranged for [[Carlo Gervasi]] to make a hit on Vito. Meanwhile, Vito reunited with his family. He explained his absence to his children by claiming that he was an undercover [[CIA]] agent hiding out in [[Afghanistan]], and warned them not to tell anybody. He later ran into [[Terry Doria]], whom he agreed to loan $20,000 for child support.

That night, Vito returned to his motel room and was ambushed by Phil Leotardo and two of his soldiers, [[Gerry Torciano]] and [[&quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamiello]]. Torciano and Gamiello duct-taped Vito's mouth shut and beat him to death while Phil Leotardo watched.  It was later revealed that Vito was found with a pool cue stick in his anus, a message that he was killed because of his homosexuality.

===Aftermath===
Phil's unsanctioned murder of Vito proved to be a serious point of contention in his working relationship with Tony. The relationship was further strained when Phil correctly suspected the New Jersey mob in the disappearance of Gamiello, who had been killed by Silvio and Carlo Gervasi after making repeated wisecracks, in the wake of Vito's death, about the sexual orientation of New Jersey mobsters.

Phil Leotardo later told Vito's wife, Marie, that her husband was probably killed by two homosexual transients Vito had picked up at a bar. He told Marie that he loved Vito &quot;like a brother-in-law,&quot; and suggested that Vito's death was probably best as a gay man would have made a poor role model for the children. However, a newspaper reported Vito was killed by mobsters after requesting to live an openly gay lifestyle. Vito's children read the story, destroying the illusion of their father being a CIA agent.

A year later Vito's son, Vito Jr. began to go through a rebellious phase in reaction to his father's murder and cruelty from his peers in light of his father's sexual orientation, entering the Goth subculture and performing various acts of vandalism. His mother, Marie, asked Tony Soprano for money so she could relocate her family to Maine, where no one would know them or what happened to Vito. Tony asked Phil Leotardo to also intervene, because of his involvement in Vito's death. Both paid separate visits to Vito Jr. and told him to start acting more like an adult. But Vito Jr. continued to act out, and later flatulently defecated in a shower at school.

Tony decided to help Marie Spatafore move to Maine, but gambled away the money he had intended to give her. Instead, Tony told Marie he would only pay for Vito Jr. to attend a &quot;tough love&quot; camp in Idaho. The camp's counselors abducted Vito Jr. from his bed at night before taking him to the camp, much to Marie's despair. Vito's homosexuality may have been a contributing factor in Phil Leotardo declaring war on the DiMeo Crime Family, as Leotardo implies that others do not respect him any longer due to Vito's &quot;disgrace.&quot;
