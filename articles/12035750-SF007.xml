==History==
Version 3.36 of Sandboxie added partial 32-bit Windows 7 compatibility, for build 7000. Version 3.38 adds additional Windows 7 support, for build 7100. Version 3.40 adds full support for Windows 7, as well as security improvements and minor fixes. Version 3.42 improves on Windows 7 support, adds new settings, and improves compatibility with 3rd party software. Version 3.46 addresses over 100 issues, including improvements to Win 7 64-bit support.
Version 3.48 introduces a new activation process to Sandboxie, to combat the piracy of Sandboxie registration codes.
A Product Key replaces the previous registration code, and Sandboxie must now be activated every 180 days online or offline. Otherwise it falls back to the limited unregistered mode.

Version 3.50 adds additional compatibility settings, bug fixes, and improvements to the GUI.
Version 3.54 makes some necessary changes for SP1 on Win 7, as well as a recent Windows Update for XP.

==64-bit Windows==
Version 3.44 reintroduced support for 64-bit Windows Vista SP1 and Windows 7, albeit not as robust as for 32-bit Windows.&lt;ref name=64Bit&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?NotesAbout64BitEdition|title=Sandboxie - Notes About 64-Bit Edition|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Sandboxie halted support for 64-bit editions of Windows, and the developer had no plans to support future 64-bit Windows versions.&lt;ref name=TechRepublic/&gt; Before then, Sandboxie was usable on 64-bit editions of Windows XP, provided that the user bypassed [[Patchguard]].  However, an updated and revised [[Patchguard]] included in hotfix &quot;KB932596&quot; makes this impossible. Although uninstalling the hotfix will allow a user to run an older 64-bit version of Sandboxie as before, doing so could expose the kernel to unauthorized modifications (like 32-bit versions do).

As of version 3.56, the 64-bit version contains a new feature called &quot;Experimental Protection&quot; which improves the protection offered by Sandboxie.  The result is protection similar to that of the 32-bit version, but it uses unofficial kernel interfaces and Sandboxie acknowldeges that &quot;there is a small chance that a future update to the Windows kernel could render the feature inoperable and might even cause system crashes.&quot;&lt;ref name=ExperimentalProtection&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?ExperimentalProtection|title=Sandboxie - Experimental Protection|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==License==
Sandboxie is released under a proprietary End-User License Agreement (EULA). Certain functions of the software such as parallel usage of multiple sandboxes are [[Crippleware|blocked]] in the free unregistered version of Sandboxie.&lt;ref name=pcworld3/&gt; After a 30 day period, users of the unregistered free version will encounter [[Nagware|popups advising the user to register (buy) the product]] when loading.&lt;ref name=TechRepublic/&gt;
