The '''Oracle Database''' (commonly referred to as ''Oracle RDBMS'' or simply as ''Oracle'') is an [[object-relational database management system]] (ORDBMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e11822/whatsnew.htm#i969790 |title= What's New|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced and marketed by [[Oracle Corporation]].

[[Larry Ellison]] and his friends and former co-workers [[Bob Miner]] and [[Ed Oates]] started the consultancy Software Development Laboratories (SDL) in 1977. SDL developed the original version of the Oracle software. The name ''Oracle'' comes from the code-name of a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-funded project Ellison had worked on while previously employed by [[Ampex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,215072,00.html |title=Welcome to Larryland |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and logical structures==

An Oracle database systemâidentified by an alphanumeric system identifier or SID&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/install.111/b32077/glossary.htm?type=popup#BABEBJAG | title = Glossary | accessdate = 2008-11-17 | author = | last = Bhakthavatsalam | first = Namrata | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | year = 2008 | month = August | work = Oracle Database Client  quote = The SID automatically defaults to the database name portion of the global database name (sales in the example sales.us.example.com) until you reach eight characters or enter a period. You can accept or change the default value. }}&lt;/ref&gt;âcomprises at least one [[Database|instance]] of the application, along with data storage. An instanceâidentified persistently by an instantiation number (or activation id: SYS.V_$DATABASE.ACTIVATION#)âcomprises a set of operating-system [[process (computing)|processes]] and [[Computer data storage|memory]]-structures that interact with the [[Computer data storage|storage]]. Typical processes include PMON (the process monitor) and SMON (the system monitor).

Users of the Oracle databases refer to the server-side memory-structure as the SGA (System Global Area). The SGA typically holds [[cache]] information such as data-buffers, [[SQL]] commands, and user information. In addition to storage, the database consists of online [[redo log]]s (or logs), which hold [[Database transaction|transactional]] history. Processes can in turn [[archive]] the online redo logs into archive logs (offline redo logs), which provide the basis (if necessary) for [[data recovery]] and for some forms of [[replication (computer science)|data replication]].

If the Oracle [[database administrator]] has implemented [[Oracle RAC]] (Real Application Clusters), then multiple instances, usually on different [[server (computing)|servers]], attach to a central [[Disk array|storage array]]. This scenario offers advantages such as better performance, scalability and redundancy. However, support becomes more complex, and many sites do not use RAC. In version 10''g'', [[grid computing]] introduced shared resources where an instance can use (for example) [[central processing unit|CPU]] resources from another node (computer) in the grid.

The Oracle DBMS can store and execute [[stored procedure]]s and [[subroutine|functions]] within itself. [[PL/SQL]] (Oracle Corporation's proprietary procedural extension to [[SQL]]), or the object-oriented language [[Java (programming language)|Java]] can invoke such code objects and/or provide the programming structures for writing them.

=== Storage ===

'''The Oracle RDBMS''' [[data storage device|stores data logically]] in the form of [[tablespace]]s and physically in the form of data [[Computer file|files]] (&quot;[[datafile]]s&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= Oracle databases are logically divided into one or more tablespaces. An Oracle tablespace is a logical entity that contains the physical datafiles.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Tablespaces can contain various types of [[memory segmentation|memory segments]], such as Data Segments, Index Segments, etc. Segments in turn comprise one or more [[extent (file systems)|extents]]. Extents comprise groups of contiguous data blocks. Data blocks form the basic units of data storage.

There is also a [[Partition (database)|partitioning]] feature available on newer versions of the database, which allows tables to be partitioned based on different set of keys. Specific partitions can then be easily added or dropped to help manage large data sets.

Oracle database management tracks its [[computer data storage]] with the help of information stored in the &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; tablespace. The &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; tablespace contains the [[data dictionary]]âand often (by default) [[index (database)|indexes]] and [[cluster (computing)|clusters]]. A data dictionary consists of a special collection of [[table (database)|tables]] that contains information about all user-[[object (computer science)|objects]] in the database. Since version 8''i'', the Oracle RDBMS also supports &quot;locally managed&quot; tablespaces which can store space management information in bitmaps in their own [[header (information technology)|headers]] rather than in the &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; tablespace (as happens with the default &quot;dictionary-managed&quot; tablespaces).  Version 10''g'' and later introduced the &lt;code&gt;SYSAUX&lt;/code&gt; tablespace which contains some of the tables formerly in the &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; tablespace.

==== Disk files ====
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

Disk files primarily consist of the following types:
* Data and index files: Those files are necessary for the physical storage, which can consist of the data dictionary data (associated to the tablespace SYSTEM), user data, or index data. These files can be managed manually or managed by Oracle itself (&quot;Oracle-managed files&quot;). Note that a datafile has to belong to exactly one tablespace, whereas a tablespace can consist of multiple datafiles.
* Redo log files consisting of all changes to the database, used to recover from an instance failure. Note that often these files are stored multiple times, for extra security in case of disk failure. The identical redo log files are said to belong to the same group.
* Undo files: Those special datafiles, which can only contain undo information, are used for recovery, rollbacks, and read consistency.
* Archive log files: Those files are copies of the redo log files, but are usually stored at different locations. They are necessary for example to be applied to a standby database, or to perform recovery after an instance failure. It is possible to archive to multiple locations.
* Tempfiles: Those special datafiles are used exclusively for temporary storage data (used for example for large sorts)
* Control file, necessary for database startup. &quot;A binary file that records the physical structure of a database and contains the names and locations of redo log files, the time stamp of the database creation, the current log sequence number, checkpoint information, and so on.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Oracle Corporation, OracleÂ® Database Concepts 11g Release 1 (11.2), http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e25789/glossary.htm#CHDDFGEC, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At the physical level, [[data file]]s comprise one or more [[block (data storage)|data blocks]], where the [[block (data storage)|block size]] can vary between data files.

Data files can occupy pre-allocated space in the file system of a computer server, utilize raw disk directly, or exist within [[Automatic Storage Management|ASM]] logical volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob | last = Watkins | authorlink = | title = Look inside ASM disk groups with Oracle 10''g''R2's ASMCMD | url = http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6154262.html | archiveurl = | work = techrepublic.com | publisher = ZDNet | location = | doi = | date = 30 January 2007 | archivedate = | accessdate = 2009-07-30 | quote = In 10''g'', Oracle introduced a new kind of storage for its database product. Automatic Storage Management (ASM) is a logical volume manager that takes physical disk partitions and manages their contents [...] Until ASM, there were only two choices: file system storage and raw disk storage. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Control files =====
The following parameters govern the size of the control files:

 * maxlogfile
 * maxlogmembers
 * maxloghistory
 * maxinstances
 * control_file_record_keep_time

===Database Schema===
Oracle database conventions refer to defined groups of object ownership (generally associated with a &quot;username&quot;) as ''[[database schema|schemas]]''.

Most Oracle database installations traditionally came with a default schema called &lt;code&gt;SCOTT&lt;/code&gt;. After the installation process has set up the sample tables, the user can log into the database with the username &lt;code&gt;scott&lt;/code&gt; and the password &lt;code&gt;tiger&lt;/code&gt;. The name of the &lt;code&gt;SCOTT&lt;/code&gt; schema originated with Bruce Scott, one of the first employees at Oracle (then Software Development Laboratories), who had a cat named Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080116210119/http://www.orafaq.com/faqora.htm#SCOTT Oracle FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle Corporation has de-emphasized the use of the &lt;code&gt;SCOTT&lt;/code&gt; schema, as it uses few of the features of the more recent releases of Oracle. Most {{As of | 2009 | alt = recent}} examples supplied by Oracle Corporation reference the default HR or OE schemas.

Other default schemas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/ora/misc/known_schemas.html |title=Known schemas in Oracle |publisher=Adp-gmbh.ch |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcdba.com/abcdbaserver11gdefaultschema |title=11g Default Schema |publisher=ABCdba.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
* &lt;code&gt;SYS&lt;code&gt; (essential core database structures and utilities)
* &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;code&gt; (additional core database structures and utilities, and privileged account)
* &lt;code&gt;OUTLN&lt;/code&gt; (utilized to store metadata for stored outlines for stable query-optimizer execution plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/ora/tuning/cbo/plan_stability.html |title=Optimizer plan stability definition |publisher=Adp-gmbh.ch |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;BI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PM&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SH&lt;/code&gt; (expanded sample schemas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/ora/misc/sample_schemas.html |title=Oracle's sample schemas |publisher=Adp-gmbh.ch |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing more data and structures than the older &lt;code&gt;SCOTT&lt;/code&gt; schema).

====System Global Area====
{{Main|System Global Area}}

Each Oracle instance uses a [[System Global Area]] or SGAâa [[shared memory|shared-memory]] areaâto store its data and control-information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-class-programme.com/Oracle-Architecture-2.asp |title=Oracle Architecture, System Global Area |publisher=World-class-programme.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Oracle instance allocates itself an SGA when it starts and de-allocates it at shut-down time. The information in the SGA consists of the following elements, each of which has a fixed size, established at instance startup:

* the redo log buffer: this stores redo entriesâa log of changes made to the database. The instance writes redo log buffers to the redo log as quickly and efficiently as possible. The redo log aids in instance recovery in the event of a system failure.
* the shared pool: this area of the SGA stores shared-memory structures such as shared SQL areas in the library cache and internal information in the data dictionary. An insufficient amount of memory allocated to the shared pool can cause performance degradation.

====Library cache====
The library cache&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-class-programme.com/Oracle-Architecture-2.asp |title=Oracle architecture, the library cache section |'''publisher=World-class-programme.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; stores shared SQL, caching the parse tree and the execution plan for every unique SQL statement. If multiple applications issue the same SQL statement, each application can access the shared SQL area. This reduces the amount of memory needed and reduces the processing-time used for parsing and execution planning.

====Data dictionary cache====
The [[data dictionary]] comprises a set of tables and  [[view (database)|views]] that map the structure of the database.

Oracle databases store information here about the logical and physical structure of the database. The data dictionary contains information such as:
* user information, such as user privileges
* integrity constraints defined for tables in the database
* names and datatypes of all columns in database tables
* information on space allocated and used for schema objects

The Oracle instance frequently accesses the data dictionary in order to [[parsing|parse]] SQL statements. The operation of Oracle depends on ready access to the data dictionary: performance bottlenecks in the data dictionary affect all Oracle users. Because of this, database administrators should make sure that the data dictionary cache&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-class-programme.com/Oracle-Architecture-2.asp |title=Oracle Architecture, data dictionary cache |publisher=World-class-programme.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; has sufficient capacity to cache this data. Without enough memory for the data-dictionary cache, users see a severe performance degradation. Allocating sufficient memory to the shared pool where the data dictionary cache resides precludes these particular performance problem.

====Program Global Area====
The Program Global Area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-class-programme.com/Oracle-Architecture-2.asp |title=Oracle architecture, Program Global Area section |publisher=World-class-programme.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/mix.102/b14388/gloss-p.htm#index-PGA PGA Definition], Oracle Database Master Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; or PGA memory-area of an Oracle instance contains data and control-information for Oracle's server-processes.

The size and content of the PGA depends on the Oracle-server options installed. This area consists of the following components:
* stack-space: the memory that holds the session's variables, arrays, and so on.
* session-information: unless using the multithreaded server, the instance stores its session-information in the PGA. (In a multithreaded server, the session-information goes in the SGA.)
* private SQL-area: an area which holds information such as bind-variables and runtime-buffers.
* sorting area: an area in the PGA which holds information on sorts, hash-joins, etc.

====Dynamic performance views====
The dynamic performance views (also known as &quot;fixed views&quot;) within an Oracle database present information from virtual tables (X$ tables&lt;ref&gt;

Database users can access the V$ views (named after the prefix of their synonyms) to obtain information on database structures and performance.

===Process architectures===
====Oracle processes====
The Oracle RDBMS typically relies on a group of processes running simultaneously in the [[background process|background]] and interacting to monitor and expedite database operations. Typical operating environments might include some of the following individual processes (shown along with their abbreviated nomenclature):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/process.htm#i16977 |title=Oracle Process architecture concepts |publisher=Download.oracle.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle Database terminology distinguishes different [[computer science|computer-science]] terms in describing how end-users interact with the database:
* user [[process (computing)|processes]] involve the invocation of application software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/process.htm#sthref1481 | title= Process Architecture | accessdate= 2008-08-13 | last= Cyran | first= Michele | coauthors= Paul Lane | date = | year= 2005 | month = | work= Oracle Database Concepts | publisher= Oracle Corporation | quote= When a user runs an application program (such as a Pro*C program) or an Oracle tool (such as Enterprise Manager or SQL*Plus), Oracle creates a user process to run the user's application. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurrency and locking===
Oracle databases control simultaneous access to data resources with [[lock (computer science)|locks]] (alternatively documented as &quot;enqueues&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Immanuel | last = Chan | coauthors = | title = Glossary | url = http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28274/glossary.htm?type=popup#sthref1649 | archiveurl = | work = Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide 11g Release 1 (11.1) | publisher = Oracle Corporation | date = | year = 2008 | month = July | archivedate = | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | quote = enqueue[:] This is another term for a lock. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
).

Database administrators control many of the tunable variations in an Oracle instance by means of values in a parameter file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Richard | last = Strohm | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = et al. | title = Parameter Files | url = http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/intro.htm#sthref23 | archiveurl = | work = Oracle Database Concepts 11g Release 1 (11.1) | publisher = Oracle Corporation | location = | page = | pages = | doi = | date = | month = October | year = 2008 | archivedate = | accessdate = 2009-07-14 | quote = Parameter files contain a list of configuration parameters for that instance and database. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Corporate/technical timeline===
* 1977: [[Larry Ellison]] and friends founded Software Development Laboratories.
* 1979: SDL changed its company-name to &quot;Relational Software, Inc.&quot; (RSI) and introduced its product Oracle V2 as an early commercially available relational database system. The version did not support [[database transaction|transactions]], but implemented the basic [[SQL]] functionality of [[query language|queries]] and [[join (SQL)|joins]]. (RSI never released a version 1 - instead calling the first version ''version 2'' as a [[marketing strategy|marketing gimmick]].)&lt;ref&gt;As Larry Ellison said in an Oracle OpenWorld keynote [http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9814858-7.html presentation] on 11 November 2007: &quot;Who'd buy a version 1.0 from four guys in California?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1982: RSI in its turn changed its name, becoming known as &quot;[[Oracle Corporation]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/07-may/p27anniv_timeline.pdf Oracle.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to align itself more closely with its flagship product.
* 1983: The company released Oracle version 3, which it had re-written using the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and which supported &lt;code&gt;[[Commit (data management)|COMMIT]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[Rollback (data management)|ROLLBACK]]&lt;/code&gt; functionality for transactions. Version 3 extended platform support from the existing [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[VAX/VMS]] systems to include [[Unix]] environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;
* 1984: Oracle Corporation released Oracle version 4, which supported [[consistency model|read-consistency]].
* 1985: Oracle Corporation released Oracle version 5, which supported the [[clientâserver model]]âa sign of networks becoming more widely available in the mid-1980s.
* 1986: Oracle version 5.1 started supporting [[distributed computing|distributed]] queries.
* 1988: Oracle RDBMS version 6 came out with support for [[PL/SQL]] embedded within [[Oracle Forms]] v3 (version 6 could not store PL/SQL in the database proper), row-level [[lock (computer science)|locking]] and hot [[backup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/07-may/p27anniv_timeline.pdf Oracle.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1989: Oracle Corporation entered the [[application software|application products]] market and developed its [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] product, (later to become part of the [[Oracle E-Business Suite]]), based on the Oracle relational database.
* 1990: the release of [[Oracle Applications]] release 8&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;
* 1992: Oracle version 7 appeared with support for [[referential integrity]], [[stored procedure]]s and [[database trigger|triggers]].
* 1997: Oracle Corporation released version 8, which supported [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] development and [[multimedia]] applications.
* 1999: The release of Oracle8''i'' aimed to provide a database inter-operating better with the [[Internet]] (the ''i'' in the name stands for &quot;Internet&quot;). The Oracle8''i'' database incorporated a native [[Java Virtual Machine|Java virtual machine]] ([[Oracle JVM]], also known as &quot;Aurora&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

===Version numbering===
Oracle products follow a custom release numbering and naming convention. With the Oracle RDBMS 10''g'' release, Oracle Corporation began using the &quot;10''g''&quot; label in all versions of its major products, although some sources refer to Oracle Applications Release 11''i'' as Oracle 11''i''.{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} The suffixes &quot;i&quot; and &quot;g&quot; do not actually represent a low-order part of the version number, as letters typically represent in software industry version numbering;  that is, there is no predecessor version of Oracle 10''g'' called Oracle 10''f''. Instead, the letters stand for &quot;internet&quot; and &quot;grid&quot;, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Consequently many simply drop the &quot;g&quot; or &quot;i&quot; suffix when referring to specific versions of an Oracle product.

Major database-related products and some of their versions include:
* [[Oracle Application Server]] 10''g'' (also known as &quot;Oracle AS 10''g''&quot;): a [[middleware]] product;
* [[Oracle Applications]] Release 11''i'' (aka Oracle e-Business Suite, Oracle Financials or Oracle 11i): a [[software suite|suite]] of [[business]] applications;
* [[Oracle Developer Suite]] 10''g'' (9.0.4);
* [[JDeveloper|Oracle JDeveloper]] 10''g'': a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[integrated development environment]];

Since version 5, Oracle's [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] release numbering has used the following codes:
* Oracle v5
* Oracle v6
* Oracle7: 7.0.16â7.3.4
* Oracle8 Database: 8.0.3â8.0.6
* Oracle8''i'' Database Release 1: 8.1.5.0â8.1.5.1
* Oracle8''i'' Database Release 2: 8.1.6.0â8.1.6.3
* Oracle8''i'' Database Release 3: 8.1.7.0â8.1.7.4
* Oracle9''i'' Database Release 1: 9.0.1.0â9.0.1.5 ([[patch (computing)|patchset]] {{As of|2003|alt=as of December 2003}})
* Oracle9''i'' Database Release 2: 9.2.0.1â9.2.0.8 (patchset {{As of|2007|alt=as of April 2007}})
* Oracle Database 10''g'' Release 1: 10.1.0.2â10.1.0.5 (patchset {{As of|2006|alt=as of February 2006}})
* Oracle Database 10''g'' Release 2: 10.2.0.1â10.2.0.5 (patchset {{As of|2010|alt=as of April 2010}})
* Oracle Database 11''g'' Release 1: 11.1.0.6â11.1.0.7 (patchset {{As of|2008|alt=as of September 2008}})
* Oracle Database 11''g'' Release 2: 11.2.0.1â11.2.0.3 (patchset {{As of|2011|alt=as of September 2011}})

The version-numbering syntax within each release follows the pattern: major.maintenance.application-server.component-specific.platform-specific.

For example, &quot;10.2.0.1 for 64-bit Solaris&quot; means: 10th major version of Oracle, maintenance level 2, Oracle Application Server (OracleAS) 0, level 1 for Solaris 64-bit.

The ''Oracle Administrator's Guide'' offers further information on Oracle release numbers.

==Marketing editions==
Over and above the different versions of the Oracle database management software developed over time, Oracle Corporation subdivides its product into varying &quot;editions&quot; - apparently for marketing and license-tracking reasons. (Do not confuse the marketing &quot;editions&quot; with the internal virtual versioning &quot;editions&quot; introduced with Oracle 11.2&lt;ref&gt;

===Suites===
In addition to its [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]], Oracle Corporation has released several related suites of tools and applications relating to implementations of Oracle databases. For example:
* [[Oracle Application Server]], a J2EE-based [[application server]], aids in developing and deploying applications which utilise [[Internet]] technologies and a browser.
* [[Oracle Collaboration Suite]] contains messaging, groupware and collaboration applications.
* [[Oracle Developer Suite]] contains software development tools, including [[JDeveloper]].
* [[Oracle E-Business Suite]] collects together applications for [[enterprise resource planning]] (including [[Oracle Financials]]), [[customer relationship management]] and [[human resources]] management ([[Oracle HR]]).
* [[Oracle Enterprise Manager]] (OEM) used by [[database administrator]]s (DBAs) to manage the DBMS, and {{As of|2007|alt= recently}} in version 10''g'', a web-based rewrite of OEM called &quot;Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control&quot;.

===Database &quot;features&quot;===
Apart from the clearly defined database options, Oracle databases may include many semi-autonomous software sub-systems, which Oracle Corporation sometimes refers to as &quot;features&quot; in a sense subtly different from the normal usage of the word. For example, [[Oracle Data Guard]] counts officially as a &quot;feature&quot;, but the command-stack within SQL*Plus, though a usability feature, does not appear in the list of &quot;features&quot; in [http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/license.102/b14199/editions.htm#CJACGHEB Oracle's list].{{Or|date=December 2009}} Such &quot;features&quot; may include (for example):

===Other databases marketed by Oracle Corporation===
By acquiring other technology in the database field, Oracle Corporation has taken over:
* [[TimesTen]], a memory-resident database that can cache transactions and synchronize data with a centralized Oracle database server. It functions as a [[real-time computing|real-time]] infrastructure software product intended for the management of low-[[lag|latency]], high-volume data, of events and of transactions.
* [[BerkeleyDB]], a simple, high-performance, [[Embedded Database|embedded database]]
* [[Oracle Rdb]], a legacy relational database for the [[OpenVMS]] operating system
* [[MySQL]] a relational database purchased as part of its immediate previous owner, [[Sun Microsystems]]

==Use==
The Oracle RDBMS has had a reputation among novice users as difficult to install on Linux systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Oracle Corporation has packaged {{As of|2006|alt=recent}} versions for several popular Linux distributions in an attempt to minimize installation challenges beyond the level of technical expertise required to install a database server.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Official support===
Users who have Oracle support contracts can use Oracle's &quot;My Oracle Support&quot; web site. The &quot;My Oracle Support&quot; site was known as MetaLink until a re-branding exercise completed in October 2010. The support site provides users of Oracle Corporation products with a repository of reported problems, diagnostic scripts and solutions. It also integrates with the provision of support tools, patches and upgrades.

The ''Remote Diagnostic Agent'' or ''RDA''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/global/tr/support/051006_ADVANCEDMETALINK_CUSTOMER.pdf |title=Advanced MetaLink |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; can operate as a command-line diagnostic tool executing a script. The data captured provides an overview of the Oracle Database environment intended for diagnostic and trouble-shooting. Within RDA, the ''HCVE'' (Health Check Validation Engine)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Stephen | last = Rea | author = | authorlink = | title = Upgrading Oracle 9.2.0.6 to 10.2.0.3 on AIX 5.2 | url = http://www.uaex.edu/srea/10gR2_upgrade.txt | archiveurl = | work = | publisher = University of Arkansas | location = | doi = | date = 16 September 2008 | archivedate = | accessdate = 2009-08-11 | quote = Run the PreInstall checklist for Oracle 10.2.0 (Metalink Note 250262.1: RDA 4 - Health Check / Validation Engine Guide): The Health Check Validation Engine (HCVE) rule set for Oracle Database 10''g'' R2 (10.2.0) PreInstall (AIX) is described in: [https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/docs/HCVE_A201DB10R2_aix.htm Oracle.com] }}&lt;/ref&gt; can verify and isolate host system environmental issues that may affect the performance of Oracle software.

===Database-related guidelines===
Oracle Corporation also endorses certain practices and conventions as enhancing the use of its database products. These include:
* [http://search.techrepublic.com.com/search/Oracle+Maximum+Availability+Architecture.html Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA)], guidelines on developing high-availability systems
* [[Optimal Flexible Architecture]] (OFA), blueprints for mapping Oracle-database objects to file-systems

===Oracle Certification Program===
{{Main|Oracle Certification Program}}

The [[Oracle Certification Program]], a [[professional certification]] program, includes the administration of Oracle Databases as one of its main certification paths. It contains three levels:

# Oracle Certified Associate (OCA)
# Oracle Certified Professional (OCP)
# Oracle Certified Master (OCM)

===User groups===
A variety of official (Oracle-sponsored) and unofficial [[Oracle User Group]]s has grown up of users and developers of Oracle databases. They include:
* [[Oracle Technology Network]]
* [[Independent Oracle Users Group]]
* Geographical/regional user groups
* Product-centric user groups
* Industry-centric user groups
* The [[Oak Table Network]]
* [[Usenet newsgroup]]s

==Market position==
===Competition===
In the market for relational databases, Oracle Database competes against commercial products such as IBM's [[IBM DB2|DB2]] UDB and [[Microsoft SQL Server]]. Oracle and IBM tend to battle for the mid-range database market on UNIX and Linux platforms, while Microsoft dominates the mid-range database market on [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms. However, since they share many of the same customers, Oracle and IBM tend to support each other's products in many middleware and application categories (for example: [[WebSphere]], [[PeopleSoft]], and [[Siebel Systems]] [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]), and IBM's hardware divisions work closely{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} with Oracle on performance-optimizing server-technologies (for example, [[Linux on zSeries]]). The two companies have a relationship perhaps{{Or|date=February 2010}} best described as &quot;[[coopetition]]&quot;. Niche commercial competitors include [[Teradata]] (in data warehousing and business intelligence), Software AG's [[ADABAS]], [[Sybase]], and IBM's [[Informix]], among many others.

In 2007, competition with [[SAP AG]] occasioned litigation from Oracle Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirek.prim.hu/cikk/61917/ About the case] in Hungarian&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, the Oracle database products compete against such [[open-source software]] relational database systems as [[PostgreSQL]], [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]], and [[MySQL]]. Oracle acquired [[Innobase]], supplier of the [[InnoDB]] codebase to MySQL, in part to compete better against open source alternatives, and acquired [[Sun Microsystems]], owner of MySQL, in 2010. Database products licensed as open source are, by the legal terms of the [[Open Source Definition]], free to distribute and free of royalty or other licensing fees.

===Pricing===
Oracle Corporation offers term licensing for all Oracle products. It bases the list price for a term-license on a specific percentage of the perpetual license price. Prospective purchasers can obtain licenses based either on the number of processors in their target server machines or on the [[Per-seat license|number of potential seats]] (&quot;named users&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;

As computers running Oracle often have eight or more processors, the software price can rise into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The [[total cost of ownership]] often exceeds this, as large Oracle installations usually require experienced and trained [[database administrator]]s to do the set-up properly. Because of the product's large installed base and available training courses, Oracle specialists in some areas have become a more abundant resource than those for more exotic databases. Oracle frequently provides special training offers for database-administrators.

On Linux, Oracle's ''certified configurations'' include Oracle's own [[Oracle Linux]] and other commercial [[Linux distributions]] ([[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] 3, 4 and 5, [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server|SuSE SLES]] 8, 9 and 10, [[Asianux]]) which can cost in a range from a few hundred to a few thousand USD per year (depending on processor architecture and the support package purchased).

The Oracle database system can also install and run on freely available Linux distributions such as the Red Hat-based CentOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Installing+Oracle+on+CentOS |title=Installation centos; official Oracle Wiki |publisher=Wiki.oracle.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Debian-based systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Installing+Oracle+on+Debian+%2F+Kubuntu+%2F+Ubuntu |title=Installation on Debian-based systems; official Oracle Wiki |publisher=Wiki.oracle.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
