'''La CaÃ±ada Flintridge''' is a small and affluent city in [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States whose population at the 2010 census was 20,246, down from 20,318 at the 2000 census. According to ''Forbes'', as of 2010, La CaÃ±ada Flintridge ranks as the 143rd most expensive U.S. city to live in, with a median home price of $1,321,367.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/09/27/most-expensive-zip-codes-2010-lifestyle-real-estate-zip-codes-10-rank.html|title=Most Expensive ZIP Codes|accessdate=2010-10-17 | work=Forbes|first=Francesca|last=Levy|date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation==
Part of the name for La CaÃ±ada Flintridge comes from the Spanish word ''caÃ±ada'', meaning ''canyon, gorge, ravine''.  In Spanish, this has a [[tilde]] ''([[Ã±]])'' and is pronounced &quot;canyada&quot; {{IPA-es|kaËÉ²aÃ°a|}}; the English pronunciation is {{IPA-en|kÉnËjÉËdÉ|}}. &quot;Flintridge&quot; is simply pronounced as the two English words &quot;flint&quot; and &quot;ridge&quot;, but does not refer to an outcropping ridge of flint (see history section). The name has nothing to do with the country Canada (whose name derives from the St. Lawrence Iroquois word for &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;).

==Geography==
La CaÃ±ada Flintridge is located at {{Coord|34|12|22|N|118|11|58|W|city}} (34.206047, -118.199499).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.6|sqmi|km2}}, over 99% of it land.

The city is situated in the far western end of the [[San Gabriel Valley]]. It is nestled between the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] and [[Angeles National Forest]] on the north, and the San Rafael Hills on the south.  Most of the city drains southeastward toward [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]], but the western part of the city (generally west of Alta Canyada Road) drains southward toward [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] via Verdugo Canyon.  Both drainages join the [[Los Angeles River]] north of downtown Los Angeles.

La CaÃ±ada Flintridge varies in [[elevation]] from about 970 feet (295 m) just below Devil's Gate Dam in the Arroyo Seco to about 2400 feet (730 m) at the highest neighborhood, along the mountain front east of Pickens Canyon, at the upper end of Ocean View Blvd.  The city limits extend into the San Gabriel Mountains and reach 3440 feet (1050 m) along Mount Lukens Road, which follows the crest line well above the developed city.

The city is home to [[Descanso Gardens]] and NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

==Weather==
The climate of La CaÃ±ada Flintridge is typical of a [[Southern California]] inland valley, with mild winters and hot summers.  Spring often has hazy days, in contrast to the more persistently clear weather of fall.  On average, the warmest month is August with high temperatures (F) in the low 90s and lows in the low 60s.  December and January are the coolest months with typical highs in the high 60s (F) and lows in the mid-40s.  Rainfall occurs mostly during winter, averaging about 22&amp;nbsp;inches annually.  Rainfall is rare in summer.  The moderating influence of the ocean (22 miles, 35&amp;nbsp;km, away) is limited due to the city's location inland from the intervening [[Santa Monica Mountains]] and the [[Verdugo Mountains]] and San Rafael Hills.  Consequently, summers are generally hotter and winters often cooler than in coastal parts of metropolitan Los Angeles if winds are calm or blowing gently offshore.  Occasional strong offshore winds, known as [[Santa Ana winds]], can bring particularly hot air in summer and fall as air from the deserts plateaus crosses the mountains and descends, thus warming further by [[adiabatic]] heating.  Summer and early fall temperatures are substantially cooler if the prevailing wind is persistently onshore.  Occasionally during a winter storm, the upper elevations of the city may see trace amounts of snow.  The small ski resorts [[Mountain High]], [[Mount Baldy]], and [[Mount Waterman]] are located about 30 miles to the northeast.  In August 2009, the city came under threat by the [[August 2009 California wildfires|Station Fire]].

==History==
During the Spanish era, the area was known as ''Rancho La CaÃ±ada.''

Prior to the city's incorporation in 1976, the area consisted of two distinct communities, La CaÃ±ada and Flintridge (the latter named after developer and United States Senator [[Frank P. Flint]]). Flintridge comprises the southern part of the city, covering the northern flank of the San Rafael Hills, but more generally including most areas south of Foothill Blvd.  The eastern part of the city, even north of Foothill Blvd., was also originally considered Flintridge and is still home to the Flintridge Riding Club and [[Flintridge Preparatory School]].  Reference to the entire city is often shortened to just 'La CaÃ±ada' but seldom to just 'Flintridge'.  The full city name specifically does not have a hyphen in it, to illustrate unity between the communities that were once separately known as La CaÃ±ada and Flintridge.

La CaÃ±ada Flintridge had the longest city name in California with 18 letters until the year 2000, when the title was ceded to [[Rancho Santa Margarita, California|Rancho Santa Margarita]].

On September 13, 2010, the California Department of Education announced that 2010 California Standards Tests (CSTs) results indicate that the La CaÃ±ada Unified School District earned the second highest Academic Performance Index (API) score in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shortall |first=Andrew |url=http://www.lacanadaonline.com/news/tn-vsl-api-20100915,0,6632555.story |title=Local schools still in state's top 2 |publisher=Lacanadaonline.com |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The API reflects a district's performance level, based on the results of statewide testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs023/1011237654128/archive/1103684721756.html |title=San Marino State's Premier Unified School District for 7th Consecutive Year |publisher=Archive.constantcontact.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district has three public elementary schools that serve grades K-6: La CaÃ±ada Elementary, Palm Crest Elementary, and [[Paradise Canyon Elementary School]]. The public high school, [[La CaÃ±ada High School]], which also serves as a middle school (grades 7-8), is a 1993 and 2004 [[Blue Ribbon School]].  [[La CaÃ±ada High School]] is currently ranked by the U.S. News and World Report as the 80th best high school in the country, 23rd best public high school in the country, 15th best high school in California, 5th best public high school in California, and best public high school in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/high-schools/2007/11/29/gold-medal-schools.html |title=Gold Medal Schools - US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small portion of the city is served by the [[Glendale Unified School District]], with La CaÃ±ada Flintridge students attending Mountain Avenue Elementary School (a 2005 [[Blue Ribbon School]]), Rosemont Middle School, [[Clark Magnet High School]] (a 2005 [[California Distinguished School]]), and [[Crescenta Valley High School]] (a 2005 [[California Distinguished School]]).

==Angeles Crest Highway Controversy==
On September 5, 2008, a big rig carrying 78,000 pounds of onions lost its brakes on [[Angeles Crest Highway]]. It entered a driveway at Hill Street Cafe, crashed into a wall, a garbage bin, a tree and six vehicles before coming to rest in the parking lot. James Bines, 43, of [[Florida]] and his passenger Willy Robinson, had been hauling a full load of onions through the high desert area in the 18-wheeler. They traveled over Angeles Crest Highway because, Bines said, he had received directions from his [[global positioning system]] that the highway, [[California State Route 2|State Route 2]], was the most direct route from there to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacanadaonline.com/articles/2008/09/05/news/doc48c1a55fa4eeb907483701.txt |title=One injured in runaway big rig crash |work=La Canada Valley Sun |publisher=Lacanadaonline.com |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktla.com/landing_topstories/?Deadly-Crash-Runaway-Big-Rig-Slams-into-=1&amp;blockID=255846&amp;feedID=1198 |title=News |publisher=ktla.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2009, a similar incident occurred at roughly the same location. A car carrier carrying 3 cars heading southbound on Angeles Crest Highway shortly before 6 p.m. lost its brakes, causing a multiple vehicle accident that resulted in two fatalities and 12 injuries, three of them critical. Angel Jorge Posca, 58, and his 12-year-old daughter Angelina, both of [[Palmdale]], had just exited the eastbound [[Foothill Freeway]] at Angeles Crest Highway in their red [[Ford]] Escort and were starting to turn north on the highway to return to Palmdale when the semi-truck struck their vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacanadaonline.com/articles/2009/04/02/news/doc49d423d77c878292022527.txt |title=Collision leaves two dead in LCF |work=La Canada Valley Sun |publisher=Lacanadaonline.com |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene has become all-too-familiar to La CaÃ±ada residents, business owners and city officials: a vehicle loses its brakes or has some other mechanical failure while traveling southbound on Angeles Crest Highway and crashes into the route's terminus on [[Foothill Boulevard]] in the heart of the city's commercial district. Articles detailing several such incidents go back to at least 1951.

A bill that bans heavy trucks with three or more axles from driving on Angeles Crest highway was signed into law by Gov. Arnold  Schwarzenegger on August 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news
