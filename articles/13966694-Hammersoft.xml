The '''Buffalo Bulls football''' program is the intercollegiate [[American football]] team for the [[University at Buffalo]] located in the U.S. state of [[New York]]. The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] level in the Football Bowl Subdivision and is a member of the [[Mid-American Conference]]. Buffalo's first football team was fielded in 1894. The team plays its home games at the 31,000 seat [[University at Buffalo Stadium|UB Stadium]] on University at Buffalo's north campus in [[Amherst, New York]]. The team's main rival are the [[Temple Owls|Temple Owls football]]. The Bulls are coached by [[Jeff Quinn (American football)|Jeff Quinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/258/story/900436.html|publisher=[[Buffalo News]]|date=December 20, 2009|title=Cincinnati's Quinn is new UB football coach |accessdate=2009-12-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
UB's first run with football started in 1894 and lasted until 1970, when the football program was suspended due to the student body's vote to stop funding the program. The football program was reintroduced in 1977. When reintroduced, the team played in Division III level football until 1992. In 1993, the school made the jump to Division I-AA. In 1999, the Bulls moved up again to Division I-A Bowl Subdivision level football.

===The early years: 1894â1903===
In 1894, UB established an [[college athletics|athletics]] association and fourteen UB Medical students formed the first UB football team&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubbullrun.com/2010/05/ub-football-101.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This team played until 1903 with a record of 28-7-13. The team managed this despite lacking a coach for all but two of those years. In 1897, [[C. W. Dibble]] coached UB to a perfect 7-0-0 record and in 1903, [[Ray Turnbull (football coach)|Ray Turnbull]] led the UB team to a 3-3 record. After the 1903 season, UB would not again put a team on the field until 1915.

===The UB Bisons: 1915â1930===
In 1915, UB re-established the football program and instituted men's basketball. Both teams were named the 'Bisons' and used as their logo a caricature of a male [[American bison]], often outfitted in a UB jersey. [[Frank Pleasant]] was called on to coach the football team but was replaced the following season after a 3-3 record. Art Powell would take over in 1916 and coach the team for six seasons (13-22-5). UB would go through two coaches in a span of two years - [[James Batterson|Jim Batterson]] in [[1922 college football season|1922]] and [[James Bond (football coach)|James Bond]] in [[1923 college football season|1923]] - before [[Russell Carrick|Russ Carrick]] would take over, serving five seasons despite winning only five games (while losing 30 and garnering two ties). The team would last be known as the Bisons under the command of [[Jay &quot;Biffy&quot; Lee]], who coached for two seasons (until [[1930 college football season|1930]]), leading UB to a 8-7 record.

===Welcome the Bulls: 1930â1942===
In 1931, the University changed its mascot to the Bulls in order to distinguish UB from professional teams in the Queen City. The Bulls played every year until the outbreak of World War II mainly under the coaching guidance of Jim Peelle who was at the helm from [[1935 college football season|1935]]-[[1942 college football season|1942]] and would lead the Bulls to a 38-34-1 record including a 6-2 season in 1942.

===Post-World War II: 1946â1954===
After World War II, UB again took to the grid-iron under [[Jim Peelle]], who led UB in two impressive seasons of 7-2 ([[1946 college football season|1946]]) and 8-1 ([[1947 college football season|1947]]), but were not selected to a bowl in either season. The program was next taken over by [[Frank Clair]], who coached for two seasons, leaving with an impressive mark of 12-4-1. The following season represented one of the low points for UB when, under the guidance of coach [[Frtiz Febel]], UB won only four games in three years with an overall record of 4-19-1.

===Offenhamer era: 1955-1965===
If the Febel season can be seen as one of the low points in UB football history, then [[Dick Offenhamer]] brought in UB's most successful era when from [[1955 college football season|1955]] to [[1965 college football season|1965]], he would coach UB to an impressive 58-37-5 record.  In [[1958 college football season|1958]], the football team won the [[Lambert Cup]], emblematic of supremacy in Eastern U.S. small-college football. That led to the team's first bowl invitation, to the [[Capital One Bowl|Tangerine Bowl]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] against [[Florida State University]].  But the Bulls would be allowed to participate only if back-up [[defensive end]] [[Mike Wilson]] and starting halfback [[Willie R. Evans (running back)|Willie Evans]], who were black, did not play.  The team stood behind the two, and refused the bowl offer. The team was profiled on [[ESPN]]'s [[Outside the Lines]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Neel, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=buffalo58 &quot;All or Nothing&quot;], [[ESPN.com]], retrieved November 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo would not be invited to or be bowl-eligible for another 50 years.

Several UB football stars from the Offenhamer years went on to play professional football, including [[quarterback]] [[John Stofa]] with the [[American Football League]]'s [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and [[defensive lineman]] [[Gerry Philbin]] with the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[New York Jets]]. Philbin is a member of the AFL Hall of Fame and the [[All-time All-AFL Team]]. Philbin and UB's [[Willie Ross (American football)|Willie Ross]] were the first two UB graduates to play on professional football championship teams: Ross with the [[1964 AFL season|1964]] AFL Champion [[Buffalo Bills]]; and Philbin with the [[1968 AFL season|1968]] AFL Champion [[New York Jets]], who went on to win [[Super Bowl III]].  They have been followed by [[Ramon Guzman]] who played on two [[Grey Cup]] Championship teams with the [[Montreal Alouettes]] and [[James Starks]] with the [[Super Bowl XLV]] champion [[Green Bay Packers]].

===Out with a whimper: 1965-1970===
Following the departure of Offenhamer in [[1965 college football season|1965]], UB would last only five more years before suspending football in 1970. There was some success under coach [[Doc Urich]], who led UB to an 18-12 record over three years, but declining performance under his successor, [[Bob Deming]] ([[1969 college football season|1969]]-[[1970 college football season|1970]]) and financial issues would cause UB to suspend its football program.  The main reason that football was dropped was that the student body voted to stop funding the team.  At the time athletics at UB were fully funded by student fees.  It would be seven years until UB would again take the field.

===Division III football: 1977-1992===
In [[1977 college football season|1977]] UB began playing football at the [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III level]] under Coach [[Bill Dando]], who would be the Bulls' longest serving coach, lasting thirteen years. UB had moderate success during his tenure, and he retired after the 1989 season. [[Sam Sanders]] would take over, but lasted only two seasons. His coaching career ended because of medical issues and [[Jim Ward (football coach)|Jim Ward]] was promoted because of a New York State hiring freeze and ushered in UB's return to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] football.

===Division I-AA (FCS): 1993-1998===
UB's return to Division I football started in [[Division I-AA]] (known today as the [[Football Championship Subdivision]]). UB would have only one winning season during their time in I-AA. Under Coach [[Craig Cirbus]], UB would go 8-3 in [[1996 college football season|1996]]. This would be UB's last season at or above .500 for a dozen years. 

===1999-2005: Return to Division I-A (Football Bowl Subdivision)===
[[Image:Drew Willy.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Drew Willy]] scrambles against Bowling Green in 2005.]]
In [[1999 college football season|1999]] UB joined the Mid-American Conference in [[Division I-A]] ([[Football Bowl Subdivision]]) football. They retained their head coach from their I-AA seasons, [[Craig Cirbus]].  After a few years of dismal results, the team hired [[Jim Hofher]] a former head coach at Division I-AA [[Cornell Big Red|Cornell University]] to be the head coach.  However, Hofher's teams were marked by poor discipline and lack of effort, and won only 8 games during his five seasons at UB.  Buffalo won only 10 games and lost 69 during this seven-year period, the second-worst record in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] during that time. A [[2002 college football season|2002]] win on the road over [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] remains their only win against a [[BCS conference|BCS]] team.

===2006-2009: Turner Gill era===
In early December 2005, Hofher was replaced by [[Green Bay Packers]] assistant coach and former [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate [[Turner Gill]].  The former [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] [[quarterback]] led the program in a remarkable turnaround, helping the team to a 5-7 (5-3 MAC East divisional co-champions) in [[2007 college football season|2007]], their best season since the school joined the MAC.

On November 21, 2008, the Buffalo Bulls won their first outright MAC Eastern Division Championship, sealing the win with a thrilling 2-OT victory over [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green]], 40-34. Down 27-7 at the beginning of the 4th quarter, the Bulls stormed back to tie the game at 27 and force it into overtime. In the second OT, running back James Starks ran 25 yards on the first play for a touchdown and a Bulls win.  The quarterback coach for Bowling Green that day was former UB head coach Jim Hofher.

Following a loss to [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] that broke a five-game winning streak for Buffalo, the Bulls entered the conference title game at 7-5, while MAC West champion [[Ball State Cardinals football|Ball State]] was an unblemished 12-0. However, on December 5, at [[Ford Field]] in Detroit, Buffalo's defense returned two fumbles for touchdowns and the Bulls defeated the Cardinals, 42-24, to become Mid-American Conference champions for 2008.  Their successful season earned the Bulls an invitation to the [[International Bowl]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] to face [[Connecticut Huskies#Football|Connecticut]].  The Bulls went on to lose [[2009 International Bowl|that game]] to UConn by a score of 38-20.

2009 would not be as successful as Starks was lost before the season even started to a shoulder injury.  The offense also struggled without four-year starting quarterback [[Drew Willy]] as new quarterback Zach Maynard had an up-and-down season as UB finished 5-7. After the season, Gill left to become head coach of [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]].

===2010-Present: Jeff Quinn era===
[[File:Screen shot 2011-08-06 at 7.13.33 PM.png|thumb|300px|Quarterback Jerry Davis in 2010]]
On December 20, 2009, it was first reported that [[Jeff Quinn (American football)|Jeff Quinn]] would be the new head coach.  He took over after coaching [[2009 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]] in the [[2010 Sugar Bowl]]. In Quinn's first season as coach, he was unable to build upon Gill's success as UB finished the [[2010 Buffalo Bulls football team|season]] 2-10.
