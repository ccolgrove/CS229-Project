'''WBOC-DT2''' is the [[Fox Network|Fox]]-affiliated [[television station]] for the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] of [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]]. It is a second [[digital subchannel]] of [[CBS]] affiliate [[WBOC-TV]] locally owned by [[Draper Holdings Business Trust]]. Over-the-air, the station broadcasts a [[SDTV|standard definition]] digital signal on [[UHF]] channel 21.2 from a transmitter in the Ralphs section of [[Laurel, Delaware]]. Unlike most digital subchannels, WBOC-DT2 is one of a few identifying with its physical digital channel (21.2) rather than a traditional [[virtual channel]] (16.2) through [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]]. Therefore, the station is known on-air as '''''Fox 21 Delmarva'''''. 

It can also be seen on [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[Comcast]] channel 5 as well as [[DirecTV]] channel 17. There is a [[high-definition television|high definition]] feed offered on Comcast digital channel 213 and Verizon FiOS digital channel 505. WBOC-DT2's parent station has studios on North Salisbury Boulevard ([[U.S._Route_13_Business_(Salisbury,_Maryland)#Salisbury.2C_MD_Business_Route|U.S. 13 Bus]]/[[Ocean Highway]]) in [[Salisbury, Maryland]]. [[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WBOC-DT2 includes: ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', and ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]''. 

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2011}} 
In March 2003, WBOC launched this subchannel to be the area's [[UPN]] affiliate known on-air as &quot;UPN 21 Total TV&quot;.  Before then, [[WUTB]] in [[Baltimore]] had been piped in on cable systems on the Maryland side of the market, while [[WPSG]] in [[Philadelphia]] had served the Delaware side. On January 24, 2006, UPN and [[The WB]] announced the two networks would cease broadcasting and merge. The new combined service would be called [[The CW]]. The letters would represent the first initial of corporate parents &quot;C&quot;BS (the parent company of UPN) and the [[Warner Bros.|&quot;W&quot;arner Bros.]] unit of [[Time Warner]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WMDT]] operated and promoted cable-exclusive WB affiliate &quot;[[WMDT-DT2|WBD]]&quot; provided through [[The WB 100+ Station Group|The WB 100+]]. 

It was announced on March 28 WMDT had gained The CW affiliation for the cable channel through similar service [[The CW Plus]]. The station then created a new second digital subchannel to offer access to CW programming for non-cable subscribers. On May 9, WBOC made public this subchannel would become a Fox affiliate beginning August 21, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/about_us/station_history/020309FOX5History WTTG Fox 5 Station History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=4883317 WBOC-TV 16] UPN21 to Become Fox21&lt;/ref&gt; WMDT-DT2 became part of The CW at the network's launch on September 18, 2006.  Before 2006, [[WTTG]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] had served as the Fox affiliate for the Maryland side of the market, while [[WTXF-TV]] in Philadelphia served the Delaware side.

==Newscasts==
When WBOC-DT2 became a Fox affiliate, the main channel began producing local news weeknights at 5 for a half-hour (known as ''WBOC News First at 5 on Fox 21'') and every night at 10 also for thirty minutes (called ''WBOC News at 10 on Fox 21''). Both shows air from a secondary set and feature a separate graphics package. Weekday mornings at 6, this station simulcasts the second hour of the main channel's weekday morning show. However, it is known on WBOC-DT2 as ''Fox 21 Breakfast Bar''. 

On August 26, 2008, WBOC began airing its local newscasts in high definition from a newly-constructed addition to its studios known as the &quot;NewsPlex&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=8803958 WBOC-TV 16] The WBOC NewsPlex&lt;/ref&gt; Since WBOC-DT2 airs in standard definition, its shows can only be seen in HD on Verizon FiOS and Comcast digital systems. In addition to the main facilities in Salisbury, the station operates Delaware bureaus in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] (in the [[Rodney Village, Delaware|Rodney Village]] section on US 13/South Dupont Highway) and [[Milton, Delaware|Milton]] (at The Square).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wboc.com/Global/category.asp?C=50889&amp;nav=menu222_13 WBOC-TV 16] About Us&lt;/ref&gt;
