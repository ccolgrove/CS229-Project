[[Major General]] '''Vijaya Wimalaratne''' [[Rana Wickrama Padakkama|RWP]], [[Rana Sura Padakkama|RSP]], [[Vishista Seva Vibhushanaya|VSV]], [[Uttama Seva Padakkama|USP]], psc, [[Gajaba Regiment|GR]] (In [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]: {{Unicode|à·à·à¶¢à¶º à·à·à¶¸à¶½à¶»à¶­à·à¶±}}) was a [[Sri Lanka]]n army officer and one of the most distinguished generals in Sri Lanka.

==Education==
He was educated at [[Royal College, Colombo]] and joined the [[Sri Lanka Army]] as an [[Officer Cadet]] in August 1962. He commenced his career as an [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] in the [[Army]] on 1 August 1963 on completion of training at the [[Indian Military Academy]], there he was appointed [[Battalion]] [[Cadet]] [[Adjutant]] in his final term .

==Military career==
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Balavegaya 2.JPG|250px|thumb|(L-R) Brig. '''Vijaya Wimalaratne''', Commander of the army Lt.Gen. Cecil Widyarethne, Commander of the Navy [[Vice Admiral]] [[W.W.E.C. Fernando|Clancy Fernando]] and Maj.Gen. Kobbekaduwa during the &quot;Balavegaya 2&quot;.]] --&gt;
He was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Gemunu Watch]], leaving soon after for a jungle warfare course in [[Malaysia]] and on his return was assigned with the task of conducting the jungle warfare phase for Officer Cadets. His competency and application of the subject to the local scenario made the training very interesting. He used to trek the jungles of [[Buttala]], Wellawaya and Ampara in search of training areas and described the bush jungle as âPodi Singho Marangâ. Sometimes he was called âKala Kumarayaâ since the jungle appeared to be his home! He also introduced training on [[Fighting]] in [[Built-up area|Built up Areas]] and anti-terrorist operations to the [[Army]]. Gen. Wimalaratne was also a graduate of the [[British Army Staff College]] at [[Camberley]].

During his colourful career he had the distinction of raising the formidable [[Gajaba Regiment]]. He nurtured, trained and guided the [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] and the [[Men]] and made the battalion an effective fighting unit. The nucleus he created in the battalion became a catalyst and the performance of the Gajaba Battalion later is ample testimony of his leadership and vision. During â[[Vadamarachchi Operation|Op Liberation]]â in 1987 he commanded 3 [[Brigade]] in the first ever two [[Brigade]] operation launched in the history of the Sri Lanka Army. He was holding the appointment of Deputy Security Forces Comd Jaffna. Meticulous planning of operations and attention to detail were his strong points and he taught and guided his staff to achieve the same standards. He played a major role in the rescue of the troops in the Jaffna Fort in 1990 and in the '[[Operation Balavegaya]]' in 1991.

He was bold and daring and whenever an incident occurred in [[Jaffna]] he used to get some troops from his battalion and proceed to the area to assess the situation. On one occasion, some claymores had been exploded on the Idaikkadu road in [[Jaffna]] and with some casualties who needed to be evacuated fast. It was getting dark. Wijaya the Brigade Commander was asked to help.

He asked the [[Sri Lankan Air Force|air force]] who for some reason or another were unable to help especially as the light was fast fading. Wijaya ordered a [[Buffel]] [[armoured personnel carrier]] to go. The driver had been injured and there was no volunteer to drive. Wijaya whose light vehicle driving is questionable took over the 15 ton vehicle and guided by red lights to the rear from the [[Gemunu Watch]] position, drove in pitch dark, picked up the injured men, gave some words of encouragement to the [[Battalion]] commander and drove back virtually through no man's land.

The staff work of Maj Gen Wimalaratne was meticulous. His method of maintaining records and data with accuracy are still being followed. His influence over the staff officers enabled them to learn and progress. He was a hard taskmaster and set high but achievable standards. With his personal guidance and personal touch he was able to obtain the best from his staff.

His final appointment was Commander Security Forces Jaffna. His vision and dedication were a sources of inspiration to others. Planning and execution of operations was his forte and he led upfront. His presence in the front and his leadership were motivating factors which led to his success in operations. He had a firm belief that proper logistical planning is essential for successful operations. Therefore he always ensured that logistic plans were make in detail and that resources were in place prior to launching of operations.

==Death==
On 8 August 1992 as Jaffna Brigade Commander, Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne was accompanied [[Major General]] (posthumously [[Lieutenant General]]) [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]], [[General Officer Commanding]] [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Sector]] and [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] (posthumously Rear Admiral) Mohan Jayamaha, Commander Northern Naval Area were killed when the [[Land Rover]] they were traveling in was destroyed by a [[land mine]] blast. Brigadier Wimalaratne was killed instantly he was posthumously promoted to the rank of [[Major General]]. Seven others were killed in the including Lt. Colonels G.H. Ariyaratne, A. Palipahana, H.R. Stephen, all three battalion commanders and Major N.S. De Alwis, General Kobbekaduwa's [[Aide-de-camp|ADC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.lk/2006/08/06/eyefea6.htm Warriors of our time]&lt;/ref&gt;  

They were planning an offensive code named &quot;Operation Final Countdown&quot; to liberate the northern peninsula from the LTTE, which was to be launched shortly. The final decision was delayed until they could reconnoiter in a particular area to finalise troop movements, which required a visit to Araly point the next day. As they were returning to be taken back to the base by helicopter, the incident occurred. It has been claimed that it was an assignation which had be carried out by the LTTE by [[Jane's Information Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/sentinel/sent000904_6_n.shtml Jane's Sentinel examines the success of the LTTE in resisting the Sri Lankan forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne was married to Manel Wimalaratne and they had a 2 sons&lt;ref&gt;www.kaputa.co./news209&lt;/ref&gt; and daughter. He had 9 brothers in his family.

==Legacy==
Being a well disciplined and dedicated [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] and [[Gentleman]] he expected the same from those serving under him. He was firm, friendly and fair. Those under him responded positively and gave him their wholehearted support since then were inspired by his leadership and had confidence that he had the staying power and courage to ensure that any assignment given to him would be successfully completed. He always made it a point to recognize good performance and place on record by way of commendations for future reference.

Being deployed in operational areas for a long duration he had to sacrifice time with his family. His wife Manel therefore had to bring up the children. Her devotion and support enabled him to carry on with the campaign to eradicate terrorism and bring about peace to [[Sri Lanka]].

The [[Sri Lankan Army]] remembers Maj Gen Vijaya Wimalaratne today as one of its greatest warriors and respected [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] who laid down his life whilst fighting in a campaign to safeguard his country, [[Sri Lanka]] and its people.
