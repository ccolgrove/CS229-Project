'''Witchcraft,''' in historical, [[Anthropology|anthropological]], [[religious]], and [[mythological]] contexts, is the alleged use of [[supernatural]] or [[magical]] powers. A '''witch''' (from Old English [[witch (etymology)|''wicca'' masculine, ''wicce'' feminine]]) is a practitioner of witchcraft. Historically, it was widely believed in [[early modern period|early modern]] Christian Europe that witches were in league with the [[Devil]] and used their powers to harm people and property. Particularly, since the mid-20th century, &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; witchcraft are sometimes distinguished, the latter often involving healing. The concept of witchcraft as harmful is normally treated as a cultural ideology, a means of explaining human misfortune by blaming it either on a supernatural entity or a known person in the community.&lt;ref&gt;PÃ³cs 1999, pp. 9â12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beliefs in witchcraft, and resulting [[witch-hunt]]s, are both found in many cultures worldwide, today mostly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (e.g., in the [[witch smeller]]s in [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] culture), and historically notably in [[Early modern period|Early Modern Europe]] of the 14th to 18th century, where witchcraft came to be seen as a vast diabolical conspiracy against Christianity, and accusations of witchcraft led to [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe|large-scale witch-hunts]], especially in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft Witchcraft]&quot;. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[witch-cult hypothesis]]&quot;, a controversial theory that [[European witchcraft]] was a suppressed pagan religion, was popular in the 19th and 20th centuries. Since the mid-20th century, [[contemporary Witchcraft|Witchcraft]] has become the self-designation of a branch of [[neopaganism]], especially in the [[Wicca]] tradition following [[Gerald Gardner]], who claimed a religious tradition of ''Witchcraft'' with pre-Christian roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45â47, 84â5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of witchcraft ==
In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, a &quot;witch&quot; differs from a sorcerer in that they do not use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and the person may be unaware that they are a &quot;witch&quot;, or may have been convinced of their own evil nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176â9 |year=1975 |isbn=046502131X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |year=1937 |pages=8â9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0198740298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European and British witchcraft, where &quot;witches&quot; could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, and some really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |year=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464â5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0297002201}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in anthropology, European witchcraft is seen by historians as an ideology for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology manifested in diverse ways. Reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref&gt;PÃ³cs 1999 pp. 9â10. The first three categories were proposed by Richard Kieckhefer, the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative sorcery
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs

[[Ãva PÃ³cs]] in turn identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:

* The &quot;neighbourhood witch&quot; or &quot;social witch&quot;: a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The &quot;magical&quot; or &quot;sorcerer&quot; witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The &quot;supernatural&quot; or &quot;night&quot; witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;PÃ³cs 1999 pp. 10â11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Neighbourhood witches&quot; are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of &quot;sorcerer&quot; witches and &quot;supernatural&quot; witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;PÃ³cs 1999 pp. 11â12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demonology ===
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], [[Protestants]], and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch, and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name=&quot;gibbons&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a book-length treatment, see Lara Apps and Andrew Gow, ''Male Witches in Early Modern Europe'', [[Manchester University Press]] (2003), ISBN 0719057094. Conversely, for repeated use of the term &quot;warlock&quot; to refer to a male witch see Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh, 1861; and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' an infamous witch-hunting manual used by both Catholics and Protestants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788, by Britannica Educational Publishing, p.27]&lt;/ref&gt; outlines how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. This book was not given the official Imprimatur of the Catholic Church, which would have made it approved by church authorities.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

=== White witches ===

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|250px|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term &quot;witch&quot; was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. &quot;There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Macfarlane 1970 p. 130; also Appendix 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scott]] noted, &quot;At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scot 1989 V. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51â4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as &quot;witches&quot; in the negative sense. Many English &quot;witches&quot; convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also Alan Macfarlane 1970 p. 127 who notes how &quot;white witches&quot; could later be accused as &quot;black witches&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' (&quot;diviner-healers&quot;) were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: &quot;White versus Black Witchcraft&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;PÃ³cs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3â7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an &quot;other-world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1&quot;&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, &quot;vampires&quot;, or &quot;witches&quot; to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

== Alleged practices ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|''Magic Circle'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886.]]
Practices to which the witchcraft label has historically been applied are those which influence another person's mind, body, or property against his or her will, or which are believed, by the person doing the labelling, to undermine the social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} consider the malefic nature of witchcraft to be a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against his or her will was clearly present in many cultures, as there are traditions in both folk magic and religious magic that have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples can be found in ancient texts, such as those from [[Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]], where malicious magic is believed to have the power to influence the mind, body or possessions, malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people â even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.

=== Spell casting ===
{{Main|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most obvious characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], a &quot;spell&quot; being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantations]]; by the performance of physical [[rituals]]; by the employment of magical [[herbs]] as amulets or potions; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see Luck, Georg, ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736â1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conjuring the dead ===
Strictly speaking, &quot;[[necromancy]]&quot; is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]] â although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The Biblical [[Witch of Endor]] is supposed to have performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ãlfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of witches. Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe which are known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions |url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Early Modern European tradition, witches were stereotypically, though not exclusively, women.&lt;ref name=&quot;gibbons&quot;&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) &quot;Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt&quot; in [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM ''The Pomegranate''] #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill (1992) ''Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions'' Revised Edition. Bridport, Dorset: Prism Press. &quot;Witch&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as &quot;diabolical fantasies&quot; by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of PrÃ¼m]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest Germany were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684,1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) &quot;The Emergence of the Christian Witch&quot; in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle Witches]], commonly involves a [[diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe &quot;[[Sabbath (witchcraft)|the witches' sabbath]]&quot; (performing infernal rites which often parodied the [[Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for bad occurrences. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] until it was reversed in later centuries as the [[witch-hunt]] gained force. Other rulers such as [[Coloman of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.

The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BCâ186BC).

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or [[wise man]]. The term &quot;witch doctor&quot; was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[charmer]]s.)

Such &quot;cunning-folk&quot; did not refer to themselves as witches and objected to the accusation that they were such.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|250px|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645-1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft, thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645-1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692-93. The most famous witchcraft incident in [[British North America]] were these witch trials, which took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. One man who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the &quot;Salem&quot; witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village, Ipswich, Andover, as well as Salem Town, Massachusetts. The best-known trials were conducted by the Court of Oyer and Terminer in 1692 in Salem Town. All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the &quot;Witch of Pungo&quot; was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

Accusations of witchraft and wizardry led to the prosecution of a man in Tennessee as recently as 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Poulsonâs American Daily Advertiser, Volume LX, August 10, 1834, Number 17,057 (From the Nashville (Tenn.)

Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a &quot;conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged.â&lt;ref&gt;Behar,Ruth.

American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, AsunciÃ³n. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an &quot;affirmation of hegemony&quot; for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A.

{{Main|Asian witchcraft}}

==== Ancient Near East ====
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the past. Both in ancient [[Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]] it played a conspicuous part, as existing records plainly show. It will be sufficient to quote a short section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.). It is there prescribed,

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L. W. King translation] (accessed 31 March 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm Newadvent.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|190px|Execution of alleged witches, 1587]]
The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]] uses the words &quot;witch&quot;, &quot;witchcraft&quot;, and &quot;witchcrafts&quot; to translate the [[masoretic text|Masoretic]] ××©×£ (''kashaph'' or ''kesheph'') and ×§×¡× (''qesem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate ÏÎ±ÏÎ¼Î±ÎºÎµÎ¹Î± (''pharmakeia'') in the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[New Testament]] text. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11â12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} (&quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&quot;) thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]]ers in the early [[Modern Age]] (see [[Christian views on witchcraft]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew ''kashaph'', usually translated as &quot;witch&quot; or &quot;sorceress&quot;, is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeia'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scott]], a prominent critic of the witch-trials, translated ''kashaph'', ''pharmakeia'', and their Latin [[Vulgate]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning &quot;poisoner&quot;, and on this basis, claimed that &quot;witch&quot; was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Scot|Scot, Reginald]] (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} ''kashaph'' is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of ''Kashaph'' include ''mutterer'' (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning &quot;herb&quot;, and ''hapaleh'', meaning &quot;using&quot;). The Greek ''pharmakeia'' literally means &quot;herbalist&quot; or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''mageia'' and ''goeteia'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33â35 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415249821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:

{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit which physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on witchcraft}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6), though the overall topic of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed. The word in most New Testament translations is &quot;sorcerer&quot;/&quot;sorcery&quot; rather than &quot;witch&quot;/&quot;witchcraft&quot;.

==== Judaism ====
[[Judaism|Jewish]] law views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in Judaism. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]], according to [[Conservadox Judaism|Traditional Judaism]], it is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. Rabbis of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic. However, some of the Rabbis practiced &quot;magic&quot; themselves. For instance, Rabbah created a person and sent him to Rabbi Zera, and Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Oshaia studied every Sabbath evening together and created a small calf to eat (Sanhedrin 65b). In these cases, the &quot;magic&quot; was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than pagan gods) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Deuteronomy]]/Devarim 18: 9â10) and that witches are to be put to death. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]/Shemot 22:17)

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in the First [[Book of Samuel]], chapter 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic in Islam]] encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulets]] and other magical equipment, [[conjuring]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], [[astrology]], and [[physiognomy]]. Muslims do commonly believe in magic (Sihr) and explicitly forbid its practice. Sihr translates from Arabic as sorcery or black magic. The best known reference to magic in Islam is the [[Sura|Surah]] [[Al-Falaq]] (meaning dawn or daybreak), which is known as a prayer to [[Allah]] to ward off black magic. &lt;blockquote&gt;Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn From the mischief of created things; From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads; From the mischief of those who practise secret arts; And from the mischief of the envious one as he practises envy. (Quran 113:1â5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also according to the Quran: &lt;blockquote&gt;And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of [[Solomon]]. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind sorcery and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut&amp;nbsp;... And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew. (al-Qur'an 2:102)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, whereas performing miracles in Islamic thought and belief is reserved for only Messengers and Prophets, supernatural acts are also believed to be performed by Awliyaa â the spiritually accomplished. Disbelief in the miracles of the Prophets is considered an act of disbelief; belief in the miracles of any given pious individual is not. Neither are regarded as magic, but as signs of Allah at the hands of those close to Him that occur by His will and His alone.

Some Muslim practitioners believe that they may seek the help of the [[Genie|Jinn]] (singularâjinni) in magic. It is a common belief that jinn can possess a human, thus requiring [[Exorcism#Exorcism in Islam|Exorcism]]. Still, the practice of seeking help to the Jinn is prohibited and regarded the same as seeking help to a devil.

The belief in jinn is part of the Muslim faith. [[Imam Muslim]] narrated the Prophet said: &quot;Allah created the angels from light, created the jinn from the pure flame of fire, and Adam from that which was described to you (i.e., the clay.)&quot;.
Also in the Quran, chapter of Jinn: {{quote|And persons from among men used to seek refuge with persons from among the jinn, so they increased them in evil doing.|(The Qur'an) (72:6)}}

To cast off the jinn from the body of the possessed, the &quot;ruqya,&quot; which is from the Prophet's [[sunnah]] is used. The ruqya contains verses of the [[Qur'an]] as well as prayers which are specifically targeted against demons. The knowledge of which verses of the [[Qur'an]] to use in what way is what is considered &quot;magic knowledge&quot;.

There is a [[Hadeeth]] recorded by [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Al-Bukhari]] which narrates that one who has eaten seven dates in the morning will not be adversely affected by magic in the course of that day.

Students of the history of religion have linked several magical practises in Islam with pre-islamic Turkish and East African customs. Most notable of these customs is the [[Zar (religious custom)|Zar Ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;Geister, Magier und Muslime. DÃ¤monenwelt und Geisteraustreibung im Islam. Kornelius Hentschel, Diederichs 1997, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magic and Divination in Early Islam (The Formation of the Classical Islamic World) by Emilie Savage-Smith (Ed.), Ashgate Publishing 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
[[Saudi Arabia]] continues to use the [[death penalty]] for sorcery. In 2006 [[Fawza Falih|Fawza Falih Muhammad Ali]] was condemned to death for practicing witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, &quot;Pleas for condemned Saudi 'witch'&quot;, 14 February 2008 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7244579.stm BBC NEWS]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no legal definition of sorcery in Saudi, but in 2007 an Egyptian pharmacist working there was accused, convicted, and executed. Saudi authorities also pronounced the death penalty on a Lebanese television presenter, [[Ali Sabat]], while he was performing the ''[[hajj]]'' (Islamic pilgrimage) in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8598134.stm | title=Death 'looms for Saudi sorcerer' | date=2010-04-01 | work=BBC News | first=Sebastian | last=Usher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Japan ====
[[File:Blacksmith Munechika, helped by a fox spirit, forging the blade Ko-Gitsune Maru, by Ogata GekkÅ.jpg|thumb|[[Inari Åkami]] and her [[Kitsune|fox]] spirits help the [[blacksmith]] Munechika forge the blade ''kogitsune-maru'' (''Little Fox'') in the late 10th century.]]

In Japanese folklore, the witch can commonly be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan or they also conduct sexual deeds. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51â59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of &quot;The Grateful foxes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml The Grateful Foxes - Japanese foxtales&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide him with many services. The fox can turn invisible and be set out to find any secrets its master desires and it still retains its many powers of illusion which its master will often put to use in order to trick and deceive his enemies. The most feared power the ''kitsune-mochi'' possess is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or &quot;hereditary witches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they will bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

=== Africa ===
The term [[witch doctor]], a common translation for the Zulu ''[[inyanga]]'', has been misconstrued to mean &quot;a healer who uses witchcraft&quot; rather than its original meaning of &quot;one who diagnoses and cures maladies caused by witches&quot;.
[[File:Shona witch doctor (Zimbabwe).jpg|thumb|[[Shona people|Shona]] witchdoctor ([[n'anga]]) in [[Zimbabwe]]]]
In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[thakathi]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as &quot;witch&quot;, and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. He also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as &quot;witch doctor&quot; (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a &quot;witch doctor&quot; is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga'''s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''thakatha'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title=&quot;An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic,&quot; in Rational Magic|year=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=1848880618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past--or present--and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.

{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve].&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcisms]], sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activist strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists. In Christianity Today, (September 2009): http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html. &lt;/ref&gt;. The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis]] snatching) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true Penis theft panic hits city..], Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt; Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has &quot;stolen&quot; a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title=&quot;An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic,&quot; in Rational Magic|year=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=1848880618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Mende (of Sierra Leone), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. &quot;The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft in order to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft&lt;ref&gt;Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria: http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593. &lt;/ref&gt;. Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by &quot;detecting&quot; child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of &quot;exorcisms&quot;, accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In Malawi it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011.

== Neopagan witchcraft ==
{{Main|contemporary witchcraft}}
{{See|Witch-cult hypothesis|Neoshamanism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as &quot;witchcraft&quot; have arisen in the twentieth century, generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and spirituality. They thus fall within the broad category of [[Neopaganism]].

Contemporary witchcraft takes many forms, but often involves the use of divination, magic, and working with the [[classical elements]] and unseen forces such as spirits and the forces of nature. The practice of [[herbalism|herbal]] and [[folk medicine]] and spiritual healing is also common, as are alternative medical and [[New Age]] healing practices.

The first groups of neopagan witchcraft to publicly appear in the 1950s and 1960s, such as [[Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Wicca]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]], operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, ISBN 0759102023.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wicca ===
{{Main|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a pan-European witch-cult originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner]]'s claim in 1954 in ''Witchcraft Today'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=1861631103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=1861631642}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=0709075677}}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large &quot;Eclectic Wiccan&quot; movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205â252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939â1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35â62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed &quot;witches.&quot; They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=== Stregheria ===
{{Main|Stregheria}}

Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia (goddess)|Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] of Christian myth, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon.

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].

=== Feri Tradition ===
{{Main|Feri Tradition}}

The Feri Tradition is a modern witchcraft practice founded by [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor Anderson]] and his wife Cora. It is an ecstatic tradition with strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual expression.

Most practitioners worship three main deities; the Star Goddess, and two divine twins, one of whom is the blue God. They believe that there are three parts to the human soul, a belief taken from the Hawaiian religion of [[Huna (New Thought)|Huna]] as described by [[Max Freedom Long]].
