{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy: Unlimited'''''|FF:U ï½ãã¡ã¤ãã«ãã¡ã³ã¿ã¸ã¼:ã¢ã³ãªããããï½|FF:U ~Fainaru FantajÄ«: Anrimiteddo~}} was an [[anime]] [[television series]] based on [[Square Enix]]'s popular ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' [[computer role-playing game|role-playing game]] [[Media franchise|franchise]].

''Final Fantasy: Unlimited'' incorporates both [[cel animation|2D animation]] and [[3D graphics]], and takes elements from the ''Final Fantasy'' games with quite a few [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter eggs]], some obvious, others obscure. It was licensed for [[North America]] and the [[United Kingdom]] by [[ADV Films]], and 7 volumes of videos were released on [[DVD]]. In 2003, the series soundtrack ''Final Fantasy: Unlimited After 2'' was released. The continuation of the story has also been released in a variety of other media.

==Story==
The original Final Fantasy: Unlimited follows the story of Ai and Yu Hayakawa, two twelve year-old twins who travel into Wonderland, a mysterious parallel dimension, in search of their missing parents. Along the way they meet Lisa Pacifist, a member of the C2 Organization, Kaze, a being of incredible power, and a variety of other characters.

The series is divided into two major sections, defined by the main mention of transport the protagonists are utilizing. The first half of the series see the group using the Interdimensional Train to reach a new world with each episode. In each of the episodes they would emerge to view a new world, confront the inherent dangers of the world, and stave off the latest assault by either the Gaudium Lords, or Omega.

Meanwhile, the story from the antagonist's view is periodically revealed with Earl Tyrant's discussion with his lords. Earl is the embodiment of Chaos, and is seeking the children as they were spawned of Chaos also, and the pieces of a powerful creature known as Omega. Omega is the ultimate destructive force, with its power only rivaled by that of the Unlimiteds; immortal beings of immense power. If he is able to collect these and adsorb them into his body, he will be able to rule Wonderland unchallenged.

The second half of the series see the protagonists join up with the rebel faction, the Comodeen, and board the submarine, Jane, which is bound for Telos, the only place in Wonderland that has a natural deposit of the gravity defying flight water. This substance will allow the airship Silvia to fly, allowing them to reach the Earl's flying fortress.

The series climaxes when the Earl himself makes a move on the Comodeen, destroying Jane and capturing the protagonists. Confronted with Chaos himself, Kaze and Makenshi, the only two surviving Unlimiteds, join forces and destroy it, thus ending its reign of terror over Wonderland.
