He loves Digimon, playing the Digimon card game and drawing up Digimon he made up. He eventually finds a Blue Card among his cards and unknowingly used it to bring Guilmon to life. Soon after, he meets Henry and then Rika, learning that Digimon are mysteriously appearing in their world. At first he's not very good at battling, but he improves overtime. Because Guilmon was a product of his imagination, Takato appears to empathic with his Digimon and thus the two influence each other in their fights. This bond is later augmented when Guilmon gains the ability to become Gallantmon when Takato Biomerges into him. He generally has feelings for Jeri Katou throughout the series, though he has a bit of a crush on Rika Nonaka.

====Guilmon====
{{voiced by|[[Masako Nozawa]]|[[Steven Jay Blum]]}}

{{nihongo|Guilmon|ã®ã«ã¢ã³|Girumon}} is a viral raptor-like Reptile Digimon who bares the ''Digital [[hazard symbol|hazard]]'' mark on his chest. Guilmon was created by Takato as a drawing and was brought to life soon after by the Blue Card which the Digignomes secretly placed among Takato's card deck. Though a rookie, Guilmon originally has a child mentality and was unaware of the differences between humans and Digimon, calling his partner [[Digimon Tamer|Tamer]] &quot;Takatomon&quot; and loving to eat the Matsuki Bakery's bread. Overtime, moved to Shinjuku Park to be kept a secret, Guilmon matures a bit to be able to speak normally and play with Takato's classmates. Guilmon has a very keen sense of smell and possess somewhat of a sixth sense to detect other digimon if around, usually going [[feral]] in earlier fights. Guilmon is very loyal and protective of Takato and would do anything for him. In the finale, Guilmon regressed to Gigimon as a side effect of the Red Card and thus was forced to part ways with Takato.

*{{nihongo|Growlmon|ã°ã©ã¦ã¢ã³||Growmon}} is the Digivolved form of Guilmon, an extremely powerful Dinosaur Digimon who uses the dragon blades on his arms he can cut through almost anything. Guilmon first Digivolved to Growlmon during his fight against [[Devidramon]], though he was unable to regress for an entire day.
*{{nihongo|WarGrowlmon|ã¡ã¬ã­ã°ã©ã¦ã¢ã³||MegaloGrowmon}} is Guilmon's Ultimate form, an extremely powerful cyborg Digimon who first manifested when Takato uses the Blue Card during the Tamers' fight with the Deva Mihiramon. The form is used to battle the Devas that follow and later Beelzemon. He is armed with bladed Pendulum Blades and the Atomic Blaster on his chest.

*{{nihongo|Megidramon|ã¡ã®ãã©ã¢ã³|Megidoramon}} is an alternate Mega form of Guilmon, an Evil Dragon Digimon which manifested as the result of Takato's rage towards Beelzemon turned Guilmon into a mindless monster while the boy's D-Ark shatters in the proces. In this form, the full destructive power of the ''Digital Hazard'' is released, causing the Digital World to begin breaking up in the monster's presence as he tries to devour Beelzemon. However, asborbing Makuramon's data at the last second, Beelzemon manages to knock Megidramon unconscious so Takato can reach his partner and restore him to his usual form.

*{{nihongo|[[Royal Knights#Gallantmon|Gallantmon]]|ãã¥ã¼ã¯ã¢ã³ ||Dukemon}} is the actual Mega form of Guilmon, an Exhalted Knight Digimon armed with the Gram lance and the Aegis Shield. Guilmon is first able to assume the form when Takato's wish to fight by his partner's side against Beelzemon causes them to Biomerge. Though Gallantmon defeats Beelzemon, he spares him at Jeri's request. After Dobermon's sacrfice, Gallantmon is used in the fight against the [[D-Reaper]] prior to receiving the ARMS &quot;Grani&quot; as his mode of transportation. In the finale, absorbing Grani at his request, Gallantmon assumes Crimson Mode to defeat the Mother D-Reaper's defenses, including Agent-01.

Guilmon was created by [[Chiaki J. Konaka]], influenced by [[Ultraman]] and [[Kaiju]] movies. Upon viewing the initial design sketches, he assumed that the character would be roughly the same size as [[Agumon]]. However, when he realized that Guilmon would be about the size of a human adult, he realized that &quot;[h]e was nowhere near small enough for a child to hide in his room.&quot; Konaka then realized that he could tailor the plot of ''Digimon Tamers'' to incorporate this problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;konaka&quot;/&gt;

===Rika===
{{voiced by|[[Fumiko Orikasa]]|[[Melissa Fahn]]}}

{{nihongo|Rika Nonaka|ç§é çå§«|Makino Ruki|Ruki Makino}} is a tomboyish girl from a family consisting of her youthful mother and grandmother, known as the &quot;Digimon Queen&quot; due to her experience in the Digimon card tournament. Eventually, Rika finds a Blue Card which enables her to receive Renamon as her partner. At first, Rika sees Digimon as nothing more than data and wanted to make Renamon the strongest Digimon in the world. But after the ordeal with IceDevimon, Rika ends their partnership out of fear. However, Rika comes to Renamon's aid and the two begin their partnership anew on mutual terms.

====Renamon====
{{voiced by|[[Yuka Imai]]|[[Mari Devon]]}}

{{Nihongo|Renamon|ã¬ãã¢ã³|}} is a fox-like Beast Man Digimon who is very mature in both form and mentality. In a fight, Renamon uses ninja-like skills including vanishing from view until called and moving at fast speeds. She has no memory of her life before meeting Rika, whom she first saw as nothing more but a means to become stronger. But Renamon begins to realize her view on humans is incorrect overtime. Eventually after the ordeal with IceDevimon and the two parting ways, Renamon begins to understand Rika and vice versa as she becomes more focus on protecting Rika as their partnership becomes mutual over time. Renamon also developed a relationship with Impmon. In the finale, Renamon regressed to Viximon as a side effect of the Red Card and thus was forced to part ways with Rika.

*{{Nihongo|Kyubimon|ã­ã¥ã¦ãã¢ã³|}} A [[Kitsune]]-like Mythical Beast Digimon, Renamon's Champion level form. Though Rika attempted to have her assume the form prior, Renamon manages to achieve digivolving when she wanted to protect Rika from a Dogukumon.
*{{Nihongo|Taomon|ã¿ãªã¢ã³}}: An [[onmyouji]]-themed Majin Digimon who fights with various spells and charms to help her harness the powers of the magical energy that flows through the universe. Taomon first appeared to fight the Ox Deva, Vajramon.
*{{Nihongo|Sakuyamon|ãµã¯ã¤ã¢ã³}}: Renamon's mega form, an armored Shaman Digimon armed with the Vajra [[Khakkhara]] and able to summon energy [[kudagitsune]] to her aid. Renamon gains this form when Rika biomerges with her in a leap of faith rather than let her partner face the D-Reaper alone. During the finale, Sakuyamon weakens herself by converting her armor into energy for Justimon to use in an attempt to destroy the Cable-Reaper.

[[Chiaki J. Konaka]] originally conceived Renamon as an [[androgyny|androgynous]] character, but her personality development over the course of the series caused the character to be treated as female.&lt;ref name=&quot;konaka&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Renamon|url=http://www.konaka.com/alice6/tamers/characters/renamon-e.html|publisher=Konaka.com|last=Konaka|first=Chiaki J.|authorlink=Chiaki J.

Along with his father Janyu, Henry is a [[Tai Chi Chuan|Tai Chi]] student. Prior to the series, Henry thought Digimon fighting each other was a game until he realizes they are living beings. After using a Blue Card to create his partnership with Terriermon, Henry vowed to make have the Digimon fight again. However, after many situations where Terriermon is forced to digivolve and fight, Henry realizes there are many battles worth fighting. For the first half of the series, Henry was unaware of his father's connections with the Monster Makers an Hypnos. In the finale, after using the Red Card to execute Operation Doodlebug to wipe out the D-Reaper, Henry realized that using it would mean that the Digimon have to return to their world

====Terriermon====
{{voiced by|[[Aoi Tada]]|[[Mona Marshall]]}}

{{Nihongo|Terriermon|ããªã¢ã¢ã³|}} is an one-horned [[terrier]]/[[bunny]] Beast Digimon with a laidback personality, often using the word &quot;Momentai&quot; (written as [[Wiktionary:ç¡åé¡|ç¡åé¡]] or [[Wiktionary:æ é®é¢|æ é®é¢]]), a [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] phrase that means &quot;''no problem''&quot; (In the English Dub, this has the translation of &quot;Momentai&quot; has been changed to &quot;''take it easy''&quot;). Terriermon also has very large ears which are often used for spinning attacks such as in the move &quot;Terrier Tornado&quot; or to float and glide. Terriermon was originally a wild Digimon who lives by the rules of the &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot; doctrine in the harsh realm of the [[Digital World]]. When Henry received a Digimon video game as a present from his father, he selected Terriermon to play with because he identified with him. However, when Henry forced Terriermon to digivolve during a battle between a [[Gorillamon]], Gargomon goes on a rampage befpre regressing and losing consciousness. Soon after, a remorseful Henry finds a Blue Card which he used to bring Terriermon into the real world as his partner. For the first half of the series, Henry hid Terriermon from his family in plain sight by making Terriermon act like a simple stuffed animal which his younger sister Susie plays with. In the finale, Terriermon regressed to Gummimon as a side effect of the Red Card and thus was forced to part ways with Henry.

*{{Nihongo|Gargomon|ã¬ã«ã´ã¢ã³|Garugomon|Galgomon}}: Terriermon's champion form, a Beast Man Digimon whose forearms are reolver gun arms that he uses in his attacks.

*{{Nihongo|Rapidmonã©ãããã¢ã³||Rapidomon}}: Terriermon's ultimate form, a Cyborg Digimon able to move at fast speeds. Terriermon first assumes the form during the attack by Pajiramon and Vajiramon.
*{{Nihongo|MegaGargomon|ã»ã³ãã¬ã«ã´ã¢ã³|SantoGargomon|SaintGalgomon}}: The Mega form of Terriermon, a machine Digimon whose size and heavy arsenal make him a weapon. But where firepower fails, MegaGargomon benefits from his Biomerging with Henry to utilize his partner's [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] [[Martial Arts]] skills in combat. Terriermon achieves the form when Henry Biomerges with him during the fight against [[Zhuqiaomon]], though the Sovereign was far from defeated. MegaGargomon later participated in battles with the [[D-Reaper]], and used the Juggernaut program downloaded by Hypnos into a Red Card to defeat it.

===Calumon===
{{main|Calumon}}

===Impmon===
{{voiced by|[[Hiroki Takahashi]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}

{{nihongo|Impmon|ã¤ã³ãã¢ã³|Inpumon}} is an [[imp]] Digimon who mysteriously appears and harasses the Tamers and their Digimon on occasion, saying that no 'self-respecting Digimon' would ever ally themselves to one, though he ends up becoming friends with Guilmon and flirting with Renamon. He was even prone to harassing Calumon, scaring him on occasion. It is revealed later in the series that Impmon did live with two children upon entering the Real World- Ai and Mako. However, their fighting over who Impmon should play with more causes him to run away with distain towards all humans. But Impmon resented the Tamers and their Digimon more as the latter are able to Digivolve through the former.

After attempting to prove himself by fighting Indramon, Impmon suffers a devastating and painful defeat that crushes his ego prior to accepting an offer from [[Chatsuramon]] as he brings him back to the Digital World: to be digivolved but only if he agrees to kill the Tamers and their Digimon when they arrive to retrieve Calumon. Though conflicted, Impmon accepts the offer and becomes the mega-level Demon Lord Digimon {{nihongo|[[Seven Great Demon Lords|Beelzemon]]|ãã«ã¼ãã¢ã³|Beruzebumon|Beelzebumon}}. Consumed by his new-found powers, Beelzemon acts on his whim to test new abilities before attacking the Tamers. 

Eventually, despite [[Leomon]]'s attempts to snap him out of it, Beelzemon kills him and takes his data before Jeri's eyes, indirectly causing the events that nearly destroyed the Digital World. However, Guilmon and Takato bio-merge into Gallantmon and defeat Beelzemon, sparing him on Jeri's request as she wanted no one else to die though she could never forgive him. Shocked, and feeling worthless,  Beelzemon wandered until he allowed some friends of the Digimon he killed extact their revenge on him, regressing him back into Impmon before being found by encounters Renamon and Rika, who decide to bring him back into the Real World.

Taking his leave without a goodbye upon reaching Shinjuku, Impmon decides to find Ai and Mako, touched upon learning that the two no longer fighting and asking forgiveness for the harm they put him through. Fueled by his new change of heart, and wanting to find his own redemption, Impmon gains the ability to warp digivolve into Beelzemon Blast Mode and helps the Tamers in their fight against the D Reaper before nearly getting himself killed saving Jeri. At the end of the series, after the D-Reaper's destruction and officially becoming Ai and Mako's Digimon partner, Impmon finally receives Jeri's forgiveness before he regresses to Yaamon and is forced to return to the Digital World.

===Jeri===
{{voiced by|[[Yoko Asada]]|[[Bridget Hoffman]], [[Philece Sampler]](movie)}}

{{nihongo|Jeri Kato|å è¤ æ¨¹è|KatÅ Juri|Juri KatÅ}}, is the classmate of Takato whom the boy has a crush on and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Jeri from ''Digimon Tamers'' head writer Chiaki J. Konaka, http://www.konaka.com/alice6/tamers/characters/juri-e.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her family happens to own a small tavern in Shibuya, where she works sometimes waitressing and even helping her father to handle drunk customers. She carries around a dog-shaped sock puppet from her half brother, which she uses to strike-up conversations with. At first glance, she seems to be a sort of perfect child because of her cheerful and happy personality.  However, the death of her birth mother left an emotional scar on Jeri which her father was unable to resolve as she could not cope having a step-mother. Jeri happens to be among those aware of the Digimons' existence before meeting Leomon. However, Leomon's death causes Jeri to relapse into a withdrawn depression that attracts the D-Reaper's attention, kidnapping her to serve as a misery-powered battery while having the Jeri-Type Agent take the girl's place and infiltrate among her family before revealing itself. However, thanks to Calumon's presense and Leomon in spirit, Jeri regains her confidence and attempts to fight her way out before Takato saves her. From the ordeal, Jeri realizes that realizes that humans can make their own destiny and that she was never meant to be alone as she accepts Impmon's apology.

Early pre-production notes made by Chiaki J. Konaka suggest a female character which likely would become Jeri was named Mishio who cared for her younger sister more often as her parents were workers in the [[red-light district]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamers Production Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konaka.com/alice6/tamers/plan-e.html|title=Digimon Tamers Concept Planning Notes Version 4.0|publisher=|accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeri is voiced by [[Yoko Asada]] (Japan) and [[Bridget Hoffman]] (English). 

====Leomon====
{{voiced by|[[Hiroaki Hirata]]|[[Paul St. Peter]]}}

Leomon is a Beast Man Digimon armed with a blade and master of the &quot;Fist of the Beast King&quot; attack. Before Bio-Emerging to the Real World, Leomon only knew of endless conflict and was at first bit frightened by Jeri's affection and insistence that he's her partner. But he grew to care for her, becoming Jeri's partner for real after his near-death experience with Zhuqiaomon during his attempt to halt Makuramon's escape. Despite Jeri's doubts of being worthy enough to be his Tamer, Leomon had much confidence in her. However, while helping the Tamers in the Digital World, Leomon dies when he restrains Beelzemon and tries to convince him what true strength is. The sight of Leomon being fatally impaled and then his data being absorbed by Beelzemon causes Jeri to fall into a depression. However, Leomon appears in spirit during the battle with the D-Reaper, first through Beelzemon using his trademark attack and then in Jeri's D-Ark to help her regain her confidence.

===Kazu and Guardromon===
* Kazu: {{voiced by|[[Yukiko Tamaki]]|[[Brad MacDonald]]}}
* Guardomon: {{voiced by|[[Kiyoyuki Yanada]]|[[Richard Cansino]]}}

{{nihongo|Kazu Shiota|å¡©ç° åå|Shiota Hirokazu|Hirokazu Shiota}}, is one of [[Takato Matsuki|Takato]]'s closest friends, calling him &quot;chumley&quot; in the English version. He is also a player of the DigiBattle Card Game, enjoying beating Takato and Kenta all the time. His involvement in Tamers truly started when Takato actually beat him, leaving him confused, but when Takato mentioned about real life experience, Kazu wanted to go deeper into it. This leads to him and Kenta seeing Guilmon, though they eventually got over their fear and befriended him. Secretly, Kazu wanted to be a Tamer himself and be just as good as Takato and the others. His chance came when he went to the Digital World, although he and Kenta did seem out of place as the others had Partners, he made the best of it until he did finally get a partner of his own in the name of Guardromon.

An Android type, Guardromon is a protector by nature, a mechanical defense specialist who faithfully fights for justice. However, he tends to be rather foppish and frequently unlucky in his endeavors. He was originally the cyborg Digimon Andromon who attempted to liberate a village of Gekomon from the control of Orochimon, who had enslaved them to mix sake for him. By the time the Tamers under Rika arrived, Andromon was badly injured in the battle with the Tamers convince the Gekomon leader to give them some of the data packets from their drinks to heal Andromon. However, he had lost much of his energy from the fight and regressed into Guardromon as a result. He helps the Tamers defeat Orochimon before becoming Kazu's partner and helping them in the battles with Beelzemon and the D-Reaper. In the finale, Guardromon regressed to Kapurimon as a side effect of the Red Card and thus was forced to part ways with Kazu.

===Kenta and MarineAngemon===
* Kenta: {{voiced by|[[TÅko Aoyama]]|[[Steven Jay Blum]]}}
* MarineAngemon: {{voiced by|[[Ai Iwamura]]|[[Wendee Lee]], [[Mona Marshall]](movie)}}

{{nihongo|Kenta Kitagawa|åå· å¥å¤ª|Kitagawa Kenta}} is another of Takato's friends, and Hirokazu's side kick. Kenta often gets credit for the numerous jokes that Kazu tells throughout the season. Like Kazu, Kenta wanted his own Digimon partner so he joins the Tamers in entering the Digital World. However, getting jealous and upset that he is the only own with a partner, Kenta attempts to pretend that Guilmon's his Digimon while he is separated from Takato. Eventually, though he tried to show him away, Kenta ends up becoming partners with MarineAngemon and is able to understand him.

MarineAngemon is a pixie Digimon who is about the size of a small housecat, said to dwell in the Internet Ocean, though he is rarely seen even by other marine Digimon. Though not a fighter as he hates violence, he does have power and deals with his attackers with his love-based Kakuna Wave attack. Appearing among the numerous mega level Digimon to help the Sovereigns fight the D-Reaper, MarineAngemon took a liking to Kenta and became his partner as a result. In the long run, MarineAngemon proves to be an unlikely ally during the battle against the D-Reaper as his love-based attacks frightened the Jeri-Type Agent, as the D-Reaper was powered only by Jeri's negative emotions. In the finale, MarineAngemon departs to the DigiWorld with the others.

===Suzie===
{{voiced by|[[Nagano Ai]]|[[Peggy O'Neal]]}}

{{Nihongo|Suzie Wong||æ å°æ¥|RÄ« Shiuchon||LÇ XiÇochÅ«n}} is Henry's little sister and the youngest of Wong children. Unaware of Terriermon's true identity, Suzie believed him to be a plush toy and often dresses him up in girls' dolls' clothes and calling him &quot;Pwincess Pwetty Pants&quot; to his dismay. Eventually, when Henry had to leave for the Digital World, Terriermon reveals himself to Suzie so she can let him go. However, in an unexpected turn, a digital fog appears in the real world while she is at the park with her father and ends up in the Digital World. There she meets and befriends the Deva Antylamon, who is later regressed into her partner Lopmon. Eventually, during the D-Reaper's attack, Suzie takes her role as Lopmon's partner seriously as she sends him to help the others.

====Lopmon====

Unlike the other Devas, Antylamon does not share their distain with humans. Meeting Suzie, Antylamon saw the girl as a small annoyance before bonding with her to the point of fighting off Makuramon when he tries to hurt the girl. As punishment, Zhuqiaomon reverts Antylamon to Lopmon. Soon after, while taking the Tamers to meet Zhuqiaomon in an attempt to reason with the Sovereign, Suzie acquires a D-Ark that makes her and Lopmon partners. Later entering the real world, being taught by Suzie, Lopmon regains his ability to become Antylamon and aids the Tamers in fighting the D-Reaper. Afterwards, regressing to Chocomon, Lopmon is forced to return to the Digital World with the rest of the Tamers' Digimon.

===D-Reaper===
{{voiced by|[[Yoko Asada]]|[[Bridget Hoffman]]}}

The D-Reaper, also known as the &quot;True Enemy&quot;, is a digital lifeform that appears as the primary antagonist. Though it began in an extremely primitive state, it is thought that its ability to become powerful enough to overcome the Digital World was due to its hibernation being so far beneath the Digital World that it actually connected with another dimension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;&gt;[http://www.konaka.com/alice6/tamers/d-reaper1-e.html Digimontamers Resources: D-Reaper Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The general design aesthetic of the D-Reaper was that of a &quot;Digital creature&quot;, exemplified in such details as the jigsaw-like fringes of the Agents, and the optic fiber/telephone wire construction of the Reaper and Mother D-Reaper. Konaka remarked that he was especially fascinated by details like the wings on [[#ADR-02: Searcher|ADR-02]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;&gt;[http://www.konaka.com/alice6/tamers/d-reaper2-e.html Digimontamers Resources: ADR Variations]&lt;/ref&gt; Aramaki was also responsible for the design of the &quot;D-Reaper Zone&quot; as it appears on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konaka.com/alice6/tamers/aramaki-e.html Design Works bv Shinji Aramaki]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Reaper'' program was created in the late 1970s, allegedly by the United States Department of Defense, before Digimon and even the [[DigiGnomes]], which appeared in the early 1980s. Though this is only set 30 years in the past of ''Digimon Tamers'', in the fast-growing Digital World it is comparable to the [[Cambrian]] period (542-488 [[Annum|Ma]]). It was designed so that whenever the number of digital lifeforms surpassed a set amount, it would delete them to return the Digital World back to a state of nothingness, in order to prevent the Digital World from being overloaded. However, when it was written, the Digital World had a very small [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] size, and while the network has grown exponentially, the D-Reaper's threshold is still based on that early, tiny figure. With nothing to do at the time, the D-Reaper program went dormant and remained deep within the recesses of the Net.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;/&gt; At about this time, the &quot;Creeper&quot; virus infected [[ARPANET]], the network belonging to the Department of Defense. It was deleted by the &quot;Reaper&quot; program, which was allegedly created for only this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle&quot;&gt;[http://www.konaka.com/alice6/tamers/chronicle-e.html Digimontamers Resources: Chronicle of the Digital World and Virtual Creatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Artificial Life research project &quot;[[Tierra]]&quot; began operations. However, the Reaper program causes mass genocide of Tierra's virtual lifeforms whenever they multiplied beyond a certain amount of memory.&lt;!--This genocide is depicted in...--&gt; Throughout the 1980s, the [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] system known as &quot;ECHELON&quot; began operations under the leadership of the [[United States Department of National Security]], which built communications bases in various nations across the globe. It is thought that the self-defense program used by ECHELON was a forerunner of the D-Reaper, or the program itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle&quot;/&gt;

By the 2000s, the network had expanded exponentially. This created a huge influx of data into the Digital World, which the Digimon used to &quot;[[Digivolution|Digivolve]]&quot; and change. Though the system was large enough to handle this load, the [[Sovereigns#Azulongmon|Sovereign Azulongmon]] sensed that it could reawaken the D-Reaper, and with the help of the DigiGnomes he transformed the &quot;Catalyst&quot; program into the form of a Digimon, [[Calumon]]. Though this greatly slowed the growth and Digivolution of Digimon, it was not enough to stave off the D-Reaper, which soon reactivated. At the time, though, it was still in an extremely primitive state, and the Sovereigns attempted to find solutions before the problem became too huge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle&quot;/&gt;

However, managing to capture Jeri, the D-Reaper uses Hynpos's system to manifest its main body, holding its Kernel Sphere, into the human world and turn the Shinjiku Metropolitan building into its base of operations while converting the surrounding area into the D-Reaper Zone. To accomplish its goals of expanding its territory while studying humans, the D-Reaper produces extensions of itself known as &quot;ADR's&quot;, or &quot;Agents of the D-Reaper&quot;. Due to being drones that all act according to the single consciousness of the D-Reaper, the Agents operate outside of the D-Reaper Zone by a red life line, similar in function to umbilical cords. When these cords are severed, the Agent becomes much weaker and easier to defeat, and weaker Agents will dissipate completely. Once the D-Reaper creates a new type of ADR, it will continue to use it until it is no longer useful and efficient. The various ADR's are named by the order they are created in, though they also possess codenames based on their appearance and function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt;

* The ADR-01: Jeri Type: A Spy Agent whose form is based on [[Jeri Katou]] from when she started becoming depressed, created in order to analyze human thought. It starts out identical in form to Jeri, but can evolve into several variations. It was designed by [[Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt;
* The ADR-02: Searcher: An Intelligence Gathering Agent. It is small, and has no offensive capability, but usually appears in large swarms. It was designed by [[Kenji Watanabe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt; 
* The ADR-03: Pendulum Feet: An Antiaircraft Attack Agent. It is the first offensive Agent created by the D-Reaper, and uses its floating extensions to perform remote strikes. It was designed by [[Kenji Watanabe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt; 
* The ADR-04: Bubbles: A Ground Combat Agent that appears in swarms, but it is able to use the wave motion guns on its arms to attack. It was designed by [[Shinji Aramaki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt;
* The ADR-05: Creep Hands: A Grappling Agent. It is a medium-sized offensive unit, which uses its spiral-shaped, stretchable arms for locomotion and hand-to-hand combat. It was designed by [[Shinji Aramaki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt; * * The ADR-06: Horn Striker: A Military Commander Agent. It is a medium-sized combat unit of overwhelming power. It was designed by [[Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt;
* The ADR-07: Paratice Head (a mis-transliteration of [[Palate|Palates Head]]): A [[Reconnaissance in force|Reconnaissance in Force]] Agent. It is large, and somewhat like the [[wikipedia:Boss (video games)|mid-boss]] of a video game. It makes sinister, unpredictable attacks. It was designed by [[wikipedia:Kenji Watanabe|Kenji Watanabe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt; * The ADR-08: Optimizer: A Mother Ship Agent. It is large, and somewhat like the [[Boss (video games)|mid-boss]] of a video game. It was designed by [[Kenji Watanabe]], who focused the design on its huge size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt; 
* The ADR-09: Gatekeeper: Also known as the &quot;D-Reaper Ball&quot;, is a Base Defense Agent. It is formed to protect the D-Reaper's core, the &quot;Kernel Sphere&quot;. It was designed by [[Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt;

Eventually, the D-Reaper reabsorbs all its Agents and uses Jeri's emotions to transform into the Mother D-Reaper, an Ability Synthesis Agent whose body is made up of countless cords, optic fibers, and electrical and telephone wires. As a result, the D-Reaper consumed all of [[Shinjuku]]. It was designed by [[Kenji Watanabe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt; From this point, complete its control over both worlds, the Mother D-Reaper opens a portal in the Digital World as it is now mostly consumed by it's other self. The other DigiWorld's D-Reaper under went a similar evolution into the Reaper or  &quot;Cable Reaper&quot; Ability Synthesis Agent, possessing the offensive powers of the Agents that compose it. It was designed by [[Kenji Watanabe]] and [[Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru]], who gave it scythes to symbolize that it is a physical manifestation of [[Death (personification)|Death]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Variations&quot;/&gt; From there, the Mother D-Reaper waits the Reaper to arrive so they can merge before beginning the systematic termination of both humans and Digimon. However, as the Tamers act out Operation Doodlebug while Gallantmon save Jeri and Calumon, both halves of the D-Reaper are sucked into the vortex where they are deleted by the Juggernaut program.

===DigiGnomes===
The DigiGnomes are digital creatures that evolved from the same [[Digital World]] data that Digimon did, and have the power to grant wishes. They were created in 1980, making them the first artificial digital creatures. The DigiGnomes were there when the D-Reaper attacked the Digital World in 1990. In 200X when the D-Reaper was slowly resurfacing, [[Azulongmon]] had the DigiGnomes transform the Shining Digivolution (the source of Digivolution for all Digimon) into a Digimon named [[Calumon]], who ended up in the Real World. The DigiGnomes were also used by Shibumi to make Blue Cards for the Tamers. When Calumon was captured by [[Makuramon]] and the cage he was in was trapped in a circuit the DigiGnomes freed him when Makuramon lost grip of it. Rika Nonaka and Renamon were the first Tamer team to encounter the DigiGnomes. Takato Matsuki, Henry Wong, and Terriermon encountered them in Shibumi's library. The DigiGnomes also appeared when Suzie Wong convinced [[Antylamon]] to play with her. Takato later saw the DigiGnomes flying towards [[Zhuqiaomon]]'s castle. When the D-Reaper was growing in power, some DigiGnomes sacrificed their lives to release the Shining Digivolution throughout the Digital World, causing all Digimon to Digivolve to their Mega Forms. A DigiGnome later placed [[MarineAngemon]] in Kenta's pocket without anyone noticing. Later on during the battle against the D-Reaper, Ai and Mako ([[Impmon]]'s Tamers) received a purple D-Power from out of nowhere as a DigiGnome flew over a bus. In the aftermath of the victory over the D-Reaper, the Tamers' Digimon disappeared back to the Digital World. Later on, a DigiGnome hovered over Guilmon's old hiding place and the gate to the Digital World opened, which was proof that a DigiGnome had granted Takato's wish.
