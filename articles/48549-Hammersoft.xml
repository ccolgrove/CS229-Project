The '''Organisation of African Unity''' ('''OAU''') ({{lang-fr|Organisation de l'UnitÃ© Africaine (OUA)}})  was established on 25 May 1963. It was disbanded on 9 July 2002 by its last [[Chairman of the Organization of African Unity|chairperson]], [[South Africa]]n [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]], and replaced by the [[African Union]] (AU).

==Aims==
The OAU had two primary aims:

* To promote the unity and solidarity of the [[Africa]]n states and act as a collective voice for the African continent. This was important to secure Africa's long-term economic and political future. Years of colonialism had weakened it socially, politically and economically.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
* The OAU was also dedicated to the eradication of all forms of [[colonialism]], as, when it was established, there were several states that had not yet won their independence or were minority-ruled. [[South Africa]] and [[Angola]] were two such countries. The OAU proposed two ways of ridding the continent of colonialism. Firstly, it would defend the interests of independent countries and help to pursue those of still-colonised ones. Secondly, it would remain neutral in terms of world affairs, preventing its members from being controlled once more by outside powers.

A Liberation Committee was established to aid independence movements and look after the interests of already-liberated states. The OAU also aimed to stay neutral in terms of global politics, which would prevent them from being controlled once more by outside forces â an especial danger with the Cold War.

{{AU History}}

The OAU had other aims, too:

* Ensure that all Africans enjoyed [[human rights]].
* Raise the [[living standards]] of all Africans.
* Settle arguments and disputes between members â not through fighting but rather peaceful and diplomatic negotiation.

Soon after achieving independence, a number of African states expressed a growing desire for more unity within the continent. Not everyone was agreed on how this unity could be achieved, however, and two opinionated groups emerged in this respect:

* [[Casablanca Group|The Casablanca bloc]], led by [[Kwame Nkrumah]] of [[Ghana]], wanted a [[federation]] of all African countries. Aside from Ghana, it comprised also [[Algeria]], [[Guinea]], [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Mali]] and [[Libya]]. Founded in 1961, its members were described as &quot;progressive states&quot;.
* [[Monrovia Group|The Monrovian bloc]], led by [[LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor|Senghor]] of [[Senegal]], felt that unity should be achieved gradually, through economic cooperation. It did not support the notion of a political federation. Its other members were [[Nigeria]], [[Liberia]], [[Ethiopia]] and most of the former French colonies.

Some of the initial discussions took place at [[Sanniquellie]], [[Liberia]]. The dispute was eventually resolved when [[Ethiopia]]n emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] invited the two groups to [[Addis Ababa]], where the OAU and its headquarters were subsequently established. The Charter of the Organisation was signed by 32 independent African states.

At the time of the OAU's disbanding, 53 out of the 54 African states were members; [[Morocco]] left on 12 November 1984 following the admission of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] as the government of [[Western Sahara]] in 1982.

The organisation was widely derided as a bureaucratic &quot;talking shop&quot; with little power. It struggled to enforce its decisions, and its lack of armed force made intervention exceedingly difficult. [[Civil war]]s in Nigeria and Angola continued unabated for years, and the OAU could do nothing to stop them.

The policy of non-interference in the affairs of member states also limited the effectiveness of the OAU. Thus, when [[human rights]] were violated, as in [[Uganda]] under [[Idi Amin]] in the 1970s, the OAU was powerless to stop them.

The Organisation was praised by [[Ghana]]ian former [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] for bringing Africans together. Nevertheless, in its 39 years of existence, critics argue that the OAU did little to protect the rights and liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing it as a  &quot;Dictators' Club&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2115736.stm News.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Dictator's Trade Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.somalilandtimes.net/sl/2005/206/19.shtml Somalilandtimes.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The OAU was, however, successful in some respects. Many of its members were members of the UN, too, and they stood together within the latter organisation to safeguard African interests â especially in respect of lingering colonialism. Its pursuit of African unity, therefore, was in some ways successful.

Total unity was difficult to achieve, however, as the OAU was largely divided. The former French colonies, still dependent on [[France]], had formed the [[Monrovia Group]], and there was a further split between those that supported the [[USA]] and those that supported the [[USSR]] in the [[Cold War]] of ideologies. The pro-[[Socialist]] faction was led by [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while [[FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny]] of the [[Ivory Coast]] led the pro-[[capitalism|capitalist]]s. Because of these divisions, it was difficult for the OAU to take action against states involved in internal conflicts because it could rarely reach an agreement on what was to be done.

The OAU did, however, play a pivotal role in eradicating [[colonialism]] and minority rule in [[Africa]]. It gave weapons, training and military bases to colonised nations fighting for independence or majority rule. Groups such as the ANC and PAC, fighting [[apartheid]], and [[ZANU]] and [[ZAPU]], fighting for the independence of [[Southern Rhodesia]], were aided in their endeavours by the OAU. African harbours were closed to the South African government, and South African aircraft were prohibited from flying over the rest of the continent. The UN was convinced by the OAU to expel South Africa from bodies such as the [[World Health Organisation]].

The OAU also worked with the UN to ease refugee problems. It set up the [[African Development Bank]] for economic projects intended to make Africa financially stronger. Although all African countries eventually won their [[independence]], it remained difficult for them to become totally independent of their former colonisers. There was often continued reliance on the former colonial powers for economic aid, which often came with strings attached: loans had to be paid back at high interest-rates, and goods had to be sold to the aiders at low rates.

The USA and USSR intervened in post-colonial Africa in pursuit of their own objectives. Help was sometimes provided in the form of [[technology]] and aid-workers. While useful, such external assistance was often perceived{{Who|date=February 2008}} as not necessarily in the best interests of the former colonies.

Autonomous specialised agencies, working under the auspices of the OAU, were:
*[[Pan-African Telecommunications Union]] (PATU)
*[[Pan-African Postal Union]] (PAPU)
*[[Pan-African News Agency]] (PANA)
*[[Union of African National Television and Radio Organisations]] (URTNA)
*[[Union of African Railways]] (UAR)
*[[Organisation of African Trade Union Unity]] (OATUU)
*[[Supreme Council for Sports in Africa]]
