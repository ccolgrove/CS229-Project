The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[San Diego Chargers]] season''' was the 50th season for the original [[American Football League]] team, and its 40th in the NFL. The Chargers improved upon their regular season record of 8â8 in [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|2008]] and won their division for the fourth straight year and fifth time in six seasons. They finished the regular season with a 13â3 record, the second best winning percentage in franchise history but were eliminated in the Divisional Playoffs by the New York Jets. It was also Norv Turner's best regular season record as head coach.

==2009 NFL Draft==
{{Main|2009 NFL Draft}}
Many have speculated as to who the Chargers are likely to target early in the 2009 NFL Draft.  Commonly noted areas of need include the safety positions, the right side of the offensive line, and inside linebacker.  The Chargers are also expected to be in the hunt for a running back to eventually replace Tomlinson, who despite past excellence has faced more frequent injuries and declining production as he ages.

Entering the playoffs as the AFC's No.&amp;nbsp;2 seed, the Chargers began their playoff run at home in the AFC Divisional Round against the No.&amp;nbsp;5 [[New York Jets]].  After a scoreless first quarter, San Diego delivered the game's first strike in the second quarter as quarterback [[Philip Rivers]] found fullback [[Kris Wilson (American football)|Kris Wilson]] on a 13-yard touchdown pass.  The Jets would respond in the third quarter with a 46-yard field goal from kicker [[Jay Feely]].  [[Philip Rivers]] threw two interceptions and the San Diego Chargers offense failed to get one first down as the Jets defense controlled the third quarter.  Then, New York would take the lead in the fourth quarter as quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Dustin Keller]], followed by a 53-yard touchdown run from running back [[Shonn Greene]].  The Chargers unsuccessfully tried to rally as struggling quarterback [[Philip Rivers]] got a 1-yard touchdown run. However, the Chargers failed to recover the onside kick giving the Jets the ball at the Chargers 28 yard line. The Chargers held the Jets to a 4th and 1 yard to go situation, but the Jets ran the ball converting the first down and kneeled the ball to end the game, finishing the Chargers' season
