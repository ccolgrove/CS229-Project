The '''Oklahoma City Community College''', also referred to as '''OCCC''' or '''O-Triple-C''',  is a [[coeducational]] [[community college]] located in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. The [[community college]] was founded in 1972. It currently enrolls 19,700 students.  The faculty consists of 134 full-time [[professors]], and 400 adjunct [[professors]].
The Oklahoma City Community College is a [[post-secondary]] school.  Students take classes for a variety of reasons: working towards an [[associate degree]], [[Academic certificate|certificate]], transfer course work to a [[university]], or to obtain technical skills. 

It offers 36 Associate in Arts and Associate in Science degree programs, 24 Associate in Applied Science degree programs, and 18 Certificate of Mastery programs.  Most courses are structured in a [[semester]] or 16-weeks.  Some courses can be completed in little as 8,5, or 4 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Oklahoma Higher Education's Official Guide to Oklahoma's Colleges and Universities | url= http://www.okhighered.org/student-center/publications/Guide/html/occc.shtml=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Courses are mostly taken at the campus itself, with average of 21:1 student to teacher ratio.  Courses are also being offered online.  The President of the Oklahoma City Community College is Paul Sechrist.  Sechrist became the appointed President after the retirement of Robert Todd in 2005.

==History==
The Oklahoma City Community College was initiated by the [[South Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce]] in March 1969.  The Chamber petitioned the [[Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education]] to create a local junior college.  From there building began in 1972.  September 25, 1972 marked the first day of the South Oklahoma City Junior College with an enrollment of 1,049.  The Board of Regents voted in 1983 to change the name to the now Oklahoma City Community College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=College History | url=http://www.occc.edu/Aboutus/CollegeHistory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The faces have changed and the enrollment has risen, but the Oklahoma City Community College is still an important part of the local community of Oklahoma City.  In 1996 the college added a new library, the Keith Leftwich Memorial Library and the Robert P. Todd SEM (Science, Engineering, and Mathematics) Center. The college also has an Olympic-sized pool that was paid for with donations by local Oklahomans and is used for swim meets, children's swimming lessons and general community recreation.  The college is also host to an annual Fall Arts Festival on Labor Day weekend.

In 2011, OCCC dedicated the Family And Community Education (FACE) center at the former John Glenn Elementary School, which houses the Child Development Center and Lab School as well as adult basic education courses including [[GED]] and [[ESL]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=FACE Center Dedication | url=http://www.occc.edu/news/facededicationafterevent.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 1, 2011 all of Oklahoma City Community College's campus is smoke-free.
