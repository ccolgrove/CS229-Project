The '''2009â10 Los Angeles Lakers season''' is the 64th season of the franchise, 62nd in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and 50th in Los Angeles. Coming off a championship in 2009, the Lakers successfully defended their title. They spent the most money of any team on player salaries this season, totaling $112.7 million ($91.3 million on player salaries and $21.4 million on [[NBA Salary Cap#Luxury tax|luxury tax]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/scott_howard_cooper/11/26/and.one/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/18/sports/la-sp-lakers-whats-next-20100619 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=After title time comes decision time for Lakers | first=Broderick | last=Turner | date=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers once again sold out all 41 home games for the season at [[Staples Center]].

The Lakers clinched the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] for the 31st time in franchise history. Despite winning eight games less than the previous season, they still held the top seed in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] playoffs and made it to the NBA Finals for the third straight season. In the [[2010 NBA Finals]] the Lakers defeated the [[Boston Celtics]] in a rematch of the [[2008 NBA Finals]] won by the Celtics. This time, the Lakers won the series 4-3 for their 16th NBA title and handed Boston its first Game 7 loss in an NBA Finals in team history. [[Kobe Bryant]] won his second consecutive [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]].

On July 14, 2009, [[Phil Jackson]] won the [[ESPY Awards 2010|2010 ESPY Awards]] for Best Coach/Manager while Kobe Bryant won for Best NBA Player.

==Offseason==
===Injuries===
The Lakers came into training camp with no serious injuries. All players were expected to be healthy enough to play in the season opener. After having surgery on his knee last season, [[Andrew Bynum]] was told that he has [[ligamentous laxity]], which required him to wear a knee [[brace (orthopaedic)|brace]] for the entire season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/bynum-zarzana-knee-2595193-brace-lakers&lt;/ref&gt;

During training camp, [[D. J. Mbenga]] was not able to participate fully in practice due to a &quot;malalignment of his hips/hip flexors&quot;. The imbalance was causing him pain in his abdominal, groin and hip flexor areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://my.lakers.com/blogs/2009/10/05/dj-mbenga-injury-update/&lt;/ref&gt; He made a full recovery and played on opening night. [[Pau Gasol]] injured his [[hamstring]] during a preseason game and missed the first 12 games of the season. In December, [[Ron Artest]] revealed that he suffered a shoulder injury during the Lakers' opening exhibition game. He kept the injury quiet so it wouldn't seem like he was making excuses, telling neither the media nor his coaches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pe.com/sports/breakout/stories/PE_Sports_Local_S_laker_notes_01.45ceacf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departures===
[[Trevor Ariza]] chose not to sign when the Los Angeles Lakers offered the Mid-Level Exception (approximately $6 million per year).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/story/11917471&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lakers looked towards other free agents, Ariza agreed to sign with the [[Houston Rockets]] for slightly more money. The Lakers had a [[NBA Salary Cap#Options|team option]] on [[Sun Yue (basketball)|Sun Yue]] to pick up his contract for one year paying him $736,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-lamar-odom23-2009jul23,0,5117681.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Lamar Odom and Lakers resume talks | first1=Broderick | last1=Turner | first2=Mike | last2=Bresnahan | date=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Lakers decided to release him to keep the roster to 13 players.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j0H3Y8DgLSvvFP8OaqLzmTWsfC4wD99PQ4KO0&lt;/ref&gt; Sun eventually signed with the [[New York Knicks]].

Assistant coach [[Kurt Rambis]] left the Lakers to pursue a head-coaching position with the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. Rambis was believed to be the potential replacement to [[Phil Jackson]] if he leave in the next season.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4386466&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signings===
The Lakers had [[NBA Salary Cap#Options|team options]] to exercise contracts on [[Josh Powell]] and [[D. J. Mbenga]]. The Lakers decided to bring both Powell and Mbenga back, paying them $959,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers2-2009jul02,0,6815585.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Lakers are far apart with free agents Trevor Ariza and Lamar Odom | first1=Mike | last1=Bresnahan | first2=Broderick | last2=Turner | date=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kobe Bryant]] also had an option to terminate his contract this offseason, which would pay him approximately $23,000,000 for the season and $24,800,000 for the season after. He chose not to opt out of his contract and will sign a 3 year extension worth between 80 and 85 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-kobe-bryant1-2009jul01,0,5024600.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=If Kobe Bryant wants a new contract, today's the deadline to ask | first1=Mike | last1=Bresnahan | first2=Broderick | last2=Turner | date=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Artest Las Vegas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Los Angeles Lakers (Artest and Mbenga pictured) at the [[Luxor Las Vegas]] after a pre-season game.]]
[[Ron Artest]] was the first player from another team to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers this offseason. On July 2, Artest told [[CBSSports.com]] that he has agreed to a contract with the Lakers. He decided not to pursue a more lucrative contract from his former team (the Rockets) and signed a 5-year deal worth $33 million on July 8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/story/11932269&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers used their [[NBA Salary Cap#Mid-level exception|Mid-Level Exception]] to sign Artest. Artest has long wanted to play for the Lakers and was looking forward to playing with [[Kobe Bryant]] and childhood friend [[Lamar Odom]]. Artest changed his jersey number from 96 to 37 in honor of [[Michael Jackson]]'s album ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' which was the #1 selling album for 37 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballerstatus.com/2009/07/09/ron-artest-becomes-a-los-angeles-laker-dedicates-jersey-song-to-michael-jackson/&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson died 13 days earlier.

[[Shannon Brown]] agreed to a contract with the Lakers on July 6. Brown turned down a more expensive offer from the [[Indiana Pacers]] and agreed to a 2 year $4.2 million deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers7-2009jul07,0,2747762.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Shannon Brown returning to Lakers | first1=Mike | last1=Bresnahan | first2=Broderick | last2=Turner | date=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers used the [[NBA Salary Cap#Bi-annual exception|Bi-annual exception]] to sign Brown. He has a [[NBA Salary Cap#Options|player option]] to terminate his contract after the 2009-10 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoopsworld.com/Story.asp?story_id=13240&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamar Odom was the last Lakers free agent to resign with the team. Before the previous season ended, Odom said he was willing to take a paycut from the $11.4 million he made in his final year of his contract (which was actually $14.1 million under the Lakers salary cap because the difference was paid upfront as a &quot;trade-kicker&quot; when he joined the Lakers). Early in July, the Lakers presented two offers to Odom:&lt;ref name=Odom&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-odom31-2009jul31,0,5679779.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Lamar Odom, Lakers agree to four-year deal | first=Broderick | last=Turner | date=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A four-year deal for $9 million a season, worth up to $36 million, but only three years and $27 million was guaranteed, with the Lakers' buyout in the fourth year worth $3 million.
*A three-year, $30-million deal that would have paid Odom $10 million a season.

When Odom and his agent did not respond quickly enough, owner [[Jerry Buss]] pulled both deals off the table. At the same time, the [[Miami Heat]] actively pursue Odom. Heat President [[Pat Riley]] and [[Dwyane Wade]] met with Odom in Los Angeles in an attempt to get Odom to return to Miami.&lt;ref name=Odom/&gt; Afterwards, Odom spoke with Jerry Buss, and Odom's agent and Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak kept an open dialogue. On July 30, Lamar Odom agreed to a four-year deal, reportedly for $33 million, with a [[NBA_Salary_Cap#Options|team option]] for the final year. Odom said he did not want to leave [[Pau Gasol]], [[Andrew Bynum]], [[Derek Fisher]] and the rest of the Lakers, especially [[Kobe Bryant]].&lt;ref name=Odom/&gt;

On September 28, the Lakers signed four players to non-guaranteed contracts: [[Tony Gaffney]], [[David Monds]], [[MickaÃ«l Gelabale]] and [[Michael Fey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/0909_training_camp_signees.html&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, the Lakers also signed [[Thomas Kelati]] to a non-guaranteed contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2009-09-30-3071576035_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Lakers sign guard Thomas Kelati | date=September 30, 2009 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; bring their total player roster to 18 players. By the beginning of the season, they had to reduce their roster to a maximum of 15 players. On October 10, the Lakers cut MickaÃ«l Gelabale, David Monds, and Michael Fey, bringing the roster to 15 players.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/091010lakerswaivethree.html&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, Thomas Kelati was cut from the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-fyi22-2009oct22,0,2498370.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Andrew Bynum looks great, but games don't count yet | first=Mike | last=Bresnahan | date=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 24, the Lakers cut Gaffney.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/091024_gaffneywaived.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trades===
The Lakers traded their first round draft pick (#29) to the [[New York Knicks]] for $3,000,000 and the Knicks 2011 second round draft pick.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/lakers-draft-player-2475454-kupchak-pick&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers traded their second pick (originally from the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for the [[Kareem Rush]] trade) for cash.

===Draft===
{{Main|2009 NBA Draft}}
The Lakers originally had three picks entering the Draft. Their 29th pick was used to pick [[Toney Douglas]] from [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]], and chose [[Patrick Beverley]] from [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] with their 42nd pick, a pick which they got from a previous trade with Charlotte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/rush_trade_041206.html|title=Lakers Trade Kareem Rush to Charlotte in Exchange for Two Future Picks|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=2009-04-18|date=2004-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers traded both each for a future second-round draft pick and cash. They kept their final pick and selected [[Chinemelu Elonu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/09draft.html|title=Lakers 2009 Draft Index|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|date=2009-06-26|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies men's basketball|Texas A&amp;M]] center earned All-[[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] honors last season after averaging 9.8 points and a team-best 7.3 rebounds and 53 blocked shots.

==Season summary==
[[File:Kobe speaks Lakers watch.jpg|thumb|250px|The Los Angeles Lakers on October 23, 2009 at the [[Bob Wilson Naval Hospital]] gym in [[San Diego]]]]

The Los Angeles Lakers opened the season at home against their intra-city rival the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. Before the game, the remaining Lakers on the team from last year received their 2009 NBA championship rings. [[Pau Gasol]] missed the first 11 games due to his [[hamstring]] injury, so Lamar Odom moved to [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and was placed in the starting lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20091027_LAC@LAL | title = Bryant, Lakers begin title defense with victory against Clippers | date = October 28, 2009 | publisher = [[CBSSports.com]] | accessdate = November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season opened with the starting lineup being:

*PG â [[Derek Fisher]]
*SG â [[Kobe Bryant]]
*SF â [[Ron Artest]]
*PF â [[Lamar Odom]]
*C â [[Andrew Bynum]]

The Lakers started off 7â1, then lost two in a row. [[Luke Walton]] was another player who was injured, suffering a pinched{{What|date=June 2011}} in his back on November 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/news/story?id=4793739&lt;/ref&gt; He was out for approximately six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/2009-11-17-walton-pinched-nerve_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Lakers' Walton diagnosed with pinched nerve, to miss six weeks | date=November 17, 2009 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gasol came back soon after and the Lakers returned to their normal lineup (with Odom coming off the bench):

*PG â Derek Fisher
*SG â Kobe Bryant
*SF â Ron Artest
*PF â Pau Gasol

Through the first 14 games of the season, the Lakers ranked second in the league in defensive field-goal shooting (41.7%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers&quot;&gt;http://www.hoopsworld.com/Story.asp?story_id=14474&lt;/ref&gt; They also had to deal with poor play by reserve players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynews.com/ci_13871499&lt;/ref&gt; After Gasol's return, the Lakers went 10â0, which included a game on December 4 when Bryant made a three-pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the [[Miami Heat]] 108â107.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20091204_MIA@LAL&lt;/ref&gt; Their 11-game winning streak ended on December 12 against the [[Utah Jazz]]. On December 11, Bryant suffered a fracture in his right index finger in a game against the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]],&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2009121113&lt;/ref&gt; but it didn't force him to miss any games. On December 16, Bryant made another game-winning shot, this time against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in overtime. The Lakers went on a five-game winning streak heading into their Christmas Day game at home against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. They lost the game for their third home defeat of the season. Later that night, Ron Artest suffered a concussion from tripping over a box and falling down a flight of stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-fyi1-2010jan01,0,1325605.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Lakers forward Ron Artest trying to regain his touch | first=Broderick | last=Turner | date=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed five games to recover. The Lakers struggled with his absence, giving up 100 or more points in four consecutive games. On January 1, Bryant made a three-pointer at the buzzer to beat the [[Sacramento Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap;_ylt=AlPw372uPqShjYE24OAV48G8vLYF?gid=2010010113&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third time that season that Bryant made a buzzer-beater to win a game. On January 3, Gasol mildly strained his left hamstring in the first quarter against the [[Dallas Mavericks]] and had to leave the game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100103_DAL@LAL&lt;/ref&gt; Artest returned to play the next game versus the [[Houston Rockets]], and Odom almost recorded a [[triple double]] with 17 points, 19 rebounds, and 9 assists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100105_HOU@LAL&lt;/ref&gt; After Christmas, the Lakers struggled, going 6â5. Since then, both Walton (28 games) and Gasol (six games) returned from injuries and the Lakers played with a full roster for the first time that season against the Clippers on January 15.

Against the Memphis Grizzlies, Bryant surpassed [[Jerry West]] to become the Lakers' all-time leading scorer. The Lakers finished the road trip 5â3. In February, Gasol was named winner of two of the three most prestigious annual awards given to European players, based on performances during the 2009 calendar year for both national and club teams. On December 27, Gasol was announced by the [[Italy|Italian]] magazine ''[[Superbasket Magazine|Superbasket]]'' as the winner of its ''[[Mr. Europa]]'' award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reportonline.it/2009122739636/stampa-in-vetrina/superbasket-52-53.html |title=SuperBasket 52â53 |publisher=''Report On Line'' |language=Italian |date=2009-12-27 |accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 28, Gasol was announced by the Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' as the winner of its ''[[Euroscar Award]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Sport_Vari/Basket/Estero/28-12-2009/europlayer-gazzetta-602467896186.shtml |title=Europlayer Gazzetta Pau Gasol fa il bis |publisher=''La Gazzetta dello Sport'' |language=Italian |date=2009-12-28 |accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6 against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], an injured Bryant sat out for a game for the first time since 2007.

All three victories came without Bryant and the final two were without Bynum.

Bryant was voted as a starter for the [[2010 NBA All-Star Game]], but sat out due to injury. Gasol was selected as a reserve for the West and logged 13 points and six rebounds in 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=300214032&lt;/ref&gt; Brown entered the dunk contest but was defeated in the second round.

Bryant returned from injury on February 23 against the [[Memphis Grizzlies]]. The Lakers went 4-1 without him. Bryant made a three-pointer with 4.3 seconds left to lift the Lakers to a 99-98 victory. However, the Lakers went 4-4 in the eight games after Bryant's return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woes&quot;&gt;http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/03/07/gasol-has-inside-perspective-on-lakers-recent-woes/&lt;/ref&gt; Since the All-Star break, the Lakers have struggled, recording a 5-5 record including the first three-game losing streak since Gasol joined the team in a trade two years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woes&quot;/&gt; The team also had to deal with injuries to [[Sasha Vujacic]] and [[Luke Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5007392&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers responded by winning five games in a row, but Bynum suffered an injury and was removed from the active roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-timberwolves-20100320,0,2710101.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Lakers get ugly win over 'Wolves but lose Andrew Bynum | first=Mike | last=Bresnahan | date=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that Bynum strained his [[Achilles tendon]] against the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] on March 19, and that he was expected to miss almost two weeks (six games) to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-lakers-bynum-20100321,0,6219097,full.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Could have been worse | first=Broderick | last=Turner | date=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their three-game losing streak, the Lakers responded by winning seven games in a row, then lost two of their next seven.

==Post-season summary==
{{Main|2010 NBA Playoffs}}

===Oklahoma City Thunder===
[[Image:Andrew Bynum 2010 playoffs.jpg|thumb|250px|Andrew Bynum shoots a free throw against the Thunder in game 5.]]
The Lakers played the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the first round of the playoffs. Both Bryant and Bynum returned from injury to start in the first game. In game one, the Lakers outscored the Thunder 27-13 in the first quarter. The Thunder attempted to close in on the lead, but the Lakers held on in the 2nd half, matching the Thunder's point total in the 3rd and 4th quarter. Although Bryant led the Lakers in points scored (21), Gasol had the most impressive night statically, collecting 19 points, 13 rebounds, three assists, and three blocks. The series went to [[Oklahoma City]] for games three and four. The Thunder won both games including a 21 point win in game 4. [[Kevin Durant]] averaged 30.5 points in the two games to lead the Thunder. During the two games, the Thunder used their speed to run on the Lakers which translated into 24 fast-break points and 23 second-chance points in game 4.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nba/dailydime/_/page/dime-100424/daily-dime&lt;/ref&gt; In game 5 in L.A., Gasol and Bynum combined for 46 points, 22 rebounds, and six assists in a 111-87 win.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100427_OKC@LAL/lakers-bounce-back-to-drill-thunder-in-game-5-take-32-lead&lt;/ref&gt; Game six saw the Lakers returning to [[Oklahoma City]] were they could clinch the series with the win. The Lakers' bench outscored the Thunder's 30-16, however the Thunder claimed a one point lead with 3:04 to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thunder&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100430_LAL@OKC&lt;/ref&gt; With time winding down, Gasol caught an offensive rebound off of a missed jump shot by Bryant and scored a layup with 0.5 seconds remaining in the game for the win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thunder&quot;/&gt;

===Utah Jazz===
The Lakers next opponent was the [[Utah Jazz]] who advanced to the second round of the playoffs by defeating the [[Denver Nuggets]] 4-2. This was the third straight year the two teams met in the playoffs. The Lakers started off the first quarter shooting 79.8% from the field,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/100502_gameday_jazz.html&lt;/ref&gt; and leading by 10 at half time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game1&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100502_UTA@LAL&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers gave up the lead in the 4th quarter before Bryant scored 11 points in the final four minutes to lead the Lakers to a 104-99 victory.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Game1&quot;/&gt; Although Bryant had the most successful night in game 2, it was the Lakers front court of Gasol, Bynum, and Odom who dominated the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game2&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100504_UTA@LAL Lakers use size advantage to tune out Jazz, take 2-0 series lead] [[CBSSports.com]] wire reports&lt;/ref&gt; Each had at least 11 points, 14 rebounds, and two blocks while the team outrebounded the Jazz 58-40 to a 111-103 victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game2&quot;/&gt; [[Andrei Kirilenko (basketball)|Andrei Kirilenko]] returned in game 3 from more than a month out with a strained left calf. While the Lakers' big men were dominate in the first two games, they had to rely on their backcourt in game 3 with Bynum and Odom being held in check.&lt;ref name=&quot;game3&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100508_LAL@UTA&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz coach [[Jerry Sloan]] said the Jazz's effort to keep the Lakers out of the middle opened up some 3-point shots and Los Angeles capitalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;game3&quot;/&gt; Artest scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half while overcoming his three-point range slump in the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;game3&quot;/&gt; The fourth quarter had 12 lead changes, including Bryant and Fisher making back-to-back 3-pointers during an 8-2 run in the final minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;game3&quot;/&gt; In the final four seconds, [[Deron Williams]] missed a shot and [[Wesley Matthews]] rebound and tip missed just before the end of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;game3&quot;/&gt; The Lakers won 111-110 and were on the verge of sweeping the Jazz. In game four, the Lakers jumped ahead and led by 22 points in the first half. The Jazz opened the third quarter with an 11-2 run and were able to cut the lead to 70-65, but the Lakers responded by  finishing the period on a 10-2 run and led 80-67 at the end of the third quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game4&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100510_LAL@UTA&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers led by 10 for most of the 4th quarter. Coach Phil Jackson called it &quot;the first really consistent game we have played...We controlled the game and forced our will on our opponent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game4&quot;/&gt; Bryant scored at least 30 points in all four games and the Lakers swept the series 4-0.

===Phoenix Suns===
The Lakers then faced the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the Western Conference Finals. In game 1, the Lakers blew out the Suns 128-107 led by Bryant's 40 points including 23 in the third quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns1&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100517_PHO@LAL&lt;/ref&gt; Odom came off the bench to tally 19 points, 19 rebounds, and three assists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns1&quot;/&gt; In game 2 Bryant played the role of facilitator, putting up 13 assists, while Gasol recorded 29 points, 9 rebounds, and five assists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns2&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100519_PHO@LAL&lt;/ref&gt; The teams were tied at 90-90 heading into the fourth quarter, but Bryant and Gasol led the fourth quarter rally and the Lakers won the game 124-112.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns2&quot;/&gt; Game 3 was played in Phoenix, where the Suns used their big men and physical play to win the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns3&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100523_LAL@PHO&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] scored 42 points and grabbed 11 rebounds while [[Robin Lopez]] 20 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns3&quot;/&gt; Odom and Bynum, however, both picked up fouls early and were ineffective for the Lakers for most of the game. The Lakers only scored 15 points in the second quarter and were down 86-84 in after three quarters. The Lakers were able to take the lead 90-89 with 8:47 to play, but the Suns rallied back to win 118-109. After battling each other in game 4 and slugging out a 23-23 first quarter, the Suns erupted for a 41 points in the second quarter, shooting 74%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns4&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100525_LAL@PHO&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 4th quarter the Lakers led 87-85. However, the Suns reserve players (who outscored the Lakers reserves 54-20) produced and 18-3 run in the 4th which the Lakers never recovered from despite Bryant's 38 points and 10 assists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns4&quot;/&gt; In game 5, the Lakers surged to a 16 point lead in the first half including a 21-4 run and led by 18 points by half time. Steve Nash, who had 29 points and 11 assists in the game, led the Suns to a 16-4 rally in the third quarter to trim the lead to six by the end of the period and one with 2:52 left in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns5&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100527_PHO@LAL&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Richardson]] made a three pointer with 3.5 seconds left in the game to tie the score 101-101.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns5&quot;/&gt;On the next possession, Bryant, who had 30 points and 11 assists in the game, missed a shot, but Artest got the offensive rebound and made the game winning layup as time expired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns5&quot;/&gt; In game 6 in Phoenix, the Lakers had the lead for most of the game. Los Angeles outscored the Suns 23-10 over the last eight minutes of the second quarter to lead 65-53 at the break and were up by 17 entering the fourth. However the Suns went on a 16-4 run and cut the Lakers lead to 95-90 with 6:09 remaining in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns6&quot;&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20100529_LAL@PHO&lt;/ref&gt; Artest scored 25 in the game and Bryant had a 37 point performance including nine points in the final two minutes to win the game 111-103 and clinch the series 4-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suns6&quot;/&gt;
