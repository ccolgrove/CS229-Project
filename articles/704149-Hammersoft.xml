'''Amanda Barrie ''' (born 14 September 1935) is an [[English people|English]] actress.

==Career==
Born as '''Shirley Anne Broadbent,''' Barrie attended St Anne's College, [[Lytham St Annes|St Anne's on Sea]]. She then trained at the [[Arts Educational School]] in [[London]] and later at [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]]. She appeared in pantomime as a child and was a dancer before acting in a number of [[British television]] and [[British film|film]] roles in the 1960s and 1970s. She was also in two of the [[Carry On films]], a long-running series of British comedy films: she had a supporting turn as a cab driver in ''[[Carry On Cabby]]'' (1963) and took the title role in ''[[Carry on Cleo]]'' (1964).

Barrie is well-known for her role as a cafÃ© proprietor's wife, [[Alma Sedgewick]] (later Baldwin), on ''[[Coronation Street]]''. She was a bit-player in the early to mid-1980s before she was offered a contract in 1988, after which she became a very well known character. She continued in the role until her retirement in 2001. In the story, Alma was diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] which later caused her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/27/27697_alma_blasts_street.html &quot;Alma blasts Street&quot;.] ''[[Manchester Evening News]]''. 18 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Coronation Street]]'' was but a stepping stone on her path to becoming an international star of stage and screen.

Since leaving ''Coronation Street'', she continued to act in the popular [[ITV1]] prison series, ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'', playing inmate Bev Tull from the fifth series to the last, along with Phyl Oswyn played by [[Stephanie Beacham]]. The characters together were known as &quot;The Costa Cons&quot;. She also became one of the celebrities who took part in ''[[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]''; a popular ITV1 &quot;[[reality TV]]&quot; series which screened in 2004. While on the show, she became so frustrated with [[Gordon Ramsay]], that she tried to slap him across the face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktCPMOS4uwU&amp;feature=related Amanda Barrie hitting Gordon Ramsay].

From November 2006 to January 2007, Amanda took a starring role in the [[pantomime]] adaption of ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' in [[Canterbury]]. From December 2007 to January 2008, she appeared as the Fairy Godmother in the pantomime adaption of ''[[Cinderella]]'' at the Gordon Craig Theatre in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecomet.net/search/story.aspx?brand=CMTOnline&amp;category=News&amp;itemid=WEED27%20Sep%202007%2011:00:05:620&amp;tBrand=CMTOnline&amp;tCategory=search|title=Having a ball|publisher=''The Comet''|date=27 September 2007|accessdate=2007-10-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 2008 to January 2009, she played the Fairy Godmother in ''[[Cinderella]]'' at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool.
