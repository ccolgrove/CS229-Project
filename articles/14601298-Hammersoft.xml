Strauss picked up the [[electric guitar]] at age 14, and began playing in rock bands in the late [[1960s]]. In 1971 he formed the first Israeli Blues band, and wrote one of the first Israeli [[Twelve-bar blues]];  &quot; I got a Telephone, Ain't got no one to call &quot;.
Drawn to jazz guitar, Avner went to Boston in 1975 to study at the [[Berklee College of Music]] (Composition, graduated in 1978).

Upon returning to Israel in 1978, he began recording and teaching music, and received an appointment as a guitar professor at the [[Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance]].
