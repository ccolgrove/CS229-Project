Jerusalem is a holy city to the three major [[Abrahamic religions]]â [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. In Judaism, Jerusalem has been the holiest city since, according to the Biblical Old Testament, King [[David]] of Israel first established it as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united Kingdom of Israel]] in c. 1000 BCE, and his son [[Solomon]] commissioned the building of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|First Temple]] in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;1000BCE&quot;&gt;Since the 10th century BCE:{{ref label|bible-david|v|a}}

In exile, the Jewish nation came to be identified with the city that had been the site of its ancient capital. Jews, wherever they were, prayed for its restoration.&quot; Roger Friedland, Richard D.

Today, the [[Positions on Jerusalem|status of Jerusalem]] remains one of the core issues in the [[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict]]. During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], [[West Jerusalem]] was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel, while [[East Jerusalem]] was captured by [[Jordan]]. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and subsequently annexed it. Currently, Israel's [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law]] refers to Jerusalem as the country's &quot;undivided capital&quot;.

A city called ''RuÅ¡alimum'' or ''UruÅ¡alimum'' (Foundation of [[Shalem]]) &lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen J.

Binz, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; appears in ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] records as the first two references to Jerusalem, dating back to the 19th and 18th centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;G.Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren (eds.) ''Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament'', (tr.David E.Green) William B.Eerdmann, Grand Rapids Michigan, Cambridge, UK 1990, Vol. VI, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/semitic/EA263-end.html |title='&amp;#39;The El Amarna Letters from Canaan'&amp;#39; |publisher=Tau.ac.il |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;The name recurs in [[Akkadian]] [[cuneiform]] as UruÅ¡alim, in the Amarna tablets datable to the 1400-1360 BCE. The name âJerusalemâ is variously etymologised to mean âfoundation (Sumerian ''yeru'', âsettlementâ/Semitic ''yry,''  âfoundâ) of the god [[Shalem]]â,  âdwelling of peaceâ, âfounded in safetyâ,&lt;ref&gt;Marten H.Wouldstra, ''The Book of Joshua,'' William B.Eerdmanns Co. Grand Rapids, Michigan (1981) 1995 p.169 n.2&lt;/ref&gt;, or to mean  âSalem gives instructionâ (''yrh'', âshow, teach, instructâ). The god Shalem has a special relationship with Jerusalem. &lt;ref&gt;G.Johannes Bottereck, Helmer Ringgren, Heinz-Josef Fabry, (eds.) ''Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament,'' tr. David E.Green, vol.XV, pp.48-49 William B.Eeerdmanns Co.Grand Rapids, Michigan/Cambridge UK 2006 pp.45-6&lt;/ref&gt;.  Others dismiss the Sumerian link, and point to ''yarah'', Semitic/Hebrew for âto lay a cornerstoneâ, yielding the idea of laying a cornerstone to the temple of the god Shalem, who was a member of the West Semitic pantheon (Akkadian ''Shalim'', Assyrian ''Shulmanu''), the god of the setting sun and the nether world, as well as of health and perfection.&lt;ref&gt; Meir Ben-Dov, ''Historical Atlas of Jerusalem,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002 p.23. &lt;/ref&gt;

The form ''Yerushalayim'' (Jerusalem) first appears in the Bible, in the book of Joshua. This form has the appearance of a [[portmanteau]] (blend) of ''Yireh'' (an abiding place of the fear and the service of God) &lt;ref name=&quot;Louis Ginzberg&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/1lotj10.txt ''The Legends of the Jews'' Volume 1] by Louis Ginzberg, Release Date: October, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the original root [[S-L-M]] and is not a simple phonetic evolution of the form in the [[Amarna letters]].

Given the city's central position in both Israeli nationalism ([[Zionism]]) and [[Palestinian nationalism]], the selectivity required to summarise more than 5,000 years of inhabited history is often&lt;ref name=&quot;bishara&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2010/995/focus.htm |title= A brief note on Jerusalem |author=[[Azmi Bishara]] |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pipes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2002/05/counterfeit-history-jerusalem |title= Constructing a Counterfeit History of Jerusalem |author=[[Daniel Pipes]] |accessdate=22 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by ideological bias or background (see [[Historiography and nationalism]]). For example, the Jewish periods of the city's history are important to Israeli nationalists ([[Zionists]]), whose [[discourse]] suggests that modern Jews descend from the [[Israelites]] and [[Maccabees]],&lt;ref&gt;âNo city in the world, not even Athens or Rome, ever played as great a role in the life of a nation for so long a time, as Jerusalem has done in the life of the Jewish people.â [[David Ben-Gurion]], 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;âFor three thousand years, Jerusalem has been the center of Jewish hope and longing. No other city has played such a dominant role in the history, culture, religion and consciousness of a people as has Jerusalem in the life of Jewry and Judaism. Throughout centuries of exile, Jerusalem remained alive in the hearts of Jews everywhere as the focal point of Jewish history, the symbol of ancient glory, spiritual fulfillment and modern renewal. This heart and soul of the Jewish people engenders the thought that if you want one simple word to symbolize all of Jewish history, that word would be âJerusalem.ââ [[Teddy Kollek]] (DC: Washington Institute For Near East Policy, 1990), pp. 19â20.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the Islamic, Christian and other non-Jewish periods of the city's history are important to [[Palestinian nationalism]], whose [[discourse]] suggests that modern [[Palestinians]] descend from all the different peoples who have lived in the region.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: [[Canaanites]], [[Jebusites]], [[Philistines]] from [[Crete]], Anatolian and [[Lydia]]n Greeks, [[Hebrews]], [[Amorites]], [[Edomites]], [[Nabateans]], [[Arameans]], [[Roman empire|Romans]], Arabs, and European [[Crusades|crusaders]], to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Hittites]], [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Babylonians]], and [[Mongols]], were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were as ravaging as the effects of major earthquakes&amp;nbsp;... Like shooting stars, the various cultures shine for a brief moment before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine. The people, however, survive. In their customs and manners, fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernityâalbeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and [[Arabic culture]].&quot; Ali Qleibo, Palestinian anthropologist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;(With reference to Palestinians in [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] times) Although proud of their [[Arab]] heritage and ancestry, the [[Palestinians]] considered themselves to be descended not only from Arab conquerors of the seventh century but also from [[indigenous peoples]] who had lived in the country since time immemorial, including the ancient [[Hebrews]] and the [[Canaanites]] before them. Acutely aware of the distinctiveness of Palestinian history, the Palestinians saw themselves as the heirs of its rich associations.&quot; [[Walid Khalidi]], 1984, ''Before Their Diaspora: A Photographic History of the Palestinians, 1876â1948''.

When Macedonian ruler [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], Jerusalem and [[Judea]] came under Macedonian control, eventually falling to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] under [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]]. In 198 BCE, [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes|Ptolemy V]] lost Jerusalem and [[Judea]] to the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] under [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]].

The eastern continuation of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], maintained control of the city for years.

Following [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] [[Khosrau II]]'s early 7th century push into [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], advancing through Syria, Sassanid Generals [[Shahrbaraz]] and [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] attacked the Byzantine-controlled city of Jerusalem ({{lang-fa|Dej Houdkh}}).

Jerusalem is considered the third holiest city (after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) in the [[Sunni]] denomination of [[Islam]]. Among [[Muslims]] of Islam's earliest era it was referred to as ''Madinat bayt al-Maqdis'' (&quot;City of the Temple&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Dov, M. ''Historical Atlas of Jerusalem''. Translated by David Louvish. New York: Continuum, 2002, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; which was restricted to the Temple Mount.

In 1244, Jerusalem was sacked by the [[KhwÄrazm-ShÄh dynasty|Khwarezmian]] [[Tatars|Tartars]], who decimated the city's Christian population and drove out the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khwarezmian Tartars were driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247. From 1250 to 1517, Jerusalem was ruled by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]s. During this period of time many clashes occurred between the Mamluks on one side and the crusaders and the [[Mongols]] on the other side. The area also suffered from many earthquakes and [[Black Death|black plague]].

===Early modern period===
[[File:DavtowerS.jpg|thumb|David's Citadel and the Ottoman walls]]
In 1517, Jerusalem and environs fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], who generally remained in control until 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;century1&quot; /&gt; Jerusalem enjoyed a prosperous period of renewal and peace under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] â including the rebuilding of magnificent walls around the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. Throughout much of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem remained a provincial, if religiously important center, and did not straddle the main trade route between [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Cohen. &quot;Economic Life in Ottoman Jerusalem&quot;; Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  The English reference book ''Modern history or the present state of all nations'' written in 1744 stated that &quot;Jerusalem is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Modern history or the present state of all nations|last= Salmon|first= Thomas|page= 461| year= 1744|url= http://books.google.com/?id=f7I-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA534&amp;dq=palestine#v=onepage&amp;q=palestine&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans brought many innovations: modern postal systems run by the various consulates; the use of the wheel for modes of transportation; stagecoach and carriage, the wheelbarrow and the cart; and the oil-lantern, among the first signs of modernization in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;[http://jeru.huji.ac.il/eh1.htm The Jerusalem Mosaic], Hebrew University, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 19th century, the Ottomans constructed the first paved road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and by 1892 the railroad had reached the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;

===Modern period===
[[File:Ben Zakai.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ben-Zakai Synagogue in 1893]]
With the annexation of Jerusalem by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city. In 1836, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] allowed Jerusalem's Jewish residents to restore four major synagogues, among them the [[Hurva Synagogue|Hurva]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Qasim al-Ahmad led his forces from [[Nablus]] and attacked Jerusalem, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, entered the city on 31 May 1834.

Ottoman rule was reinstated in 1840, but many Egyptian Muslims remained in Jerusalem and Jews from [[Algiers]] and North Africa began to settle in the city in growing numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt; In the 1840s and 1850s, the international powers began a tug-of-war in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the region's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through consular representatives in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Judaica'', Jerusalem, Keter, 1978, Volume 9, &quot;State of Israel (Historical Survey)&quot;, pp.304â306&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prussian consul, the population in 1845 was 16,410, with 7,120 Jews, 5,000 Muslims, 3,390 Christians, 800 Turkish soldiers and 100 Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt; The volume of Christian pilgrims increased under the Ottomans, doubling the city's population around Easter time.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, new neighborhoods began to develop outside the Old City walls to house pilgrims and relieve the intense overcrowding and poor sanitation inside the city. The [[Russian Compound]] and [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]] were founded in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eylon |first=Lili |title=Jerusalem: Architecture in the Late Ottoman Period |work=Focus on Israel |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |month=April |year=1999 |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfaarchive/1990_1999/1999/4/focus%20on%20israel-%20jerusalem%20-%20architecture%20in%20the%20l |accessdate=20 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867 an American Missionary reports an estimated population of Jerusalem of 'above' 15,000, with 4,000 to 5,000 Jews and 6,000 Muslims.

As the British Mandate for Palestine was expiring, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 UN Partition Plan]] recommended &quot;the creation of a special international regime in the City of Jerusalem, constituting it as a ''[[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]]'' under the administration of the UN.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/52b7d0e66142a40e85256dc70072b982/6362111f689724d705256601007063f2!OpenDocument|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145437/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/52b7d0e66142a40e85256dc70072b982/6362111f689724d705256601007063f2!OpenDocument|archivedate=26 January 2008 |publisher=The United Nations |date=22 January 1948 |accessdate=3 February 2007 |title=Considerations Affecting Certain of the Provisions of the General Assembly Resolution on the &quot;Future Government of Palestine&quot;: The City of Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international regime (which also included the city of [[Bethlehem]]) was to remain in force for a period of ten years, whereupon a [[referendum]] was to be held in which the residents were to decide the future regime of their city. However, this plan was not implemented, as the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war|1948 war erupted]], while the British withdrew from Palestine and [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israel declared its independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lapidoth&quot;/&gt; The war led to displacement of Arab and Jewish populations in the city.

The war of 1948 resulted in Jerusalem being divided, with the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] lying entirely on the Jordanian side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|line]]. A no-man's land between East and West Jerusalem came into being in November 1948: [[Moshe Dayan]], commander of the Israeli forces in Jerusalem, met with his Jordanian counterpart [[Abdullah el Tell]] in a deserted house in Jerusalemâs [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara]] neighborhood and marked out their respective positions: Israelâs position in red and Jordan's in green. This rough map, which was not meant as an official one, became the final [[Green Line (Israel)|line]] in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], which divided the city and left [[Mount Scopus]] as an Israeli [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] inside [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jposttravel.com/jerusalem_tours/FormerIsrael1008.html |title=No Man's Land |publisher=Jposttravel.com |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbed wire and concrete barriers ran down the center of the city, passing close by [[Jaffa Gate]] on the western side of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]], and a crossing point was established at [[Mandelbaum Gate]] slightly to the north of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]]. Military skirmishes frequently threatened the ceasefire. After the establishment of the State of Israel, Jerusalem was declared its capital. Jordan formally annexed East Jerusalem in 1950, subjecting it to Jordanian law.&lt;ref name=&quot;lapidoth&quot;&gt;{{cite web

After 1948, since the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] in its entirety was to the east of the armistice line, [[Jordan]] was able to take control of all the holy places therein, and contrary to the terms of the armistice agreement, denied Jews access to Jewish holy sites, many of which were desecrated. Jordan allowed only very limited access to Christian holy sites.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert, [http://www.mefacts.com/cache/html/wall-ruling_/11362.htm &quot;Jerusalem: A Tale of One City&quot;], ''The New Republic'', 14 Nov. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 58 synagogues in the Old City, half were either razed or converted to stables and hen-houses over the course of the next 19 years, including the [[Hurva]] and the [[Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue]].

The Jewish Quarter became known as ''Harat al-Sharaf'', and was resettled with refugees from the 1948 war. In 1966 the Jordanian authorities relocated 500 of them to the [[Shuafat|Shua'fat refugee camp]] as part of plans to redevelop the area.&lt;ref&gt;Doson, Nandita and Sabbah, Abdul Wahad (editors) ''Stories from our Mothers'' (2010).

In 1967, despite Israeli pleas that Jordan remain neutral during the [[Six-Day War]], [[Six-Day War#West Bank|Jordanian forces attacked Israeli-held West Jerusalem on the war's second day]]. After hand to hand fighting between Israeli and Jordanian soldiers on the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Israel Defense Force]] captured East Jerusalem, along with the entire West Bank. East Jerusalem, along with some nearby West Bank territory, was subsequently annexed by Israel. On 27 June 1967, a few weeks after the war ended, Israel extended its law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem and some surrounding area, incorporating it into the Jerusalem Municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/13+Law+and+Administration+Ordinance+-Amendment+No.htm |title=13 Law and Administration Ordinance -Amendment No |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although at the time Israel informed the [[United Nations]] that its measures constituted administrative and municipal integration rather than annexation, later rulings by the Israeli Supreme Court indicated that the eastern sector of Jerusalem had become part of Israel. In 1980, Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] as an addition to its [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Laws]], which declared Jerusalem the &quot;complete and united&quot; capital of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1980_1989/Basic%20Law-%20Jerusalem-%20Capital%20of%20Israel |publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=Basic Law- Jerusalem- Capital of Israel |accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jewish and Christian access to the holy sites inside the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] was restored. Israel left the [[Temple Mount]] under the jurisdiction of an Islamic ''[[waqf]]'', but opened the [[Western Wall]] to Jewish access. The [[Moroccan Quarter]], which was located adjacent to the Western Wall, was evacuated and razed&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Khalidi, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/195696.pdf &quot;The Future of Arab Jerusalem&quot;] ''British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (1992), pp. 133â143&lt;/ref&gt; to make way for a plaza for those visiting the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=6 |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |accessdate=20 July 2008 |year=1988 |title=Jerusalem's Holy Places and the Peace Process}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, Arabs living in the Jewish Quarter were also evicted. On April 18, 1968, the Israeli Treasury Ministry official expropriated the land of the former Moroccan Quarter and the Jewish Quarter for public use, and offered 200 [[Jordanian dinar]]s to each displaced Arab family. 

Israel subsequently built Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem, and settled Jews in Arab neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowen|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10656890 |title=House-by-house struggle for East Jerusalem|publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the annexation, Israel conducted a census of Arab residents in the areas annexed. Residents present at the time of the census were given permanent residency status, with the option of applying for citizenship. 

The annexation of East Jerusalem was met with international criticism. Following the passing of the [[Jerusalem Law]], the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|a resolution]] that declared the law &quot;a violation of international law&quot; and requested all member states to withdraw all remaining embassies from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/399/71/IMG/NR039971.pdf?OpenElement |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=30 July 2008 |year=1980 |title=Resolution 478 (1980)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In biblical times, Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of [[almond]], [[olive]] and [[pine]] trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the Jerusalem region thus built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

{{Main|Demographics of Jerusalem}}
In December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600â64% were Jewish, 32% Muslim, and 2% Christian.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa-40th&quot;/&gt; At the end of 2005, the population density was {{convert|5750.4|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st02_14.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |title=Population and Density per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Localities Numbering Above 5,000 Residents on 31 XII 2005 |year=2006 |accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim [[birth rate]], and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/09/26/mideast.jerusalem.reut/index.html &quot;Arab population growth outpaces Jews in Jerusalem&quot;] Reuters, 26 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kiryat sanz.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Kiryat Sanz, Jerusalem|Kiryat Sanz]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] neighborhood]]
In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high [[birth rate]], especially in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] and [[Arab people|Arab]]communities. Consequently, the [[total fertility rate]] in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Har Homa, Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Har Homa]]]]
In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)âsimilar to Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot; /&gt; This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades. In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3254277,00.html |publisher=YNet |title=Jerusalem: More tourists, fewer Jews|accessdate=10 March 2007 |last=Sel |first=Neta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] are leaving in higher numbers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Many people are moving to the suburbs and coastal cities in search of cheaper housing and a more secular lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish-drop&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/jerus.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060909060853/http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/jerus.htm|archivedate=9 September 2006 |publisher=The Washington Post via Cornell University |title=Jewish Drop In Jerusalem Worries Israel |last=Hockstader |first=Lee |accessdate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, the percentage of Haredim in the city was increasing. As of 2009, out of 150,100 schoolchildren, 59,900 or 40% are in state-run secular and [[Religious Zionism|National Religious]] schools, while 90,200 or 60% are in Haredi schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/165421|title=Most Jerusalemites Attend Hareidi-Religious Schools|publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]|accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1086819.html|title=Most of Jerusalem's non-Jewish children live below poverty line|author=Nadav Shragai|publisher=Haaretz|date=21 May 2009|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some Israelis see Jerusalem as poor, rundown and riddled with religious and political tension, the city has been a magnet for Palestinians, offering more jobs and opportunity than any city in the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip]]. Palestinian officials have encouraged Arabs over the years to stay in the city to maintain their claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-orthodox5jun05,1,1841144.story?page=2&amp;coll=la-util-nationworld-world|title=Clashing values alter a city's face|author=Richard Boudreaux|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/weekinreview/13myre.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=Israeli Riddle: Love Jerusalem, Hate Living There|author=Greg Myre|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinians are attracted to the access to jobs, [[health care|healthcare]], [[social security]], other benefits, and [[quality of life]] Israel provides to Jerusalem residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-barrier4jun04,1,5137437.story?coll=la-util-nationworld-world|title=Change cast in concrete|author=Ken Ellingwood|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab residents of Jerusalem who choose not to have Israeli citizenship are granted an Israeli identity card that allows them to pass through checkpoints with relative ease and to travel throughout Israel, making it easier to find work. Residents also are entitled to the subsidized healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides its citizens. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighborhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as [[Hadassah Medical Center]] are available to residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-barrier4jun04,1,5853828,full.story|title=Change cast in concrete|author=Ken Ellingwood|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority proposed expanding city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;laub2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120200463_pf.html |title=Jerusalem Barrier Causes Major Upheaval |date=2 December 2006 |publisher=The Associated Press via The Washington Post |last=Laub |first=Karin |accessdate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of [[Judaization of Jerusalem|efforts to promote a Jewish majority]] in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Hodgkins, &quot;The Judaization of Jerusalem â Israeli Policies Since 1967&quot;; PASSIA publication No. 101, December 1996, (English, Pp. 88)&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[World Bank]] report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighborhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and &quot;the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators&quot; than Jewish violators of the permit process.&lt;ref name = &quot;worldbank&quot;/&gt; In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the [[City of David]] archaeological park in the 60% Arab neighborhood of [[Silwan]] (adjacent to the Old City),&lt;ref&gt;Meron Rapoport.[http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=530047&amp;contrassID=1 Land lords]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}; Haaretz, 20 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Tolerance]] on [[Mamilla]] cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank&quot;&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WestBankrestrictions9Mayfinal.pdf &quot;Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency&quot;]; World Bank Technical Team, 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esther Zandberg.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/825662.html &quot;The architectural conspiracy of silence&quot;]; Haaretz, 24 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents view such urban planning moves as geared towards the [[Judaization of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Allison Hodgkins.

==Local government==
[[File:KikarsafraS.jpg|thumb|[[Safra Square]], Jerusalem City Hall]]
The Jerusalem [[city council|City Council]] is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, [[Uri Lupolianski]], was elected in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;corridors&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1173879092720&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=28 March 2007 |date=15 March 2007 |title=Corridors of Power: A tale of two councils |last=Cidor |first=Peggy}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 2008 city elections, [[Nir Barkat]] came out as the winner and is now the mayor. Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was [[Teddy Kollek]], who spent 28 yearsâ-six consecutive terms-âin office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;corridors&quot; /&gt; Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jerusalem Becomes A Battleground Over Gay Rights Vs.

The headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at [[Safra Square]] (''Kikar Safra'') on [[Jaffa Road]]. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/site_form_atar_eng.asp?site_id=147&amp;pic_cat=2&amp;icon_cat=6&amp;york_cat=7 |publisher=The Municipality of Jerusalem |accessdate=24 April 2007 |title=Safra Square â City Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city falls under the [[Jerusalem District]], with Jerusalem as the district's capital.

Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] passed by the UN in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a [[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]] administered by the United Nations. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the [[Arab Higher Committee]] in Palestine and the [[Arab League]]) rejected it, opposing any partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Palestinian refugees in Jordan 1948â1957 |last=Plascov |first=Avi |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0714631202 |page=2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=daLPXTYcoewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q= |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jerusalem question, 1917â1968 |last=Bovis |first=H.

The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty in the city.
On 5 December 1949, the State of Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's capital,&lt;ref name=&quot;ben-gurion&quot; /&gt; and since then all branches of the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]]â[[Politics of Israel#Legislative branch|legislative]], [[Politics of Israel#Judicial system|judicial]], and [[Politics of Israel#Prime Ministers and governments in the last ten years|executive]]âhave resided there, except for the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]], located at [[HaKirya]] in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4181.IH: |publisher=The Library of Congress |title=Jerusalem and Berlin Embassy Relocation Act of 1998 |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the proclamation, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan and thus only West Jerusalem was proclaimed Israel's capital. Following the Six-Day War, Israel annexed East Jerusalem, and a provision stipulating that the city was the united capital of Israel was added to the country's Basic Law.&lt;ref name=&quot;basiclaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1980_1989/Basic%20Law-%20Jerusalem-%20Capital%20of%20Israel |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2 April 2007 |date=30 July 1980 |title=Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not internationally recognised as the Israeli capital, and its status is one of the central controversies in the Middle East.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]], passed on 20 August 1980, declared that the Basic Law was &quot;null and void and must be rescinded forthwith&quot;. Member states were advised to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem as a punitive measure. Most of the remaining countries with embassies in Jerusalem complied with the resolution by relocating them to Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Currently, there are no embassies located within the city limits of Jerusalem, although there are embassies in [[Mevaseret Zion]], on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and four consulates in the city itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;foreign-embassies&quot; /&gt; In 1995, the United States Congress had planned to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with the passage of the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ45/content-detail.html |title=Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=15 February 2007 |date=8 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] have argued that Congressional resolutions regarding the status of Jerusalem are merely advisory. The Constitution reserves foreign relations as an executive power, and as such, the United States embassy is still in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/print/20020930-8.html |title=Statement on FY 2003 Foreign Relations Authorization Act |accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2009, United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] warned that Jerusalem must be the capital of both Israel and Palestine if peace is to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=32762&amp;Cr=jerusalem&amp;Cr1= |title=Jerusalem must be capital of both Israel and Palestine, Ban says |publisher=United Nations  |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]]. The Palestinian Authority claims all of East Jerusalem, including the [[Temple Mount]], as the capital of the [[State of Palestine]], and claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an [[open city]].&lt;ref name=PalestinianPosition&gt;In the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]'s [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] of 1988, Jerusalem is stated to be the capital of the [[State of Palestine]]. In 2000 the [[Palestinian Authority]] passed a law designating the city as such, and in 2002 this law was ratified by Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]]. See [http://english.people.com.cn/200210/06/eng20021006_104530.shtml Arafat Signs Law Making Jerusalem Palestinian Capital], People's Daily, published October 6, 2002; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2302961.stm Arafat names Jerusalem as capital], BBC News, published October 6, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister [[Moshe Kahlon]] said that the bill sent &quot;a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided&quot;, and that &quot;all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over {{sic|it's}} capital are mistaken and misleading&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tzippe Barrow |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2010/October/Bill-to-Grant-Jerusalem-Priority-Status/ |title=Bill to Grant Jerusalem Priority Status â Inside Israel â CBN News â Christian News 24â7 |publisher=CBN.com |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 1967, the government of [[Levi Eshkol]] extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm|title=Jerusalem in International Diplomacy|author=[[Dore Gold]] |accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Israel ordered the closure of [[Orient House]], home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], for security reasons.

Due to its proximity to the city, especially the [[Temple Mount]], [[Abu Dis]], a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, Mitchell G.
