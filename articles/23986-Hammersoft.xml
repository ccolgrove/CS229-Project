'''Pegasus''' (Greek ''Î Î®Î³Î±ÏÎ¿Ï/Pegasos'', Latin ''Pegasus'') is one of the best known fantastical as well as mythological creatures in [[Greek mythology]]. He is a winged divine horse, usually white in color. He was sired by [[Poseidon]], in his role as horse-god, and foaled by the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Medusa, in her archaic [[centaur]]-like form. He appears in the incised relief on a mid-7th century BCE vase from [[Boeotia]] at the [[Louvre]] (CA795), illustrated in John Boardman, Jasper Griffin and Oswyn Murray, ''Greece and the Hellenistic World'' (Oxford University Press) 1988, fig p 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the brother of [[Chrysaor]], born at a single birthing when his mother was decapitated by Perseus. Greco-Roman poets write about his ascent to heaven after his birth and his obeisance to [[Zeus]], king of the gods, who instructed him to bring lightning and thunder from Olympus. Friend of the Muses, Pegasus is the creator of [[Hippocrene]], the fountain on [[Mt. Helicon]]. He was captured by the Greek hero [[Bellerophon]] near the fountain Peirene with the help of Athena and Poseidon. Pegasus allows the hero to ride him to defeat a monster, the Chimera, before realizing many other exploits. His rider, however, falls off his back trying to reach Mount Olympus. Zeus transformed him into the constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] and placed him in the sky.
 
Hypotheses have been proposed regarding its relationship with the [[Muses]], the gods [[Athena]], [[Poseidon]], [[Zeus]], [[Apollo]], and the hero [[Perseus]].

The symbolism of Pegasus varies with time. Symbol of wisdom and especially of fame from the Middle Ages until the Renaissance, he became one symbol of the poetry and the creator of sources in which the poets come to draw inspiration, particularly in the 19th century. Pegasus is the subject of a very rich iconography, especially through the ancient Greek pottery and paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance. Personification of the water, solar myth, or shaman mount, Carl Jung and his followers have seen in Pegasus a profound symbolic esoteric in relation to the spiritual energy that allows to access to the realm of the gods on Mount Olympus.

In the 20th and 21st century, he appeared in movies, in fantasy, in video games and in role play, where by extension, the term Pegasus is often used to refer to any winged horse. In [[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]], [[Rainbow Dash]] and [[Fluttershy]] are some of several characters that appear as Pegasi types of ponies.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Ian-Hornak-Acrylic-Canvas-Pegasus-1991.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ian Hornak]], ''Pegasus'', Acrylic on Canvas, [[National Hellenic Museum]], 1991]]
The poet [[Hesiod]] connects the name ''Pegasus'' with the word for &quot;spring, well&quot;, ''pÄgÄ'': &quot;the ''pegai'' of [[Oceanus|Okeanos]], where he was born;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959:80: &quot;In the name Pegasos itself the connection with a spring, ''pege'', is expressed.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

A proposed etymology of the name is  [[Luwian language|Luwian]] ''pihassas'', meaning &quot;lightning&quot;, and ''Pihassassi'', a local Luwian-Hittite name in southern Cilicia of a weather god represented with thunder and lightning. The proponents of this etymology adduce Pegasus' role, reported as early as [[Hesiod]], as bringer of thunderbolts to Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;The connection of ''Pegasus'' with ''Pihassas'' was suggested by H.T. Bossert, &quot;Die phÃ¶nikisch-hethitischen Bilinguen vom Karatepe&quot;, ''Jahrbuch fÃ¼r kleinasiatische Forschung'', '''2''' 1952/53:333, P. Frei, &quot;Die Bellerophontessaga und das Alte Testament&quot;, in B. Janowski, K. Koch and G. Wilhelm, eds., ''Religionsgeschichtliche Beziehungen zwischen Kleinasien, Nordsyrien und der Alte Testament'', 1993:48f, and Hutter, &quot;Der luwische Wettergott ''pihaÅ¡saÅ¡si'' under der griechischen Pegasos&quot;, in Chr. Zinko, ed. ''Studia Onomastica et Indogermanica...'' 1995:79-98, all noted in Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2009:207f.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Fox (2009) criticizes this suggestion, saying that the connection of Pegasus with lightning bolts may be secondary, based on the &quot;like-sounding name&quot; of the Luwian god.&lt;ref&gt;
 &quot;a storm god is not the origin of a horse. However, he had a like-sounding name, and Greek visitors to [[Cilicia]] may have connected their existing Pegasus with [[Zeus]]'s lightning after hearing about this 'Pihassassi' and his functions and assuming, wrongly, he was their own Pegasus in a foreign land.&quot; Fox 2009:208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pegasus and springs==
[[File:Pegaz Opera PoznaÅ.jpg|thumb|right|Pegasus, as the horse of Muses, was put on the roof of PoznaÅ Opera House ([[Max Littmann]], 1910)]]
According to legend, everywhere the winged horse struck his hoof to the earth, an inspiring spring burst forth. One of these springs was upon the [[Muse]]s' [[Mount Helicon]], the ''[[Hippocrene]]'' (&quot;horse spring&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], 9. 31. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; opened, [[Antoninus Liberalis]] suggested,&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'' 9&lt;/ref&gt; at the behest of [[Poseidon]] to prevent the [[mountain]] swelling with rapture at the song of the Muses; another was at [[Troezen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias,  2. 31. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod relates how Pegasus was peacefully drinking from a spring when the hero [[Bellerophon]] captured him.  Hesiod also says Pegasus carried [[thunderbolt]]s for [[Zeus]].

==Birth==
There are several versions of the birth of the winged stallion and his brother [[Chrysaor]] in the far distant place at the edge of Earth, Hesiod's &quot;springs of Oceanus, which encircles the inhabited earth, where [[Perseus]] found [[Medusa]]:

One is that they sprang from the blood issuing from Medusa's neck as [[Perseus]] was beheading her,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' 281; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2. 42, ''et al.'' Harris, Stephen L. and Gloria Platzner. ''Classical Mythology: Images and Insights.'' 2nd ed. (New York: Mayfield Publishing), 1998. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the manner in which [[Athena]] was born from the head of Zeus. In another version, when Perseus beheaded Medusa, they were born of the Earth, fed by the Gorgon's blood. A variation of this story holds that they were formed from the mingling of Medusa's blood, Pain and sea foam, implying that Poseidon had involvement in their making. The last version bears resemblance to the birth of [[Aphrodite]].

==Bellerophon==
Pegasus aided the hero [[Bellerophon]] in his fight against both the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] and the [[Amazons]]. There are varying tales as to how Bellerophon found Pegasus; the most common&lt;ref&gt;For example in [[Pindar]], Olympian Ode 13.&lt;/ref&gt; says that the hero was told by [[Polyeidos]] to sleep in the [[Parthenon|temple of Athena]], where the goddess visited him in the night and presented him with a golden bridle. The next morning, still clutching the bridle, he found Pegasus drinking at the [[Pierian]] spring

==Perseus==

Michaud's ''Biographie universelle'' relates that when Pegasus was born, he flew to where thunder and lightning is released. Then, according to certain versions of the myth, Athena tamed him and gave him to Perseus, who flew to Ethiopia to help Andromeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaud&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

In fact Pegasus is a late addition to the story of  Perseus, who flew on his own with the sandals loaned him by [[Hermes]].

==Olympus==
Pegasus and Athena left Bellerophon and continued to Olympus where he was stabled with [[Zeus]]' other steeds, and was given the task of carrying [[Zeus]]' thunderbolts. Because of his faithful service to Zeus, he was honored with transformation into a [[Pegasus (constellation)|constellation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aratus]], ''Phaenomena'' 206; Scott Littleton, ''Mythology.

==Legacy==
===World War II===
[[File:British Airborne Units.svg|thumb|The emblem of the World War II, British Airborne Forces, [[Bellerophon]] riding the flying horse Pegasus.]]
During [[World War II]], the silhouetted image of Bellerophon the warrior, mounted on the winged Pegasus, was adopted by the [[United Kingdom]]'s newly-raised parachute troops in 1941 as their upper sleeve insignia. The image clearly symbolized a warrior arriving at a battle by air, the same tactics used by [[paratrooper]]s. The square upper-sleeve insignia comprised Bellerophon/Pegasus in light blue on a maroon background. The insignia was designed by famous English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]], who was married to the commander of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] (and later the expanded British Airborne Forces), General [[Frederick Browning|Frederick &quot;Boy&quot; Browning]]. The maroon background on the insignia was later used again by the Airborne Forces when they adopted the famous maroon beret in Summer 1942. The beret was the origin of the German nickname for British airborne troops, The [[Red Devils (Parachute Regiment)|Red Devils]]. Today's [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] carries on the maroon beret tradition.

During the [[Operation Deadstick|airborne phase]] of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]] on the night of 5â6 June 1944, [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]] captured all its key objectives in advance of the seaborne assault, including the capture and holding at all costs of a vital bridge over the [[Canal de Caen Ã  la Mer|Caen Canal]], near [[Ouistreham]]. In memory of their tenacity, the bridge has been known ever since as [[Pegasus Bridge]].
