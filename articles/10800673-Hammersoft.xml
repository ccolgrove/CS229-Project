As ''Dynasty'' begins, the [[Carrington family|Carringtons']] longtime [[majordomo]] Joseph is fiercely loyal to the family and takes an immediate dislike to [[Blake Carrington]]'s new bride [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle]]. Krystle rises to the challenge and they eventually share a mutual respect. Joseph later shows a deeper loathing for [[Alexis Colby|Alexis]], Blake's first wife, which is later exacerbated by Alexis' ill treatment of Joseph's daughter, [[Kirby Anders|Kirby]]. At the end of Season Three, Alexis and Krystle are trapped in a cabin that is then set on fire; they survive, and it is eventually revealed that Joseph had set the fire in an effort to kill Alexis after she had threatened to disclose a secret related to Kirby's parentage. After learning this, Blake drives to Joseph's home but is too late, as the guilty Joseph has killed himself by way of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

In 1987, Alexis' new husband [[Sean Rowan]] has a secret; he is actually Joseph's son, in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] to exact his revenge on Alexis and the Carringtons. It is also revealed that Sean and Kirby have another sibling, Victoria.

[[Krystle Carrington|Krystle Jennings]]' former flame and a Denver-Carrington employee, Matthew returns to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] from the [[Middle East]] on the eve of Krystle's marriage to [[Blake Carrington]]. He struggles with his feelings for Krystle as he tries to rebuild his marriage with fragile [[Claudia Blaisdel Carrington|Claudia]], newly released from an institution after a breakdown. Matthew leaves Blake's employ to run his own rig, and soon their rivalry over Krystle transforms into a fierce rivalry over oil. Meanwhile, Claudia's friendship with Blake's son [[Steven Carrington]] turns into an affair; when the secret comes out, Matthew takes his and Claudia's daughter [[Lindsay Blaisdel|Lindsay]] and leaves town. They are later presumed dead in a car crash in the jungles of [[Peru]].

Matthew returns in 1987, very much alive; he and Lindsay had been rescued from the crash by a jungle tribe who saved his life, Matthew says Lindsay later died from her injuries.
