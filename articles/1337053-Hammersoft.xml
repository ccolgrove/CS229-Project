{{Music of Final Fantasy}}
The music of the video game ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' was composed by regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]]. It was the first title in the main ''Final Fantasy'' series in which Uematsu was not the sole composer. The ''Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack'' was released on four [[Compact Disc]]s in 2001 by [[DigiCube]], and was re-released in 2004 by [[Square Enix]]. Prior to the album's North American release, a reduced version entitled ''Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack'' was released on a single disk by [[Tokyopop]] in 2002. An [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''feel/Go dream: Yuna &amp; Tidus'' containing additional singles not present in the game was released by DigiCube in 2001. ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy X'', a collection of [[piano]] arrangements of the original soundtracks by Masashi Hamauzu and performed by Aki Kuroda, was released by DigiCube in 2002 and re-released by Square EA in 2004. A collection of vocal arrangements of songs from the game arranged by Katsumi Suyama along with [[radio drama]] tracks was released as ''Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection'' in 2002 by DigiCube.

The theme song for the game is the song &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;, which was performed by Japanese folk singer [[Ritsuki Nakano]], known as &quot;RIKKI&quot;, in Japanese for both the Japanese and English versions of the game. The song was released as a [[single (music)|single]] by DigiCube in 2001 and was re-released by Square Enix in 2004. The music was well received overall; reviewers praised the additions to the soundtrack by the two new composers for the series.  They especially praised Hamauzu, both for his work in the original soundtrack and in arranging the songs for ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy X''. Several songs, especially &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; and &quot;Zanarkand&quot;, remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series, as well as been published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups.

==Creation and influence==
''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' marks the first time Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a ''Final Fantasy'' game. His fellow composers for ''Final Fantasy X'' were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. Uematsu contributed 51 tracks, Hamauzu contributed 20 tracks and Nakano contributed 18 tracks to the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-1&quot;/&gt; The two new composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different than Uematsu's while still working together.&lt;ref name=&quot;RBNU&quot;/&gt; Uematsu claims that he found inspiration for the soundtrack by listening to specific instruments of songs by [[Elton John]] and [[The Beatles]] separately to see how they fit into the whole, and that his favorite part about the soundtrack is the good reviews from listeners.&lt;ref name=&quot;RBNU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LINER&quot;/&gt; Nakano set out to create music with a &quot;vibrant and dynamic feel&quot; that tied together his years of experience with game music, while Hamauzu tried to use the soundtrack to bring video game music to &quot;greater heights&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LINER&quot;/&gt;

&quot;To Zanarkand&quot; was originally written by Uematsu before the development of ''Final Fantasy X'', for the recital of a flutist friend named Seo. Uematsu eventually decided the track was too gloomy and kept it for a later use. When development of ''Final Fantasy X'' started, he decided to use the track for the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-2&quot;/&gt;

{{Nihongo|''Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack''|ãã¡ã¤ãã«ãã¡ã³ã¿ã¸ã¼ï¼¸ããªãªã¸ãã«ãµã¦ã³ããã©ãã¯|Fainaru FantajÄ« Ten Orijinaru Saundotorakku}} is a soundtrack album of music from ''Final Fantasy X'' composed, arranged and produced by Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. Vocals are performed by RIKKI for &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;, Bill Muir for &quot;Otherworld&quot;, and choruses for &quot;[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Practices|Hymn of the Fayth]]&quot;. It spans four discs and 91 tracks, covering a duration of 4:32:26. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2001 by DigiCube with catalog number ''SSCX-10054'', and was re-released on May 10, 2004 by Square Enix with catalog number ''SQEX-10013''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFOST&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, Tokyopop released a version of ''Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack'' in North America entitled ''Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack'', which contained 17 tracks from the original album on a single disk. This release had the catalog number TPCD-0211-2. Additionally, in 2001, prior to the game's release, Square released a promotional disk titled ''Final Fantasy X Promo CD'', which contained edited versions of &quot;Other World&quot;, &quot;Zanarkand&quot;, and &quot;Battle 1&quot;. The disk covers a length of 7:08, and was only released in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFOFS&quot;/&gt;

''Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack'' reached #4 on the Oricon charts, and sold 140,000 copies as of January 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ORIOST&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oricon&quot;/&gt; The album was moderately well received; while some reviewers felt it to be an &quot;absolutely amazing&quot; soundtrack, others only found it to be a &quot;satisfying&quot; work that was &quot;not quite all I was hoping for&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFOST&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCOST&quot;/&gt; Some reviewers felt that of the three composers, Uematsu's pieces were the weakest, citing them as having a tendency to be &quot;buried&quot; under the compositions of the others. The same reviewers, however, noted that some of the best pieces on the soundtrack, such as &quot;Zanarkand&quot;, were the work of Uematsu. Hamauzu's contributions were seen as some of his best work, and reviewers felt that both he and Nakano brought a &quot;myriad of new flavors&quot; to the soundtrack which were very well received.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFOST&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCOST&quot;/&gt; ''Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack'', although not re-released after the ''Original Soundtrack'' was brought to North America, was seen as a good sampler of the music from the full soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFOFS&quot;/&gt;

''Piano Collections Final Fantasy X'' is a collection of music from the original soundtrack arranged for the piano by [[Masashi Hamauzu]], and performed by Aki Kuroda. Hamauzu intended the process of arranging the pieces to &quot;consider the groundwork of individual compositions in order to transform these pieces into piano arrangements&quot; rather than simply playing the songs on a piano as they originally sounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;1UPint&quot;/&gt; It spans 15 tracks and covers a duration of 56:43.  It was first released in Japan on February 20, 2002 by DigiCube with catalog number ''SSCX-10064'', and was re-released on July 22, 2004 by Square Enix with catalog number ''SQEX-10028''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFPC&quot;/&gt; 

''Piano Collections Final Fantasy X'' reached #89 on the Oricon charts&lt;ref name=&quot;ORIPIANO&quot;/&gt; and was very well received, with reviewers finding it to be a &quot;great&quot; album, and stating that it was superior to most video game soundtracks, both piano or otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFPC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCPC&quot;/&gt;  They especially praised Hamauzu, terming him a &quot;very skilled arranger and performer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCPC&quot;/&gt;

===''Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection''===
''Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection'' is a collection of vocal arrangements of songs from the game arranged by Katsumi Suyama along with [[radio drama]] tracks, performed by the game's characters' [[seiyÅ«|voice actors]] in Japanese. It spans 14 tracks and covers a duration of 42:21. It was released in Japan on December 18, 2002 by DigiCube with catalog number ''SSCX-10073''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFVOC&quot;/&gt; The album was poorly received by critics. They found the album, while it had &quot;pretty good&quot; vocals, to have overall poor sound quality and a clichÃ©d musical style.  While &quot;not a horrible album&quot;, they found that the collection was overpriced and under-produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFVOC&quot;/&gt; It reached #69 on the Oricon charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ORIVOC&quot;/&gt;

==''Suteki da ne''==
&quot;Suteki da ne&quot; is the [[video game music|theme song]] of ''Final Fantasy X''. It was written by Nobuo Uematsu and [[Kazushige Nojima]] and was sung by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as &quot;[[RIKKI]]&quot;, whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an [[Okinawa]]n atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;interviews&quot;/&gt; &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of ''Final Fantasy X''. The song's title translates to &quot;Isn't It Wonderful?&quot; in English, and its lyrics were written by scenario writer Kazushige Nojima,&lt;ref name=&quot;interviews&quot;/&gt; while Uematsu composed the instrumentals and [[ShirÅ Hamaguchi]] arranged the instrumentals. Like the ballad from ''Final Fantasy VIII'', &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; has an in-game version used in cutscenes together with an orchestrated version used as part of the ending theme.

The song was released as a single by DigiCube on July 18, 2001, and re-released by Square Enix on July 22, 2004.  The disk also contains an instrumental version, an unrelated song entitled &quot;Gotsuki-sama ~UTIKISAMA~&quot; (&quot;The Moon&quot;), and a vocal version of [[Aerith Gainsborough|Aerith]]'s theme song from ''Final Fantasy VII'' titled &quot;Pure Heart&quot;. The single covers a duration of 20:35. The original release has a catalog number of ''SSCX-10053'', and the re-release has a catalog number of ''SQEX-10029''.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-3&quot;/&gt; The original release of &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; reached #10 on the Oricon charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ORISDN&quot;/&gt;

There is also an &quot;autumn version&quot; of the song, also performed by Ritsuki Nakano, released by Universal on October 3, 2001 on the &quot;KANARIA&quot; minialbum together with six unrelated tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-4&quot;/&gt; The release has a catalog number of ''UMCK-1056''. This version of the song, as well as all versions on the single, is also found on the Final Fantasy Single Collection bootleg CD, released by EverAnime with catalog number ''GM-496'', by Archer Records with catalog number ''SA-007''&lt;ref name=&quot;u-5&quot;/&gt; and by Miya Records with catalog number ''MICA-0068''.&lt;ref name=&quot;u-6&quot;/&gt; An official English translation of the song was created for the ''[[Final Fantasy concerts|Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy]]'' concert series and was first performed in Chicago by vocalist Susan Calloway on December 12, 2009.
