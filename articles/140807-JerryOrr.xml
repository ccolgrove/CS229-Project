The '''Yucca Mountain''' Nuclear Waste Repository was to be a [[deep geological repository]] storage facility for [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent nuclear reactor fuel]] and other [[high level radioactive waste]], until the project was canceled in 2009.  It was to be located on federal land adjacent to the [[Nevada Test Site]] in [[Nye County, Nevada]], about {{convert|80|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of the [[Las Vegas metropolitan area]]. The proposed repository was within [[Yucca Mountain]], a [[ridge]] line in the south-central part of Nevada near its border with [[California]].

Although the location has been highly contested by both environmentalists and non-local residents in Las Vegas, which is over {{convert|100|mi|km}} away, it was approved in 2002 by the [[United States Congress]].  However, under the [[Obama Administration]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GAO&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=GAO: Death of Yucca Mountain Caused by Political Maneuvering |url=http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/05/10/10greenwire-gao-death-of-yucca-mountain-caused-by-politica-36298.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=11 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; funding for development of Yucca Mountain waste site was terminated effective with the 2011 federal budget passed by Congress on April 14, 2011.

== Background ==
[[Image:Nuclear waste locations USA.jpg|thumb|right|Nuclear Waste Locations]]
Spent nuclear fuel is the radioactive by-product of [[electric power]] [[Electricity generation|generation]] at commercial [[nuclear power]] plants, and high-level radioactive waste is the by-product from [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080514020437/http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/documents/nwpa/css/nwpa.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14

 | accessdate= 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.&lt;ref&gt;Culler, Floyd L. 1957. ''Status report on the disposal of radioactive wastes''. Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Energy began studying Yucca Mountain in 1978 to determine whether it would be suitable for the nation's first long-term geologic repository for over {{convert|70000|MT}} (150 million pounds) of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste currently stored at 121 sites around the nation.  An estimated {{convert|10000|MT}} of the waste would be from America's military nuclear programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Midweek Perspectives: Waste that won't go away |author=Michael J. Kolar  |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=2001-08-15 |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/forum/20010815kol0815enp5.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 1984, the Department of Energy selected ten locations in six states for consideration as potential repository sites. This was based on data collected for nearly ten years. The ten sites were studied and results of these preliminary studies were reported in 1985. Based on these reports, [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] approved three sites for intensive scientific study called site characterization. The three sites were [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]]; [[Deaf Smith County, Texas]]; and Yucca Mountain.  In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed DOE to study only Yucca Mountain, which is already located within a former nuclear test site. The Act provided that if during Site Characterization the Yucca Mountain location is found unsuitable, studies will be stopped immediately. This option expired when the site was actually recommended by the President.
On July 23, 2002, [[POTUS|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signed House Joint Resolution 87,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate= 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{USPL|107|200}}) allowing the DOE to take the next step in establishing a safe repository in which to store the country's nuclear waste.  The Department of Energy was to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain Repository by January 31, 1998 but did not do so because of a series of delays due to legal challenges, concerns over how to transport nuclear waste to the facility, and political pressures resulting in underfunding of the construction.

On July 18, 2006 the DOE proposed March 31, 2017 as the date to open the facility and begin accepting waste based on full funding.  On September 8, 2006 Ward (Edward) Sproat, a nuclear industry executive formerly of PECO energy in Pennsylvania, was nominated by President Bush to lead the Yucca Mountain Project. Following the 2006 mid-term Congressional elections, Democratic Nevada Senator [[Harry Reid]], a long time opponent of the repository, became the [[Senate Majority Leader]], putting him in a position to greatly affect the future of the project. Reid has said that he would continue to work to block completion of the project, and is quoted as having said: &quot;Yucca Mountain is dead. It'll never happen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/ym_repository/seis/index.shtml

In the 2008 Omnibus Spending Bill, the Yucca Mountain Project's budget was reduced to $390 million.  Despite this cut in funding, the project was able to reallocate resources and delay transportation expenditures to complete the License Application for submission on June 3, 2008. Lacking an operating repository, however, the federal government owes to the utilities somewhere between $300 and $500 million per year in compensation for failing to comply with the contract it signed to take the spent nuclear fuel by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The purpose of the Yucca Mountain project is to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and develop a national site for spent nuclear fuel and high-level [[radioactive waste]] storage. The management and operating contractor as of April 1, 2009 for the project is USA Repository Services (USA-RS) (a consortium of government contractors, URS Corporation, Shaw Corporation and Areva Federal Services LLC). Following the layoff of 800 employees on March 31, 2009, the consortium had about 100 employees remaining on the project prior to all being laid off by the end of the 2010 financial year &lt;ref&gt;{http://www.eenews.net/public/Greenwire/2010/08/24/2/}&lt;/ref&gt; due to zero funding in President Obama's 2011 budget for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.energy.gov/environment/ocrwm.htm}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandia National Laboratories]] had the scientific responsibility for post closure analysis and ensuring compliance with the NWPA for one million years.  The main tunnel of the Exploratory Studies Facility is U-shaped, {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|25|ft|abbr=on}} wide. There are also several cathedral-like alcoves that branch from the main tunnel. It is in these alcoves that most of the scientific experiments are conducted. The emplacement drifts (smaller diameter tunnels branching off the main tunnel) where waste would have been stored were not constructed since they required a construction authorization by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.cfr/cfr2002026&amp;div=10&amp;collection=cfr&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;terms=63.&amp;type=matchall 10&amp;nbsp;CFR&amp;nbsp;63].&lt;/ref&gt;  The repository has a statutory limit of {{convert|77000|MT|ST}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Erin Neff: The arbitrary science of Yucca Mountain |author=Erin Neff |newspaper= [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=2006-04-16 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-16-Sun-2006/opinion/6858785.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; To store this amount of waste requires {{convert|40|mi|km}} of tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008news&quot;/&gt; The Nuclear Waste Policy Act further limits the capacity of the repository to {{convert|63000|MT}} of initial heavy metal in commercial spent fuel.

The latest Total System Life Cycle Cost presented to Congress on July 15, 2008 by Director Sproat is $90 billion.  This cost, however, cannot be compared to previous estimates since it includes a repository capacity about twice as large as previously estimated over a much longer period of time (100 years vs 30 years).  Additionally, the cost of the project continues to escalate due to the lack of sufficient funding to most efficiently move forward and complete the project. In 2007, the DOE announced it was seeking to double the size of the Yucca Mountain repository to a capacity of {{convert|135000|MT|ST}}, or 300 million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The U.S. Department of Energy was to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain repository by January 31, 1998. However, 12 years after this deadline, the repository at Yucca Mountain is still over a decade away from being opened, and the opening date continues to be delayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010funding&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2009/2009-05-08-092.asp|title=FY2010 Energy Budget Shuts Yucca Mountain Nuclear Dump|date=May 8, 2009|publisher=Environment News Service|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of delays in construction, a number of nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to [[dry cask storage]] of waste on-site indefinitely in nearly impervious [[steel]] and concrete [[cask]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/locations.html |title=NRC: Locations of Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations |author= |date=2009-10-15 |work=[[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |publisher= |accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep these plants operating, it may be necessary to construct a temporary facility at the Yucca Mountain site or somewhere else in the [[Western United States|West]] if opening of the underground storage continues to be delayed.

The project is widely opposed in Nevada and is a hotly debated national topic.  A two-thirds majority of Nevadans feel it is unfair for their state to have to store nuclear waste when there are no nuclear power plants in Nevada.&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Congress&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In addition, the [[Nevada Test Site]] (NTS), which borders Yucca Mountain to the east, is the location where over 1000 nuclear weapons have been detonated and continues to function as the location for nuclear weapons testing. The NTS currently hosts a variety of research activities, both nuclear and otherwise, and is the host to two [[low-level radioactive waste]] sites.

One point of concern has been the standard of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] proposed a limit of 350&amp;nbsp;millirem per year for that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There was significant public and political opposition to the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository project in Nevada.  An attempt was made to push ahead with the project and override this opposition.  But for large projects which would take decades to complete, there is every chance that sustained local opposition will prevail, and this happened with the Yucca Mountain project.&lt;ref name=sc/&gt; Successful nuclear waste storage siting efforts in Scandinavia have involved local communities in the decision-making process and given them a veto at each stage, but this did not happen with Yucca Mountain.

== Radiation standards ==
=== Original standard ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) established its Yucca Mountain standards in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080625143023/http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/yucca/402-f-05-026.pdf
|archivedate= 2010-06-09
 | title= EPAâs Proposed Public Health and Environmental Radiation Protection Standards for Yucca Mountain
 | month= October | year= 2005 | format= PDF |work= |publisher= [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]
 | accessdate= 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 [[millirem]] per year for the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a [[groundwater]] protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards set a limit of 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a [[pollution prevention]] measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's [[Environmental Impact Statement]], but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act]]. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Testimony&amp;Hearing_ID=da19acbe-802a-23ad-4357-2f58816a73f0&amp;Witness_ID=58979654-be03-4f7f-9bde-04967db10644|title=Full Committee Oversight Hearing on the Status of the Yucca Mountain Project |author=William Wehrum  |date=2006-03-01 |work= |publisher=U.S. Senate committee on Environmental and Public Works |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Court of Appeals finds standard inconsistent with NAS recommendations ===
Shortly after the EPA first established these standards in 2001, the nuclear industry, several environmental and public interest groups, and the State of [[Nevada]] challenged the standards in court. In July 2004, the [[Court of Appeals]] for the District of Columbia Circuit found in favor of the Agency on all counts except one: the 10,000 year regulatory time frame. The court ruled that EPAâs 10,000-year compliance period for isolation of radioactive waste was not consistent with [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) recommendations and was too short.&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbosch, Robert, and Susanne E. Vandenbosch. 2007. ''Nuclear waste stalemate''. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 111, 190â191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Energy Institute v. EPA, 373 ''F.3d'' 1251 (D.C. Cir. 2004). [http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200407/01-1258a.pdf UScourts.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; The NAS report had recommended standards be set for the time of peak risk, which might approach a period of one million years.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Research Council, Committee on Technical Bases for Yucca Mountain Standards. 1995. ''Technical Bases for Yucca Mountain standards''. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By limiting the compliance time to 10,000 years, EPA did not respect a statutory requirement that it develop  standards consistent with NAS recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbosch, Robert, and Susanne E. Vandenbosch. 2007. ''Nuclear waste stalemate''. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 111).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EPA's rule ===
EPA published in the Federal Register a final rule in 2009.  The new rule limits radiation doses from Yucca Mountain for up to 1,000,000 years after it closes. Within that regulatory time frame, the EPA has two dose standards that would apply based on the number of years from the time the facility is closed.

For the first 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final ruleâs dose limit of 15&amp;nbsp;millirem per year. This is protection at the level of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100&amp;nbsp;[[millirem]] per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of [[earthquakes]], [[volcanic activity]], [[climate change]], and container [[corrosion]], over one million years.  The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1&amp;nbsp;mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.

[[Image:Caliente Corridor.jpg|thumb|right|Proposed Transportation Route of SNF through Nevada]]

The formation that makes up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a [[caldera]] [[volcano]] and is composed of alternating layers of [[ignimbrite]] (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi-welded tuff. The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enviroliteracy.org/article.php/1349.html |title= Yucca Mountain |author= |date=2008-04-08 |work= |publisher= The Environmental Literacy Council|accessdate=2010-06-09| quote=''Scientists believe that tuff has special chemical, physical, and thermal characteristics that make it extremely suitable for burying radioactive waste. As long as the waste stays solid and remains deep underground, it should not pose a threat to the environment or to human health as the layers of tuff shield the radiation.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lies along the transition between the [[Mohave Desert|Mohave]] and the [[Great Basin Desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ground water at Yucca Mountain: how high can it rise? |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-309-07669-2 |page=191 |pages= |url= |accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volcanic [[tuff]] at Yucca Mountain is appreciably fractured and movement of water through an aquifer below the waste repository is primarily through fractures.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy. 2002. ''Yucca Mountain science and engineering report, revision 1''. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. [http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/documents/ser_b/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; While the fractures are usually confined to individual layers of tuff, the faults extend from the planned storage area all the way to the water table {{convert|600|to|1500|ft|abbr=on|lk=on}} below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberwest.com/cw14/14scwst2.html |title=Earthquake could cause flooding of Yucca Mountain repository |author= |date=1997-09-02 |work= Cyberwest Magazine |publisher= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future water transport from the surface to waste containers is likely to be dominated by fractures. There is evidence that surface water has been transported down through the {{convert|700|ft|abbr=on}} of overburden to the exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain in less than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbosch, Robert, and Susanne E. Vandenbosch. 2007. ''Nuclear waste stalemate''. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 12, 106-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris, A.E., H.W. Bentley, S. Cheng, P.W. Kubik, P. Sharma, and H.E. Gove. 1990. â&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl studies of water movements deep within unsaturated tuffs,â ''Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B'' 52 (2 December): 455-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some site opponents assert that, after the predicted containment failure of the waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface.&lt;ref name=Summary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/yucca/ymsum01.htm |title=Summary of Yucca Mountain Oversight and Impact Assessment Findings |accessdate=2008-05-16 |publisher=State of Nevada|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Officials state that the waste containers will be stored in such a way as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.

The area around Yucca Mountain received much more rain in the geologic past and the water table was consequently much higher than it is today, though well below the level of the repository.

===Earthquakes===
Nevada ranks fourth in the nation for current [[seismic]] activity&lt;ref name=usgs_quakes&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/top_states.php |title=Top Earthquake States |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |work=Earthquake Hazards Program |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthquake databases (the Council of the National Seismic System Composite Catalogue and the Southern Great Basin Seismic Network) provide current and historical [[earthquake]] information. Analysis of the available data in 1996 indicates that, since 1976, there have been 621 seismic events of magnitude greater than 2.5 within a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of Yucca Mountain. Reported underground nuclear weapons tests at the Nevada Test Site have been excluded from this count.&lt;ref name=usgs_quakes/&gt;

DOE has stated that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not significantly affect [[Seismic performance|repository performance]]. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide [[Earthquake engineering|substantial protection]] of the waste form from seepage water, even under severe [[seismic loading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocrwm.doe.gov/documents/43222_tbd/index.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080126070554/http://ocrwm.doe.gov/documents/43222_tbd/index.htm |archivedate=Jan. 26, 2008 |title=Technical Basis Document No. 14: Low Probability Seismic Events |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|work=Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management |date=June 2004 |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, it was discovered that the Bow Ridge fault line ran underneath the facility, hundreds of feet east of where it was originally thought to be located, beneath a storage pad where spent radioactive fuel canisters would be cooled before being sealed in a maze of tunnels. The discovery required several structures to be moved several hundred feet further to the east, and drew criticism from Robert R. Loux, then head of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, who argues that Yucca administrators should have known about the fault line's location years prior, and called the movement of the structures âjust-in-time engineering.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/25/nation/na-yucca25 |title=Yucca Mt. adjusts to fault line |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep/25/usa |author=Attewill, Fred |title=US nuclear dump plan in danger after seismic shock|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=2010-03-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2008, a major nuclear equipment supplier, Holtec International, criticized the Department of Energy's safety plan for handling containers of radioactive waste before they are buried at the proposed Yucca Mountain dump.  The concern is that, in an earthquake, the unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial at Yucca Mountain could be sent into a &quot;chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-yucca6-2008jun06,0,5309730.story |title=Yucca Mountain safety plan is 'doomed,' nuclear company says |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-27 |first=Ralph |last=Vartabedian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation of waste ==
The nuclear waste is planned to be shipped to the site by rail and/or truck in robust containers known as [[spent nuclear fuel shipping cask]]s, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada will be public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport will be secret for security reasons.  State or tribal representatives will be notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel enter their jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=ocrwm1&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate= 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nevada routes ===
Within Nevada, the planned primary mode of transportation is via rail through the Caliente Corridor.  This corridor starts in [[Caliente, Nevada|Caliente]], Nevada, traveling along the western and northern borders of Nevada for approximately {{convert|200|mi}}.  At this point, it turns south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= | publisher= OCRWM, DoE
 | accessdate= 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other options that are being considered include a rail route along the Mina corridor.  This rail route would originate at the Fort Churchill Siding rail line, near [[Wabuska, Nevada|Wabuska]].  The proposed corridor would proceed southeast through [[Hawthorne, Nevada|Hawthorne]], [[Nevada State Route 265|Blair Junction]], Lida Junction and Oasis Valley.  At Oasis Valley, the rail line would turn north-northeast towards Yucca Mountain.  Use of this rail corridor by the Department of Energy would require permission from the Walker River Paiute Tribe in order to cross their land.  As the first {{convert|54|mi}} of the proposed corridor is owned by the Department of Defense, additional permission from the DoD would have to be granted.&lt;ref&gt;MinaFeasabilityStudyRev01_26OCT06_alt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impacts ===
Since the early 1960s, the U.S. has safely conducted more than 3,000 shipments of [[spent nuclear fuel]] without any harmful release of radioactive material. This safety record is comparable to the worldwide experience where more than 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been transported since 1970 â an amount approximately equal to the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that would be shipped to Yucca Mountain.&lt;ref name=ocrwm1/&gt;  However, cities are still concerned about the transport of radioactive waste on highways and railroads that may pass through heavily populated areas. Dr. Robert Halstead, who has been a transportation adviser to the state of Nevada since 1988, stated regarding transportation of the high level waste, &quot;They would heavily affect cities like Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, in the Chicago metropolitan area, in Omaha.&quot; &quot;Coming out of the south, the heaviest impacts would be in Atlanta, in Nashville, St. Louis, Kansas City, moving across through Salt Lake City, through [[downtown Las Vegas]], up to Yucca Mountain. And the same cities would be affected by rail shipments as well.&quot;  Spencer Abraham (DOE) on the other hand has stated, &quot;I think thereâs a general understanding that we move hazardous materials in this country, an understanding that the federal government knows how to do it safely.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Cultural impact ==
Archaeological surveys have found evidence that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis (Stoffle ''et&amp;nbsp;al.'' 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;29). Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Cancellation of project==
In May 2009, Secretary Steven Chu stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Yucca Mountain as a repository is off the table. What we're going to be doing is saying, let's step back. We realize that we know a lot more today than we did 25 or 30 years ago. The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades, so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long-term strategy. We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived [[actinide]] waste. These are [[fast-neutron reactor]]s. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...
&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Some of the waste is already [[Radioactive waste#Vitrification|vitrified]]. There is, in my mind, no economical reason why you would ever think of pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagineâagain, it depends on what the blue-ribbon panel saysâone could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as [[salt dome]]s. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymoreâthat's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.
&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;So the real thing is, let's get some really wise heads together and figure out how you want to deal with the interim and long-term storage. Yucca was supposed to be everything to everybody, and I think, knowing what we know today, there's going to have to be several regional areas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=22651 The secretary of energy talks with ''[[Technology Review]]'' about the future of nuclear power post Yucca Mountain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, the House of Representatives voted 388 to 30 on amendments to HHR3183 ({{USHRollCall|2009|591}}) to not defund the Yucca Mountain repository in the FY2010 budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010funding&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3183/show|title=H.R.3183 â Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
