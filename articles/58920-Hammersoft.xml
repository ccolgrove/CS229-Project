More commonly, however, students refer to the college as &quot;WashU&quot;. To prevent confusion over its location, the [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]] added the phrase &quot;in St. Louis&quot; in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;george&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/archives/facts/george.html | title=Origin of the &quot;Washington&quot; Name | work=[http://library.wustl.edu Washington University in St. Louis: University Libraries]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early History (1853â1900)===
Washington University was conceived by seventeen [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] business, political, and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the [[Midwest]]. Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.

The university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support. 
[[File:WGEliot.jpg|150px|thumbnail|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees|left]]

During the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved &quot;Eliot Seminary&quot;, but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.&lt;ref name=founding&gt;{{cite web | url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html | title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=[http://magazine.wustl.edu/ Washington University in St. Louis Magazine]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to &quot;Washington Institute&quot; in honor of [[George Washington]]. Naming the University after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the University amended its name to &quot;Washington University.&quot; The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix &quot;in St. Louis&quot; to distinguish the university from the nearly two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;george&quot; /&gt;

Although chartered as a university, for many years Washington University functioned primarily as a night school located on 17th Street and Washington Avenue in the heart of downtown St. Louis. Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=[http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, [[Smith Academy]], and the [[Mary Institute]].

In 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the University, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.

===Modern Era (1900â1955)===
[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|190px|right|thumb|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]
Washington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the University began to move west. The University Board of Directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted &amp; Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of &quot;Hilltop&quot; campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William H. Danforth]].

In 1899, the university opened a national design contest for the new campus. The renowned Philadelphia firm [[Cope &amp; Stewardson]] won unanimously with its plan for a row of [[Collegiate Gothic]] quadrangles inspired by [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] Universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Architecture of Danforth Campus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture of Danforth Campus | url=http://www.wustl.edu/community/visitors/tour/danforth/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on October 20, 1900. The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and Olympics. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope &amp; Stewardsonâs original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Architecture of Danforth Campus&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Brookings.jpg|260px|thumb|left|[[Brookings Hall]] Quad]]
By 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louisâs Central West End. Three years later, Washington University admitted its first women medical students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wustl.edu/about/facts/chancellors/hall.html Frederic Aldin Hall | Facts, History and Traditions | About | Washington University in St. Louis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, a young physics professor, [[Arthur Holly Compton]], conducted a series of experiments in the basement of Eads Hall that demonstrated the &quot;particle&quot; concept of electromagnetic radiation. Comptonâs discovery, known as the â[[Compton Effect]]â, earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927. After working for many years at the [[University of Chicago]], Arthur Holly Compton returned to St. Louis in 1946 to serve as Washington Universityâs ninth chancellor. Compton reestablished the Washington University football team, making the declaration that athletics were to be henceforth played on a &quot;strictly amateur&quot; basis with no athletic scholarships. Under Comptonâs leadership, enrollment at the University grew dramatically, fueled primarily by World War&amp;nbsp;II veterans' use of their GI Bill benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wustl.edu/about/facts/chancellors/compton.html Arthur Holly Compton | Facts, History and Traditions | About | Washington University in St. Louis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, [[Gerty Cori]], a professor at the School of Medicine, became the first American woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Professors Carl and Gerty Cori became Washington University's fifth and sixth Nobel laureates for their discovery of how glycogen is broken down and resynthesized in the body.

The process of desegregation at Washington University began in 1947 with the School of Medicine and the School of Social Work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Desegregation at Washington University in St. Louis | url=http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/archives/facts/desegregation.html | work=[http://library.wustl.edu Washington University in St. Louis: University Libraries]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid and late 1940s, the University was the target of critical editorials in the local African American press, letter-writing campaigns by churches and the local [[Urban League]], and legal briefs by the NAACP intended to strip its tax-exempt status. In spring 1949, a Washington University student group, the Student Committee for the Admission of Negroes (SCAN), began campaigning for full racial integration. In May 1952, the Board of Trustees passed a resolution desegregating the school's undergraduate divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Amy M. Pfeiffenberger, &quot;Democracy at Home: The Struggle to Desegregate Washington University in the Postwar Era,&quot; ''Gateway-Heritage'' (Missouri Historical Society), vol. 10, no. 3 (Winter 1989), pp. 17â24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent History (1955âpresent)===
[[Image:WashU Graham Chapel.JPG|260px|thumb|right|Graham Chapel]]
During the latter half of the twentieth century, Washington University transitioned from a strong regional university to a national research institution. In 1957, planning began for the construction of the âSouth 40,â a complex of modern residential halls. With the additional on-campus housing, Washington University, which had been predominately a âstreetcar collegeâ of commuter students, began to attract a more national pool of applicants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wustl.edu/about/facts/chancellors/shepley.html Ethan A.H. Shepley | Facts, History and Traditions | About | Washington University in St. Louis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, over two-thirds of incoming students came from outside the St. Louis area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wustl.edu/about/facts/chancellors/thomas_eliot.html Thomas H. Eliot | Facts, History and Traditions | About | Washington University in St. Louis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Board of Trustees appointed Chancellor [[William Henry Danforth]], who guided the university through the social and financial crises of the 1970s and strengthened the universityâs often strained relationship with the St. Louis community. During his 24-year chancellorship, Danforth significantly improved the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], established 70 new faculty chairs, secured a $1.72 billion endowment, and tripled the amount of student scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wustl.edu/about/facts/chancellors/danforth.html William H. Danforth | Facts, History and Traditions | About | Washington University in St. Louis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Mark S. Wrighton]], former Provost at [[MIT]], was elected the universityâs 14th chancellor. During Chancellor Wrighton's tenure undergraduate applications to Washington University have more than doubled. Since 1995, the University has added more than 190 endowed professorships, revamped its Arts &amp; Sciences curriculum, and completed more than 30 new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wustl.edu/wrighton/ Mark Stephen Wrighton | Leadership | About | Washington University in St. Louis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of Washington Universityâs reputation has coincided with a series of record-breaking fund-raising efforts during the last three decades. From 1983 to 1987, the âAlliance for Washington Universityâ campaign raised $630.5 million, which was then the most successful fund-raising effort in national history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.wustl.edu/Fall06/DanforthCampus.htm Washington University in St. Louis Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2004, the âCampaign for Washington Universityâ raised $1.55 billion, which has been applied to additional scholarships, professorships, and research initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/22/us/a-mighty-fund-raising-effort-helps-lift-a-college-s-ranking.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Mighty Fund-Raising Effort Helps Lift a College's Ranking | first=Greg | last=Winter | date=December 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Presidential and Vice Presidential debates===
[[Image:Wustldebate08.JPG|260px|thumb|right|[[2008 Vice Presidential Debate]] at the Washington University Field House]]
Washington University has been selected by the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] to host more presidential and vice presidential debates than any other institution in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-info.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/11937.html History of debates at Washington University in St. Louis | Newsroom | Washington University in St. Louis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The University has been selected to host a presidential or vice presidential debate in every United States presidential election since 1992. [[United States presidential election debates]] were held at the Washington University Athletic Complex in 1992, 2000, and [[United States presidential election debates, 2004#Second presidential debate&amp;nbsp;â October 8|2004]]. A presidential debate was planned to occur in 1996, but owing to scheduling difficulties between the candidates, the debate was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://record.wustl.edu/archive/1996/09-26-96/7800.html Lost site: Presidential campaigns drop St. Louis from debate schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; The university hosted the only 2008 vice presidential debate, between [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Democratic Party (US)|Democrat]] [[Joe Biden]], on October 2, 2008, also at the Washington University Athletic Complex.

Although Chancellor Wrighton had noted after the 2004 debate that it would be &quot;improbable&quot; that the University will host another debate and was not eager to commit to the possibility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.studlife.com/media/storage/paper337/news/2004/10/04/News/Wrighton.2008.Debate.Bid.improbable-740519.shtml Wrighton: 2008 debate bid 'improbable'&amp;nbsp;â News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; he subsequently changed his view and the University submitted a bid for the 2008 debates. &quot;These one-of-a-kind events are great experiences for our students, they contribute to a national understanding of important issues, and they allow us to help bring national and international attention to the St. Louis region as one of America's great metropolitan areas,&quot; said Wrighton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debate.wustl.edu/ Washington University in St. Louis&amp;nbsp;â Vice Presidential Debate 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Danforth University Center.JPG|260px|right|thumb|Danforth University Center]]
Distinguished by its [[collegiate gothic]] architecture, the {{convert|169|acre|ha|1|sing=on}} [[Danforth Campus]] lies at the western boundary of [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]]. Formerly known as the Hilltop Campus, the Danforth Campus was officially dedicated with a formal university ceremony on September 17, 2006, in honor of [[William Henry Danforth|William H. Danforth]], the 13th Chancellor of the University, the Danforth family, and the Danforth Foundation.

The construction of Danforth Campus was accelerated through a profitable lease of several buildings to the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 St. Louis World's Fair]]. At the fair's conclusion, the newly constructed buildings assumed their original functions as classrooms and administrative offices. Additionally, [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]], the grounds of the [[1904 Summer Olympics]], and Francis Gymnasium were converted for use by the Washington University athletic department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=A Glorious World's Fair Transforms a University Campus | last=O'Connor | first=Candace | url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer04/AGloriousWorld%27sFair-np.htm | date=Summer 2004 | accessdate=October 27, 2007 | work=[http://magazine.wustl.edu/ Washington University in St. Louis Magazine] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003035/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer04/AGloriousWorld'sFair-np.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
[[Image:WUWomansBuilding.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Women's Building]]
Washington University has over 200 undergraduate student organizations on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Directory of Student Groups | url=http://su.wustl.edu/general/groupresources/directory.php | work=[[Washington University Student Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are funded by the [[Washington University Student Union]], which has a $2 million plus annual budget that is completely student controlled and is one of the largest student government budgets in the country. Known as SU for short, Student Union sponsors large-scale campus programs including [[Walk in lay down|WILD]] (a semesterly concert in the quad), free copies of the [[New York Times]], [[USA Today]], and the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] through The Collegiate Readership Program; the Assembly Series, a weekly lecture series; and the campus television station, [[WUTV 22|WUTV]] and the [[radio station]], [[KWUR]]. KWUR was named best radio station in St. Louis of 2003 by the Riverfront Times despite the fact that its signal reaches only a few blocks beyond the boundaries of the campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;radio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Best of St. Louis | url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:31233&amp;section=oid:29272&amp;year=2003 | work=[http://www.riverfronttimes.com Riverfront Times]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 12 fraternities and 7 sororities. The Congress of the South 40 (CS40) is a Residential Life and Events Programming Board, which operates outside of the SU sphere. CS40's funding comes from the Housing Activities Fee of each student living on the South 40.

Many of these organizations and other campus life amenities are housed in the $43 million [[Danforth Campus#Student Centers|Danforth University Center]] on the [[Danforth Campus]], also dedicated in honor of the Danforth family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.studlife.com/news/1.612522 |title=Big Names Drive DUC Funding |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=[http://www.studlife.com Student Life]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building opened on August 11, 2008 and earned [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certification for its environmentally friendly design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://danforthuniversitycenter.wustl.edu/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=[http://danforthuniversitycenter.wustl.edu Danforth University Center]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residences===
[[Image:South40.jpg|left|thumb|260px|The South 40]]

75% of undergraduate students live on campus.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Most of the residence halls on campus are located on the '''South 40''', named because of its adjacent location on the south side of the [[Danforth Campus]] and its size of {{convert|40|acre|m2}}. It is the location of all the freshman dorms as well as several upperclassman dorms, which are set up in the traditional [[residential college]] system. All of the dorms are co-ed. The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Wohl [[Student activity center|Student Center]], the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, [[University police|University Police]] Headquarters, various student-owned businesses (e.g. the laundry service, Wash U Wash), and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40.

Another group of residences, known as the Village, is located in the northwest corner of [[Danforth Campus]]. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East on-campus apartments, and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house, which is off campus and located just northwest of the South 40. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord. The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites along with non-BLOCs. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn.

===Student media===
Washington University supports four major student-run media outlets. The university's [[student newspaper]], [[Student Life (newspaper)|''Student Life'']], is available for students. [[KWUR]] (90.3 FM) serves as the students' official radio station; the station also attracts an audience in the immediately surrounding community due to its eclectic and free-form musical programming. Though KWUR offers streaming content through the Internet, the station only broadcasts at 10&amp;nbsp;watts,&lt;ref name=&quot;radio&quot; /&gt; and its frequent applications to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] to increase its power have been unsuccessful. [[WUTV 22|WUTV]] is the university's [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] [[television channel]]. The university's main student-run political publication is the [http://www.wupr.org Washington University Political Review] (nicknamed &quot;WUPR&quot;), a self-described &quot;multipartisan&quot; monthly magazine. Washington University undergraduates publish two literary and art journals, The Eliot Review and Spires Intercollegiate Arts and Literary Magazine. A variety of other publications also serve the university community, ranging from in-house [[academic journal]]s to glossy alumni magazines to WUnderground, campus' student-run satirical newspaper.
