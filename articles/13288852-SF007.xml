'''Kaspersky Internet Security''' or '''KIS''' is an [[Internet security]] suite developed by [[Kaspersky Lab]] compatible with [[Microsoft Windows]]. KIS supports the detection and remidition of [[malware]], as well as [[e-mail spam]], [[anti-phishing|phishing attempts]], and [[data leak]]s.

==Version History==
===Version 2007 (6.0)===
Version 6.0 was the first release of KIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Bertolucci|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/software/kaspersky-internet-security-6/4505-3513_7-31884380.html;lst |title=Kaspersky Internet Security 6 |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] magazine praised version 6.0's detection of malware. KIS detected 100 percent of threats on a subset of the January 2006 wildlist, a list of prevalent threats. The suite detected almost 100 (99.57%) percent of [[adware]] samples. KIS has the ability to scan within compressed or [[runtime packer|packed]] files, detecting 83.3 percent of the &quot;hidden&quot; malware. However, version 6.0 was criticized for not completely removing malware by leaving [[Windows Registry|Registry]] entries and files. PC World also highlighted the suite's [[false positive]]s&amp;nbsp;â eight of 20,000 clean files were incorrectly flagged as malicious&amp;nbsp;â and its noticeable impact on [[computer performance]]. However, data is cached from each scan, making each subsequent scan faster. The firewall blocked all attacks from inside and outside the computer when tested.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWORLD01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Narasu Rebbapragada |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125705/first_look_kasperskys_best_of_breed_security_suite.html;lst |title=First Look: Kaspersky's Best of Breed Security Suite|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine found the [[GUI|graphical user interface]] to be awkward to navigate. Features such as [[parental controls]] and [[instant messaging]] protection, found in competing suites from [[Symantec]] and [[McAfee]], were not a part of version 6.0. Both [[CNET]] and PC World criticized the suite's relatively high [[retail price]], US$79.95.

KIS 6.0 supports [[Windows 98#Windows 98 Second Edition|Windows 98 SE]], [[Windows ME|ME]], [[Windows NT 4.0|NT Workstation 4.0]], [[Windows 2000|2000 Professional]], [[Windows XP editions#Home and Professional|XP Home Edition]], [[Windows XP editions#Home and Professional|XP Professional]], [[Windows XP editions#Windows XP Professional x64 Edition|XP Professional x64]], and [[Windows Vista|Vista]]. 50 [[megabyte]]s of free space, [[Internet Explorer 5|Internet Explorer 5.5]], and [[Windows Installer]] 2.0 are required. [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and [[Central processing unit|CPU]] requirements are dependent on the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kaspersky Internet Security 6.0 MP2 (builds 6.0.2.614, 6.0.2.621) |url=http://support.kaspersky.com/kis6mp2?level=3&amp;qid=208279305 |date= |work=Kaspersky Lab Technical Support |publisher=[[Kaspersky Lab]] |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 2008 (7.0)===
Version 7.0 introduced a redesigned GUI. Components were renamed and reorganized; the ''Anti-hacker'' module was renamed to the ''Firewall'', and the ''Anti-Spy'' module was integrated with the ''Privacy Control'' module. [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] described the new interface as &quot;intuitive&quot; and &quot;great-looking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWorld07&quot; &gt;{{cite web |author=Erik Larkin |title=Kaspersky Lab Internet Security 7.0|url=http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/product/30864/review/internet_security_70.html |date=30 November 2007 |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental controls were introduced, with specific settings for different age categories, such as &quot;child&quot; or &quot;parent&quot;. Within age categories are content categories, such as [[drugs]] or [[violence]]. Users can manually configure profiles. Filtering profiles can be associated with users. Since content is filtered at the network level, the feature will work with any [[Internet]] browser. The filter relies on a database of known URLs and can analyze websites in real-time. Attempts to access forbidden URLs are logged, and sites visited are tracked as well, raising privacy issues. Limits on Internet access may be set based on time, and chat rooms along with [[webmail]] sites can be manually blocked.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCMag07&quot; &gt;{{cite web |author=Neil J. Rubenking |title=Parental Control One Point Oh|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2162421,00.asp |date=1 August 2007 |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spam filtering integrates with [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Outlook Express]], [[Windows Mail]], and [[The Bat!]]. E-mail content is analyzed and scored, and e-mail with scores above two specified thresholds are either marked as &quot;!!spam&quot; or &quot;??probably spam&quot;. The ''Mail Dispatcher'' feature shows subject and sender information for messages, and allows users to avoid downloading blatant spam by selecting which messages to download. The filter self-trains by analyzing incoming and outgoing e-mail not marked as spam, or by analyzing folders only containing spam or valid e-mail. Senders of verified valid e-mail are [[whitelist]]ed. E-mail can also be whitelisted or [[blacklist]]ed based on phrases present in the text. E-mail with non-[[ASCII]] characters or invisible text can also be blocked. However, version 7.0 had a relatively poor showing, misidentifying 30 percent of valid messages in PC Magazine testing. 30 percent of spam also made to the inbox.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCMag07&quot; /&gt;

Protection against [[data leak]]s was incorporated in this release. The suite warns users when programs attempt to access or send data from certain areas, such as where Internet Explorer stores [[webform]] information.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWorld07&quot; /&gt;

Malware protection was mostly positive in detection and disinfection tests by AV-Test.org. Version 7.0 detected 100 percent of wildlist threats. Using one-month old [[Antivirus software#Signature based detection|signatures]] and a set of new malware, however, detection fell to 14 percent. Files were scanned at 5.24 megabytes per second. Version 7.0 successfully identified all six actively running [[rootkit]]s, four of six inactive [[rootkits]], and was only able to remove two of six rootkits. The firewall correctly blocked all attempted outside connections, with a reasonable level of security when left on default settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWorld07&quot; /&gt;

This version drops support for the Windows 98, 2000, and NT. [[Windows XP#Service Pack 2|Windows XP Service Pack 2]] is required, except in the case of XP Professional x64 edition. Vista is supported as well. RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the operating system. 75 megabytes of free space, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Windows Installer 2.0.

===Version 2009 (8.0)===
This version introduces a revised user interface, an application filtering module, an updated anti-virus engine, and a vulnerability scanner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neil J. Rubenking |authorlink= |title=Kaspersky Internet Security 2009 |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326993,00.asp |date=4 August 2008 |publisher= |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main window separates settings in four categories, compared to eight in its predecessor. A status bar changes color (green, yellow, and red) to reflect overall program status and flashes to divert attention when needed. [[PC Magazine]] also noted pop-up notifications were kept to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neil J. Rubenking |title=Kaspersky Internet Security 2009 |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326995,00.asp |date=4 August 2008 |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaspersky claims the core anti-virus engine was revised to increase scan speed. PC Magazine found an initial scan took over two hours, however subsequent scans took two minutes to complete. However, malware detection was relatively low in comparison to other anti-virus applications tested. Out of 650 thousand samples, version 8.0 detected 95.6 percent. The top score was around 99 percent. Using two-week old signatures, version 8.0 detected 52 percent of viruses in a different set of samples. Kaspersky also blocked about 60 percent of malware based solely on [[Antivirus software#Suspicious behavior monitoring|behavior]]. The top performers scored 55.3 percent and 80 percent respectively. Version 2009 detected 98.1 percent of [[adware]]. However, PC World noted to achieve that kind of performance, users will have to modify program settings. On default settings, KIS allowed [[Zango (company)|Zango]] to install. To block the installation, users must enable KIS to scan for &quot;other malware&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Erik Larkin |title=Kaspersky Lab Internet Security 2009 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/product/44057/review/kaspersky_lab_internet_security_2009.html |date=23 January 2009  |work= |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Security Analyzer'' looks for operating system and program patches. It also looks for vulnerable system settings, presenting users with a list of recommended actions to prevent malware from gaining access to a system. However, PC World criticized the amount of computer [[jargon]] used and lack of information about how adjust settings appropriately.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} On the other hand, PC Magazine found the feature straightforward, and often the solution involved downloading and installation an update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neil J. Rubenking |title=Finding and Fixing Vulnerabilities |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2327000,00.asp |date=4 August 2008 |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KIS uses a whitelist by Bit9 to classify trusted and malicious programs. Malicious programs are not allowed to run at all. Unknown programs falling in between the two categories are restricted in the actions they can perform. Its firewall blocked all attacks in PC Magazine testing. [[Phishing]] protection was introduced in this release. Testing by PC Magazine found the feature blocked 44 percent of phishing URLs. [[Internet Explorer 7]] blocked 67 percent of the URLs, and [[Mozilla Firefox]] blocked 81 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neil J. Rubenking |title=Protection Against Phishing |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2327001,00.asp |date=4 August 2008 |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spam filtering now integrates with [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and scans [[NNTP]] traffic. Spam can be automatically diverted to its own folder. When using an unsupported e-mail client to download POP3, IMAP or NNTP mail, Kaspersky will still generate a report of all messages. However, in an unsupported client, there will be no toolbar nor will the program classify any messages as spam in the client itself.

===Version 2010 (9.0)===
Version 2010 of Kaspersky Internet Security introduces an overhauled user interface and a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] for running applications in a virtualized environment. The latest build of KIS 2010 (9.0.0.736) fully supports the [[Windows 7]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaspersky.com/windows7 Get the protection you need for Windows 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 2011 (11.0)===
This is the latest version Kaspersky Lab has released.  The beta version was released for all windows users on June 8.  This version includes a new interface, as well as a [[Gadget#Application gadgets|gadget]] only available for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kaspersky Lab |title=Kaspersky Lab releases Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 and Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2011 |url=http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207576100 |date=8 June 2010 |publisher= |accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   PC Mag rated this version &quot;very good&quot; (4/5 stars).  Its firewall was noted to be very good, but that made up for its only adequate malware detection rates. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2367794,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Two critical fixes have been released by Kaspersky Lab, making the current version 11.0.2.556 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaspersky.com/kis_latest_versions&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 2012 (12.0)===
In 1 March 2011, Kaspersky released the first build of version 2012, it came out as beta version and in English, French and Russian version, more versions will come out soon. &lt;ref name=Beta Testing Forum&gt;{{cite web | url=http://devbuilds.kaspersky-labs.com/devbuilds/KIS2012/12.0.0.191/ | title=Kaspersky Dev Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June, 7th 2011 Kaspersky Lab announced the commercial release of Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 in France, Germany, Switzerland. The full version number: 12.0.0.374.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://support.kaspersky.com/kis2012/buy?qid=208284463 | title=Kaspersky Internet Security 2012: commercial release (build 12.0.0.374)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
