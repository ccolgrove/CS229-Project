=== January ===

'''25 January 2011''': The '''&quot;Day of Revolt&quot;''', nationwide protests against the government of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak began. Tens of thousands of protestors gathered in Cairo, with thousands more in cities throughout Egypt. The protests were generally non-violent, but there were reports of some casualties among both civilians and police. After several Facebook groups were created and so-called tweets (from [[Twitter]]) facilitated mass demonstrations, the Egyptian government decided to shut down access to Twitter, although Egyptians were still able to access the website through third-party mobile applications. The Twitter block was lifted the next day.

'''26 January 2011''': (.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowie |first=James |url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to impede protestors' communication. Protests across Egypt gained steam, violence continued as police attempted to force protesters off the streets. Live bullets fired at demonstrators. At least three people reported dead from violence. It was reported that injuries resulting from police violence reached 120 in Suez alone.

'''27 January 2011''': Protests on this day were not as large-scale as those of the previous two days, as many Egyptians had been preparing themselves for the planned &quot;Friday of Anger&quot; that was to take place the following day. At around 7:00 PM local time, Egyptian authorities blocked access to Facebook, although many Egyptians were still able to bypass the block through the use of proxies and third party applications.

'''28 January 2011''': The '''&quot;Friday of Rage&quot;''' protests began. Just after midnight, the Egyptian authorities ordered most Communication and Internet services to be shut down in an attempt to disrupt the protests. That same morning, the authorities had also shut down the country's mobile phone carriers (namely Vodafone, Mobinil, and Etisalat). Shortly after Friday prayers, hundreds of thousands gathered in Cairo and other Egyptian cities. Opposition leader Mohammed ElBaradei traveled to Cairo to participate.  Some looting was reported. Police forces withdrew from the streets completely, and the Egyptian government ordered the military to assist the police. International fears of violence grew, but no major casualties were reported.

'''29 January 2011''': Protests continued as military presence in Cairo increased. A curfew was instituted, but protests continued throughout the night. The military showed restraint, reportedly refusing to obey orders to use live ammunition; there were no reports of major casualties.

'''30 January 2011''': [[Egyptian Air Force]] [[F-16]]s overfly Tahrir Square in a show of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/01/31/fighter-jets-fly-over-protesters-as-chaos-rules-cairo.html |title=Fighter jets fly over protesters as chaos rules Cairo &amp;#124; Newspaper |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''31 January 2011''': '''&quot;The March of the Millions&quot;'''. A protest of over a million people was planned for this day. News agencies have various counts for how many protesters were actually in Tahrir Square that day (Some say there were less than a million, considering the square only holds 250,000 people, but other sources like Al Jazeera argue that there were as many as 2 million in the square and its surrounding areas).

=== February ===

'''1 February 2011''': Mubarak made a televised address once again after unceasing protests, and offered several concessions. He pledged he would not run for another term in elections planned for September, and pledged political reforms. He stated he would stay in office to oversee a peaceful transition. Small but violent clashes began that night between pro-Mubarak and anti-Mubarak groups.

'''2 February 2011''': '''&quot;Battle of the Camel&quot;'''. Violence escalated as waves of Mubarak supporters met anti-government protesters, and some Mubarak supporters rode on camels and horses into Tahrir Square, reportedly wielding swords and sticks. The clashes were believed to have been orchestrated by Habib El Adly, and there were hundreds of casualties. The military tried to limit the violence, repeatedly separating anti-Mubarak and pro-Mubarak groups. President Mubarak reiterated his refusal to step down in interviews with several news agencies. Incidents of violence toward journalists and reporters escalated amid speculation that the violence was being actively aggravated by Mubarak as a way to end the protests.

'''3 February 2011''': Gunmen fire on anti-government protesters in Cairo, where about 10 are killed and more than 830 injured in fighting. The U.N. estimates that 300 people have died in the unrest.

'''4 February 2011''': Thousands gather in Tahrir Square to again press for an end to Mubarak's rule in a &quot;Friday of Departure.&quot;

'''5 February 2011''': Protests in Cairo and throughout the nation continued.  Egyptian Christians held Sunday Mass in Tahrir Square, protected by a ring of Muslims.  Negotiations began between Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman and opposition representatives.  The Egyptian army increased its security role, maintaining order and protecting Egyptâs museums.  Suleiman offered political and constitutional reforms while other members of the Mubarak regime accused nations, including the US, of interfering in Egyptâs affairs.

'''6 February 2011''': Egyptian Christians held Sunday Mass in Tahrir Square, protected by a ring of Muslims. Negotiations involving Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman and representatives of the opposition commenced amid continuing protests throughout the nation.

'''10 February 2011''': Mubarak formally addressed Egypt amid speculation of a military coup, but rather than resigning (as was widely expected), he simply stated he would delegate some of his powers to Vice President Suleiman, while continuing as Egypt's head of state. Reactions to Mubarak's statement were marked by anger, frustration and disappointment, and throughout various cities there was an escalation of the number and intensity of demonstrations.

'''11 February 2011''': The '''&quot;Friday of Departure&quot;''', Egyptians did not settle for Mubarak's announcement of ceding his powers to Suleiman, and set up massive protests in many Egyptian cities. At 6:00 p.m. local time, Suleiman announced Mubarak's resignation and that the Supreme Council of Egyptian Armed Forces would assume leadership of the country.

The council also declared that it would hold power for six months or until elections could be held, whichever came first.

Women, children and men over 40 are allowed to pass freely. Men aged between 18 and 40 will still require a permit, and trade is prohibited. The crossing will now be open from 0900 to 2100 every day except Fridays and holidays.
