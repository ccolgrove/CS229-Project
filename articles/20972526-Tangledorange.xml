He resigned his position and pleaded not guilty. The trial began on June 10, 2010.

On Friday, July 9, 2010, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] opened a civil rights case against Mehserle; the federal government can prosecute him independently for the same act under the separate sovereigns exception to [[double jeopardy]].

On November 5, 2010 Mehserle was sentenced to two years, minus time served. He served his time in the Los Angeles County Jail, occupying a private cell away from other prisoners.

==The incident==
===Background===
Oscar Grant had been celebrating [[New Year's Eve]] with his friends on [[The Embarcadero (San Francisco)|the Embarcadero]] in San Francisco, and was returning to the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] in the lead car of a BART train bound for [[Fruitvale, Oakland, California|Fruitvale]].&lt;ref name=missteps/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kpix1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbs5.com/local/oakland.BART.shooting.2.901215.html |title=Family Files Claim In BART Shooting; Officer ID'd|year=2009|publisher=[[KPIX-TV]]|accessdate=2009-01-10}} {{Dead link|year=October 2010|bot=H3llBot|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; BART offered extended service and a special &quot;Flash Pass&quot; for the New Year's Eve holiday.&lt;ref name=deadlybart/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BFPSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2008/news20081201a.aspx |title=New Year's Eve flash pass, service adjustments, for holiday travelers |year=2009 |publisher=[[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] |accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately 2:00 a.m. PST, [[BART Police]] responded to reports that up to 12 people were involved in a fight on an incoming train from the [[West Oakland (BART station)|West Oakland BART Station]] and the participants were &quot;hammered and stoned.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;missteps&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maher204&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_11630509|title=Witnesses to shooting file claim against BART|last=Maher|first=Sean|date=2009-02-04|publisher=''[[Oakland Tribune]]''|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers removed Grant and several other men suspected of fighting from the train and detained them on the platform. A source familiar with the investigation said that Grant and another man ran back onto the train after being detained; Grant returned voluntarily while BART Police Officer Tony Pirone grabbed the other man and dragged him from the train.&lt;ref name=&quot;missteps&quot;/&gt; Pirone handcuffed Grant's friend, angering other riders.&lt;ref name=&quot;missteps&quot;/&gt; Pirone then lined up Grant and two other men against the wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;missteps&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chron125&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/24/BABG15GNB1.DTL |title=Video shows another BART cop hitting passenger|last=Lagos|first=Marisa|date=2009-01-25|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mehserle's motion for bail, Pirone confirmed with the train operator that the men detained were involved in the fight.&lt;ref name=bail-motion/&gt; When five other officers, including Johannes Mehserle, arrived at the Fruitvale station, they found the situation chaotic.&lt;ref name=&quot;missteps&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cuffs&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/02/BAL91534TE.DTL|author=Jill Tucker| title = No cuffs on man shot by officer, BART maintains| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle| accessdate = 2009-01-09 | date=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehserle's partner on duty, Officer Jon Woffinden, said the &quot;incident was one of the most frightening he had experienced in his 12 years as a police officer.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcbs.com/pages/4463968.php?contentType=4&amp;contentId=4057529 Mehserle Preliminary Hearing To Resume] [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]] May 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehserle's motion for bail, citing the police investigation, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Officer Pirone directed Officer Mehserle to arrest two of the individuals who had not been handcuffed. One of the individuals to be arrested was Oscar Grant, and Officer Pironeâs direction to Mehserle was overheard by Grant. Grant, upon hearing that he was under arrest, attempted to stand up, but was forced to the ground face first. Both Officer Mehserle and Officer Pirone attempted to restrain Mr. Grant and to seek his compliance by ordering him to put his hands behind his back to be handcuffed, but Mr. Grant resisted and refused to submit to handcuffing. Officer Mehserle was pulling at Mr. Grantâs right hand and arm, which remained under his torso near his waistband. Mr. Grant had not been searched by any officer for weapons, either prior to his initial detention or after being seated near the wall.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cell-phone video broadcast on local television station KTVU on January 23 showed what appeared to be Pirone rushing towards Grant and punching him in the face several times two minutes before he was shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;missteps&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chron125&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ktvu123&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=

BART police had been on edge before the shooting because two guns had been recovered in separate incidents along the rail line over the previous hour.&lt;ref name=bartappeals&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/04/MN0R153LGU.DTL |date=2009-01-05 |title=BART appeals for calm as footage shows shooting|author=Damian Bulwa |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately before he arrived at Fruitvale, Mehserle was involved in an incident at the West Oakland station where a teenage boy with a [[semi-automatic pistol]] had fled from police and jumped off the station platform, breaking several bones.&lt;ref name=missteps/&gt;

===Fatally shot===
While dozens of people shouted and cursed at officers from the stopped train, Mehserle and Pirone positioned Grant face-down.  According to Pirone, Grant was disobeying instructions and cursing at officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa130&quot;/&gt;  Witnesses stated Grant pleaded with BART police not to shock him with a [[Taser]].&lt;ref name=sfgate7/&gt;  Pirone then knelt on Grant's neck and told him that he was under arrest for [[resisting arrest|resisting an officer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chron125&quot;/&gt;

Mehserle's motion for bail, citing the police investigation, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pirone said he told Grant &quot;Stop resisting, you're under arrest, put your hands behind your back.&quot;  At that time Pirone said he heard Mehserle say, &quot;Put your hands behind your back, stop resisting, stop resisting, put your hands behind your back.&quot; Then Mehserle said, &quot;I'm going to taze him, I'm going to taze him. I can't get his arms. He won't give me his arms. His hands are going for his waistband.&quot; Then Mehserle popped up and said, &quot;Tony, Tony, get away, back up, back up.&quot;

Pirone did not know if Grant was armed. Mehserle had fear in his voice. Pirone had never heard Mehserle's voice with that tone. Mehserle sounded afraid.&lt;ref name=bail-motion/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The motion also states that the man sitting next to Grant also told police he heard Mehserle say &quot;I'm going to taze him.&quot;&lt;ref name=bail-motion/&gt;

Mehserle then stood up, unholstered his gun, a [[SIG Sauer P226]],&lt;ref name=bulwa130/&gt; and fired a shot into Grant's back.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-video-shooting&quot;/&gt; Immediately after the shooting, Mehserle appeared surprised and raised his hands to his face; according to [[Michael Rains]], Mehserle's criminal defense attorney, several eyewitnesses described Mehserle as looking stunned.&lt;ref name=bulwa130/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fong&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/568629 |author=Petti Fong|accessdate=2009-01-10|title=Was shooting a fatal error? | date=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses say Mehserle said &quot;Oh my god!&quot; several times after the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kron.com/News/ArticleView/tabid/298/smid/1126/ArticleID/1703/reftab/329/t/Former-BART-Officer-Johannes-Mehserle-Will-Be-Tried-for-Murder/Default.aspx Former BART Officer Johannes Mehserle Will Be Tried for Murder] [[KRON-TV|Kron4]] 6/4/2009&lt;/ref&gt; and many saw him put his hands to his head.&lt;ref name=bailmotion/&gt;

Initially there was disagreement about whether Grant was handcuffed before he was shot. Court filings by the district attorney's office say that Grant's hands were behind his back and that he was &quot;restrained and unarmed&quot; but do not say he was handcuffed. Video evidence showed Grant never surrendered his hands, and Mehserle voiced his fear that Grant was &quot;going for his waistband,&quot; where weapons are often kept.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindmurdercharge&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/15/MNJE15A6O2.DTL |author=Demian Bulwa, Wyatt Buchanan, Matthew Yi|date=2009-01-15|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Behind murder charge against ex-BART officer|date=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2LDw5l_yMI |title=Court releases dramatic video of BART shooting |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the day after the shooting, BART spokesman Jim Allison said that Grant was not restrained when he was shot,&lt;ref name=&quot;deadlybart&quot;/&gt; and multiple witnesses testified that Grant refused to give up his hands for handcuffing prior to the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://cdn.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2009/01/30/motion_for_bail.pdf | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family's claim against BART stated that Grant was handcuffed only after he was shot.&lt;ref name=merc106/&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' video of the shooting shows that Grant was not cuffed at 2:03 seconds into the video, 5 seconds after the shot was fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot;/&gt;

BART Officer Marysol Domenici was first officer on the scene with her partner, Tony Pirone.  Domenici testified at the BART incident hearing that Grant and his friends swore at her and did not obey her orders.  She is quoted as having testified that: &quot;If they would've followed orders, this wouldn't have happened.  They probably would've just been cited and released.&quot;  She was terminated by BART on an accusation that she was untruthful in her statements to transit investigators.  On December 18, 2010, it was reported that San Francisco labor arbitrator William Riker ordered her re-instated with full back pay because there was no basis to find that Domenici was not telling the truth.  Domenici's attorney, Alison Berry Wilkinson, was quoted as saying that &quot;She [Domenici] has been vindicated.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Terry Collins, Marin Independent Journal, December 18, 2010, page A2&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2009, Mehserle's attorney postponed a scheduled meeting by BART investigators, seeking to defer it until the following week.

[[File:Sign Closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters holding signs while walking in the streets on January 8, 2009.]]
Police in [[riot gear]] were dispatched and made efforts to [[disperse]] the crowds.  During the course of the evening, among other peaceful protest tactics, some of the protesters turned to [[riot]]ing and rampant [[vandalism|property vandalism]].  [[Black Bloc]] and other rioters smashed hundreds of car and shop windows,&lt;ref&gt;and burned a police car,&lt;/ref&gt; several private cars and numerous trash containers, and dumpsters.  Public buildings such as the Oakland Police Internal Affairs office and almost restored Fox Theatre were heavily vandalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Fruitvale protest and march; downtown rioting====
On January 7, 2009, protests over the shooting and administration of justice began peacefully about 3:30 p.m. with about 500 people gathering at the Fruitvale station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eliott C.

Over 200 Oakland police officers were dispatched in an attempt to disperse the protesters.  Police [[roadblock]]ed streets and diverted vehicle and foot traffic.After entering the [[Oakland#Central business district|central business district]] the march continued to BART Police command and control headquarters at 8th &amp; Madison streets near the Lake Merritt BART station.

Once at BART Police Command and Control, a contingent of angry protesters surrounded a police car.  The officer driving the car fled on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulwa&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author=Demian Bulwa|coauthors= Charles Burress, Matthew B.

A line of police wearing gas masks swept up behind the rear of the march and deployed tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulwa&quot;/&gt;

The protest continued as the crowd marched along 8th Street through Chinatown.  At Broadway, officers wearing gas masks deployed more tear gas canisters and acted quickly to charge and disperse the crowd as they approached the vicinity of Oakland Police headquarters at 7th and Broadway.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The protest regrouped downtown at the intersection of 14th and Broadway, blocking motor vehicle traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Police in helmets and gas masks grouped in standing line formations on the south, west, and north sides of the intersection, allowing an avenue of retreat down 14th Street on the East side of the intersection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulwa&quot;/&gt;

====Dellums' appearance and rioting flare up====
As the rioting moved east toward Lake Merritt, Oakland Mayor [[Ron Dellums]] and Larry Reid held an impromptu press conference at 14th and Jackson Streets, along the spine of the rioting, and called for the crowd to disperse peacefully.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulwa&quot;/&gt;  Dellums peacefully marched with the crowd back West along 14th Street to the steps of City Hall, where he attempted to address the crowd, but cut the meeting short and entered City Hall after the crowd became agitated, began booing, and shouted Dellums down.

After Dellums entered City Hall with his own delegation, locking the doors behind him, the demonstrators continued through City Hall Plaza, with angry splinter groups of rioters smashing the windows of [[Oakland Police Department]]'s Internal Affairs and Recruiting Office at the East side of 250 Frank Ogawa Plaza.  Windows of police cruisers parked outside the offices were also smashed.

The protesters continued east along 17th Street into the 17th Street Commercial District in [[Oaksterdam]], crossing Broadway and Franklin, where rioters broke numerous storefront windows,&lt;ref name=&quot;Steven E.F. Brown&quot;/&gt; and continued back into the [[Lakeside Apartments District, Oakland, California|Lakeside District]], lighting discarded [[christmas trees]] on fire.  Police continued their efforts to disperse the crowds, and rioting continued on Broadway Downtown.

====Denouement and subsequent media coverage====
The rioting wound down around 10:40PM&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulwa&quot;/&gt; in the vicinity of 20th and Broadway outside of the Paramount Theater, where police detained around 80 individuals for various offenses.  Most were cited and released for complaints which include inciting a riot, [[vandalism]], [[assault]] on a police officer, and [[arson]].  Police recovered two handguns from the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff refused to speculate whether Mehserle would be charged with first or second degree murder, saying &quot;What I feel the evidence indicates is an unlawful killing done by an intentional act and from the evidence we have there's nothing that would mitigate that to something lower than a murder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ktvu.com/news/18475843/detail.html| title = BART Slaying 'Intentional'; Murder Charge Filed | author = KTVU Oakland | publisher = [[KTVU]]| year = 2009| accessdate = 2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Oscar-Grant-Shooting-Ex-Cop-Charged/Article/200901315203972| title = Former Cop Charged Over Shooting | author = Sky News | publisher = [[Sky News]]| year = 2009| accessdate = 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orloff noted Mehserle's refusal to explain himself as a reason for charging him with murder, rather than [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;behindmurdercharge&quot;/&gt; Orloff said he would fight any motion to [[Change of venue|change venue]] for the trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindmurdercharge&quot;/&gt;

Mehserle retained [[Pleasant Hill, California|Pleasant Hill]] criminal defense attorney Michael Rains, who previously successfully represented one of the [[Oakland Riders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa122&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/21/BAA415EN2U.DTL|title=Prominent lawyer to defend BART ex-officer|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|date=2009-01-22|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Mehserle retained Rains, Rains told the [[Associated Press]] that it could be difficult to prosecute Mehserle for murder because the law discourages &quot;second-guessing and hindsighting&quot; of police officers, who tend to be favorably viewed by juries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap114&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gO4s1dgxjYfHi3mbqoobWZZomz3gD95NDKQ80|title=Ex-cop charged with murder in Calif. shooting|last=Collins|first=Terry|date=2009-01-14|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehserle's defense was paid for by a statewide fund for police officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa122&quot;/&gt;

===Bail hearing===
At a January 30 bail hearing, Rains told the court that Mehserle had only carried a Taser for a few shifts prior to the January 1 shooting and mistakenly deployed his service weapon when he thought Grant was reaching for a gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa130&quot;/&gt;  Rains stated &quot;Mr. Grant was actively, actively, actively resisting arrest&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ktvumay20&quot;&gt;[http://www.ktvu.com/news/19523065/detail.html Attorneys Spar Over Whether Grant Was Resisting Arrest] [[KTVU]] May 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and that some witnesses heard Mehserle say &quot;Get back, I'm gonna taze him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trib130&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/crime/ci_11596120|title=BART shooting suspect's bail set at $3 million|last=Rosynsky|first=Paul T.|date=2009-01-30|publisher=''[[Oakland Tribune]]''|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rains said he plans to call witnesses who will show &quot;there was a level of resistance by Oscar Grant and others that will negate malice&quot;.

The prosecutors' theory of the case is that the video evidence shows that Mehserle deliberately reached for his weapon. They argued: &quot;What we see in the video is an officer releasing his control of a suspect, standing up, drawing his weapon, with some difficulty, and shooting it.&quot;&lt;ref name=trib130/&gt; Jacobson agreed in deciding to set bail at $3 million that Mehserle's claim of Taser confusion was inconsistent with his earlier statement to a fellow officer and that Mehserle might be changing his story.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa130&quot;/&gt; He later imposed a [[gag order]] on attorneys and investigators in the case, prohibiting them from releasing future filings or otherwise commenting to the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;gagorder&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/13/BAM415TVN6.DTL|title=Judge won't lift gag order in BART case|last=Lee|first=Henry K.|date=2009-02-14|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preliminary hearing===
Rains argued during the preliminary hearing that Mehserle lacked the malice necessary for a murder charge and that he intended to tase Grant. A BART officer testified saying Grant and his friends yelled profanities and did not obey her orders to sit down moments before Mehserle fired at Grant. She said she was fearful when she heard taunts coming from Grant, his friends, and passengers on the train.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kron.com/News/ArticleView/tabid/298/smid/1126/ArticleID/1600/reftab/329/Default.aspx BART Officer: Grant Was Uncooperative Before Death] Kron4 5/26/2009&lt;/ref&gt; After the seven days of  testimony, Judge C. Don Clay concluded that Mehserle had not mistakenly used his service pistol instead of his stun gun. The judge based this on Mehserle's statements to other officers that he thought Grant had a gun. He also noted that Mehserle had held his weapon with both hands when he was trained to use just his left if he was firing a Taser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/04/MNRA18125K.DTL | title=Mehserle ordered to stand trial for murder | first=Demian | last=Bulwa | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehserle faced up to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Mehserle-released-from-prison-on-3M-bail39238592.html|title=Mehserle released from prison on $3M bail|date=2009-02-06|publisher=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a supplemental motion filed Rains argued that Judge Clay should take a second look at a ruling that barred him from  presenting evidence about Grant's criminal background as well as a ruling  that barred him from presenting evidence that Mehserle told a fellow officer just before the shooting incident that he planned to use his Taser on Grant. He protested that &quot;Both rulings amount to grave errors  under longstanding and never-questioned California authorities&quot; and alleged  that they &quot;substantially interfere with Mehserle's federal due process right  to defend against the murder charge.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;kron4&quot;&gt;[http://www.kron.com/News/ArticleView/tabid/298/smid/1126/ArticleID/1651/reftab/329/t/Mehserle-Defense-Wants-to-Present-Evidence-of-Oscar-Grant-s-Bad-Character-in-BART-Shooting-Trial/Default.aspx Mehserle Defense Wants to Present Evidence of Oscar Grant's Bad Character in BART Shooting Trial] [[KRON-TV|KRON4]] 6/1/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Rains had also failed to convince Judge Clay to remove District Attorney Tom Orloff's office from the case. Rains claimed Orloff violated his client's rights because he ordered two Oakland police officers to try to interview Mehserle after he was arrested even though Orloff knew Mehserle had an attorney. Judge Clay said Orloff's actions did not prove a bias nor did it meet the requirements necessary for him to be taken off the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_12395559 Videos spur emotion in first day of hearing for BART killing] ''Oakland Tribune'' 5/18/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plea and jury selection===
On June 19, 2009, Mehserle pleaded not guilty, and the jury trial was scheduled to begin in October. Mehserle's attorney Michael Rains sought a change of venue of the trial on the grounds that there would not be an impartial jury in Alameda County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/18/BAS5189N61.DTL|title=Ex-BART officer wants to move murder trial|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|date=2009-06-18|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing extensive media coverage and social upheaval, the judge agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;T&amp;G 2009-12-02&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20091202/APN/312029475|title=LA judge assigned to Bay Area cop shooting case|date=December 2, 2009|work=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]|accessdate=December 10, 2009|location=Worcester, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rains's request was honored on October 16, and downtown Los Angeles was chosen on November 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/21356770/detail.html|title=BART Shooting Trial Could Hinge On New Venue|work=KTVU.com|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Angeles County Judge Robert J. Perry was assigned to the case. He signaled that he would not allow cameras in the courtroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercury 2009-12-03&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge to block cameras from Mehserle trial, court says|last=Rosynsky|first=Paul|date=December 3, 2008|work=San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a hearing on February 19, 2010 to address two issues. Mehserle's bail was not reduced as requested by the defense. The judge also rejected a motion to remove Alameda County prosecutors from the case. Rains had argued that prosecutors and detectives acted inappropriately when they interviewed Mehserle earlier in the case. Another hearing was set for March 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfappeal.com/alley/2010/03/bart-cop-murder-trial-moved-up.php |title=BART Cop Murder Trial Moved Up: The Alley |publisher=SFAppeal |date=2010-03-26 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehserle's attorney is expected to argue that his client did not commit first-degree murder and has asked the judge to instruct the jury to limit its deliberations to either second-degree murder or acquittal.  Rains wrote that Mehserle will not argue the killing was conducted in the heat of passion or in self-defense. Rains also argues that prosecutors have shown no evidence that the fatal shooting is either voluntary or involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP  2010-05-02&quot;/&gt;

On May 7, Judge Perry granted a motion by defense to discuss Grant's conviction for possessing a gun and evading arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Risling&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/08/BAKC1DBCK5.DTL|title=Judge: Jurors can hear about BART victim's past|last=Risling|first=Greg|date=May 8, 2010|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=May 8, 2010 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry formally selected the jury on June 8. The 12-member jury consists of eight women and four men; of these jurors, seven were white, four Hispanic, and one Asian. Of the alternates, there were five women and one man with three Asians, two whites, and one Hispanic.

===Taser confusion===
Several experts who observed video evidence suggested Mehserle might have confused his gun for his Taser&lt;ref name=&quot;fong&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;policeone&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.policeone.com/officer-shootings/articles/1772254-BART-shooting-raises-issue-of-TASER-confusion/ | author=Dave Smith | publisher=PoliceOne.com | title=BART shooting raises issue of TASER confusion | date=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing him to mistakenly believe he was tasering Grant.&lt;ref name=&quot;bartvideo&quot;/&gt; If Mehserle thought he was firing his Taser, this could provide a full or partial defense to the [[murder]] charge,&lt;ref name=&quot;egelko115&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brownpushes&quot;/&gt; depending on whether Mehserle had a legal right to use his taser at all, which was also brought into question.&lt;ref name=bulwa130/&gt;  Prosecutors allege that paperwork, including a blood alcohol test, completed by Mehserle after the shooting show that he has changed his story.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP  2010-05-02&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_15002927|title=Ex-BART cop lawyer lays out murder trial strategy|last=Collins|first=Terry|date=May 2, 2010|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=May 3, 2010}} {{Dead link|year=October 2010|bot=H3llBot|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been previous cases where police officers have confused guns with Tasers, modern Tasers weigh half as much as handguns.&lt;ref name=&quot;egelko115&quot;/&gt;  The prosecution argues that the position of Mehserle's Taser &quot;in relation to his duty weapon, combined with the different 'feel' and color of the two weapons makes it highly unlikely that he would have mistaken one for the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ktvu206&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/18652393/detail.html#-|title=Prosecutor: BART Cop Used 'Poor Judgement' In Shooting|date=2009-02-05|publisher=[[KTVU]]|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burris responded to claims of Taser confusion by arguing that video evidence did not support the idea of Taser confusion and, in any event, Mehserle had no reason to fire his Taser.&lt;ref name=bulwa130/&gt; Mehserle was wearing his Taser on the left side of his body (on the opposite side from which he wore his gun) -- but set up for a cross-body, strong hand (right-hand) draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiabeat.org/2010/06/28/mehserle-defenses-use-of-force-expert-falters-during-cross-examination |title=Defense use of force expert falters during cross examination â California Beat |publisher=Californiabeat.org |date=2010-06-28 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BART purchased the Taser X26 stun guns in September, and provided them to officers after six hours of training,&lt;ref name=&quot;bulwa130&quot;/&gt; which is the amount recommended by the manufacturer.&lt;ref name=&quot;aparton201&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Lawyer-cop-who-hit-victim-was-provoked38784057.html|title=Attorneys trade barbs in BART shooting case|last=Aparton|first=Tamara Barak|date=2009-02-01|publisher=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|accessdate=2009-02-05}} {{Dead link|year=October 2010|bot=H3llBot|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witness testimony===
{{Expand section|year=June 2010|date=February 2011}}
* June 14: Carlos Reyes recalled Mehserle saying &quot;Oh shit, I shot him&quot; after shooting Grant, whose former girlfriend, Sophina Mesa, testified she called Grant while he and his friends were being detained and he said: &quot;They're beating us up for no reason, I'll call you back.&quot; Deputy District Attorney David Stein believes that Grant's phone call proves a desire not to resist arrest that night. Cell phone records showed two calls between Grant and Mesa: at 2:05 a.m. and 2:09 a.m., the latter just two minutes before Grant was shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Term of shock&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Mehserle blurted term of shock, witness says|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/15/BAGI1DUVHV.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|page=C1|date=June 15, 2010|date=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 15: Three eye witnesses of the account testified that neither Grant nor the other suspects actively resisted the officers at any time. Each expressed disgust at the behavior from officers preceding the shooting that night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Term of shock&quot;/&gt;
* June 22: Jackie Bryson, one of Grant's friends &quot;who was kneeling and handcuffed just inches from Grant when Johannes Mehserle shot him&quot;, testified for the prosecution. Bryson said that Grant's hands were under Grant's body and Grant said: &quot;I quit. I surrender.&quot; Mehserle then supposedly said &quot;Fuck this&quot; before shooting Grant. Defense attorney Rains repeatedly accused Bryson of lying to convict Mehserle and pointed out a video showing Bryson running towards the train while handcuffed. Responding to Mehserle's question &quot;You were going to leave your friend on that platform, weren't you?&quot; Bryson said &quot;I would never leave my friend.&quot; Rains accused Bryson of being inconsistent from statements in Bryson's lawsuit against BART, and Bryson admitted that he lied to investigators, distrusted the police, and was frequently stressed after Grant died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Mehserle lawyer, Grant's friend clash in court|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/22/BAEA1E362R.DTL&amp;feed=rss.bayarea|work=San Francisco Chronicle|page=A1|date=June 22, 2010|date=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 25: Mehserle took the witness stand. Sobbing, he said that he thought that he was not holding his gun until he heard a pop and looked at his right hand. Responding to a question from Rains, he recalled Grant saying &quot;you shot me&quot; right after the shot went off. Judge Perry called a recess after Oscar Grant supporter Timothy Killings shouted out to Mehserle to &quot;save those fucking tears.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex Alonso 2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Alonso|first=Alex|title=Oakland resident released from jail after court room outburst during Johannes Mehserle trial|url=http://www.streetgangs.com/features/062910_tim_released|work=StreetGangs.Com |accessdate=July 15, 2010|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killings was later arrested for contempt of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Mehserle weeps: 'I didn't think I had my gun'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/25/BA371E4VGE.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|page=A1|date=June 26, 2010|date=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing arguments and verdict===
Judge Perry offered jurors three conviction options: second-degree murder (with a sentence of 15 years to life in prison), [[voluntary manslaughter]] (3 to 11 years), or involuntary manslaughter (2 to 4 years); in addition the jury could have decided to [[acquittal|acquit]]. Prosecutor Michael O'Brien said that Mehserle committed a crime inherently by shooting Grant. Intention meant murder or voluntary manslaughter, and an accident indicated recklessness on Mehserle's part and thus involuntary manslaughter. Judge Perry gave two interpretations of Mehserle's shocked reaction after shooting Grant: either Mehserle actually wanted to use his Taser or Mehserle realized that many people were witnessing his action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Manslaughter on the table in Mehserle trial|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/30/BAQA1E7DM3.DTL|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 1, 2010|page=A1|date=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closing arguments took place on July 1. Expressing a belief that Mehserle &quot;lost all control&quot; the night he shot Grant and labeled the shooting as an accident to avoid liability, Deputy District Attorney David Stein asked the jury to convict Mehserle of second-degree murder. Defense attorney Rains argued that the shooting was accidental and told them not to make &quot;some sort of commentary on the state of relations between the police and the community in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Final arguments continue in Mehserle trial|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/01/BAMO1E87UM.DTL|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 2, 2010|date=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jury deliberations began on Friday, July 2, and the jury had the day off on July 5 because of the Independence Day holiday. On July 6, deliberations were suspended after one juror left for vacation having notified the judge in advance, another juror went to a medical appointment, and another called in sick. One new alternate juror joined the panel. One juror submitted a question asking whether provocation by &quot;sources other than the suspect(s)&quot; can make one guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Stein argued that the jury should be able to consider outsiders' influence of Mehserle, but Rains disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Mehserle jury done for the day; no verdict|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/07/BAQK1EAPC0.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=July 7, 2010|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2010, the jury informed the court that they had reached a verdict by 2:10 p.m.  The deliberations with this jury panel totaled six and a half hours over the course of two days.  At approximately 4 p.m., the jury found Johannes Mehserle guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and not guilty of both the second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;convicted&quot;/&gt;  The jury also found Mehserle guilty of a gun enhancement charge that could add up to ten years to his prison sentence, make him ineligible for probation, and force him to serve 85 percent of his sentence as opposed to the 50 percent most state prisoners serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosynsky|first=Paul T.|last2=Metinko|first2=Chris|title=Mehserle guilty of involuntary manslaughter|newspaper=''[[Oakland Tribune]]''|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_15467680|date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the time of the verdict announcement was announced, many people packed BART trains to leave Oakland, and Interstates [[Interstate 880 (California)|880]] and [[Interstate 980|980]] had heavy traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/08/MNFL1EBKII.DTL|title=After dark, mobs form, smash windows, loot|work=San Francisco Chronicle|page=A1|date=July 9, 2010 | first1=Matthai | last1=Kuruvila | first2=Kevin | last2=Fagan | first3=Carolyn | last3=Jones | date=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were multiple peaceful gatherings held throughout Oakland after the verdict was announced, and sporadic conflicts were quelled quickly by the police early in the evening.  The protests became more violent as darkness fellâsee &quot;Protests and Violence&quot; below.

A two-page letter written by Mehserle was released after the verdict in which he said: &quot;no words can express how truly sorry I am.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farooq |first=Sajid |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local-beat/No-Words-Can-Express-How-Truly-Sorry-I-Am-Mehserle-98131839.html |title=No Words Can Express How Truly Sorry I Am |publisher=NBC Bay Area |year= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing==
Mehserle was originally scheduled to be sentenced on August 6, 2010. On August 6, sentencing was rescheduled for November 5, 2010 so the judge could hear additional motions in the case.

On November 5, Mehserle was sentenced to two years with double credit for time already served, reducing his term by 292 days for the 146 days he has already spent in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/youth-radio-youth-media-international/mehserle-sentenced-to-2-y_b_779702.html |title=Youth Radio - Youth Media International: Mehserle Sentenced to 2 Years |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |year= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge overturned the gun enhancement, which could have added an additional 3 to 10 years to the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/11/05/BA061G7HVS.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |title=Johannes Mehserle sentenced to 2-year minimum term |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2010-11-06 |accessdate=2011-02-22 |first=Demian |last=Bulwa |date=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=7765037 |title=Johannes Mehserle gets two years for involuntary manslaughter in Oscar Grant case &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from prison at 12:01am on June 13, 2011.

==Video evidence==
The incident and subsequent [[direct evidence]] of the shooting was documented by video cameras held by passengers on the train idling next to the platform, as police detained Grant and a number of other men police suspected of being involved in the disturbance. Several witnesses testified during the [[preliminary hearing]] for Mehserle's trial that they began recording because they believed BART officers were acting too aggressively.&lt;ref name='Bay Area News Group 2009-05-19'&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Rosynsky | title=Videos spur emotion in first day of hearing for BART killing | date=2009-05-19 | url =http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12398850 | work =Bay Area News Group | accessdate = 2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos were made available through television news and internet video.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-video-shooting&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/01/06/BART.shooting/?iref=mpstoryview| title = Video of California police shooting spurs investigation| publisher = CNN|author=Eliott C.

Oakland attorney John Burris says BART confiscated numerous cell phone images that he believes contains additional evidence of the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,476644,00.html| title = Man's Fatal Shooting by San Francisco Subway Police Prompts Probe, Plans for $25M Lawsuit | publisher = [[Fox News]]| accessdate = 2009-01-16 | date=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said video confiscated by BART was useful in bringing the murder charge against Mehserle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.kron4.com.dnnmax.com/News/ArticleView/tabid/298/smid/1126/ArticleID/163/reftab/329/Default.aspx?t=D.A.:-Facts-in-BART-Shooting-Case-Justify-Murder-Charges-Against-Former-Officer| title =

Orloff, the district attorney, said that several passenger videos that have not been made public were &quot;very helpful&quot; in the investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindmurdercharge&quot;/&gt;

On January 2, KTVU aired a video by an anonymous passenger who submitted a cell phone video of the actual shooting.

On January 23, KTVU aired a cell-phone video which appeared to show a second officer punching Grant in the face prior to the shooting.&lt;ref name=ktvu123/&gt; In late February, KRON 4 aired a clip of a video showing a different angle of this altercation. In the report, former Alameda  district attorney, Michael Cardoza, told KRON that Pirone appears to be attempting to restrain Grant by grabbing his head and pushing him down. He also said that Grant appeared to be reaching for Pirone's gun. Burris responded by calling it a &quot;ridiculous assumption&quot; since Grant was trying to resolve the problem.

BART spokesperson Linton Johnson described the surveillance footage from the Fruitvale platform cameras as &quot;benign&quot; and said the platform cameras had recorded some of the incident, but did not include the actual shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuffs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BARTcameras&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=BART cameras unclear in fatal shooting|author=Sean Maher|publisher=''[[Oakland Tribune]]''|accessdate=2009-01-06|year=2009|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_11382372?source=most_viewed}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There has been varying commentary on the video evidence. After viewing the shooting from multiple angles, police use-of-force expert Roy Bedard commented: &quot;I hate to say this, it looks like an execution to me&quot; and &quot;It really looks bad for the officer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bartvideo&quot;/&gt;  [[University of San Francisco]] law professor Robert Talbot said the videos could support a claim of an accidental shooting: &quot;Nothing about his body looks murderous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;egelko115&quot;/&gt; Attorney [[Harland Braun]], who won acquittal for an officer in the [[Rodney King]] beating, noted that video evidence can be deceptive, and doesn't show what happened before or after an incident.&lt;ref name=egelko115/&gt;

===Impact of technology===
Video images of the incident were widely broadcast and streamed online.  Several hundred thousand viewed the videos in the first few days after the shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;bartvideo&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/07/MNOV154P0R.DTL| title = BART shooting captured on video| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle|year=2009|author=Matthew B.

The caseâand the overall intense community response to itâhighlights the impact technology can have on news events.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet1&quot;/&gt;

==BART's response==
On January 8, 2009, BART's elected directors offered apologies to the victim's family.&lt;ref name=&quot;apology&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Rachel Gordon|coauthors=Steve Rubenstein| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/09/MN3U155V2F.DTL| title = BART directors apologize to slain man's family| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle|year=2009| accessdate = 2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BART later filed a legal response to the lawsuit that claimed that the shooting was &quot;a tragic accident&quot;, and that Grant contributed to the fatal incident. BART said the officers were &quot;just defending themselves&quot; and that &quot;Oscar Grant willfully, wrongfully, and unlawfully made an assault upon defendants and would have beaten, bruised, and ill-treated them if defendants had not
immediately defended themselves.&quot; &lt;ref name=MercNews4/3/&gt;{{Clarify|year=October 2009|date=February 2011}}

===Riots===
On January 7, 2009 a protest march in Oakland involving about 250 people&lt;ref name=&quot;horror&quot;/&gt; became violent.  Demonstrators caused over $200,000 in damage while breaking shop and car windows, burning cars, setting trash bins on fire, and throwing bottles at police officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;3charged&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;horror&quot;&gt;{{cite news

On May 18, 2009, 100 protested outside of the courthouse during the preliminary hearing and then marched to the nearby Oakland Police Department.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that many of the rioters who were most aggressive in damaging Oakland businesses and property were organized white anarchists wearing black clothing and hoods.  An anarchist slogan was painted on one wall that read &quot;Say 'no' to work.  Say 'yes' to looting.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/09/MNFL1EBKII.DTL | title=After dark, mobs form, smash windows, loot | first1=Matthai | last1=Kuruvila | first2=Kevin | last2=Fagan | first3=Carolyn | last3=Jones | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Oakland officials objected to the &quot;anarchist&quot; label, commenting that the outside agitators seemed to lack any cohesive philosophy and were simply bent on making trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/12/BARE1E8NO2.DTL | title=Community colleges cash in on foreign students | first1=Phillip | last1=Matier | first2=Andrew | last2=Ross | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil action==
Oakland attorney John Burris filed a $25 million wrongful death claim against BART on behalf of Grant's family on January 6, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;BSFSB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-video-shooting&quot;/&gt;  In February, he also filed claims for a total of $1.5 million on behalf of five of Grant's friends who he says were detained without cause for five hours after the shooting, alleging illegal [[search and seizure]], [[false arrest]], and [[excessive force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maher204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;upton205&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Passengers-file-claim-against-BART39124617.html|title=Passengers file claim against BART|last=Upton|first=John|date=2009-02-05|publisher=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such claims are prerequisites to a civil lawsuit if BART denies the claim or fails to respond within 45 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;BSFSB&quot;/&gt;

Part of a $50 million federal civil rights lawsuit brought by Grant's family was closed when BART settled with the mother of Grant's daughter for $1.5 million. Grant's daughter will receive a series of payouts until her 30th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BART pays $1.5 million to aid Grant's daughter|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/27/BAFV1BONH6.DTL|author=Bulwa, Demian |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2010-07-09 | date=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
