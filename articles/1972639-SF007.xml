In computer [[jargon]], '''to slipstream''' updates, [[patch (computing)|patches]] or [[service pack]]s means to integrate them into the [[installation (computer programs)|installation]] files of their original [[software]], so that the resulting files will allow a direct installation of the updated software.

If not directly supported by the software vendor, slipstreaming can be technically possible, depending on the updates, the structure and type of the program to be slipstreamed and of its [[installer]], if any.

In [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environments, it is common for [[system administrator]]s to make slipstreamed installation sources of the operating system available on [[network share]]s. That greatly simplifies [[Software deployment|deployment]] for new installations. Microsoft also usually allows ordering slipstreamed CDs from their website.  Newer versions of Microsoft products usually come either already slipstreamed or with a separate CD holding some updates.

Slipstreaming can save time and money.  It is possible to add [[service pack]]s and other updates and patches to the install source, as well as extra drivers.  In a Windows environment, slipstreaming all needed drivers onto the install source will save time downloading them from the Internet. However, if newer drivers are available then a new install source would be needed.  It also involves more work initially, but can save time later on in reinstallation terms. This is especially significant for administrators that have to manage a large number of computers, where the default case for installing an operating system on each computer would be to use the original media and then update each computer after the installation was complete, as opposed to using a more up-to-date (slipstreamed) source, and having to download/install a minimal number of updates.

Adding patches to the install source is also another time saver.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} However, not all (Windows) patches can be applied in this fashion and one disadvantage is that if it is discovered that a certain patch is responsible for later problems, said patch cannot be removed without using an original, non-slipstreamed install CD.  Online instructions for this way of doing things emphasise the use of virtual PC environments (such as [[VMware Workstation]] or [[VirtualBox]]) for testing, as the end user often gets no support from the program manufacturer for using these &quot;homemade&quot; CDs.

Using slipstreamed OS CDs (e.g. XP Pro) can avoid installation errors caused by drivers and hardware components.
