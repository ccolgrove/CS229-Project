A '''general strike''' is a [[strike action]] by a critical mass of the [[labour (economics)|labour force]] in a city, region, or country. While a general strike can be for political goals, economic goals, or both, it tends to gain its momentum from the ideological or [[Social class|class]] sympathies of the participants. It is also characterized by participation of workers in a multitude of workplaces, and tends to involve entire communities. The general strike has waxed and waned in popularity since the mid-19th century, and has characterized many historically important strikes.

==Purpose==
General strikes have been done in order to seek &quot;democracy, political representation and the provision of basic education and healthcare&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=TmlYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Labour+research+,+Volume+94&amp;dq=Labour+research+,+Volume+94&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FXGpTs2HMs734QTbhsT8Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA&lt;/ref&gt;. In Europe, General Strikes were very common in the 19th and early 20th century. It could be argued that many of them have contributed to rights, such as universal healthcare, low cost college education, and  higher taxes on the rich. 

In [[Portugal]], a general strike has been called by the federation of public labor unions to avert austerity measures.&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110408-702627.html retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Honduras]], a general strike has been called by Union workers, farmers and other organizations demanding better education, an increase in the minimum wage and against fuel price hikes.&lt;ref&gt;Seattle PI, http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Teachers-strike-fuels-unrest-in-polarized-Honduras-1317798.php retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Algeria]], public sector workers have mounted a general strike for higher wages and improved working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Magharebia, http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/newsbriefs/general/2011/04/07/newsbrief-03 retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At any given moment, there may be general strikes in numerous nations around the world. Government leaders may seek to ban general strikes, and in some cases they are successful.  In February, 1947, [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]], as [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] in Japan, banned a planned general strike of 2,400,000 government workers, stating that &quot;so deadly a social weapon&quot; as the general strike should not be used in the impoverished and emaciated condition of Japan so soon after [[World War II]]. Japan's labour leaders complied with his ban.&lt;ref&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald, February 1, 1947, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

[[Ralph Chaplin]], editor of the  [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) newspaper ''[[Solidarity (U.S. newspaper)|Solidarity]]'' and later, of the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'', identified four levels of general strike, 

:* A General Strike in a community.
:* A General Strike in an Industry.
:* A national General Strike.
:* A revolutionary or class strike-- THE General Strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;iww.org&quot;&gt;Ralph Chaplin, The General Strike, Pamphlet, Industrial Workers of the World, 1933 (from the 1985 republication of this pamphlet), http://www.iww.org/en/culture/official/strike/strike4.shtml retrieved April 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1905 pamphlet ''The Social General Strike'', published in Chicago in 1905, Stephen Naft had previously acknowledged the same four levels of the general strike:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The name &quot;General Strike&quot;] is often used to designate the strike of all branches in one trade; for instance the general strike of the miners; when helpers and hoisting engineers, etc. are all out. Then it is used as: General Strike of a city, i.e., &quot;General Strike in Florence&quot;, or a General Strike in a whole country or province, for the purpose of gaining political rights, i.e., the right to vote; as in Belgium, or Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Naft 1905, pages 5-6&quot;&gt;Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike, Debating Club No. 1, Chicago, June 1905, pages 5-6, translated from the German language pamphlet of the same name by Arnold Roller&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The profoundest conception of the General Strike, however, [is] the one pointing to a thorough change of the present system: a social revolution of the world; an entire new reorganization; a demolition of the entire old system of all governments...&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Naft 1905, pages 5-6&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Naft's 1905 pamphlet (translated from the German language) traced existing sentiment for this goal of the general strike to [[proletarian]]s of Spain and Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Naft 1905, page 6&quot;&gt;Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike, Debating Club No. 1, Chicago, June 1905, page 6, translated from the German language pamphlet of the same name by Arnold Roller&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise of ''The Social General Strike'' is that no matter how powerfully the working class organizes itself, it still has no significant power over a congress, or the executive (which has military force at its beck and call). Therefore a general strike called by an &quot;energetic and enthusiastic&quot; minority of workers, may be embraced by the mass of workers who remain unorganized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Naft 1905, page 6&quot;/&gt; Thus it may be possible,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...to completely interrupt production in the whole country, and stop communication and consumption for the ruling classes, and that for a time long enough to totally disorganize the capitalistic society; so that after the complete annihilation of the old system, the working people can take possession through its labor unions of all the means of production...&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Naft 1905, page 7&quot;&gt;Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike, Debating Club No. 1, Chicago, June 1905, page 7, translated from the German language pamphlet of the same name by Arnold Roller&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Social General Strike'' noted the complexity of modern industry, identifying the many stages in the manufacturing process and geographic dispersal of related manufacturing locations as weaknesses of the industrial process during any labor dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Naft 1905, page 7&quot;/&gt; The pamphlet notes the problem of hunger during a general strike, and recommends where warehouses are available for the purpose, that proletarians, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...do the same thing as the ruling classes have done uninterruptedly for thousands of years: that is, &quot;consume without producing.&quot; This deportment of the ruling classes the working class calls exploitation, and if the proletarians do it, the possessing classes call it plunderingâand socialism calls it [[expropriation]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike, Debating Club No. 1, Chicago, June 1905, page 8, translated from the German language pamphlet of the same name by Arnold Roller&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the pamphlet asserts that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The immense advantage of the general strike is that it begins entirely lawfully and without any danger for the workers, and for this reason thousands will take part...&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike, Debating Club No. 1, Chicago, June 1905, page 9, translated from the German language pamphlet of the same name by Arnold Roller&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Socialists, anarchists differ on tactics===

In 1966, in a study of [[Second International|revolutionary socialism]], [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] of the [[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace]] (a conservative/libertarian [[think tank]]), noted two tactical options which divided late 19th century and early 20th century anarchists from socialists: electoral politics, which the socialists embraced, but anarchists generally opposed; and, the general strike as a mechanism to prevent war, which anarchists supported, but socialists refused to endorse.&lt;ref&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 81&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a group, the Socialists of the period repeatedly rejected the general strike as a tactic;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milorad M. Drachkovitch 1943, page 83&quot;&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; however, a number of Socialist leaders advocated its use for one reason or another.&lt;ref&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, pages 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist leaders who embraced the general strike tended to see it as an instrument for obtaining political concessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milorad M. Drachkovitch 1943, page 83&quot;/&gt;

Drachkovitch identified five types of general strikes:

* the political mass strike, a general strike for political rights (such as the right to vote)
* the general strike as a revolutionary act that would transform society
* the general strike as a &quot;revolutionary exercise&quot; which would eventually lead to a transformation of society
* a one day demonstration general strike on [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] (International Workers' Day), aimed at identifying a &quot;worldwide proletariat&quot;
* commencing in 1891, a theoretical mechanism by which to stop wars between nation states&lt;ref name=&quot;Milorad M. Drachkovitch 1943, pages 99-100&quot;&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, pages 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Drachkovitch perceived the first two concepts, the socialist-friendly general strike for political rights within the system, and the general strike as a revolutionary mechanism to overthrow the existing order â which he associated with a &quot;rising anarcho-syndicalist movement&quot; â as in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 99. His actual term was &quot;mutually exclusive.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Drachkovitch believed that the difficulty arose from the fact that the general strike was &quot;one instrument&quot;, but was frequently considered &quot;without distinction of underlying motives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milorad M. Drachkovitch 1943, page 100&quot;&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 100&lt;/ref&gt; 

Milorad M. Drachkovitch also observed the variable success of the general strike in actual use:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Belgium a general strike movement, broken off in one instance without damage to the organizing forces, eventually led to universal suffrage; in Holland a general strike collapsed with disastrous consequences; in Sweden, a general strike was conducted and terminated with disciplined order but did not attain the desired results. In Italy, general strikes had been both socially effective and politically unproductive. On the other hand, the events of January 1905 in Russia once more seemed to underscore the suitability of the general strike as a decisively revolutionary action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milorad M. Drachkovitch 1943, page 100&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Syndicalism and the general strike===

Orthodox labor unions typically act as a representative from the workers to employers. They bargain over wages, hours, and working conditions. 

Other labor organizations typically bargain for the same wage, hour, and conditions improvements, but embrace a critique of capital as establishing and maintaining a permanent working class and an elite ruling class. These unions therefore advocate a permanent solution to the circumstances of strikes, injunctions, and crossing other workers' picket lines.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Hagerty and W. E. Trautmann, One Big Union, An Outline of a Possible Industrial Organization of the Working Class, with Chart, 1st edition, Charles H. Kerr &amp; Company, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the hierarchical relationships of the existing economic system, these other unions perceive the necessity of a radical change in the social order. In brief, these unions are radical in their orientation, and may accurately be described as ''revolutionary''.

One [[labour movement]] philosophy of &quot;peaceful [[revolution]]&quot; is known as [[syndicalism]]. Its tactical method is the strike â the regular strike for protecting the material welfare of the workers, and the general strike as a means to accomplish the desired permanent solution to industrial strife.&lt;ref&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalism has been a common union organizing principle in a number of European countries, including France, Spain, and Italy.

One variation of syndicalism is [[anarcho-syndicalism]], which (in comparison to syndicalism) develops rank and file power with democratic traditions to maintain worker control over union leadership.

====Industrial Workers of the World====

In the United States, Britain, and (to a lesser extent) Australia, the trend toward revolutionary unionism culminated in the growth of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW). Technically, the IWW is described as a union that practices ''[[industrial unionism|revolutionary industrial unionism]]''. Some consider the revolutionary industrial unionism of the IWW to be a form of anarcho-syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out differences; for example, [[Ralph Chaplin]] has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the I.W.W. concept of the General Strike differs almost as much from that of the anarcho-syndicalist as from that of the political or craft unionist. In form, structure and objective, the I.W.W. is more all-sufficient, more mature and more modern than any of its anarcho-syndicalist predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;iww.org&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IWW began to fully embrace the general strike in 1910-1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip S. Foner 1917, page 140&quot;&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 140&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the general strike, according to Industrial Workers of the World theory, is to displace capitalists and give control over the means of production to workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip S. Foner 1917, page 140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1911 speech in New York City, IWW organizer Haywood explained his view of the economic situation, and why he believed a general strike was justified,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The capitalists have wealth; they have money. They invest the money in machinery, in the resources of the earth. They operate a factory, a mine, a railroad, a mill. They will keep that factory running just as long as there are profits coming in. When anything happens to disturb the profits, what do the capitalists do? They go on strike, don't they? They withdraw their finances from that particular mill. They close it down because there are no profits to be made there. They don't care what becomes of the working class. But the working class, on the other hand, has always been taught to take care of the capitalist's interest in the property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Haywood 1911&quot;&gt;Bill Haywood, The General Strike (Chicago, n.d.), pamphlet, published by Industrial Workers of the World, from a New York City speech delivered March 16, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bill Haywood]] believed that [[industrial unionism]] made possible the general strike, and the general strike made possible industrial democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Haywood 1911&quot;/&gt; According to [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|Wobbly theory]], the conventional strike is an important (but not the only) weapon for improving wages, hours, and working conditions for working people. These strikes are also good training to help workers educate themselves about the class struggle, and about what it will take to execute an eventual general strike for the purpose of achieving industrial democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip S. Foner 1917, page 141&quot;&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 141&lt;/ref&gt; During the final general strike, workers would not walk out of their shops, factories, mines, and mills, but would rather occupy their workplaces and take them over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip S. Foner 1917, page 141&quot;/&gt; Prior to taking action to initiate industrial democracy, workers would need to educate themselves with technical and managerial knowledge in order to operate industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip S. Foner 1917, page 141&quot;/&gt; 

According to labor historian [[Philip S. Foner]], the Wobbly conception of industrial democracy is intentionally not presented in detail by IWW theorists; in that sense, the details are left to the &quot;future development of society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, pages 141-142&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain concepts are implicit. Industrial democracy will be &quot;a new society [built] within the shell of the old.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip S. Foner 1917, page 142&quot;&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the industrial union educate themselves to operate industry according to democratic principles, and without the current hierarchical ownership/management structure. Issues such as production and distribution would be managed by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip S. Foner 1917, page 142&quot;/&gt;

In 1927 the IWW called for a three day nationwide walkout â in essence, a demonstration general strike â to protest the execution of anarchists [[Sacco and Vanzetti|Ferdinando Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. McClurg, The Colorado Coal Strike of 1927 -- Tactical Leadership of the IWW, Labor History, Vol. 4, No. 1, Winter, 1963, page 71&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable response to the call was in the [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]] coal district of Colorado, where 1,132 miners stayed off the job, and only 35 went to work,&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. McClurg, The Colorado Coal Strike of 1927 -- Tactical Leadership of the IWW, Labor History, Vol. 4, No. 1, Winter, 1963, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; a participation rate which led directly to the [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Colorado coal strike .28a case study.29|Colorado coal strike of 1927]].

On March 18, 2011, the Industrial Workers of the World website (www.iww.org) supported an endorsement of a general strike as a followup to [[2011 Wisconsin protests|protests against Governor Scott Walker]]'s proposed labor legislation in [[Wisconsin]], following a motion passed by the South Central Federation of Labor (SCFL) of Wisconsin endorsing a statewide general strike as a response to those legislative proposals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iww.org/en/genstrike retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scfl.org&quot;&gt;http://www.scfl.org/ retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The SCFL website states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;At SCFLâs monthly meeting Monday, Feb. 21, delegates endorsed the following: &quot;The SCFL endorses a general strike, possibly for the day Walker signs his 'budget repair bill.'&quot; An ad hoc committee was formed to explore the details. SCFL did not CALL for a general strike because it does not have that authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;scfl.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction of orthodox labor==

The year 1919 saw a number of general strikes throughout North America, including two that were considered significant â the [[Seattle General Strike]], and the [[Winnipeg General Strike]]. While the IWW participated in the Seattle General Strike, that action was called by the Seattle Central Labor Union, affiliated with the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL, predecessor of the [[AFL-CIO]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/strike/ retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June, 1919, the AFL national organization, in session in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], passed resolutions in opposition to the general strike. The official report of these proceedings described the convention as the &quot;largest and in all probability the most important Convention ever held&quot; by the organization, in part for having engineered the &quot;overwhelming defeat of the so-called Radical element&quot; via crushing a &quot;[[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]] proposition&quot;, and also for defeating a proposal for a nationwide general strike, both &quot;by a vote of more than 20 to 1.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheet Metal Workers' Journal 1919, pages 265-267&quot;&gt;Sheet Metal Workers' Journal, Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' International Alliance, Volumes 24-25, Chicago, Illinois, 1919, pages 265-267&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL amended its constitution to disallow any central labor union (i.e., regional labor councils) from &quot;taking a strike vote without prior authorization of the national officers of the union concerned.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheet Metal Workers' Journal 1919, pages 265-267&quot;/&gt; The change was intended to &quot;check the spread of general strike sentiment and prevent recurrences of [[Seattle General Strike|what happened at Seattle]] and [[Winnipeg General Strike|is now going on at Winnepeg]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheet Metal Workers' Journal 1919, pages 265-267&quot;/&gt; The penalty for any unauthorized strike vote was revocation of that body's charter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheet Metal Workers' Journal 1919, pages 265-267&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===Rome===

The first general strike may have been the ''[[secessio plebis]]'' in ancient Rome. In the ''Outline Of History'', H.G. Wells recorded &quot;the general strike of the [[plebeian]]s; the plebeians seem to have invented the strike, which now makes its first appearance in history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H.G. Wells 1920, page 225&quot;&gt;H.G. Wells, Outline Of History, Waverly Book Company, 1920, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Their first strike occurred because they &quot;saw with indignation their friends, who had often served the state bravely in the legions, thrown into chains and reduced to slavery at the demand of [[patrician]] creditors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H.G. Wells 1920, page 225&quot;/&gt; 

Wells noted that &quot;[t]he patricians made a mean use of their political advantages to grow rich through the national conquests at the expense not only of the defeated enemy, but of the poorer plebeian...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H.G. Wells 1920, page 225&quot;/&gt; The plebeians, who were expected to ''obey'' the laws, but were not allowed to ''know'' the laws (which patricians were able to recite from memory),&lt;ref name=&quot;H.G. Wells 1920, pages 225-226&quot;&gt;H.G. Wells, Outline Of History, Waverly Book Company, 1920, pages 225-226&lt;/ref&gt; were successful, winning the right to appeal any injustice to the general assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;H.G. Wells 1920, page 225&quot;/&gt; In 450 BC., in a concession resulting from the rebellion of the plebeians, the laws of Rome were written for all to peruse.&lt;ref name=&quot;H.G. Wells 1920, pages 225-226&quot;/&gt;

===North America===

North American general strikes include the [[1877 Saint Louis general strike]], which grew out of the events of the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]] across the United States, and the [[1892 New Orleans general strike]].  

====1919 Seattle general strike====

In Seattle, [[Seattle General Strike|35,000 shipyard workers went on strike]] for a pay increase. The Seattle Central Labor Council called for a city-wide strike in support. More than one hundred union locals voted to strike. Total number of strikers were sixty-thousand union workers, joined by 40,000 other workers who walked out in sympathy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard Zinn 2010, page 377&quot;&gt;Howard Zinn, A People's History of the United States, Harper Collins, 2010, page 377&lt;/ref&gt; 

The city was successfully shut down, except for essential needs such as fire protection and hospital laundry. Thirty-five neighborhood milk stations were set up throughout the city, and large kitchens prepared thirty thousand meals per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard Zinn 2010, page 377&quot;/&gt;

National leadership of the [[American Federation of Labor]] and other top union officials opposed the strike, and successfully brought pressure to end it.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Philip S., History of the Labor Movement in the United States, v.8 Postwar Struggles, 1918-1920 (NY: International Publishers, 1988), page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Howard Zinn, participants in the strike were mostly affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and there were only a few IWW locals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Howard Zinn, &quot;Self Help in Hard Times&quot;, Chapter 15 of A People's History of the United States, http://www.iww.org/en/culture/articles/zinn15.shtml retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The strike had been peaceful. But when it was over, there were raids and arrests: on the Socialist party headquarters, on a printing plant. Thirty-nine members of the IWW were jailed as &quot;ring-leaders of anarchy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====1934 textile workers====

The term &quot;general strike&quot; is sometimes applied to large-scale strikes of all of the workers in a particular industry, such as the [[Textile workers strike (1934)]]. Such &quot;general&quot; strikes, however massive they might be, involve workers only in a particular workplace.

====1934 dock workers strike====

The classic general strike involves workers (and members of the working-class) who may have no direct stake in the outcome of the strike. For example, in the [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike|San Francisco General Strike of 1934]], both union and non-union workers struck for four days to protest the police and employers' tactics that had killed two picketers and in support of the longshoremen's and seamen's demands.

====1934 Teamsters strike====

The distinction between a strike of different organizations, and a general strike is not always clear. In the [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934]], as an example, many building trades unions and organizations of unemployed workers in federal work projects struck in sympathy with striking truck drivers and to protest the police violence against picketers. Thousands of others participated in demonstrations to support the strikers. Those sympathy strikes, while sizable, never acquired the scope necessary to amount to a &quot;general strike&quot;, however, and the organizers of the Teamsters' strike did not describe it as such.

====1946 Oakland strike====
In October 1946, women at two department stores went on strike.  On December 1, 400 members of the city's police force were employed to break the strike.   Police succeeded in breaking the picket line, but their actions created a spontaneous general strike throughout the city.  An estimated 130,000 people stopped work, essentially shutting down the city. &lt;ref&gt;http://blog.sfgate.com/kalw/2011/11/02/remembering-the-1946-oakland-general-strike/&lt;/ref&gt;

Milorad M. Drachkovitch noted four mass strikes in Belgium â 1886, 1887, 1891, and 1893 â which eventually led to universal suffrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milorad M. Drachkovitch 1943, pages 99-100&quot;/&gt;

[[Belgium]] was likely one of the first important industrial countries where a general strike happened, at least in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strikwerda1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The final strike was the [[Belgian general strike of 1893]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C07E3D61731E033A25750C1A9629C94629ED7CF ''Many Riots in Belgium'', New York Times, 13 April 1893]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his book about [[Rosa Luxemburg]], Paul FrÃ¶lich quotes several experiences of general strikes, including the Belgian general strike for the universal suffrage in 1893. Although the strike succeeded, absolute equality of suffrage had yet to be obtained. 

In 1902 the Belgian Labour Party launched an other strike, which failed. Many German social democrats thought such an experiment was absurd. Drachkovitch observed that German socialists were against the general strike because &quot;under the Kaiser, supporting it was not very safe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864-1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosa Luxemburg]] had a different view, criticizing the Belgian Labour Party for perceived tactical incompetence: ''A general strike forged in advance within the fetters of legality is like a war demonstration with cannons dumped into a river within the very sight of the enemy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrÃ¶lich1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Carl E. Schorske wrote about the same Belgian phenomenon studied by Luxemburg as well as the German opposition to it: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In German Social Democratic circles, the general strike suffered from the hereditary taint of its anarchist origins (...) Rosa Luxemburg, who studied the Belgian strike, was particularly impressed with its success in activating the political consciousness of the backward portions of the population. She was not yet however, prepared to give it European-wide significance. Luxemburg felt it to be appropriate only in countries in which industry was geographically concentrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schorske1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The Walloon author Claude Renard explained the relative successes of the general strike by the relative small territory of Belgium (and especially [[Wallonia]] where the industry was concentrated). He also quoted Luxemburg who criticized [[Le Peuple]], the official newspaper of the Belgian Labour Party who was again in favour of the German method after the General strike of 1902 failed. In [[Die Neue Zeit]], she pointed out the small territory of Belgium, the fact that only  3 or 400 thousand workers were able to make a country strike-bound. But she insisted also about a climate of liberty and democracy where the working class  is really stronger, in [[France]] as well as in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Luxemburg, ''The Belgian Experience'', Die Neue Zeit, 14 may 1902, pp. 47 and the following pages. Quoted by Claude Renard, La conquÃªte du suffrage universel en Belgique, Editions de la Fondation Jacquemotte, Bruxelles, 1966, pp. 224-226.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For several historians, it seemed that Wallonia sprang from these strikes&lt;ref&gt;Marinette Bruwier 1886, ''La Wallonie nÃ©e de la grÃ¨ve'',Colloque UniversitÃ© de LiÃ¨ge, Editions Labor, Bruxelles, 1990 ISBN 2-8040-0522-4&lt;/ref&gt; and likely from the last Belgian general strike the [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike]].

====Spain====

[[Anarchism in Spain|General strikes were frequent in Spain]] during the early 20th century, where revolutionary [[anarcho-syndicalism]] was most popular.

==Notable general strikes==

The largest  general strike that ever stopped the economy of an [[Developed country|advanced industrial country]] &amp;ndash; and the first general [[wildcat strike]] in history &amp;ndash; was [[May 1968 in France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SitInt12&quot;&gt;''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/beginning.html The Beginning of an Era]'', from ''[[Situationist International]]'' No 12 (September 1969). Translated by [[Ken Knabb]].&lt;/ref&gt; The prolonged strike involved eleven million workers for two weeks in a row,&lt;ref name=&quot;SitInt12&quot;/&gt; and its impact was such that it almost caused the collapse of the [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] government.
