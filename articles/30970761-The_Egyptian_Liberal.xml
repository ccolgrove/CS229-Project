The '''2011 Moroccan protests''' are a series of demonstrations across [[Morocco]] and the Moroccan-controlled [[Western Sahara]]n territory which began on 20 February 2011 and are influenced by [[2010â2011 Middle East and North Africa protests|other protests in the region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek Unrest Spreads&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hatem|first=Mohammed|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-16/bahrain-yemen-libya-face-protests-as-region-s-unrest-spreads.html|title=Bahrain, Yemen, Libya Face Protests as Regionâs Unrest Spreads|publisher= [[businessweek.com]]|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Moroccan authorities had approved a peaceful anti-government protest which had been planned on the social networking site [[Facebook]] by several Moroccan youth movements. The protest took place on 20 February 2011 and demanded mainly constitutional reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/03/idINIndia-54646220110203 |title=Morocco government plays down call for protests |publisher=Reuters |date=3 February 2011|accessdate=8 February 2011 |first=Souhail |last=Karam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opposition is thus sometimes known as the '''February 20 Movement for Change''', after the Facebook group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/19/us-morocco-protest-idUSTRE71I3K220110219 | work=Reuters | first=Souhail | last=Karam | title=Morocco February 20 protest leaders quit after row | date=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2011 Moroccan protests 1.jpg|thumb|Thousands of demonstrators gathered in [[Casablanca]].]]
On 20 February, thousands of Moroccans rallied in the capital, [[Rabat]], to demand that King Mohammed give up some of his powers, chanting slogans such as: &quot;Down with autocracy&quot; and &quot;The people want to change the constitution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Thousands took to the streets of Rabat, Casablanca, Tangier and Marrakech in peaceful protests demanding a new constitution, a change in government and an end to corruption. During a march on Hassan II Avenue in the capital, Rabat, demonstrators demanded a new constitution to bring more democracy to the country. They shouted slogans calling for economic opportunity, education reform, better health services, and help in coping with the rising cost of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/856068-protests-spread-to-streets-of-morocco |title=Protests spread to streets of Morocco |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/02/20/moroccans-want-to-reign-in-royal-powers/ |title=Moroccans want to reign in royal powers |publisher=Euronews |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February, about 1,000 people demonstrated in [[Casablanca]] demanding political reforms, according to [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/at-reform-rally-in-morocco/story-fn6s850w-1226012647707|title=Casablanca catches protest fever |date=27 February 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011|publisher=Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March, several hundred demonstrators gathered in Casablanca demanding reforms. Riot police broke up the rally with batons, injuring dozens in what was described as the most violent intervention since the start of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moroccan police break up rally, hurt dozens-witness |author=[[Reuters]] |url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72D00X20110314?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;sp=true |newspaper= |date=14 March 2011|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April, thousands of people protested across Morocco, demanding an end to corruption, an independent judiciary, constitutional reforms, legislative elections as well as more jobs for university graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Protesters demand reform in Morocco |author= |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2011/04/201142512013759717.html |newspaper= |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;24AprAFP&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Moroccans stage peaceful pro-democracy protests |author=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jLVsfu60TI8Ev8KlOaNQdZgp5uNw?docId=CNG.f9dc8540002b694b3f07a574f74a6ed3.ce1 |newspaper= |date=24 April 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May, thousands of Moroccans marched in Marrakesh to demand reforms and express their opposition towards terrorist attacks, like the one on 28 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands demand reform in Morocco rally |author=Souhail Karam |url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE74716020110508?sp=true |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=8 May 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May, Moroccan police spent hours chasing hundreds of pro-democracy activists through the streets of the capital in an effort to prevent any pro-reform demonstrations.
The government appeared to be implementing a new zero tolerance policy for protesters.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/Article_2011-05-22-ML-Morocco-Demonstrations/id-paaa0869d0d074b9388450639c6688ea5 Associated Press 22 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, a few dozens of Feb20 Movement protesters gathered in front of a courthouse in Safi to demand authorities to free two unfairly arrested Sebt Gzoula demonstrators. Those two were arrested under false claims of attacking government forces&lt;ref&gt;Video on YouTube with english, french and arabic descriptions included:[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47KCsnl8gNU]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Protests have continued nearly every Sunday, with thousands, if not tens of thousands, marching in cities around Morocco calling for governmental reform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/MoroccoProtest&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September, three thousand protesters marched through the streets of Casablanca in the largest such demonstration in months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/18/ap/middleeast/main20107964.shtml | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic response==
On 9 March, in a live televised address, King Mohammed VI announced his decision to undertake a comprehensive constitutional reform aimed at improving democracy and the rule of law, and underlined his &quot;firm commitment to giving a strong impetus to the dynamic and deep reforms... taking place&quot;. The monarch announced the formation of a commission to work on the constitutional revisions, with proposals to be made to him by June after which a [[Moroccan constitutional referendum, 2011|referendum]] would be held on the draft constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

The comission was widely criticized by the protest movement leaders, which refused to participate in the comission's work, despite being invited to do so by the government. 

On 14 April, King Mohammed VI pardoned or reduced the sentences of 190 prisoners, including Islamists and [[Sahrawi independence]] activists&lt;ref name=&quot;24AprAFP&quot;/&gt;.

==Constitutional reform proposals==
In a televised speech on Friday, 17 June, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]] announced a series of constitutional reforms, passed trough [[Moroccan constitutional referendum, 2011|a national referendum]] on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/world/africa/18morocco.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=world Morocco King Proposes Limited Steps to Democracy], [[New York Times]], 17 June 2011. Accessed 19 June 2011 &lt;/ref&gt; The newly proposed reforms were largely supported by Moroccans, and popular celebrations were observed throuought the country, the leaders of the 20 February Movement rejected the proposals as insufficient and called for continuing protests on 19 June 2011 demanding &quot;truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy&quot;, while calling for a mass boycott of the poll .&lt;ref name=&quot;aj&quot;&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/06/201161810543184895.html Protests called against Morocco reform plan,] [[Al Jazeera]], 18 June 2011. Accessed 19 June 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Morocco-Reform-offer-rejected-20110618 Morocco: Reform offer rejected], [[News24]], 18 June 2011.

The proposed reforms passed and gave the prime minister and parliament more executive authority, and made [[Berber languages|Berber]] an official language in Morocco, together with [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as the [[HassÄnÄ«ya language|Arab-Hassani Language]] spoken among the [[Saharawi]] tribes of Morocco. The proposal empowered the prime minister with the authority to appoint government officials and to dissolve the parliament - the powers previously held by the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;aj&quot;/&gt; However, the king remains the military commander-in-chief and retains his position as the chair of the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Security Council, the primary bodies responsible for the security policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;aj&quot;/&gt; A new constitutional provision  also confirms the king's role as the highest religious authority in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13816974 Morocco's King Mohammed unveils constitutional reforms], [[BBC News]],  18 June 2011. Accessed 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a televised speech on 30 July the king said the constitutional changes should be implemented swiftly, starting with [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary elections]], adding that &quot;any delay may jeopardise this dynamic of trust and squander opportunities offered by the new reform&quot;. After negotiations between the interior ministry, which oversees elections, and some 20 political parties, the government proposed that parliamentary elections should take place on 11 November instead of the scheduled date of September next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morocco to host early parliamentary election |author= |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/08/201181541738753674.html |newspaper= |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of protesters went onto the streets again on 11 September 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://derstandard.at/1315006080977/Tausende-demonstrieren-erneut-fuer-demokratische-Reformen&lt;/ref&gt; and on 18 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/moroccos-pro-democracy-movements-start-demonstrations-again-after-hiatus/2011/09/18/gIQArwB2cK_story.html | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
On 2 June 2011, a man died of injuries he had allegedly received during the riots the city of Safi witnessed three days before. Official reports state that the man's participation to the protest in  precarious health conditions led to the complications which caused his death.
