There are a number of '''media ministries''' associated with the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. These come in print, radio and television forms and reach countries all around the globe. The Adventist church has a long history of media-based communication, having grown out of the [[Millerite movement]] of the 1840s which heavily used the print media.  Some of the media ministries are directly funded by the church, while others are self-supporting organizations that rely on donations.

All the main Adventist broadcast ministries have engaged in worldwide outreach via numerous crusades and rallies.  Worldwide outreach is also conducted by Adventist World Radio mostly via [[shortwave radio]] transmissions, but also via AM, FM, [[satellite radio|satellite]], Internet, and direct-to-home satellite radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;Historical dictionary of Seventh-Day Adventists By Gary Land, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasting is currently done from 10 transmitter sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

== Publishing ==
Adventists are prolific publishers. They operate numerous publishing houses around the world, with the two main ones in North America being [[Review and Herald Publishing Association|Review and Herald]] and [[Pacific Press Publishing Association|Pacific Press]].&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Spectrum (magazine)|Spectrum]]'' issue [http://spectrummagazine.org/spectrum/issue/vol_8_no_4_aug_1977 8:4 (August 1977)], which focuses on publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[List of Seventh-day Adventist periodicals|Adventist magazines]] are published around the world.

== Radio ==
The ''[[Voice of Prophecy]]'' was founded in 1929 by [[H.M.S. Richards]], Sr. on a single radio station in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], but has since spread to stations throughout the nation and has recently begun television and video production.  Richards' son, H.M.S. Richards, Jr., succeeded him in the late 1970s, and today is hosted by Pastor Lonnie Meleshenko and Connie Jeffery (daughter of ''It Is Written'' founder George Vandeman).

''[[The Quiet Hour]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thequiethour.org/index.php Thequiethour.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1937 by J.L. Tucker as a radio program.  Succeeding members of the Tucker family have run the ministry since then, and it too has expanded into television.

''[[Amazing Facts]]'' was founded in 1965 by Joe Crews in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].  Inspired by the success of the ''Voice of Prophecy'', Crews' original objective was to reach out to both Christian and non-Christian listeners via daily 15-minute programs by opening with a catchy historic fact, and how it applies to the overall Biblical messages.  Later, the program offered accompanying home Bible study courses, as well as books written by Crews himself.  In 1987, Amazing Facts initiated a television ministry.  In 1994, after Joe Crews' passing, [[Doug Batchelor]] assumed the position as Director/Speaker, and has held that position ever since.  Today, Amazing Facts broadcasts mainly out of [[Sacramento, California]].

''[[Faith For Today]]'' was launched in May, 1950, by William and Virginia Fagal and was fully sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Since its inception, Faith For Today sought to reach out to the vast and diverse television audiences. By December, 1950, it became the first authentically national religious telecast in North America. Since the very first broadcast, Faith For Today offered viewers Bible lessons, books and other spiritual and personal growth materials. For nearly 20 years, Faith For Today's program format was similar to the popular variety shows of that era. Featuring music by the Faith For Today Quartet, discussions, special guests, short dramatic skits, and inspirational commentaries by William Fagal, the audience's interest was kept engaged while communicating the basics of Christianity. In 1972, Faith For Today moved its format to a weekly dramatic series called ''Westbrook Hospital''. This drama in a hospital setting showed that Christian virtues such as honesty and love work in the real world. Currently, Faith For Today's programs include ''McDougall, M.D.'', ''The Evidence'' and ''Lifestyle Magazine''.  This ministry, led by Mike Tucker, is proud to celebrate its 60th year in broadcasting.
