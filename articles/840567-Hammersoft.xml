A '''grater''' (also known as a '''shredder''' in parts of the eastern [[United States]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}) is a [[kitchen utensil]] used to grate foods into fine pieces. It was invented by FranÃ§ois Boullier in the 1540s.

==Uses==
Several types of graters feature different sizes of grating slots, and can therefore aid in the preparation of a variety of foods. They are commonly used to grate [[cheese]] and [[lemon]] or [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] peel (to create [[zest (ingredient)|zest]]), and can also be used to grate other soft foods. They are commonly used in the preparation of [[toasted cheese]], [[Welsh rarebit]], and [[macaroni and cheese]].

In [[:category:Slavic cuisine|Slavic cuisine]], graters are commonly used to grate [[potato]]es, for preparation of, e.g., [[draniki]], [[bramborak]] or [[potato babka]].

In tropical nations, graters are also used to grate [[coconut]] meat. In [[Jamaica]], a coconut grater is used as a traditional musical instrument&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/fredericks.html|accessdate=2007-07-14|title=American Rhythm and Blues Influence on Early Jamaican Musical Style|author=Brad Fredericks}}&lt;/ref&gt; (along with drums, fife, and other instruments) in the performance of [[kumina]], [[jonkanoo]], and sometimes [[mento]].

==History==
The cheese grater was invented by Issac Cox in the 1540s so hard cheeses could still be used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}In Roman times, Roman soldiers were known to grate each other with cheese graters for sexual pleasure.

==Variants==
There are also complex food-processing machines with grater-like mechanisms. These mechanisms rotate by the turn of a cluster or electric motor.

==In popular culture==
* In ''[[The Sopranos]]'' episode, &quot;[[Mergers and Acquisitions (The Sopranos)|Mergers and Acqusitions]]&quot;, [[List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_-_Friends_and_Family#Valentina_La_Paz|Valentina La Paz]] reports, in disgust, to [[Tony Soprano]] that in lieu of having conventional sexual relations, Soprano family mob captain, [[Ralph Cifaretto]], asks her to scrape a cheese grater across his back and pour hot candle wax on his [[testicles]].

*Comedian [[Mitch Hedberg]] performed a joke in which he stated that the negative name of cheese grater would be &quot;a sponge ruiner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/01ebe428cd/mitch-hedberg-cheese-shredder-from-standupfan|accessdate=2011-06-25|title=Mitch Hedberg - Cheese Shredder|author=Mitch Hedberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
