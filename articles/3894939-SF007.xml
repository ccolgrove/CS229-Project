'''Ekiga''' /i k ai g a/ (formerly called '''GnomeMeeting''') is a [[VoIP]] and [[video conferencing]] application for [[GNOME]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It is distributed as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. It was the default VoIP client in [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] until October 2009, when it was replaced by [[Empathy (software)|Empathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ekiga|title=Ekiga|date=2008-10-23|publisher=Ubuntu Documentation|accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ekiga supports both the [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] and [[H.323]] (based on [[Open Phone Abstraction Library|OPAL]]) protocols and is fully interoperable with any other SIP compliant application and with [[Microsoft]] [[NetMeeting]]. It supports many high-quality audio and video [[codec]]s.&lt;ref name=What&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.ekiga.org/index.php/About_Ekiga|title=About Ekiga|date=23 February 2007|publisher=Ekiga Wiki|accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ekiga was initially written by [[Damien Sandras]] in order to graduate from the [[UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain]]. It is currently developed by a community-based team led by Sandras. The logo was designed based on his concept by Andreas Kwiatkowski.&lt;ref name=Kwiatkowski&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.ekiga.org/index.php/People|title=People|date=23 February 2007|publisher=Ekiga Wiki|accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ekiga.net also serves as a free and private SIP registrar, which enables its members to originate and terminate (receive) calls from and to each other without involvement of any other networks (such as the [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]]) except the Internet.
