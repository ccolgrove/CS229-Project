'''''SpongeBob SquarePants''''' (&lt;!-- Put the correct grammar, do not capitalize it as &quot;Often&quot;. --&gt;often referred to simply as '''''SpongeBob''''') is an American animated television series, created by [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and [[animator]] [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|title character]] and his various friends in the underwater city of &quot;Bikini Bottom&quot;.&lt;!-- Punctuation always goes at the end of a sentence, not a quote symbol. --&gt; The series' popularity has prompted the release of a [[media franchise]], contributing to its position as [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon's]] highest rated show, the most distributed property of [[MTV Networks]], and among [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons']] most watched shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnilive.com/2009/06/nickelodeon-celebrates-pop-culture-icon-spongebob-squarepants-decade/ |title=Nickelodeon Celebrates Pop Culture Icon SpongeBob SquarePants decade |work=Media News International |first=Rosina |last=Stock |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--It was never been produced by Nelvana, or Teletoon outside of the USA. Any removal considered vandalizing.--&gt; As of 2011, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' is the only Nicktoon from the 1990s that has not ended yet. The show is listed 15th in IGN's top 100 animated series list. It is also known for being one of [[Nickelodeon]]'s longest running TV shows.

The basis for ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' was formed by Hillenburg in 1984 while teaching and studying [[marine biology]] at the [[Ocean Institute]] in [[Dana Point, California]], where he wrote the comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone'', which starred various [[anthropomorphic]] forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters. He left the institute to become an animator in 1987, and later attended the [[California Institute of Arts]] in 1992. In the institute, he made his [[thesis]] film ''Wormholes'' (1992), which led to his hiring as a [[animation director|director]], writer, producer, storyboard artist, and [[executive producer]] of the series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' by creator [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]]. He started to develop the series in 1996 following ''Rocko's Modern Life''{{'s}}, and pitched the series to Nickelodeon in 1998 and was later greenlit for a first season.

The pilot episode of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' first aired episodes in the United States on Nickelodeon on May 1, 1999, following the ''[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]''. The first episodes were called &quot;[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]&quot;, &quot;Reef Blower&quot;, and &quot;[[Tea at the Treedome]]&quot;. The &quot;official&quot; series [[premiere]] followed on July 17, 1999, with the second episode, &quot;Bubblestand/Ripped Pants.&quot; The show reached enormous popularity by 2000 during the second season, and has remained popular since. A [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie|feature film]] of the series was released in theaters on November 19, 2004. The series celebrated its tenth anniversary on July 17, 2009. ''SpongeBob'' was renewed for a ninth season on January 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/01/nickelodeon-renews-spongebob-squarepants-for-ninth-season/ |title=Nickelodeon Renews âSpongeBob SquarePantsâ For Ninth Season |publisher=Deadline.com |date=2011-01-03 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far the series has aired 320 individual episodes.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters}}
'''[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]]''' is an energetic and optimistic [[sponge|sea sponge]] (although his appearance more closely resembles a [[sponge (tool)|kitchen sponge]]) who lives in a [[sea pineapple|pineapple]] under the sea with his pet [[snail]], '''[[Gary (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Gary]]''', who meows like a cat. Although Gary only actually speaks in a few episodes, (mainly in &quot;Sleepy Time&quot; in SpongeBob's dream world, where Gary is portrayed as a [[librarian]] with an [[English language in England|English accent]]) the characters have shown an ability to understand him. Living two houses down from SpongeBob is his best friend, '''Patrick Star''', a dim-witted yet friendly [[Pisaster brevispinus|pink seastar]] who lives under a rock. Even despite his &quot;Mental Setbacks&quot;, Patrick still sees himself as intelligent.  SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker is '''Squidward Tentacles''', an arrogant and ill-tempered squid who lives in an Easter Island [[moai]] and dislikes his neighbors (especially SpongeBob) for their child-like behavior. He enjoys playing the [[clarinet]] and painting self-portraits, but hates his job working at the Krusty Krab.

Another close friend of SpongeBob's is '''[[Sandy Cheeks]]''', a [[squirrel]]&lt;!-- Do not put what kind of squirrel Sandy is without a reliable source. --&gt; from [[Texas]]. Sandy is an expert at [[karate]] and lives in an underwater tree dome. When not inside her tree dome, she wears an [[astronaut]]-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. SpongeBob and Squidward's employer is former [[officer cadet]] for the Bikini Bottom Navy force and war veteran '''[[Mr. Krabs|Eugene Krabs]]''', a miserly [[crab]] obsessed with money, who is the owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant. Mr. Krabs has a [[whale]] daughter, Pearl, who is a teenage cheerleader. The reason why Mr. Krabs' daughter is a whale is unknown. Mr. Krabsâ archenemy is '''[[Sheldon Plankton]]''', a small green [[copepod]] who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket across the street from the Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers to obtain success (occasionally with the assistance of his computer wife, Karen), though his schemes always end in failure.

==Origins==
[[File:Cal Arts entrance.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] became an [[animator]] during his period of study at the [[California Institute of Arts]].]]
Creator Stephen Hillenburg initially conceived ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' in 1984, while he was teaching and studying [[marine biology]] at what is now the [[Orange County Ocean Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Exposed|Banks]], pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Hillenburg became fascinated with animation, and wrote a [[comics|comic book]] entitled ''The Intertidal Zone'' starring various [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters,&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks, p. 9&quot;&gt;Banks, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; including &quot;Bob the Sponge&quot;, who was the co-host of the comic and resembled an actual [[sponge|sea sponge]], as opposed to SpongeBob who resembles a [[Sponge (material)|kitchen sponge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillenburg&quot; /&gt; In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue his dream of becoming an [[animation|animator]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks, p. 9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillenburg&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Hillenburg, Stephen|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to envision the possible concept of a project involving anthropomorphic sea life, drawing several rough sketches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillenburg&quot; /&gt; In 1992, Hillenburg began to attend the [[California Institute of the Arts]] to study animation, having been accepted into the institute by [[Jules Engel]], who was impressed with Hillenburg's previous work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks, p. 9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drymon&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Drymon, Derek|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants.

While attending animation school, Hillenburg received a job on the children's TV series ''[[Mother Goose &amp; Grimm]]'', and worked on the series from 1991 to 1993. When attending the California Institute of the Arts, he made his [[thesis]] film entitled ''Wormholes'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillenburg&quot; /&gt; which was funded by the [[Princess Grace Foundation]] and was later displayed at various animation festivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillenburg&quot; /&gt; In 1993, Hillenburg graduated from the institute, earning a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in experimental animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks, p. 9&quot;/&gt; In 1995, [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]], creator of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', met Hillenburg at an animation festival, and offered him a job as a [[animation director|director]] of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillenburg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Joe Murray (animator)|Murray, Joe]]|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants.

''Rocko's Modern Life'' ended in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.joemurraystudio.com/tv/rocko.shtml Rocko's Modern Life]&quot;. ''Joe Murray Studio''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly following this, Hillenburg began working on ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', teaming up with several Nickelodeon veterans and ''Rocko'' crew members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillenburg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks, p. 10&quot;/&gt; To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on ''Rocko's Modern Life''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Excitable&quot; /&gt; Originally, SpongeBob was to be named ''SpongeBoy'', but this name was already in use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Exposed|Banks]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; This was discovered after voice acting for the original seven minute pilot was recorded in 1997. The Nickelodeon legal department discovered that the name was already in use for a mop product.&lt;ref name=Radio /&gt; Upon finding this out, Hillenburg decided that the character's given name still had to contain &quot;Sponge&quot; so viewers would not mistake the character for a &quot;Cheese Man.&quot; Hillenburg decided to use the name &quot;SpongeBob.&quot; He chose &quot;SquarePants&quot; as a family name as it referred to the character's square shape and &quot;had a nice ring to it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rocko|Neuwirth]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

While pitching the cartoon to Nickelodeon executives, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an âunderwater terrarium with models of the charactersâ, and Hawaiian music to set the theme. The setup was described by Nick executive Eric Coleman as &quot;pretty amazing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Coleman, Eric|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; When given money and two weeks to write the pilot episode (âHelp Wantedâ),&lt;ref name=&quot;Drymon&quot; /&gt; [[Derek Drymon]], Stephen Hillenberg, and Nick Jennings returned with, described by Nickelodeon official [[Albie Hecht]], âa performance he wished he had on tapeâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Hecht, Albie|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although described as stressful by executive producer Derek Drymon,&lt;ref name=&quot;Drymon&quot; /&gt; the pitch went âvery wellâ; [[Kevin Kay]] and Hecht had to step outside because they were âexhausted from laughingâ, making the cartoonists worried.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot; /&gt;

==Progression==
===Hillenburg era (1999â2004)===
''SpongeBob'''s first season was only a modest success during its initial run after the series' debut in 1999, but the show still garnered enough popularity that Nickelodeon quietly renewed it for a second season. Beginning with this season, production of the series switched from [[Traditional animation#Traditional ink-and-paint and camera|traditional cel animation]] to [[digital ink and paint]]. During the second season's run, the show quickly achieved enormous and world wide popularity, leading to an immediate third season pick-up. The show's continued success eventually led to the creation of a feature film called ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'', which was intended to be the end of the series. However, shortly after the film's release, Nickelodeon renewed the series for a fourth season. Also following the film's release, Stephen Hillenburg resigned as show runner, causing a shift in the series' production crew, as well as several of the series' writers. Following the end of the Hillenburg era, the animation style changed to 3D computer animation (although it would still use digital ink and paint).

===Post-movie era (2005âpresent)===
The series' fourth season began in May 2005, and was ordered a fifth season in December 2005, bringing the showâs total episode count to 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/12/27/tvnradio/12578379&amp;sec=tvnradio |title=More SpongeBob on Nickelodeon |accessdate=April 24, 2008 |date=December 27, 2005 |work=Star Online eCentral }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, ''SpongeBob'' was approved for a sixth season.

Later on November&amp;nbsp;12, 2007, a TV movie aired titled ''[[Atlantis SquarePantis]]'', guest starring [[David Bowie]] as the voice of Lord Royal Highness. In March 2008, it was announced that ''SpongeBob'' would have an additional thirty-nine episodes, which includes the remaining episodes of the sixth season, and a seventh season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/news/Pages/newstext.aspx?RID=1118469|accessdate= March 15, 2008|work=Viacom.com|title=Nickelodeon Picks-Up Returning Animated Hits|date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1656|accessdate= March 16, 2008|work=Animation Insider|title=Nickelodeon Upfront 2008|date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=22274|accessdate= March 19, 2008|work=ToonZone|title=Nick Orders New Eps of &quot;SpongeBob,&quot; &quot;OddParents&quot; and Other Series|date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rugrats'' aired 172 episodes in its run; ''SpongeBob'', when the eighth season completes, will have 178.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/spongebob-renewed-26-episodes-11810 |accessdate=December&amp;nbsp;16, 2009 |work=The Wrap |title='SpongeBob' Renewed for 26 Episodes |date=December&amp;nbsp;15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was further extended to a ninth season in January 2011, bringing its total to 204 episodes.

The eighth season started on March 26, 2011, when &quot;Oral Report&quot; and &quot;A Friendly Game&quot; aired. &quot;Sentimental Sponge&quot; aired the next weekend, on April 2, 2011. The next episode did not air until June 4, 2011, when a SpongeBob SquarePants new episode marathon started, that aired 1 new episode every Saturday, for the month of June.

==Music==
The [[theme music]] was composed by Derek Drymon, Mark Harrison, Stephen Hillenburg and Blaise Smith as part of Hank Smith Music, and is primarily based on the [[sea shanty]], &quot;[[Blow the Man Down]]&quot;. The song is sung by Painty the Pirate, voiced by [[Patrick Pinney]], and can be found on the soundtrack ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights]]''. A cover of the song by [[Avril Lavigne]] can be found on the [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (soundtrack)|''SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' soundtrack]]. Another cover by the [[Violent Femmes]], which aired as a commercial on Nickelodeon to promote season two, can be viewed in the special features of the [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants Media|Nautical Nonsense/Sponge Buddies DVD]]. A choral version was recorded for the SpongeBob [[Christmas special]] where the last repetition of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; was replaced by, &quot;It's the SpongeBob Christmas special.&quot; The theme song is occasionally used as marching cadence. An instrumental version of the opening theme is used in Italy. The series' [[Music editor (filmmaking)|music editor]] and main composer is Nicolas Carr. Most of the background music used in the series comes from the Associated Production Music (APM) Library, some of which have also been used in shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', ''[[The Mighty B!]],'' ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete]]''. For competition-based episodes, some of [[Sam Spence]]'s [[NFL Films]] music is used (such as &quot;A Golden Boy Again&quot; used in episodes such as [[The Fry Cook Games]] and &quot;Ramblin' Man from Gramblin&quot; is used in Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V. &quot;The Lineman&quot; is also used extensively in Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy episodes). Ironically, one of Spence's more famous songs for the NFL Films library of music is an orchestral version of &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot; called &quot;Up She Rises&quot;, first suggested by [[Steven Sabol]] to his father [[Ed Sabol|Ed]] because he liked the song at summer camp.

Hawaiian steel guitar music is used for comedic and dramatic effect in the show. Various compositions featuring the Hawaiian steel convey happy, sad, or goofy emotions and situations. Many are traditional Hawaiian melodies such as &quot;[[Aloha 'Oe]]&quot; and are usually sampled from the above-mentioned APM music library, and are from time to time performed by classic steel guitar artists, including The Woodies, [[The Langhorns]], and [[The MelTones]]. Creator Hillenburg states that much of the music in the series was inspired by 1950s Hawaiian steel guitar tunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exposed&quot;/&gt; Another aspect of the series' musical score is traditional sea shanties, which are used for the musical themes in the show. The most commonly used song in the series is &quot;[[Drunken Sailor]],&quot; though a ukulele version of the &quot;[[Twelfth Street Rag]]&quot; is often heard in the background as well. Unlike other Nickelodeon shows, SpongeBob features well-known independent musicians who contribute to its soundtrack. [[Alternative rock]] bands such as [[Wilco]], [[The Shins]], [[The Flaming Lips]] and [[Ween]], as well as metal bands [[Pantera]], [[MotÃ¶rhead]] and [[Twisted Sister]] have made appearances on the show and movies soundtracks.

==Reception==
===Popularity and appeal===
''SpongeBob SquarePants'' was the first &quot;low budget&quot; [[Nicktoons|Nickelodeon cartoon]], according to the network, to become extremely popular. Low-budget cartoons had not garnered as much esteem as higher-rated, higher-budgeted shows, although when ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' aired in 1999, it had gained a significant enough number of viewers in the ratings to be considered popular, eventually reaching worldwide popularity by 2000. ''SpongeBob'' follows other Nickelodeon shows that have attracted &quot;older&quot; followers: Other shows have followed in this trend as well: ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' won a similar fan base when it premiered in 2001, and is now second only to ''SpongeBob'' in popularity. Though the show debuted in 1999, ''SpongeBob'' did not become hugely popular until around 2000, and it has remained popular since then. Since 2004, IGN made ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' 15th in its top 100 animated series of all time list.

[[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] group [[Metallica]] even released a T-shirt featuring cartoon versions of themselves playing live with the characters SpongeBob and Patrick. British rock singer [[David Bowie]] was a special guest on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode Atlantis SquarePantis, which aired on November 12, 2007.&lt;ref name=bowie&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/11152007/tv/bowie_sponge_makes_splash_402981.htm | title = Bowie &quot;sponge&quot; makes splash|work=New York Post | date = November 15, 2007 | accessdate = December 7, 2007 | first=Michael | last=Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode drew total 8.8&amp;nbsp;million viewers, the biggest audience in the show's eight-year history.&lt;ref name=bowie/&gt;

The show became so popular with adolescents and adults that the series was broadcast on [[MTV]] and featured on [[Spike TV]]. A quote by Patrick, &quot;It's gonna rock!&quot; from the episode [[Mid-Life Crustacean]], has been used as a promotional tag-line for rock stations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} [[Ren and Stimpy]], among others, had followed a similar path. ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' features a [[cameo appearance]] by actor [[David Hasselhoff]], in a parody of his role from the ''Baywatch'' TV series. In April 2009, as a tie-in to the special &quot;SpongeBob vs. The Big One&quot;, [[Burger King]] distributed two different commercials geared toward children and adult audiences. In ads broadcast on major networks, the commercial shows [[rapper]] [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] recording a music video for his new song, â[[Baby Got Back|SpongeBob Got Back]]â.

===Criticism and controversy===
In 2005, a promotional video which showed SpongeBob along with other characters from children's shows singing together to promote [[cultural diversity|diversity]] and [[Toleration|tolerance]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Icon&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4190699.stm | title=US right attacks SpongeBob video | date=January 20, 2005 | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | author=BBC Staff |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; was attacked by an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] group in the United States because they saw the character SpongeBob being used as an advocate for [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=accuse&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2005-01-22-kids-video_x.htm | title=Spongebob, Muppets and the Sister Sledge writer suffer criticism | date=January 22, 2005 | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dobson]] of [[Focus on the Family]] accused the makers of the video of promoting homosexuality due to a pro-tolerance group sponsoring the video.&lt;ref name=accuse /&gt;

The incident led to questions to whether or not SpongeBob is homosexual. In 2002, SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg denied this, despite the fact that SpongeBob's popularity with gay men grew. He clarified that he considers the character to be &quot;almost [[asexual]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2313221.stm | title=Camp cartoon star 'is not gay' | date=October 9, 2002 | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | author=BBC Staff |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1021976,00.html | title=SpongeBob Asexual, Not Gay: Creator | date=January 28, 2005 | accessdate=August 26, 2009 | first=Stephen M. | last=Silverman | work=[[People (magazine)|People]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dobson made the comments, Hillenburg repeated this assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=22&amp;art_id=vn20050129114540161C803463|title=SpongeBob isn't gay or straight, creator says |date=January 29, 2005|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=November 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people = Farhat, Basima (Interviewer) |date = December 5, 2006 |title = Tom Kenny: Voice of SpongeBob SquarePants â Interview |url = http://www.thepeoplespeakradio.net/archives/mp3/tps-2006-12-05-kenny.mp3 |format = mp3 |medium = Radio production |publisher=The People Speak Radio |accessdate = November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobson later asserted that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob, the video, or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video, ''[[We Are Family Foundation]]''. Dobson indicated that the ''We Are Family Foundation'' posted pro-homosexual material on their website, but later removed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050128/20875.htm|title=Dobson clarifies Pro-Gay SpongeBob Video Controversy|last=Chang|first=Pauline J.|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=[[The Christian Post]]|accessdate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the controversy, John H. Thomas, the [[United Church of Christ]]'s general minister and president, said they would welcome SpongeBob into their ministry. He said ''&quot;Jesus didn't turn people away. Neither do we&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ministry celebrates SpongeBob: Gay, happy, yellow, orange, whatever, he's welcome | url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/home/column_article.asp?id=11260&amp;cid=1&amp;cname=Media | date=February 4, 2005 | author=Till, Francis | work=National Business Review | accessdate=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey P. Dennis, author of the journal article &quot;The Same Thing We Do Every Night: Signifying Same-Sex Desire in Television Cartoons,&quot; argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in love, while adding that he believed that SpongeBob and Patrick &quot;are paired with arguably erotic intensity.&quot; Dennis noted the two are &quot;not consistently coded as romantic partners,&quot; since they live in separate residences, and have distinct groups of friends, but claimed that in the series, &quot;the possibility of same-sex desire is never excluded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Jeffrey P. &quot;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-110113188.html The Same Thing We Do Every Night: Signifying Same-Sex Desire in Television Cartoons].&quot; ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]''.

Within the PDF document the source info is on p. 137 (6/10)&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Goodman of ''[[Animation World Magazine]]'' described Dennis's comments regarding SpongeBob and Patrick as &quot;interesting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Martin. &quot;Deconstruction Zone â Part 2.&quot; ''[[Animation World Network]]''.

A 2011 study conducted at the [[University of Virginia]], published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'', suggested that allowing preschool audiences to watch the series caused short term disruptions in mental function and attention span. The study had three groups of four-year-olds each engage in activities; one group watched ''SpongeBob'', another watched ''[[Caillou]]'', and the third group drew pictures. After nine minutes, the children were tested on mental functions; the group watching ''SpongeBob'' scored significantly lower than the other two groups, whose results were roughly equal to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Lillard, Angeline and Jennifer Peterson.

===Film===
{{Main|The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie}}
[[Image:Spongebob squarepants ver8.jpg|170px|thumb|The theatrical poster for ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie''.]]
[[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]] produced ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'', a film [[adaption]] of the ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' animated series released on November 19, 2004. The film was directed by series creator Stephen Hillenburg, and was written by long-time series writers Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill, Kent Osborne, Aaron Springer, and Paul Tibbitt. Nickelodeon official Albie Hecht, Drymon, Hillenburg, Julia Pistor, and Gina Shay produced the film, while much of the film's music was composed by Gregor Narholz. this movie was originally going to be the [[series finale]], but because of the film's popularity and universal critical acclaim, Stephen Hillenburg decided to make more episodes. The film follows SpongeBob, who expects to be bestowed the title of manager for Mr. Krabs' new restaurant, ''The Krusty Krab 2'' (although this restaurant is never seen or mentioned for the rest of the series). However, the position is given to Squidward instead, causing SpongeBob to go into a state of depression.

Nickelodeon's parent company [[Viacom]] purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of the ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different to already popular designs for [[Hello Kitty]] and [[Pikachu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/01/24/entertainment/e091755S47.DTL|title=SpongeBob Goes Trendy to Win Japan Fans|last=Kageyama|first=Yuri|date=January 24, 2007|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=November 8, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
