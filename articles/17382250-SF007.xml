Their first album, LusoQualquerCoisa, was reelased in 1996. In 1997 they released the album Kazoo.

Their third record, Lustro, was released in 2000. With it they won the [[Blitz (newspaper)|Blitz Awards]] for Best Female Vocal, Best National Band and Best National Album. Lustro was also released in France, and the band played in [[Paris]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Barcelona]].

Interested in art, as a whole, ClÃ£ were invited by [[Porto 2001 â Portuguese Capital of Culture]] - to compose and play live an original soundtrack for a classical silent movie. The band chose Murnau's ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922).

[[Rosa Carne]], the fourth album, was considered by critics one of the most important albums of 2004. Vivo and the DVD [[Gordo Segredo]] were released in 2005. The band released their album &quot;[[Cintura]]&quot; in 2007.
