Barack Obama's fundraising has broken previous records for presidential primary and general campaigns, and has changed expectations for future presidential elections. The campaign avoided using public campaign funds, raising all of its money privately from individual donors. By the general election the campaign committee raised more than $650 million for itself, and coordinated with both the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) and at least 18 state-level Democratic committees to create a joint-fundraising committee to raise and split tens of millions of dollars more.&lt;ref name='NYT-Cooper-November 11, 2008'&gt;

Post-election fundraising continued for the separate transition administration, called the [[Obama-Biden Transition Project]], and also the separate inaugural ceremonies and celebrations committee.&lt;ref name='NYT-Cooper-November 11, 2008'/&gt;

===Chronology===
According to reports filed with the [[Federal Election Commission]], Obama's campaign raised more money in the first quarter of 2008 ($133,549,000)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; than it had raised in all of 2007 ($103,802,537). The campaign had a relatively small total of $21.9 million in May, but went on to raise $52 million in June, after Obama had secured the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;

By rejecting the funds in favor of private donations, the campaign was in a position to outspend John McCain prior to the election. Had he signed on to the plan, the campaign would only have been able to spend $84.1 million between the party convention in August and the general election in November.&lt;ref&gt;

Obama explained his decision to opt out of the public financing system, saying, &quot;public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPOF&quot; /&gt;

On September 4, 2008, the Obama campaign announced they raised $10 million in the 24 hour period after Republican Vice Presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]]'s acceptance speech.

On October 19, 2008, Obama's campaign announced a record fundraising total of $150 million for September 2008. This exceeded the campaign's single-month record ($66 million) for August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122441294251948009.html?mod=googlenews_wsj | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=October 19, 2008| title=Obama Takes in a Record $150 Million, But McCain Narrows Gap in Some Polls | last= Cooper| first= Christopher| coauthors=Meckler, Laura }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovations===
Barack Obama was particularly noted for his use of the [[Internet]] to rally supporters and make his policies known.

&quot;The integration of technology into the process of field organizing â¦ is the success of the Obama campaign,&quot; says Sanford Dickert, who worked as [[John Kerry]]âs chief technology officer for the [[United States presidential election|2004 campaign]]. &quot;But the use of technology was not the end-all and be-all in this cycle. Technology has been a partner, an enabler for the Obama campaign, bringing the efficiencies of the internet into the real-world problems of organizing people in a distributed, trusted fashion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wired.com&quot;&gt;Stirland,S.:[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/10/obamas-secret-w/],&quot;Obama's Secret Weapons: Internet, Databases and Psychology&quot;, October 29, 2008. Retrieved on May 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obamaâs use of the Internet targeted 18 to 29 years olds, the age group most reliant on new media for political information about the election. Numbers have shown that presidential candidates have increased their presence and activity online. Obamaâs campaign managers understood that the reason younger voters tended to ignore politicians was because politicians tended to ignore issues which most concerned them, which is why Obama received such a positive reaction from Americaâs youth.

Through forums and social websites such as [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]], Obama built relationships with his supporters, and would-be supporters. He developed an upfront, personable and face-to-face quality that gave his supporters a sense of security and trust, which inspired them to rally others in their local communities. The supporters of Obama themselves formed a nation-wide community. The Internet provided useful and effective tools, such as the Neighbor-to-Neighbor tool on (My.BarackObama.com), allowing them to reach a large number of people in a short time in their own community, which in turn led to campaign rallying for more Obama support. Online communication led to Obama supporters engaging in social activities such as signmaking and door-to-door petitioning for Obama support, as well as simply discussing their opinions about policies and issues they supported along with Obama.&lt;ref&gt;Xenos,M. and W. Lance Bennett.&quot;THE DISCONNECTION IN ONLINE POLITICS: The Youth Political Sphere and US Election Sites, 2002-2004.&quot; Information, Communication, and Society 10 (2007): 443-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pasek, Josh, Daniel Romer, and Kathleen Hall Jamieson. &quot;America's Youth

The Obama web campaign used consumer marketing to target individuals with customized information to their predicted interests. Political communication to viewers was based on data collected about them. This data was collected by volunteers, surveys on the website and records of consumption habits. Website surveys took a short amount of time to fill out.&lt;ref name=Salon.com&gt;{{cite web | url=http://salon.com/news/feature/2008/07/16/obama_data | title=Barack Obama's super marketing machine | author=Mike Madden | date=July 16, 2008 | publisher=Salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; More detailed surveys were requested and received through email. Records of consumption habits helped the campaign make predictions about people based on statistical models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon.com&quot;/&gt; People received messages tailored close to their beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon.com&quot;/&gt; Marketing based on consumer data also enabled effective grassroots organizing through the website. Data gathered from the website indicated who the most dedicated constituents were; the website tracked how often a person visited and when.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon.com&quot;/&gt; The campaign team then targeted and encouraged activists in contested, winnable areas, such as through the website program Neighbor-to-neighbor.

All of his policies were made available online, and updates were sent to the subscribers of his political party via [[email]] and [[Text messaging|text message]], ultimately making him the most technologically savvy candidate to date, increasing his popularity among youth voters.

An unprecedented communication strategy was the &quot;online call toolâ. Over one million calls were made from residential, personal laptops and desktops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter, Jonathan 2010&quot;/&gt; 

Obamaâs campaign was further strengthened by his opponent [[John McCain]]âs comparatively limited use of the Internet. McCain did not have the organization of Obamaâs campaign, nor did he spend a comparable amount of money on this portion of the campaign. Both opportune timing and usage of online campaigning gave Obama significant advantage over McCain.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired.com&quot; /&gt;

===Logo===
{{See also|Obama logo}}
Obama's campaign is notable for its extensive use of a [[logo]]. The logo, consisting of a circle, with the center suggesting a sun rising over fields in the colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], was designed by a team at Chicago design firm [[Sender LLC]]. &quot;We were looking at the âoâ of his name and had the idea of a [[Sunrise|rising sun]] and a new day,â according to [[Sol Sender]], now a strategist at [[VSA Partners]]. &quot;The sun rising over the horizon intended to evoked a new sense of hope.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Slogan===
Obama's campaign used the slogan &quot;Change we can believe in&quot; and the chant &quot;Yes We Can&quot;. The latter slogan is shared with the [[United Farm Workers]] and associated with its founder [[CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez]] and is well known amongst Latinos in its Spanish form [[Si se puede]]. The &quot;Change we can believe in&quot; has been used in parodies both during and since the campaign. [[John McCain]] attempted to criticize Obama by enumerating various controversial policy positions he allegedly took and proclaiming &quot;that's not change we can believe in&quot; alongside a banner proclaiming McCain as &quot;a leader we can believe in&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIEFUjm3lU&lt;/ref&gt; Since the campaign it has been used to parody campaigns against incumbents as being &quot;change you can't believe in&quot; such as by British blog LeftFootForward against [[David Cameron]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leftfootforward.org/2010/04/david-clegg-eron-change-you-cant-believe-in/&lt;/ref&gt; or by the [[Economist]] against the [[People's Democratic Party of Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15612447 | work=The Economist | title=Change you can't believe in | date=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hope poster===
{{See also|Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster}}
The Barack Obama &quot;{{smallcaps|hope}}&quot; poster was an iconic image of [[Barack Obama]] designed by artist [[Shepard Fairey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasick&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|title=Iconic Obama poster based on Reuters photo|last=Pasick|first=Adam|date=January 15, 2009|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of a stylized [[stencil]] portrait of Obama in solid red, white (actually [[beige]]) and (pastel and dark) blue. Either the words &quot;{{smallcaps|progress}}&quot;, &quot;{{smallcaps|hope}}&quot;, or &quot;{{smallcaps|change}}&quot; were under the image of Obama (in some versions other words were used).  It was created and distributed widely&amp;mdash;as a digital image, on posters and other paraphernalia&amp;mdash;during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election season]]. Initially it was distributed independently but with the approval of the official Obama campaign.  The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the campaign itself.  In January 2009, after Obama had won the election, Fairey's [[mixed-media]] stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for its [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].

===Typefaces===
The signature campaign typeface was [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]], typically using [[capital letter]]s with occasional use of the script Snell Roundhand. Gotham was designed in 2000 by [[Jonathan Hoefler]] and [[Tobias Frere-Jones]], originally for ''GQ'' magazine. Prior to Gotham, the campaign used the typeface Gill Sans in upper case and lower case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/04/arts/design7.php | work=International Herald Tribune | date=April 6, 2008 | accessdate=January 18, 2009 | title=Brand Obama, a leader in the image war | last= Rawsthorn | first= Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hoefler and Frere-Jones font, [[Requiem (typeface)|Requiem]], was used for the campaign logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tschorn |last=Adam |title=Even Obama's typeface gets bloggers buzzing |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1020415.html }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally started by American-Israelis in late May, the &quot;Israel for Obama&quot; campaign aimed to refute the smears made against Obama concerning Israel and the Jewish community. This was done by gaining endorsements from Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;Israel for Obama&quot; Campaign |publisher=Israel for Obama blog |url=http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/IsraelforObama/gGCGXs |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Illinois Senator Barack Obama took a Middle East trip from Afghanistan to Iraq, Jordan and finally to Israel, they organized a small &quot;Israel for Obama&quot; rally for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 23, 2008 |title=Obama In Ramallah |publisher=Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jan-mcgirk/obama-in-ramallah_b_114639.html |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obama wraps up Middle East trip |publisher=U.S. Senator Barack Obama |url=http://obama.senate.gov/news/060113-obama_wraps_up/ |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 22, 2008 |title=Details of Obama's Trip Released |publisher=washingtonpost.com |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/07/22/details_of_obamas_trip_release.html |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, John McCain proposed a series of ten joint [[town hall meetings]] with Obama, at which the two could engage each other.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Parker, &quot;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/06/the-debate-over.html Political Radar: The Debate Over the Debates],&quot; [[ABC News]], June 4, 2008.

McCainâs confidence vastly lowered when Obama questioned his ideas on the financial crisis in a meeting on September 25 at the White House with Bush and other congressmen. McCain did not have suggestions regarding what he would do to fix the economy, particularly Henry Paulsonâs $700 billion three page bank recovery plan (TARP). Neither McCain nor Bush had read it. Obamaâs confidence escalated from that point. This was the turning point of the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter, Jonathan 2010&quot;/&gt;

===Presidential debates===
There were three [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]] between Obama and McCain. No third party candidates or Independent candidates were offered an invitation to join in any of the debates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debates.org/pages/news_111907.html Commission on Presidential Debates Announces Sites, Dates, Formats and Candidate Selection Criteria for 2008 General Election], [[Commission on Presidential Debates]], November 19, 2007. Retrieved July 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; as Obama and McCain were the only candidates on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] proposed, and the candidates agreed, that two of three 90 minute debates would be in an informal, seated, talk show format, while the third would be in a town hall format that allowed both candidates to walk around.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-caucus0627.artjun27,0,5462694.story Gun Ruling Reverberates],&quot; ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'', June 27, 2008.

==Eve of the election==
After campaigning at the Battle of Bull Run (Manassas, VA) on November 3, 2008, Barack Obama told David Axelrod (Chief Strategist), âI think weâre going to win, but if we donât Iâll be at peace. Weâve run as good a campaign as you could run, and if it isnât there, it isnât there.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter, Jonathan 2010&quot;/&gt;

==Election day==
On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama became the first [[African American]] to be elected President of the United States, sparking many celebrations in the United States and around the world. He gained almost 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes. The popular vote percentage was the best showing for any presidential candidate since [[George H.W. Bush]] in 1988. His 365 electoral votes was the best showing since [[Bill Clinton]] had 379 in 1996. He won Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina, all states that were won by President [[George W. Bush]] in 2004. In addition, he became the first Democratic candidate to win one of Nebraska's electoral votes since the state decided to split their electoral votes. He was the first candidate to be elected President without winning Missouri since 1956. Obama also received more total votes than any Presidential candidate in history, totaling well over 69 million votes.

63% of Americans who met the voting requirements voted, the highest percentage in fifty years. Obama won the moderate vote 60â39 and the independent vote 52â44.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter, Jonathan 2010&quot;/&gt;

Joe Biden also made history by becoming the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President. In addition, he is the longest-serving Senator to become Vice President, having served in the United States Senate for the 36 years prior to the election. Biden also won reelection to the Senate, but served only briefly in the 111th Congress before resigning to take his place as vice president.

==Certification of the electoral votes==
On January 8, 2009, the [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of the U.S. Congress]], chaired by former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] as [[President of the United States Senate|President of the Senate]] and Nancy Pelosi as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], announced and certified the votes of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] for the 2008 presidential election. From the electoral votes of the [[U.S. state#List of states|50 states]] and the [[District of Columbia]], Vice President Cheney declared 365 electoral votes for both Barack Obama of the state of [[Illinois]] and [[Joe Biden|Joseph Biden]] of the state of [[Delaware]] and 173 electoral votes for both [[John McCain]] of the state of [[Arizona]] and [[Sarah Palin]] of the state of [[Alaska]]. Based on the results of the electoral vote count, Vice President Cheney declared officially that Obama was elected as President of the United States and Biden was elected as Vice President of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;EVcertify&quot; /&gt;

Over 25% of the electorate was of a race besides Caucasian, a first for America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter, Jonathan 2010&quot;/&gt;
