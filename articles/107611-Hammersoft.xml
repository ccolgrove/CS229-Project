'''Charter Oak''' is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in [[Los Angeles County, California]], approximately {{convert|26|mi|km}} east of [[downtown Los Angeles]].  The population was 9,310 at the 2010 census, up from 9,027 at the 2000 census.

Charter Oak is located in the eastern [[San Gabriel Valley]], situated along Arrow Highway in between [[Covina, California|Covina]] to the south, [[Glendora, California|Glendora]] to the north and San Dimas to the east.  Some residents refer to the CDP portion as the &quot;unincorporated part of Covina&quot;.

Originally a small agricultural town (primarily citrus orchards) centered around the intersection of Arrow Highway and Bonnie Cove Avenue, population growth greatly expanded the area recognized as &quot;Charter Oak&quot;.  Since the 1960s, it has been known as a &quot;[[bedroom community]]&quot; suburb of [[Los Angeles]] and commercial agriculture is nearly gone.

Today, the generally-accepted boundaries of Charter Oak are I-210 to the north, Valley Center Avenue to the east, Covina Hills Road to the south and Grand Avenue to the west.  In the mid-1960s, Glendora annexed the area north of Arrow Highway and Covina annexed much of the area south of Arrow Highway.  Several small &quot;county islands&quot; of unincorporated area remained within the annexed portions of Covina and Glendora until the 1980s.  The remainder forms the CDP.

==Geography==
Charter Oak is located at {{coord|34|6|5|N|117|51|28|W|type:city}} (34.101308, -117.857656){{GR|1}}.  

Charter Oak is primarily flat ground, though the [[South Hills (California)|South Hills]] of Glendora form much of the northern border, and there is a small valley in the southeast quadrant, with Walnut Creek flowing in the bottom.  The other major water feature in Charter Oak is the San Dimas Wash, a concrete-lined flood control channel which was formerly the San Dimas River, a tributary of the San Gabriel River.  Both Walnut Creek and San Dimas wash flow from east-northeast toward west-southwest, the wash in Glendora and the creek in Covina.

The ground is described as &quot;dry riverbed,&quot; with sandy soil which was suitable not only for the citrus orchards which once were the primary industry in the area, but also for several nurseries growing cactus and other small plants.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|2.4|km2|mi2|1|sp=us}}, all of it land.

==Education and culture==
The area is served by the Charter Oak Unified School District, as well as numerous private schools.  The boundaries of the Charter Oak Unified School District, formed in areas which were at the time unincorporated area, eventually became the accepted boundaries of Charter Oak, attesting to the importance of the district in the community.  

Community college students from Charter Oak generally attend [[Citrus College]] in Glendora or [[Mount San Antonio College]] (&quot;Mount SAC&quot;) in [[Walnut, California|Walnut]].

Charter Oak [[Gymnastics]] has been a U.S. National Team training center since 1989, and has produced many elite athletes, including national champion [[Vanessa Atler]] and Olympian [[Jamie Dantzscher]].
