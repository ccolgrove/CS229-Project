{{Nihongo|'''Nitto Records'''|ãããã¼ã¬ã³ã¼ã|NittÅ rekÅdo}} was a Japanese [[record label]], originally published by the company {{Nihongo|NittÅ Chikuonki Kabushiki Gaisha|æ¥æ±èé³æ©æ ªå¼ä¼ç¤¾}} established in [[Osaka]] on March 20, 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takahashi&quot;&gt;[http://www.okigei.ac.jp/sougou/photo/20100630153458.pdf è¿ä»£æ²ç¸ã«ãããé²é³ã¡ãã£ã¢ã®å°å¥ãChapter 4: ãããã¼ã¬ã³ã¼ãè¨­ç«ã¨æ´»åã®å¤é·], Miki Takahashi {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label was also called the &quot;Swallow Brand&quot;, because of their trademark artwork.

Nitto was known as a prolific brand, with over 2,000 titles published in about five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takahashi&quot;/&gt; In 1925, they were recognized as one of the two major labels in Japan at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;asahi&quot;&gt;[http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/das/ContentViewServlet?METAID=10029429&amp;TYPE=HTML_FILE&amp;POS=1&amp;LANG=JA ãèé³æ© è¸äººã®äºå¥ªæ¦ çµå¶ç¾æãæ±äº¬ææ¥æ°è] (1925, Tokyo Asahi Shimbun) {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The label produced numerous records of traditional Japanese music and art such as [[JÅruri (music)|JÅruri]], as well as solo plays of western music and orchestra recordings, although the latter remained small in the share of their overall production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takahashi&quot;/&gt; As more record companies with foreign capital entered the market, Nitto gradually lost its competitiveness, and was taken over by Taihei Records in 1935. After the takeover, Taihei renamed the newly merged company {{Nihongo|Dainippon Chikuonki|å¤§æ¥æ¬èé³æ©}}, while maintaining the &quot;Swallow Brand - Nitto Records&quot; along with other labels.

In one article of a long run series (1997-1999) celebrating the 120th anniversary of phonograph, the ''[[Kobe Shimbun]]'' wrote:
&quot;The only company which could rival [[Columbia Records]] head-to-head in the market... (Nitto was) so tightly focused on traditional arts which made them late in responding to rapidly growing demand for popular music. Moreover, it was the retirement of Morishita,&lt;ref&gt;Consort of Nitto founder Shirayama's daughter.&lt;/ref&gt; who was driving Nitto's marketing strategy all alone, that determined the fate of Nitto.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kobe-np.co.jp/tokushu/record/record7-14.html ãé¢è¥¿çº ã¬ã³ã¼ã120å¹´ ç¬¬7é¨ ã¬ã³ã¼ãåç¤¾èäº¡ç§è©± No.14ã](1999, The Kobe Shimbun){{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swallow Nitto brand finally disappeared in 1942, when Dainippon Chikuonki was absorbed by [[Kodansha]], shareholder of [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]], to become only a production facility of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kobe-np.co.jp/tokushu/record/record7-15.html ãé¢è¥¿çº ã¬ã³ã¼ã120å¹´ ç¬¬7é¨ ã¬ã³ã¼ãåç¤¾èäº¡ç§è©± No.15ã](1999, The Kobe Shimbun){{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicians who worked for the label included pop and jazz composer [[Ryoichi Hattori]].&lt;ref&gt;Hattori became a composer for Taihei Records in 1931, moved to Tokyo in 1933 and became general music director at Nitto-Taihei Tokyo Studio that had opened recently.
