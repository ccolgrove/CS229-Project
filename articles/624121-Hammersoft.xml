'''The Comedy Network''' (often referred to as '''Comedy''') a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[English language]] [[Category A services|Category A]] [[specialty channel]] owned by [[Bell Media]] specializing in [[comedy]] programming.

The channel operates two time shifted feeds, East ([[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) and West ([[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]).

==History==
In September 1996, 1155636 Ontario Inc. (a company majority controlled by [[Baton Broadcasting]], with the remaining interests held by [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]], [[Astral Media|Astral Broadcasting]], and Les Films Rozon inc.) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for the Comedy Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-596.htm Decision CRTC 96-596] CRTC 1996-09-04&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through various acquisitions over the years, Shaw, Astral, and Les Films Rozon sold their interest in the service to Baton, which became Bell Globemedia in 2001, later renamed CTVglobemedia in 2007, and Bell Media in 2011 following [[Bell Canada]]'s acquistion of CTVgm.  ''(see [[CTVglobemedia]] and [[Bell Media]] for history of Baton ownership)''.  

The channel was launched on October 17, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctvmedia.ca/comedy/releases/release.asp?id=9824&amp;yyyy=2007 The Comedy Network Turns 10 Today and Goes Full-On-Cyber with Revolutionary Revamped Website] The Comedy Network press release 2007-10-17&lt;/ref&gt; The network was launched with the slogan ''Time Well Wasted'', a variation of the U.S.-based channel [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s slogan &quot;Time Well Spent&quot;. The slogan was used until the network's overhaul on November 1, 2011.

The Comedy Network maintained a consistent look since its incarnation in 1997. The 'yellow oval' logo (which has undergone slight modifications throughout its use) was in use since the network's launch in 1997 until November 1, 2011 when the Comedy Network was relaunched with a new look, consisting a new simplified logo and new on-air presentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bellmediapr.ca/comedy/releases/release.asp?id=14415&amp;yyyy=2011 Itâs a NEWvember for The Comedy Network as New Look and Feel Revealed Nov. 1] Bell Media press release 2011-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successes and awards===
