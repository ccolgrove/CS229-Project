'''Microsoft Virtual Server''' is a virtualization solution that facilitates the creation of [[virtual machines]] on the [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] [[operating systems]]. Originally developed by [[Connectix]], it was acquired by [[Microsoft]] prior to release.  [[Microsoft Virtual PC|Virtual PC]] is Microsoft's related desktop virtualization software package.

[[Virtual machine]]s are created and managed through an [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] web-based interface or through a Windows client application tool called VMRCplus. 

The current version is Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1. New features in R2 SP1 include [[Linux]] guest operating system support, Virtual Disk Precompactor, [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] (but not for the Guest OS), [[x86-64]] (x64) Host OS support (but not Guest OS support), the ability to mount virtual hard drives on the host OS and additional operating systems, including [[Windows Vista]]. It also provides a Volume Shadow Copy writer which enables live backups of the Guest OS on a [[Windows Server 2003]] or [[Windows Server 2008]] Host. A utility to mount VHD images is also included since SP1. Virtual Machine Additions for Linux are downloadable [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=BF12642F-77DC-4D45-AE4E-E1B05E0A2674 here.] Officially supported Linux guest operating systems include [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] versions 2.1-5.0, [[Red Hat Linux]] 9.0, [[SUSE Linux]] and [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] versions 9 and 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/virtualserver/downloads/linuxguestsupport.mspx Linux Guest Support for Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual Server has been superseded by [[Hyper-V]].

==Version history==
Microsoft acquired an unreleased Virtual Server from Connectix in February 2003.
The initial release of Microsoft's Virtual Server, general availability, was announced on September 13, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/sep04/09-13availabilityvs2005pr.mspx |title=Virtual Server 2005 |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2009-07-02 |publisher=Microsoft Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual Server 2005, was available in two editions: Standard and Enterprise. The Enterprise edition supported more processors.

On 2006-04-03, Microsoft made Virtual Server 2005 R2 Enterprise Edition a free download,&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft TechNet FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/software/faq.mspx#EIB |title=Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1 Download Frequently Asked Questions |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2007-10-15 |publisher=Microsoft TechNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to better compete with the free virtualization offerings from [[VMware]] and [[Xen]], and discontinued the Standard Edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2006/04/03/566267.aspx Microsoft Virtual Server is now free]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft Virtual Server R2 SP1 added support for both Intel VT (IVT) and AMD Virtualization (AMD-V).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/virtualserver/evaluation/vsoverview.mspx#EMC |title=Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1 Product Overview |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2007-08-24 |publisher=Microsoft TechNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Benefits of using Microsoft virtual server: ==
Rolling out new software to check for compatibility issues 

Testing software updates and patches

To solve compatibility issues between software packages

To solve software legacy issues

== Limitations ==
Known limitations of Virtual Server, {{As of|2007|alt=as of September 2007}}, include the following:

* Although Virtual Server 2005 R2 can run on hosts with [[x86-64]] processors, it cannot run x64 guests that require x86-64 processors (guests cannot be 64-bit).&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft TechNet FAQ&quot; /&gt;
* It also makes use of [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]], but does not virtualize it (it does not currently allow guests to use more than 1 CPU each).&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft TechNet FAQ&quot; /&gt;
* Performance may suffer due to the way the instruction set is virtualized in this platform, with very limited direct interaction with the host hardware.&lt;ref name=virtsh&gt;{{cite web | title=Benchmarking VMware ESX Server 2.5 vs Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 Enterprise Edition | url=http://capitalhead.com/articles/benchmarking-vmware-esx-server-25-vs-microsoft-virtual-server-2005-enterprise-edition.aspx | work=Virtualization Benchmark Review | date=2006-04-19 | accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Benchmarking Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 | url=http://capitalhead.com/articles/benchmarking-microsoft-virtual-server-2005.aspx | work=Benchmarking Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 | date=1900-1-0 | accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
