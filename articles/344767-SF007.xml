'''Rhino''' is an [[open source]] [[JavaScript engine]]. It is developed entirely in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and managed by the [[Mozilla Foundation]]. The Foundation also provides another implementation of [[JavaScript]] engine written in [[C (programming language)|C]] known as [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey]].

Rhino converts JavaScript scripts into [[Class (computer programming)|classes]]. Rhino works in both [[Compiler|compiled]] as well as [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] mode. It is intended to be used in [[server-side]] applications, hence there is no built-in support for the [[Web browser|browser]] objects that are commonly associated with JavaScript.

Rhino can be used as a [[debugger]] by making use of the Rhino [[command line interface|shell]]. It can be used in applications by embedding&lt;!-- appropriate interwiki link? --&gt; Rhino.

A slightly modified version of Rhino 1.6r2 comes [[Software bundling|bundled]] with the [[Sun Microsystems]] release of [[Java SE]] version 6, which was released in December 2006. This makes it easier to integrate JavaScript as part of Java programs and to access Java resources from JavaScript. Other implementations of Java 6 may differ.

==History==
The Rhino project was started at [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] in 1997. At the time, Netscape was planning to produce a version of [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]] written entirely in Java and so it needed an implementation of JavaScript written in Java. When Netscape stopped work on &quot;Javagator&quot;, as it was called, the Rhino project was finished as a JavaScript engine. Since then, a couple of major companies (including [[Sun Microsystems]]) have licensed Rhino for use in their products and paid Netscape to do so, allowing work to continue on it.

Originally, Rhino compiled all JavaScript code to [[Java bytecode]]s in generated [[Java class file|classfiles]]. This produced the best performance (often beating the C implementation of JavaScript when run on a [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]]), but suffered from two faults. First, compilation time was long since generating Java bytecodes and loading the generated classes was a heavyweight (resource-intensive) process. Also, the implementation effectively [[Memory leak|leaked memory]] since most [[Java Virtual Machine|JVMs]] don't [[Garbage collection (computer science)|collect]] unused classes or the [[String (computer science)|strings]] that are [[String interning|interned]] as a result of loading a class file.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

So in the fall of 1998, Rhino added an interpretive mode. The classfile generation code was moved to an optional, [[Dynamic loading|dynamically loaded]] package. Compilation is faster and when scripts are no longer in use they can be collected like any other Java object.

Rhino was released to [[Mozilla Foundation]] in April 1998. Originally Rhino classfile generation had been held back from release. However the licensees of Rhino have now agreed to release all of Rhino to open source, including class file generation. Since its release to open source, Rhino has found a variety of uses and an increasing number of people have contributed to the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Example==
Below is an example of Java code running JavaScript &lt;code&gt;print('Hello, world!')&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class RhinoEngine {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptEngineManager mgr = new ScriptEngineManager();
        // Now we can go and get a script engine we want. 
        // This can be done either by finding a factory that supports 
        // our required scripting language 
        // (engine = factory.getScriptEngine();)
        // or by requesting a script engine that supports a 
        // given language by name from the script engine manager.
        ScriptEngine engine = mgr.getEngineByName(&quot;JavaScript&quot;);
        
        // Now we have a script engine instance that 
        // can execute some JavaScript
        try {
            engine.put(&quot;name&quot;, args[0]);
            engine.eval(&quot;print('Hello ' + name + '!')&quot;);
        } catch (ScriptException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }    
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a simple example showing a Rhino script that outputs each line in the stdin converted to uppercase.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// Equivalent in effect to the Java declaration import java.io.*;
importPackage(java.io);
importPackage(java.lang);

// &quot;in&quot; is a keyword in JavaScript. 
// In JavaScript you could query for an attribute using [] syntax: 
var reader = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(System['in']) );

// We use JavaScript's dynamic typing here to let s be a boolean first, and later on a string...
var s = true;

while (s) {
    s = reader.readLine();

    if (s) {
        System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Rhino Shell==
The JavaScript shell provides a simple way to run scripts in batch mode or an interactive environment for exploratory programming. Invoking the Rhino Shell with the command below:
 '''java''' org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main

The Rhino Shell can also be invoked with this command:
 '''java''' -jar js.jar
The advantage is that you don't have to configure the classpath to use this form.
