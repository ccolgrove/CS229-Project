The '''Edirne railway station''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]:''Edirne garÄ±'') is the main railway station for the city of [[Edirne]]. The station is located in the southeast of the city. The station services regional trains to [[Ä°stanbul]] and international trains to [[Bucharest]] and [[Belgrade]].

==History==
When the [[Chemins de fer Orientaux]] (CO) started building their main line between [[Ä°stanbul]] and [[Vienna]] during the [[Ottoman Empire]], they built the line to also service Edirne. However this line didn't enter the city, instead the railway built a station in the town of [[KaraaÄaÃ§]], 4&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Edirne. The beautiful [[KaraaÄaÃ§ Railway Station]] opened with a grand main building. After the [[Turkish Independence War]] and the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] signed, stating [[Turkey]]'s borders, the rail line exited Turkey into Greece at UzunkÃ¶prÃ¼ and came back into Turkey at Edirne, then went back into Greece. This became a problem for Greek and Turkish rail service, so in 1971, the [[Turkish State Railways]] built a cut off line known as the [[Edirne Cut-off]] from [[PehlivankÃ¶y]] up the Turkish Greek border to Edirne and built the line through the city and further northwest to [[Bulgaria]]. This however lead to the abandonment of the KaraaÄaÃ§ station. In 1997 the line was electrified.
