'''libdvdcss''' (or '''libdvdcss2''' in some repositories) is a [[free software|free]] [[software library]] for accessing and unscrambling [[DVD]]s encrypted with the [[Content Scramble System|Content Scramble System]] (CSS). libdvdcss is part of the [[VideoLAN]] project and is used by [[VLC media player]] and other [[DVD player]] software such as [[Ogle DVD Player|Ogle]], [[xine]]-based players, and [[MPlayer]].

==Comparison with DeCSS==
libdvdcss is not to be confused with [[DeCSS]]. While DeCSS uses a cracked DVD player key to perform authentication, libdvdcss uses a generated list of possible player keys. If none of them works (for instance, when the DVD drive enforces region coding) a [[brute force attack|brute force]] algorithm is tried so the [[region code]] of a DVD is ignored. Unlike DeCSS, libdvdcss has never been legally challenged.

==Distribution==
Many GNU/[[Linux distribution]]s do not contain libdvdcss (for example [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[SUSE Linux distributions|SUSE Linux]], and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]) due to fears of running afoul of [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]-style laws, however they may provide the tools to let the user install it themselves. For example, it is available in Ubuntu through [[Medibuntu]].

Distributions which come pre-installed with libdvdcss include [[BackTrack]], [[CrunchBang Linux]], [[LinuxMCE]], [[Linux Mint]], [[PCLinuxOS]], [[Puppy Linux|Puppy Linux 4.2.1]], [[Recovery Is Possible]], [[Slax]], [[Super OS]], [[Pardus (operating system)|Pardus]], and [[XBMC Live]].

==Usage==
Libdvdcss alone is only a [[Software library|library]] and cannot play DVDs. DVD player applications, such as [[VLC Media Player]], link to this library to decode DVDs. Libdvdcss is optional in many open-source DVD players, but without it, only non-encrypted discs will play.
