Version 2.11 was released on May 15, 1986. It can still be found on old [[abandonware]] and [[shareware]] download sites.

Ashwood-Smith says of his interpreter: &quot;PC-LISP is a small implementation of LISP for ANY MS-DOS machine.  While small, it is capable of running a pretty good subset of Franz LISP.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;from the distribution's readme file&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the Franz LISP dialect was the immediate, portable successor to the [[ITS]] version of [[Maclisp]] and is perhaps the closest thing to the  LISP in the [[Steven Levy]] book ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution|Hackers]]'' as is practical to operate. PC-LISP runs well in DOS emulators and on modern Windows versions. Because PC-LISP implements Franz LISP, it is a dynamically scoped predecessor to modern [[Common Lisp]]. This is therefore an historically important implementation.

==Example==
[[Image:Pclisp.jpg|thumb|PC-LISP 2.11 (1986) session.]] The session is running the following code which demonstrates [[dynamic scoping]] in Franz LISP. Note that PC-LISP does not implement the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; special form that [[Emacs Lisp]] provides for local variables. Instead, all variables are what an [[ALGOL]]-based language would call &quot;global&quot;. The first dialect of Lisp to incorporate ALGOL scoping rules (called [[lexical scoping]]) was [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] although the [[Common Lisp]] language also added this feature.
&lt;pre&gt;
;; Demonstration of dynamic scoping

;; This is a &quot;global&quot; variable
(setq myglobal &quot;this is my global variable&quot;)

;; Another global variable
(setq yourglobal &quot;this is my global variable&quot;)

;; a function which prints the symbols
(defun dosomething (mine yours)
  (princ &quot; * Mine is  - &quot;)
  (princ mine)
  (princ &quot;\n&quot;)
  (princ &quot; * Yours is - &quot;)
  (princ yours)
  (princ &quot;\n&quot;))

;; override the symbols
(defun nolocals ()
  (setq mine &quot;I have set mine to a new value&quot;)
  (setq yours &quot;I have set mine to a new value&quot;)
  (dosomething mine yours))

(defun main ()
  ;; define two symbols
  (setq mine myglobal)
  (setq yours yourglobal)
  
  ;; print them
  (princ &quot;calling dosomething\n&quot;)
  (dosomething mine yours)
  (princ &quot;calling nolocals\n&quot;)
  (nolocals)
  (princ &quot;calling dosomething again\n&quot;)
  (dosomething mine yours))
&lt;/pre&gt;
