The '''.44 Remington Magnum''', or simply '''.44 Magnum''', is a large-bore [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] originally designed for [[revolver]]s. After introduction, it was quickly adopted for [[carbine]]s and [[rifle]]s. Despite the &quot;.44&quot; designation, all guns chambered for the .44 Magnum case, and its parent case, the [[.44 Special]], use bullets of approximately {{convert|0.429|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;lyman&quot;&gt;''Lyman Reloading Handbook'', 48th edition, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The .44 Magnum is based on a lengthened [[.44 Special]] case, loaded to higher pressures for greater velocity (and thus, energy). The .44 Magnum has since been eclipsed in power by the [[.454 Casull]], among others; nevertheless, it has remained one of the most popular commercial large-bore magnum cartridges.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yearsyoung&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cotw10&quot;/&gt; When loaded to its maximum and with heavy, deeply penetrating bullets, the .44 Magnum cartridge is suitable for short-range hunting of all North American gameâthough at the cost of much [[recoil]] and [[muzzle flash]], when fired in handguns. In carbines and rifles, these are non-factor.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boddington|first=Craig|url=http://www.gunsandammomag.com/ammunition/fabulous_44_mag/ |title=The Fabulous .44 Mag |authorlink=Craig Boddington |publisher=Guns &amp; Ammo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The .44 Magnum cartridge was the end result of years of tuned [[handloading]] of the .44 Special.&lt;ref name=&quot;COTW&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnes| first = Frank C.| authorlink = | coauthors = Skinner, Steve| title =Cartridges of the World: 10th Edition, Revised and Expanded | publisher = Krause Publications| year = 2003| location = | page = 528| isbn = 978-0-87349-605-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The .44 Special, and other large-bore handgun cartridges, were being loaded with heavy bullets, pushed at higher than normal velocities for better hunting performance. One of these handloaders was [[Elmer Keith]], a writer and outdoorsman of the 20th Century.&lt;ref name=&quot;50years&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gunsandammomag.com/ammunition/fifty_101105/ |author=Garry James |title=A Big 50 For The .44 |journal=Guns &amp; Ammo |month=June | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmer Keith settled on the .44 Special cartridge as the basis for his experimentation, rather than the larger [[.45 Colt]]. At the time the selection of .44 caliber projectiles for handloaders was more varied, and the .44 Special case was smaller in diameter than the .45 Colt case. In revolvers of the same size, this meant the .44 caliber revolvers had thicker, and therefore stronger, cylinder walls than the .45. This allowed higher pressures to be used without risk of a burst cylinder.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yearsyoung&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_177_29/ai_n14816284 |author=Taffin, John. |title=The .44 Magnum: 50 years young! |journal=American Handgunner |date=SeptemberâOctober, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith encouraged [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] and [[Remington Arms|Remington]] to produce a commercial version of this new high pressure loading, and revolvers chambered for it. While S&amp;W produced the first prototype revolver chambered in .44 Magnum, the famous [[S&amp;W Model 29|Model 29]], [[Sturm, Ruger]] actually beat S&amp;W to market by several months in 1956 with a .44 Magnum version of the [[single action]] [[Ruger Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] revolver. The exact reason for this is unclear. One version says a Ruger employee found a cartridge case marked &quot;.44 Remington Magnum&quot; and took it to [[William B. Ruger|Bill Ruger]], while another says a Remington employee provided Ruger with early samples of the ammunition.&lt;ref name=&quot;flattop&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gunblast.com/Hamm_44-Flattop.htm |author=Bill Hamm |title=Ruger Blackhawk .44 Magnum 'Flattop' |journal=GunBlast.com |date=September 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The .44 Magnum case is slightly longer than the .44 Special case, not because of the need for more room for propellant, but to prevent the far higher pressure cartridge from being chambered in older, weaker .44 Special firearms, thus preventing injuries and possible deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yearsyoung&quot; /&gt;

The .44 Magnum was an immediate success, and the direct descendants of the S&amp;W Model 29 and the .44 Magnum Ruger Blackhawks are still in production, and have been joined by numerous other makes and models of .44 Magnum revolvers and even a handful of [[semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic models]], the first being the [[AutoMag (pistol)|.44 Automag]], produced in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Martin J., ''Small Arms: From the Civil War to the Present Day'' Fall River: 2005, page 61, ISBN 978-0-7607-6329-2&lt;/ref&gt;  The debut of the Clint Eastwood star-vehicle film [[Dirty Harry]] (1971) prominently featuring the S&amp;W M29 contributed to that model's popularity (as well as the cartridge itself).&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Martin J., ''Small Arms: From the Civil War to the Present Day'' Fall River: 2005, page 46, ISBN 978-0-7607-6329-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruger introduced its first long gun, a semi-automatic carbine chambered for the .44 Magnum, in 1959, and Marlin followed soon after with a [[lever action]] model 1894 in .44 Magnum.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotw10&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Cartridges of the World, 10th Ed. |publisher=Krause Publications |author=Frank C. Barnes, ed. Stan Skinner |isbn=978-0-87349-605-6 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;50years&quot; /&gt; Having a carbine and a handgun chambered in the same caliber is an old tradition; the [[.44-40 Winchester]] was introduced by Winchester in a lever action in 1873, and Colt followed in 1878 with a revolver chambered in the same caliber. The [[.38-40 Winchester]] and [[.32-20 Winchester]] were also available chambered in both carbines and revolvers, allowing the shooter to use one type of ammunition for both firearms.&lt;ref name=&quot;himmelwright&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pistol and Revolver |author=[[Abraham Lincoln Artman Himmelwright]] |year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although improved modern [[alloy]]s and manufacturing techniques have allowed even stronger cylinders, leading to larger and more powerful cartridges such as the [[.454 Casull]] and [[.480 Ruger]] in revolvers the same size as a .44 Magnum, the .44 Magnum is still considered a top choice today.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot; /&gt; In 2006, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the .44 Magnum, Ruger introduced a special 50th anniversary Blackhawk revolver, in the &quot;Flattop&quot; style.&lt;ref name=&quot;flattop&quot; /&gt;

==Technical specifications==
[[File:Anaconda-502.jpg|thumb|.44 Magnum [[Colt Anaconda]]]]
The .44 Magnum delivers a large, heavy bullet with high velocity for a handgun. In its full-powered form, it produces so much recoil and muzzle blast that it is generally considered to be unsuitable for use as a police weapon. Rapid fire is difficult and strenuous on the users' hands, especially for shooters of smaller build or with small hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gun-tests.com/performance/nov96biteout.html |title=Taking the Bite Out of the Mighty .44 Magnum |journal=Performance Shooter |month=November | year=1996 |author=Terry Riebling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Taylor | first =Chuck| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Complete Book Of Combat Handgunning | publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1981| location = Boulder, CO| page = 200| isbn = 978-0-87364-327-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although marketed as a .44 caliber, the .44 Magnum, and its previous model .44 Special parent, are actually .429-.430 caliber. The .44 designation is a carry over from the early measurements of &quot;heeled&quot; bullets, used in the later 19th century. In those times, bullets were measured on the outside of the cartridge, not the inside of the cartridge. After the .44 S&amp;W Russian was developed, the forefather of the .44 Special and thus the .44 Magnum, the measurement of bullet caliber, was taken from inside of the cartridge. Resulting in .429 caliber. Instead of confusing buyers who were used to .44 caliber revolvers, the original .44 designation was kept for market recognition.

Some gun styles are more comfortable to use when shooting this caliber. Many shooters find the rounded grip shape of the single action better for handling heavy recoil than the grip shape of [[double-action]] revolvers, which have a shoulder on top of the grip. Many shooters, consider the ideal type of grip for heavy recoiling guns to be the longer &quot;Bisley&quot; style [[single action]] grip, and it can be found on single actions from Ruger (models marked &quot;Bisley&quot;) and [[Freedom Arms]], as well as many custom makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I LIKE SINGLE ACTIONS BECAUSE... |author=John Taffin |publisher=Sixguns.com |url=http://www.sixguns.com/range/single_actions.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual-purpose use===
[[File:Marlin Model 1894 .44 Magnum carbine.jpg|thumb|.44 Magnum [[Marlin Model 1894]] carbine]]
The concept of a dual-purpose handgun/rifle cartridge has been popular since the [[American Old West|Old West]], with cartridges like the [[.44-40 Winchester]], whose &quot;High-Speed&quot; rifle loadings were precursor magnum loads. Other dual-use rounds were the [[.32-20 Winchester]] and the [[.38-40 Winchester]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cotw10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;himmelwright&quot; /&gt;

Some past dual-purpose cartridges, like the .44-40 Winchester, gave their manufacturers trouble when people loaded the &quot;High-Speed&quot; versions designed for rifles into handguns.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotw10&quot; /&gt; Since the .44 Magnum was designed from the start as a revolver cartridge, such issues are moot, and [[SAAMI]]-compliant ammunition should fire from any handguns or rifles chambered for the .44 Magnum.

As a rifle or carbine cartridge the .44 Magnum is sufficiently powerful for medium-sized game, yet fits easily into a compact, lightweight package. In 1969, Ruger introduced their [[Ruger .44 Carbine|.44 Carbine]], the first .44 Magnum carbine. The [[lever-action]] [[Marlin Model 1894]], Ruger Deerfield, and many other firearms are currently available in this caliber. With significantly longer barrels than revolvers, carbines will generate a significantly higher velocity than a revolver loaded with the same ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/44mag.html Ballistics By The Inch .44magnum results.]&lt;/ref&gt; Tests with various ammunition in the Ruger Deerfield yielded a 100&amp;nbsp;yard (90&amp;nbsp;m) velocity of over {{convert|1300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|240|gr|g|sing=on}} bullet, comparable to the muzzle velocity out of a revolver.&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/woods_rifles.htm |title=Woods and Brush Rifles

===Suitable game===
The .44 Magnum is well-suited for game up to [[elk]] size. With precise shot placement and deep penetrating cartridges it has even been used to take the largest of game, including [[Cape Buffalo]]. Publisher Robert E. Petersen took a record setting [[polar bear]] with a .44 Magnum.&lt;ref name=&quot;50years&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;taffin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sixguns.com/tests/tt44mag.htm |title=TAFFIN TESTS: THE .44 MAGNUM |author=JOHN TAFFIN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been used against [[elephant]]s with success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fryxell| first = Glen E.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Bullets of SSK | work = Sixguns| publisher = John Taffin| date = | url = http://www.sixguns.com/crew/sskbullets.htm| doi = | accessdate = 2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to beating the ballistics of the old .44-40 rifle loads, long considered a top deer cartridge,&lt;ref name=&quot;cotw10&quot; /&gt; the heavy, flat point bullets typically used in the .44 Magnum have an additional advantage. Tests performed where bullets are shot through light cover, intended to represent twigs and brush, have shown that the high velocity, light weight, thin jacketed, pointed bullets used by most hunting cartridges today are easily deflected by contact with the brush. The ideal bullets for penetrating brush with minimal deflection are heavy, flat point bullets at moderate velocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot; /&gt;

===Range===

The accuracy of the .44 Magnum is very good, with models from Colt, Smith &amp; Wesson, and Ruger producing bullet groups of 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;inches (7.5 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm) at 50&amp;nbsp;yards, with most ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gun-tests.com/performance/oct97gggmagnums.html |title=.44 Magnums: Accuracy Problems Plague the Model 29 |journal=Guns, Gear &amp; Game |month=October | year=1997 |author=GGG Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gun-tests.com/performance/jul97silhouette.html |title=Stock Silhouette Revolvers: Anaconda Versus Redhawk |month=July | year=1997 |journal=Performance Shooter |author=PS Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limiting factor of the .44 Magnum cartridge is not [[terminal ballistics]]. When fired from a 6&quot; revolver, a typically loaded .44 Magnum 240gr bullet, will have more impact energy at 150yds, than a 246gr .44 Special has at the muzzle, when fired from the same weapon. When loaded with a heavy, non-expanding bullet, the .44 Magnum will easily shoot through large game such as [[elk]] and even [[bison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reloading&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.handgunsmag.com/ammunition/44mag_081005/index1.html |title=Reloading the .44 Magnum |author=Patrick Sweeney |authorlink= Patrick Sweeney (gunsmith)|journal=Guns &amp; Ammo Handguns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limiting factor is the bullet's trajectory; the best hunting bullets are heavy, thus, relatively slow, meaning a significant drop-out of trajectory at ranges beyond 100&amp;nbsp;yards (90&amp;nbsp;m); with a 50-yard zero, the point of which the &quot;line of sight&quot; and the &quot;bullet trajectory&quot; meet, drop-out at 100&amp;nbsp;yards is about 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm), and drop-out at 150&amp;nbsp;yards (135&amp;nbsp;m) is more than 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm); with a 100-yard zero, drop-out at 150&amp;nbsp;yards is more than 6&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remington.com/products/ammunition/ballistics/comparative_ballistics_results.aspx?data=R44MG2*R44MG3*RH44MGA |title=Ballistics Results |publisher=Remington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts recommend limiting hunting ranges to 100&amp;nbsp;yards (91&amp;nbsp;m) when shooting .44 Magnum cartridges, less if practical accuracy requires it.&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;handgunhunting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/handgun_hunting.htm |title=Handgun Hunting |author=Chuck Hawks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:S&amp;W Model 29-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29|Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 with the 203mm/8in barrel]]]]

While the .44 Magnum was very popular among shooters for many years after its introduction, it did not come to the attention of the general public until 1971 when it was prominently featured in the [[Clint Eastwood]] star-vehicle &quot;[[Dirty Harry]]&quot; (and its four sequels), which also used the [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0007342/ &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; Callahan character filmography].&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the classic lines in cinema, Eastwood's character [[Harry Callahan (character)|&quot;Dirty&quot; Harry Callahan]] describes his M29 as &quot;the most powerful handgun in the world&quot; in the [[1971 films|1971]] film ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. Although not strictly true (the more powerful [[wildcat cartridge|wildcat]] [[.454 Casull]] was announced in 1959&lt;ref name=&quot;cotw10&quot; /&gt;), the .44 Magnum was the most powerful then in production. Demand for the M29 skyrocketed, so much the guns were selling for up to three times suggested retail price.

The .44 Magnum has continued to be associated with Callahan, including the line [[Go ahead, make my day.|&quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot;]] in the [[1983 films|1983]] film ''[[Sudden Impact]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2005/quotesannouned.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |title=AFI's list of 100 famous movie quotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gun is also used in the film &quot;[[Taxi Driver]]&quot;, in which protagonist [[Travis Bickle]] (played by [[Robert DeNiro]]) buys one off the black market after one of his passengers says that he is going to kill his wife with a .44 Magnum pistol.

Popular [[First-person shooter|shooters]] and [[role-playing video game]]s, such as [[Fallout New Vegas]], include the .44 Magnum as a usable weapon.
