'''CA Technologies''' ({{nasdaq|CA}}), formerly '''CA, Inc.''' and  '''Computer Associates, Inc.''', is a [[Fortune 500]] company and one of the largest independent software corporations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/2974.html | work= CNN | title=CA â Fortune 500 2010 â CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Islandia, New York]], the company supports software which runs in mainframe, distributed, virtualized and cloud environments and which a majority of the Forbes Global 2000 has installed.{{Cn|date=October 2011}}
In 2010, CA Technologies announced its cloud computing management strategy at its CA World user conference, and its new CA Cloud-Connected Management Suite of products that address the emerging challenges presented by the cloud. 

Although the company sells [[anti-virus]] and [[internet security]] programs for consumer personal computers, it is primarily known for its [[mainframe computer]] and [[distributed computing]] applications and solutions used by businesses with CA Technologies claiming that its software is used by a majority of the Forbes Global 2000 companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?rpc=66&amp;symbol=CA.O |title=CA Inc (CA.O)| work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CA Technologies, which posted $4.4 billion US$ in revenue for fiscal year 2010 (ending March 31, 2010),&lt;ref name=&quot;CA Annual Report 2010&quot;/&gt; maintains 150 offices in more than 45 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/snapshots/341.html | work=CNN | title=CA â CA, Inc. â Fortune 500 2006 â CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company employs 13,200 people (March 31, 2010),&lt;ref name=&quot;CA Annual Report 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Inception and early years===
[[File:Computer-Associates-HQ.jpg|thumb|300px|Headquarters on Long Island]]
In 1969, under regulatory pressure, [[IBM]] announced its decision to unbundle the sale of mainframe computers from computer programs and support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/giftfire/ibm.html |title=IBM: Producer or Predator |publisher=Rohan.sdsu.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (At this time, the computer industry was dominated by mainframes, principally from IBM.) The decision opened new markets to competition and provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the nascent software industry â an opportunity that [[Charles Wang]] and his friend and business partner [[Russell Artzt|Russ Artzt]] exploited by creating a company to develop and market mainframe software, and they developed several products for the mainframe market, with modest success. In 1976, they obtained the North American distribution rights for CA-Sort, which had previously been distributed by Pansophic Systems under the name PanSort. CA-Sort was originally developed by a Swiss company named Computer Associates, which had been founded by Sam Goodner and Max Sevcik several years earlier. CA-Sort had found success in Europe, but sales in North America hadn't kept pace. Wang and Artzt established a new venture (in partnership with the Swiss company), which they named Trans-American Computer Associates, and went to market with CA-Sort, along with their original products.

The CA-Sort program helped computers to sort data efficiently. Its superior performance (mostly on the DOS/VSE platform), combined with the sales acumen of Charles Wang, led to rapid growth in the large and lucrative North American market. After merging with the original Swiss company in 1980, the new global venture (subsequently known as Computer Associates International, Inc.) was able to expand, hiring more salespeople and programmers and acquiring many smaller software companies in the following years. The acquisition in 1987 of Uccel Corporation (flagship products UCC-1, UCC-7, UCC-11) made CA the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of OS/MVS security software with CA-Top Secret and CA-ACF2.  It also made [[Walter Haefner]], who was half-owner of Uccel at the time, its largest individual shareholder, a distinction he still enjoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4189/is_20060127/ai_n16038914 |title=Activist investor group becomes No. 1 institutional holder |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=January 27, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Following an [[initial public offering]] in 1981, the company expanded rapidly through a series of acquisitions, including software makers Capex, Information Unlimited Software, Johnson Systems, CGA Computer, and [[Uccel]]. Whereas CAâs focus during this time was on system utilities, the company also sought to compete in the applications market with firms such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Lotus Development Corporation]] through acquisition of companies that provided spreadsheet, word processor, graphics, and other application software. As the decade ended, CA became the first software company after Microsoft to exceed $1 billion USD in sales.

===1990s===
In the early years of the 1990s, CA was forced to address criticism of the company (specifically, a lack of strategic focus, incompatibilities between its disparate product line, a reputation for poor customer service, and failure to win a significant share in application software markets) as well as a sharp decline in its stock price, which fell more than 50% during 1990. The ensuing changes included a push into foreign markets (Japan, Canada, Africa, and Latin America), reform in how the company charged its customers for software maintenance, and improved compatibility with products from other vendors such as [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]. Meanwhile, CA continued to expand through acquisitions, most notably in client-server computing (Legent Corporation for $1.78 billion USD in 1995, at that time the biggest ever acquisition in the software industry) and [[data storage device|data storage]] software (Cheyenne Software for $1.2 billion USD in 1996).

===2000s===
CA faced further challenges in the early 2000s including constraints imposed by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] on acquisitions, the need to service and refinance large amounts of debt, and a [[proxy fight|proxy battle]] between the board and shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4DE1630F932A15755C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Entrepreneur to Begin Proxy Fight for Computer Associates, '&amp;#39;New York Times,'&amp;#39; June 21, 2001 |work=New York Times |date=June 21, 2001 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also suffered from controversies regarding executive compensation, accounting methods, and insider-trading by its then CEO and chairman, [[Sanjay Kumar]]. Between 2004 and 2006, CA made sweeping changes among its board and executive team, including the appointment of a new CEO, John Swainson, plus new appointments to the positions of Chairman, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, CFO, COO, CTO, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, and co-General Counsel, most of which were outside appointments. On September 1, 2009, CA announced CEO John Swainson's decision to retire by December 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca.com/us/press/release.aspx?cid=215623 |title=CA, Inc. CEO John A. Swainson Announces Plans to Retire by End of 2009 |publisher=Ca.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the company presented its [[Enterprise IT Management|Enterprise IT Management (EITM)]] vision to unify and simplify enterprise-wide IT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3564046 |title=â âBelieve Againâ in CA |publisher=Internetnews.com |date=November 14, 2005 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and debuted the largest number of products in its history. Underscoring the message of a changed company, CA also unveiled a new global branding program to inspire the industry to âBelieve Againâ in the power of technology to support business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.com/us/press/release.aspx?cid=76885 CA Press Release, November 13, 2005: CA Launches New Global Branding Program]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CA changed its name from Computer Associates Inc. to CA Inc. in 2006 and to CA Technologies in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.com/us/press/release.aspx?cid=236083 CA, Inc. Has a New Name: CA Technologies]. May 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the company announced its support for [[Lean IT]] through an announcement of 13 new and enhanced EITM products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.com/us/press/release.aspx?cid=203332 CA Enables Lean IT to Help Maximize Value and Minimize Cost]. April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
CA Technologies embraced the Cloud Strategy by launching the unique{{cn|date=June 2011}} concept of IT Supply Chain, allowing a company to manage and secure dynamically both physical and virtual environments and to deliver more flexible IT services.

In 2011 CA sold its antivirus properties to Updata Partners, which spun the division off as '[[Total Defense]]'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/17/ca_quits_anti_virus_biz/&lt;/ref&gt;

With a presence in over 25 countries, CA Services works with businesses of all sizes to develop implementation, technology roadmap, and education plan. The organization posted US$280M in revenue for fiscal year 2010 (ending March 31, 2010).{{cn|date=June 2011}}

== CA Labs ==
CA Labs was established in 2005 to strengthen relationships between research communities and CA. CA Labs has been working closely with universities, professional associations and government on various projects that relate to CA products, technologies and methodologies. The results of these projects vary from research publications, to best practices, to new directions for products.

Through a variety of University Relations programs, CA is working with many universities to enable and promote innovationâincluding funding university research projects in specific areas, working with faculty to enhance curriculum, and providing opportunities to interact with CA research and development experts.

== Controversies ==
CA has been party to a number of lawsuits over its thirty-plus year history, and particularly so during the period from the early 1990s to early 2000s. One of the higher-profile disputes was a 1992 suit by [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS), which was a CA customer. EDS accused CA of breach of contract, including misuse of copyright, and violations of anti-trust laws. CA filed a counter-claim, also alleging breach of contract, including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sec.edgar-online.com/1994/03/29/00/0000040730-94-000002/Section4.asp |title=Excerpt from General Motors 10-K SEC Filing, March 29, 1994 |publisher=Sec.edgar-online.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies reached a settlement in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;CA_History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Funding_Universe_History&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, a hostile (and unsuccessful) takeover bid by CA in 1998 for computer consulting firm [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (CSC) prompted a bribery suit by CSCâs (then) chairman Van Honeycutt against CAâs founder and (then) CEO, [[Charles Wang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1998/0518/6110098a_print.html |title=A pain in the posterior, '&amp;#39;Forbes,'&amp;#39; May 18, 1998 |work=Forbes |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy followed in 1999 when Wang received the largest bonus in history at that time from a public company. Moreover, this receipt (a $670 million stock grant that dated to the vesting of a 1995 stock option&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatenarc.com/cascandal.php |title=Computer Associates Accounting Scandal |publisher=Corporatenarc.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) occurred while the company faced a slowdown in European markets and an economic slump in Asia, both of which had affected CA's earnings and stock price. In total, the company took a $675 million after-tax charge for $1.1 billion in payouts to Wang and other top CA executives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funding_Universe_History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_16/b3625017.htm |title=Executive Pay: Up, Up and Away, '&amp;#39;Business Week'&amp;#39; Online, April 19, 1999 |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek   |date=April 19, 1999 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 a shareholder-based class-action lawsuit accused CA of misstating more than $500 million in revenue in its 1998 and 1999 fiscal years in order to artificially inflate its stock price. An investigation by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) also followed, which resulted in charges against the company and some of its former top executives. The SEC alleged that from 1998 to 2000, CA routinely kept its books open to include quarterly revenue from contracts executed after the quarter ended in order to meet Wall Street analystsâ expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2004-134.htm |title=SEC files securities fraud charges against Computer Associates, Inc |publisher=Sec.gov |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company reached a settlement with the SEC and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 2004, agreeing to pay $225 million in restitution to shareholders and to reform its corporate governance and financial accounting controls. Eight CA executives since pleaded guilty to fraud charges â most notably, former CEO and chairman [[Sanjay Kumar]], who received a 12-year prison sentence for orchestrating the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De |first=Michael J. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/technology/03computer.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin |title=Ex-Leader of Computer Associates Gets 12-Year Sentence and Fine, '&amp;#39;New York Times,'&amp;#39; November 3, 2006 |work=The New York Times  |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company subsequently made sweeping changes through virtually all of its senior leadership positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;CA_History&quot;/&gt;
