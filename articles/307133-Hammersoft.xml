The '''Boeing 787 Dreamliner''' is a long-range, mid-size [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]], [[twinjet|twin-engine]] [[jet airliner]] developed by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]]. It seats 210 to 290 passengers, depending on the variant. Boeing states that it is the company's most [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficient]] airliner and the world's first major airliner to use [[composite material]]s for most of its construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;787_flyingredef&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Norris, G.; Thomas, G.; Wagner, M. and Forbes Smith, C. |title=Boeing 787 Dreamliner â Flying Redefined |publisher=Aerospace Technical Publications International |year=2005 |isbn=0-9752341-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 787 consumes 20% less fuel than the similarly-sized [[Boeing 767]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/background.html |title=Commercial Airplanes â 787 Dreamliner â Background |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its distinguishing features include a four-panel windshield, noise-reducing chevrons on its engine [[nacelle]]s, and a smoother nose contour.

The aircraft's initial designation was '''7E7''', prior to its renaming in January 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Designation&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Boeing Gives the 7E7 Dreamliner a Model Designation |publisher=Boeing |date=January 28, 2005 |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2005/q1/nr_050128g.html|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 787 was unveiled in a roll-out ceremony on July 8, 2007, at Boeing's [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett assembly factory]], by which time it had become the fastest-selling wide-body airliner in history with 677 orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;677 orders&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q3/070708b_nr.html|title=Boeing Celebrates the Premiere of the 787 Dreamliner|publisher=Boeing|date=July 8, 2007|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2011, 797 Boeing 787s had been ordered by 57 customers, with  [[International Lease Finance Corporation|ILFC]] having the largest number on order.&lt;ref name=787_O_D_summ/&gt;

The 787 development and production has involved a large-scale collaboration with numerous suppliers around the globe. Final assembly is at the [[Boeing Everett Factory]] in [[Everett, Washington]]. Aircraft will also be assembled at a new factory in [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]], South Carolina. Both sites will deliver 787s to airline customers. Originally planned to enter service in May 2008, the project has suffered from multiple delays. The airliner's [[maiden flight]] took place on December 15, 2009, and completed flight testing in mid-2011.  Final [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] [[type certificate|certification]] was received in late August 2011 and the first model was delivered in late September 2011. It entered commercial service on October 26, 2011.

==Development==
===Background===
During the late 1990s, Boeing began considering replacement aircraft programs as sales for the [[Boeing 767|767]] and [[Boeing 747-400]] slowed. The company proposed two new aircraft, the [[Boeing 747#747X and 747X Stretch|747X]], which would have lengthened the 747-400 and improved efficiency, and the [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]], which would have achieved 15% higher speeds (approximately [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.98) while burning fuel at the same rate as the existing 767.&lt;ref name=&quot;need-speed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunter|first=Lori|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2002/july/i_ca2.html|title=The Need for Speed, Boeing's Sonic Cruiser team focuses on the future|publisher=Boeing Frontier magazine|date=July 2002|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Market interest for the 747X was tepid, but the Sonic Cruiser had brighter prospects. Several major airlines in the United States, including [[Continental Airlines]], initially showed enthusiasm for the Sonic Cruiser concept, although they also expressed concerns about the operating cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes_Sonic_Cruiser_20010528&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Paper plane: That Mach 0.95 Sonic Cruiser from Boeing will never fly. Here's why. |last=Banks |first=Howard |work=Forbes |date=May 28, 2001 |url=http://members.forbes.com/global/2001/0528/056.html |accessdate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boeing787 model dreamliner-1.png|thumb|Earlier proposed design configuration of the Boeing 7E7.|alt=Early impression of the 7E7 in blue and white livery]]

The global airline market was upended by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and increased petroleum prices, making airlines more interested in efficiency than speed. The worst-affected airlines, those in the United States, had been considered the most likely customers of the Sonic Cruiser, and thus Boeing officially cancelled the Sonic Cruiser on December 20, 2002. Switching tracks, the company announced an alternative product using Sonic Cruiser technology in a more conventional configuration, the 7E7, on January 29, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;787_flyingredef&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press.

Retrieved June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on a smaller midsize twinjet rather than a large 747-size aircraft represented a shift from [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke theory]] towards the [[Point-to-point transit|point-to-point theory]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerlines&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Cannegieter |first=Roger |url=http://www.aerlines.nl/issue_31/31_Cannegieter_Ranging_Capabilities.pdf |title=Long Range vs. Ultra High Capacity|publisher=Aerlines.nl |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to analysis of [[focus group]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;BabejPollak&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Babej |first1=Marc E. |last2=Pollak |first2=Tim|and Tim Pollak |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/05/23/unsolicited-advice-advertising-cx_meb_0524boeing.html  |title=Boeing Versus Airbus |work=Forbes |date=May 24, 2006 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The replacement for the Sonic Cruiser project was dubbed the &quot;7E7&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2003/march/cover.html |title=Maximizing the Middle, Finding the sweet spot in the market |publisher=Boeing Frontier magazine

Technology from the Sonic Cruiser and 7E7 was to be used as part of Boeing's project to replace its entire airliner product line, an endeavor called the [[Boeing Yellowstone Project|Yellowstone Project]] (of which the 7E7 became the first stage).&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_787_power_on&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2008/q2/080620b_nr.html |title=Boeing Achieves 787 Power On |publisher=Boeing |date=June 20, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early concept images of the 7E7 included rakish [[cockpit]] windows, a dropped nose and a distinctive &quot;shark-fin&quot; [[vertical stabilizer|tail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/10/22/218786/daydream-believer-how-different-is-the-boeing-787.html |title=Daydream believer: How different is the Boeing 787? |work=Flight International  |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;E&quot; was said to stand for various things, such as &quot;efficiency&quot; or &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;; however, in the end, Boeing claimed that it stood merely for &quot;Eight&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;787_flyingredef&quot; /&gt; In July 2003, a public naming competition was held for the 7E7, for which out of 500,000 votes cast online the winning title was ''Dreamliner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2003/july/i_nan.html |title='Name Your Plane' sweepstakes |date= July 2003 |publisher=Boeing Frontiers Online |accessdate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names in the pool included ''eLiner'', ''Global Cruiser'' and ''Stratoclimber''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2009|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Should the last name be Stratoclimber?

===Design effort===

On April 26, 2004, Japanese airline [[All Nippon Airways]] became the launch customer for the 7E7 Dreamliner, by announcing a firm order for 50 aircraft with deliveries to begin in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2004/q2/nr_040426g.html |title=Boeing Launches 7E7 Dreamliner |publisher=Boeing |date=April 26, 2004| accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All Nippon Airways's order was initially specified as 30 787-3, 290â330 seat, one-class domestic aircraft, and 20 787-8, long-haul, 210â250 seat, two-class aircraft for regional international routes such as Tokyo [[Narita]]âBeijing. The aircraft would allow All Nippon Airways to open new routes to cities not previously served, such as [[Denver]], Moscow, and New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrodenver.org/blog-tags/industries/ANA-Japan-Denver-international-flight.html |title=ANA says Denver still in hunt for non-stop to Tokyo |publisher=Metrodenver.org |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 787-3 and 787-8 were to be the initial variants, with the 787-9 entering service in 2010.&lt;ref name=start/&gt;

The 787 was designed to become the first production [[composite material|composite]] airliner, with the fuselage assembled in one-piece composite barrel sections instead of the multiple aluminum sheets and some 50,000 fasteners used on existing aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rdmag.com/Featured-Articles/2006/11/The-Dream-of-Composites/ |title=The Dream of Composites â R&amp;D Magazine |publisher=Rdmag.com |date=November 20, 2006 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rdmag_200707&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rdmag.com/Featured-Articles/2006/11/The-Dream-of-Composites/ |title=The Dream of Composites |work=[[www.rdmag.com]] |publisher=Advantage Business Media |author=Walz, Martha |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing selected two new engine types to power the 787, the [[General Electric GEnx]] and [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000]].&lt;ref name=&quot;787_flyingredef&quot; /&gt; Boeing claimed the 787 would be near to 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the 767,&lt;ref name=AviationWeek_2009_0109&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=comm&amp;id=news/WIND010909.xml&amp;headline=Boeing%20Rules%20Out%20787%20Window%20Change |title= Boeing Rules Out 787 Window Change |accessdate =June 14, 2011 |author=Norris, Guy |date= January 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Aviation Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately forty percent of the efficiency gain from the engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=222308 |title=Design News â Features â Boeing's 'More Electric' 787 Dreamliner Spurs Engine Evolution |first= Joseph|last=Ogando|work=designnews.com |date=June 7, 2007|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus gains from aerodynamic improvements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2009|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; the increased use of lighter-weight composite materials, and advanced systems.&lt;ref name=start&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/channels/mro/articles/2006/03/27/205611/dream-start.html |title=Dream start |first= Carole|last=Shifrin|work=Flight International|date=March 27, 2006|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 787-8 and â9 were intended to be certified to 330 minute [[ETOPS]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandey |first=Mohan |title=How Boeing Defied the Airbus Challenge |year=2010 |publisher=Createspace |location=USA |isbn=9781450501132 |url=http://www.amazon.com/How-Boeing-Defied-Airbus-Challenge/dp/1450501133/ref=tmm_pap_title_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the design phase, the 787 underwent extensive [[wind tunnel]] testing at Boeing's Transonic Wind Tunnel, [[QinetiQ]]'s five-meter wind tunnel at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]], UK, and [[NASA Ames Research Center]]'s wind tunnel, as well as at the French aerodynamics research agency, [[ONERA]]. The final styling of the aircraft was more conservative than earlier proposals, with the fin, nose, and cockpit windows changed to a more conventional form. By the end of 2004, customer-announced orders and commitments for the 787 reached 237 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reinforcedplastics.com/view/4282/boeings-787-trials-tribulations-and-restoring-the-dream/|title=Boeing's 787: trials, tribulations, and restoring the dream|work=Reinforced Plastics|accessdate=July 29, 2010|last=Marsh|first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing initially priced the 787-8 variant at US$120&amp;nbsp;million, a low figure that surprised the industry. In 2007, the list price was US$146â151.5&amp;nbsp;million for the 787-3, US$157â167&amp;nbsp;million for the 787-8 and US$189â200&amp;nbsp;million for the 787-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atwonline.com/aircraftenginescomponents/news/boeing-boosts-aircraft-prices-55-rising-cost-labor-materials-0309 |title=Boeing boosts aircraft prices 5.5% on rising cost of labor, materials |publisher=[[Air Transport World]] |date=June 26, 2007| accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing and suppliers===

After stiff competition, Boeing announced on December 16, 2003, that the 787 would be assembled in its [[Boeing Everett Factory|factory]] in [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;787_flyingredef&quot; /&gt; Instead of building the complete aircraft from the ground up in the traditional manner, final assembly would employ just 800 to 1,200 people to join completed subassemblies and to integrate systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;bca_20061206&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071223183836/http://boeingmedia.com/imageDetail.cfm?id=14679&amp;KeyWord=787&amp;buID=0&amp;caid=0&amp;prid=0&amp;sc=lrg&amp;pn=1&amp;clr=&amp;CFID=2903355&amp;CFTOKEN=34556541 Boeing Unveils 787 Final Assembly Factory Flow].&quot; Boeing, December 6, 2006.

===Flight systems===

Among 787 flight systems, the most notable contribution to efficiency is the new electrical architecture, which replaces [[bleed air]] and [[hydraulic]] power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps, as well as completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems (e.g., engine starters or brakes).&lt;ref name=&quot;AERO_QTR_406_787_from_the_ground_up&quot;&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_06/AERO_Q406_article4.pdf &quot;Boeing 787 from the Ground Up&quot;].

===Engines===
[[File:Toothed exhaust duct covers on a Boeing 787.jpg|thumb|left|The toothed exhaust duct covers on the first 787, shown here with thrust-reversers deployed]]

The 787's engines use all-electrical [[Bleed air|bleedless]] systems, eliminating the superheated air conduits normally used for aircraft power, de-icing, and other functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;787_flyingredef&quot;/&gt; As part of its &quot;Quiet Technology Demonstrator 2&quot; project, Boeing adopted several engine noise-reducing technologies for the 787. Among these are a redesigned air inlet containing sound-absorbing materials and redesigned exhaust duct covers whose rims are tipped in a toothed pattern to allow for quieter mixing of exhaust and outside air. Boeing expects these developments to make the 787 significantly quieter both inside and out.&lt;ref name=Goodrich_noise&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.goodrich.com/Feature/SingleStory/0,1285,67,00.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071019053358/http://www.goodrich.com/Feature/SingleStory/0,1285,67,00.html |archivedate= October 19, 2007 |date= August 16, 2005 |title= GR &amp; Boeing Demo.

The two different engine models compatible with the 787 use a standard electrical interface to allow an aircraft to be fitted with either [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] or [[GE Aviation|General Electric]] engines. This aims to save time and cost when changing engine types; while previous aircraft can have engines changed to those of a different manufacturer, the high cost and time required makes it rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;What's new&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corliss|first=Bryan|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20090621/BIZ/701299594|title=What's new, different about the 787|journal=The Daily Herald|date=June 21, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leeham_20060718&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.leeham.net/filelib/SCOTTSCOLUMN071805.pdf 787 Is not Meeting 24hour-Engine Change Promo, lessor says].&quot; Leeham Co.

Boeing has offered three variants of the 787 from the program launch in 2004. The 787-8 is the first variant produced and is to be followed by the 787-9.

===787-8===
The 787-8 is the base model of the 787 family, with a length of 186 feet (57 m) and a wingspan of 197 feet (60 m) and a range of 7,650 to 8,200 nautical miles (14,200 to 15,200&amp;nbsp;km), depending on seating configuration. The 787-8 seats 210 passengers in a three-class configuration.&lt;ref name=&quot;787-8 specs&quot;/&gt; The variant was the first of the 787 line to enter service, entering service in 2011. Boeing is targeting the 787-8 to replace the [[Boeing 767-200ER|767-200ER]] and [[767-300ER]], as well as expand into new non-stop markets where larger planes would not be economically viable. Two thirds of 787 orders are for the 787-8.&lt;ref name=787_O_D_summ/&gt;

===787-9===
The 787-9 will be the first variant of the 787 with a &quot;stretched&quot; or lengthened fuselage, seating 250â290 in three classes with a range of 8,000 to 8,500 nautical miles (14,800 to 15,750&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=&quot;787-9 specs&quot;/&gt; This variant differs from the 787-8 in several ways, including structural strengthening, a lengthened fuselage, a higher fuel capacity, a higher maximum take-off weight (MTOW), but with the same wingspan as the 787-8.&lt;ref name=Boe_787_brochure/&gt; The targeted entry into service (EIS) date, was originally planned for 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;seattlepi_20050427&quot;&gt;Wallace, J.[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/221772_air27.html &quot;Aerospace Notebook: New 787 is taking off&quot;]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}. ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', April 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; but by October 2011 deliveries were scheduled to begin in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-delays-first-747-8i-and-787-9-deliveries-363941/]&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing is targeting the 787-9 to compete with both passenger variants of the [[Airbus A330]] and to replace their own [[767-400ER]]. Like the 787-8, it will also open up new non-stop routes, flying more cargo and fewer passengers more efficiently than the 777-200ER or A340-300/500. The firm configuration was finalized on July 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boeing clears firm configuration hurdle for 787-9 |publisher=flightglobal |year=2010 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/07/01/343969/boeing-clears-firm-configuration-hurdle-for-787-9.html |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dreamliner render 787-9.JPG|thumb||Artist's impression of the stretched 787-9, designed with greater range and payload capability]]

When first launched, the 787-9 had the same fuel capacity as the other two variants. The design differences meant higher weight and resulted in a slightly shorter range than the 787-8. After further consultation with airlines, design changes were incorporated to add a forward tank to increase its fuel capacity, so it has a longer range and a higher MTOW than the other two variants.&lt;ref name=&quot;787-9 specs&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- The â9 will also have the lowest [[Available seat miles|seat-mile cost]] of the three 787 variants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} --&gt; [[Air New Zealand]] is the launch customer for the 787-9 and the second customer for the 787 after ANA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2009|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other variants===
====787-3====
This variant was designed to be a 290-seat (two-class) short-range version of the 787 targeted at high-density flights, with a range of 2,500 to 3,050 nautical miles (4,650 to 5,650&amp;nbsp;km) when fully loaded. Its design used the same basic fuselage as the 787-8. The wing was derived from the 787-8, with blended [[winglets]] replacing raked wingtips. The change decreased the wingspan by roughly {{Convert|25|ft|m}}, allowing the 787-3 to fit into more domestic gates, and in particular in Japan. This model would have been limited in its range by a reduced MTOW of 364,000&amp;nbsp;lb (165,100&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=&quot;787-3 specs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;Actual range is based on remaining available weight for fuel after the aircraft empty weight and payload are subtracted from the MTOW.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Dreamliner render 787-3.JPG|thumb|left|An artist's impression of the 787-3, which would have featured a shorter wing with winglets.]]

The â3 variant was designed to operate on [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757â300]]/[[Boeing 767|767â200]]-sized regional routes from airports with restricted gate spacing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2009|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boeing projected that the future of aviation between very large, but close cities of five million or more people  may stabilize around the capacity level of the 787-3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baseler_ Randy_200505&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boeingblogs.com/randy/archives/2005/05/kangaroo_hop.html |title=Kangaroo hop |work=Randy's Journal |publisher=The Boeing Company |date= May 20, 2005 |author=Baseler, Randy |accessdate=July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAA_2005_20704&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/comments/209455.htm |title= Congestion And Delay Reduction At Chicago O'Hare International Airport: Docket No. FAA-2005-20704 |work=Comments of The United States Department of Justice |publisher=Before The Federal Aviation Administration Department of Transportation |date= May 24, 2005 |author=Pate, R.

Forty-three 787-3s were ordered by the two Japanese airlines, but production problems on the base 787-8 model led Boeing to postpone the introduction of the 787-3 in April 2008, following the 787-9 but without a firm delivery date.&lt;ref name=&quot;787 variants delayed to at least 2012&quot;/&gt; By December 2009, all 787-3 orders had been converted to the 787-8.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_O_D_search&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=userdefinedselection.cfm&amp;pageid=m15527|title=Orders and Deliveries search page|publisher=Boeing|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was likely the 787-3 variant would be shelved entirely following the lack of interest by potential customers caused by its being designed specifically for the Japanese market.&lt;ref name=Boeing_likely_scrap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010963351_boeingbloom03.html |title=Boeing will likely scrap 787-3 |work=The Seattle Times |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, 2010, Boeing did cancel the 787-3, since it was no longer financially viable after its orders were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/boeingaerospace/2013672244_boeingprices14.html |title=Boeing raises aircraft prices 5.2%, cancels short-haul 787 |publisher=Seattle Times |date=December 13, 2010 |first=Susanna |last=Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====787-10====
Boeing has stated that it is likely to develop another version, the longer 787-10, with [[seating capacity]] between 290 and 310.&lt;ref name=&quot;seattlepi_20051222&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wallace |first=James |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Everett-work-force-for-787-pegged-at-1-000-1190602.php |title=Everett work force for 787 pegged at 1,000 |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=December 22, 2005 |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atw_20050926&gt;{{cite news |url=http://atwonline.com/aircraftenginescomponents/news/boeing-looks-larger-dreamliner-meet-emirates-ba-requirements-0309 |title=Boeing looks at larger Dreamliner to meet Emirates, BA requirements |author=Thomas, G. |date=September 26, 2005 |work=[[Air Transport World]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed model is intended to compete with the planned Airbus [[Airbus A350|A350-900]].&lt;ref name=atw_20051223&gt;{{cite news |url=http://atwonline.com/aircraftenginescomponents/news/boeing-bullish-787-10-dreamliner-production-0309 |title=Boeing bullish on 787-10, Dreamliner production |author=Thomas, G. |date=December 23, 2005 |work=[[Air Transport World]] |publisher=ATW Media Group |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 787-10 would supersede the [[Boeing 777|777-200ER]] in Boeing's current catalog and could also compete against the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] and [[Airbus A340|A340-300/500]].
