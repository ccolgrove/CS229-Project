'''Anonym.OS''' was a [[Live CD]] [[operating system]] based on [[OpenBSD]] 3.8 with strong [[encryption]] and anonymization tools. The goal of the project was to provide a secure anonymous [[internet|web browsing]] access to everyday users.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The operating system was [[OpenBSD]] 3.8, although many [[Software package (installation)|packages]] have been added to facilitate its goal. It used [[Fluxbox]] as its [[window manager]].

The project was discontinued after the release of Beta 4. &lt;ref&gt;
