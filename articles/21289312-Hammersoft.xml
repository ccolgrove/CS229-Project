'''Jay Marshall Strabala''' is an [[United States|American]] [[architect]] who has been recognized with participating in the design of notable buildings, including as a member of the team that designed the [[Burj Khalifa]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]], in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. However, in June 2011, two of Strabala's former architectural firm employers sued him alleging that he had &quot;misrepresented&quot; the role he played in various projects.&lt;ref name=WLS /&gt;&lt;ref name=law360 /&gt;

== Education ==
Strabala received his [[bachelor of arts]] in design from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=HCon22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PR /&gt; In 1988, Strabala graduated with an [[Master of Architecture]] from [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].&lt;ref name=HCon22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PR /&gt;

==Career==
===Skidmore, Owings and Merrill===
After graduating with his master's degree, Strabala worked at [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] (SOM) in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], for 19 years.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt; He ultimately was made an associate partner in charge of design.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt; 

While at SOM, Strabala served as the studio head under lead architect [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]] in working on the design of [[Burj Khalifa]] ([[Dubai]], 2009), which is the tallest building in the world.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Keegan&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/Architects/adrian-smith-leaves-som.aspx | title=Adrian Smith Leaves SOM | author=Keegan, Edward | journal=[[Architect (magazine)|Architect]]|publisher=[[American Institute of Architects]] &amp; [[Hanley Wood]]|date=October 2006|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/travel/13iht-tall.1.15201567.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|title=Rising in Dubai: Adrian Smith's vision of green: Tall and getting taller | author=Bernstein, Fred A. |date=August 12, 2008|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strabala also worked under Smith as one of the two studio heads over the course of the project in designing the 828 m. tall [[Nanjing Greenland Financial Center]] ([[Nanjing]], China, 2010).&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=that's Shanghai| issn=1672-8033 |title=The architect's architect | publisher= Urbanatomy Media | date= March 18, 2011 | url=http://www.urbanatomy.com/index.php/article/detail/115/the-architects-architect | accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also while at SOM, Strabala participated in the design of the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] ([[Hong Kong]], 1997).&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt;

Strabala left SOM in 2006.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt; In a 2007 interview, Adrian Smith alleged that Strabala was one of several architects up for, but who did not make, partner at SOM in what Smith described as &quot;a power move by the New York office.&quot;&lt;ref name=businessweek&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis]]|title=Parting Company| date=January 2007| volume=26|issue=6| author=Makovsky, Paul|issn=0279-4977|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070110/parting-company | accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gensler===

[[File:HoustonBalletApril92011.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Houston Ballet Center for Dance]]]]
After leaving SOM, Strabala joined the [[Houston]], Texas, office of [[Gensler]] global architectural firm as the firm's South Central Region Director of Design in 2006.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite web|title=J. Marshall Strabala Joins Gensler Houston As Director Of Design | author=Gensler |publisher=officenewswire| date=April 7, 2006|url=http://www.officenewswire.com/1642 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt;  Strabala has been reported to have led the design of the 128-story [[Shanghai Tower]] while at Gensler and to have completed the &quot;bulk of the design work&quot;.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt; Gensler, however, claims that the tower is not Strabala's design. According to Gensler, &quot;Gensler, not (Strabala), is the source of the architectural and design services rendered in designing the Shanghai Tower.&quot;&lt;ref name=archmag&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Architect (magazine)|Architect]] | title=Newswire: Gensler vs. Strabala |date=June 10, 2011|publisher=American Institute of Architects &amp; Hanley Wood|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/architect-newswire/gensler-vs--strabala.aspx | accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it is finished, the tower will become China's tallest building and the world's second-tallest building.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miller, JFK | url=http://www.webcitation.org/5z2JByeF2 |title=The Master Builder| journal=[[that's Shanghai]] | publisher=Urbanatomy Media|issn=1672-8033| date=December 9, 2010 | accessdate=2011-06-04|location=Shanghai, China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strabala also has been credited for leading Gensler's efforts in designing [[Hess Tower]] (Houston, 2010) and the [[Houston Ballet Center for Dance]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 26, 2010 | author=Hall, Christine|work=Houston Business Journal | title=Marshall Strabala Gives New Meaning to Supertall| accessdate=2011-06-09| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2010/09/27/newscolumn2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glentzer&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/features/6556005.html|title=Houston Ballet breaks ground on new downtown home|author=Glentzer, Molly |date=July 31, 2009 |newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Houston Ballet]] |title= Houston's New Home for Dance | url= http://www.houstonballet.org/CenterForDance/Houston_Ballet_News_New_Home_For_Dance/|author=Shields, Mitchell J.|year=2009|accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gensler has claimed that &quot;'Gensler, not (Strabala), is the source of the architectural and design services rendered in designing Hess Tower'&quot;, and that Strabala was but &quot;'one of many members of that Gensler team'&quot; that designed the Houston Ballet Center for Dance.&lt;ref name=WLS /&gt;

Strabala left Gensler in 2010.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt;

===Formation of new firm===
After leaving Gensler, Strabala started his own [[architectural firm]], 2DEFINE Architecture, with offices in Shanghai, Seoul, and Chicago.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt; According to Strabala, he &quot;continues to be involved in the Shanghai Tower project at the behest of the client&quot;.&lt;ref name=Urbanatomy /&gt;

==Litigation concerning attribution of credit==
In June 2011, Gensler, sued Strabala alleging that after founding his own firm he &quot;'misrepresented the nature of his contribution, if any, to certain design projects while intentionally minimizing or entirely omitting the nature of Gensler's contribution.'&quot;&lt;ref name=WLS&gt;{{cite news | title=Architect making false claims, former employer says | url=http://www.wlsam.com/Article.asp?id=2209350&amp;spid= | date=June 10, 2011 | agency=[[Sun-Times Media Wire]] | publisher=[[WLS-AM]] | location=Chicago | accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=archmag /&gt;&lt;ref name=GvSDocs&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rfcexpress.com/lawsuits/trademark-lawsuits/illinois-northern-district-court/76467/m-arthur-gensler-jr-associates-inc-v-jay-marshall-strabala-individually-and-doing-business-as-2define-architecture/official-court-documents/ | publisher=RFC Express|title=Court Documents|work=Gensler v. Strabala |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One day later, SOM also sued Strabala alleging that he was &quot;falsely claiming credit for work that originated with the company, including the designs for  three of the 10 tallest  buildings in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=law360&gt;{{cite news | author=Ugolik, Kaitlin |date= June 10, 2011 | publisher=Law360| title=Ex-Skidmore Architect Sued Over Building Design Claims | url=http://www.law360.com/employment/articles/250517/ex-skidmore-architect-sued-over-building-design-claims | accessdate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SvSDocs&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.rfcexpress.com/lawsuits/copyright-lawsuits/new-york-southern-district-court/76456/skidmore-owings-merrill-llp-v-jay-marshall-strabala/official-court-documents/ | publisher=RFC Express|title=Court Documents|work=Skidmore, Owings and Merrill v. Strabala |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strabala and his attorneys have filed motions to dismiss both lawsuits.&lt;ref name=GvSDocs /&gt;&lt;ref name=SvSDocs /&gt;&lt;ref name=1:11-cv-03945-docket&gt;{{cite web |date= Aug. 9, 2011 | title=Motion by Defendant Jay Marshall Strabala to dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) (docket #16) |publisher=[[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] ([[PACER (law)|PACER]]) |work=Gensler v.

==Local involvement==
In 1999, Strabala, speaking as a private citizen as part of a community group, testified before the [[Chicago City Council]] Zoning Committee against a high-rise development at 840 [[Lake Shore Drive]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|title=Streeterville High-rise Passes Zoning Panel | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] | author=Garza, Melita Marie |date=August 25, 1999 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-25/news/9908250257_1_lake-michigan-abrams-soar | accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strabala lived nearby and was concerned that the high-rise would be &quot;out of scale with the neighborhood&quot;.&lt;ref name=tribune /&gt; Despite opponents' efforts, and that the project would &quot;flout existing law&quot;, the Zoning Committee amended the ordinance allowing the project to proceed even though it contradicted zoning ordinances.&lt;ref name=tribune /&gt;
