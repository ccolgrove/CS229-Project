'''Bochs''' (pronounced &quot;box&quot;) is a portable [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] [[IBM PC compatible]] [[emulator]] and [[debugger]] mostly written in [[C++]] and distributed as [[free software]] under [[GNU Lesser General Public License]]. It supports emulation of the processor(s) (including [[protected mode]]), memory, disks, display, [[Ethernet]], [[BIOS]] and common hardware peripherals of [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]].

Many ''guest'' [[operating system]]s can be run using the emulator including [[DOS]], several versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[BSD]]s, [[Linux]], [[Xenix]] and [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]] (precursor of Mac OS X). Bochs can run on many ''host'' operating systems, like [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]].

Bochs is mostly used for operating system development (when an emulated operating system [[Crash (computing)|crashes]], it does not crash the host operating system, so the emulated OS can be [[debugging|debugged]]) and to run other guest operating systems inside already running host operating systems. It can also be used to run older software â such as PC games â which will not run on non-compatible, or too fast computers.

It uses [[SeaBIOS]].

== History ==
Bochs started as a program with a commercial license, at the price of 25 [[United States dollar|USD]], for use as-is.  If a user needed to link it to other software, that user would have to negotiate a special license. That changed on 22 March 2000, when Mandrakesoft (now [[Mandriva]]) bought Bochs from lead-developer Kevin Lawton and released it for [[Linux]] under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MandrakeSoft buys Bochs for Linux and commits it to Open Source|url=http://lwn.net/2000/0323/a/mand-bochs.html|date=March 23, 2000|accessdate=September 21, 2011|author=Gael Duval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Bochs can emulate the hardware needed by the guest operating system, including hard drives, CD drives, and floppy drives. Disk and ISO images can be &quot;inserted&quot; while the system is being run. However, the system performance is very slow because it is only emulated. It doesn't provide any CPU [[Hardware-assisted virtualization|virtualization]] features.  However, it is useful for capturing screen shots in researching old [[DOS]] software. Bochs is widely used for hobbyist OS developing, as it saves the need for constant system restarts (to test code). Bochs is also convenient for OS developers because it has error reporting and dump files that other emulators may lack.

[http://bfe.sourceforge.net/?p0=screenshots BFE] makes it possible to debug software step-by-step at the instruction and register level, much like Borland's [[Borland Turbo Debugger|Turbo Debugger]].
