The '''''James Bond''''' [[film series]] is a British series of motion pictures based on the fictional character of [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] (code designation &quot;007&quot;), who originally appeared in a [[James Bond novels|series of books]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Earlier films were based on Fleming's novels and short stories, followed later by films with original storylines. It is the longest continually-running film series in history, having been in ongoing production from 1962 to the present (with a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/7608854/James-Bond-film-suspended.html|title=James Bond film suspended|date=20 April 2010|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that time [[Eon Productions]] has produced 22 films, at an average of about one every two years, usually produced at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The series has grossed just over US$5 billion to date, making it the [[List of highest-grossing film series|second-highest-grossing film series of all-time]] (behind  [[Harry Potter  (film series)|''Harry Potter'']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/sep/11/jkjoannekathleenrowling|title=Harry Potter becomes highest-grossing film franchise|accessdate=28 September 2011|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 September 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Bond (character)#Actors|Six actors]] have portrayed 007 in the Eon series, with the Connery films largely setting the style and mood of the series, and Roger Moore starring in the most films.

[[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] co-produced the Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli became the sole producer. Since 1995, Broccoli's daughter [[Barbara Broccoli|Barbara]] and stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]] have co-produced them. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, [[Danjaq]], has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with [[United Artists]] since the mid-1970s. From the release of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) up to ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981) the films were distributed solely by UA. When [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought UA in 1981, MGM/UA Entertainment Co. was formed and distributed the films until 1995. MGM solely distributed three films from 1997 to 2002 after UA retired as a mainstream studio. From 2006 to present MGM and [[Columbia Pictures]] have co-distributed the franchise, following the 2005 acquisition of MGM by a consortium led by Columbia's parent company, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]. In November 2010, MGM filed for bankruptcy. Following MGM's emergence from bankruptcy, Columbia has been co-production partner of the series with Danjaq.

Independently of the Eon series, there have been three additional film or TV productions with the character of James Bond â a satirical film spoof based on ''Casino Royale'' (1967), a remake of ''Thunderball'' entitled ''Never Say Never Again'' starring Sean Connery (1983) and a pre-Eon 1954 American television adaptation of ''Casino Royale''.

==Development==
===First Bond film===
Previous attempts to adapt the [[James Bond novels]] for screen resulted in a [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|1954 television episode]] of ''[[Climax!]]'', based on the first novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', and starring American actor [[Barry Nelson]] as &quot;Jimmy Bond&quot;. [[Ian Fleming]] desired to go one step further and approached producer [[Sir Alexander Korda]] to make a [[film adaptation]] of either ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' or ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]''. Although Korda was initially interested, he later withdrew.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=255}} On 1 October 1959, it was announced that Fleming would write an original film script featuring Bond for producer [[Kevin McClory]]. [[Jack Whittingham]] also worked on the script, culminating in a screenplay entitled ''James Bond, Secret Agent''.{{sfn|Caplen|2010|p=73}} However, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Richard Burton]] turned down roles as director and star, respectively.&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite news | title = The Lost Bond | publisher = [[Total Film]] | date = 27 February 2008 | url = http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-lost-bond | accessdate=19 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McClory was unable to secure the financing for the film, and the deal fell through. Fleming used the story for his novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' (1961).{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=42}}

In 1959, producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]] expressed interest in adapting the Bond novels, but his colleague [[Irving Allen]] was unenthusiastic. In 1961, Broccoli, now partnered with [[Harry Saltzman]], purchased the film rights to all the Bond novels (except ''Casino Royale'') from Fleming.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=5}} However, numerous Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding it &quot;too British&quot; or &quot;too blatantly sexual&quot;.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=13}} The producers wanted US$1 million to either adapt ''Thunderball'' or ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'', and reached a deal with [[United Artists]] in July 1961. The two producers set up [[Eon Productions]] and began production of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=43}}

===Sean Connery (1962â1967)===
[[File:Sean Connery 1980 Crop.jpg|thumb|[[Sean Connery]] in 1980]]
A contest was set up to 'find James Bond', and six finalists were chosen and screen-tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a [[Gregory Peck]] quality, but proved unable to cope with the role.{{sfn|Cork| Scivally |2006|p=31}} The producers turned to [[Sean Connery]], who ended up playing Bond for five consecutive films (and more subsequently). According to one story, Connery had been suggested by Polish director Ben Fisz, a friend of Saltzman. Saltzman viewed Connery in ''[[On the Fiddle]]'' (also called &quot;Operation Snafu&quot;), the actor's eleventh film. By other accounts, Broccoli first saw Connery in a screening of ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=8}}

====''Dr. No'' (1962)====
Connery was not Broccoli and Fleming's first choice, but they accepted him after being rejected by [[Patrick McGoohan]] and rejecting [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], [[James Mason]], [[Rex Harrison]], [[David Niven]], [[Trevor Howard]], and Broccoli's friend [[Cary Grant]] for various contractual impasses. Cary Grant was first choice but would only sign for one film instead of two; James Mason, the second choice, would only sign for two instead of three.  Broccoli later said, &quot;I wanted a ballsy guy...Put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job&quot;. Already balding, Connery wore a toupee in all his Bond films. Connery stated that &quot;the character is not really me, after all&quot;.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=8-9}} Ian Fleming, after seeing the preview screening of the first film, ''Dr. No'', told his research assistant, &quot;Dreadful. Simply dreadful.&quot;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=16}} ''Dr. No'' received mixed reviews, some quite hostile, and even received a rebuke by the Vatican.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=16}} Fleming eventually warmed up to Connery sufficiently to establish a Scottish ancestry for Bond in the late novels.

The role of Dr. No went to [[Joseph Wiseman]], who had played a similar character in a ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' episode &quot;[[One More Pallbearer]]&quot;, after [[Noel Coward]], [[Christopher Lee]], and [[Max von Sydow]] were suggested.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=14}} (Both Lee and Sydow played Bond villains later, Sydow in the non-Eon Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.) With just two weeks to go before filming, the part of the first principal [[Bond girl]], [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], had yet to be cast. Director Young had seen a picture of Swiss-born actress [[Ursula Andress]], then wife of [[John Derek]], when visiting [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] over at Fox, and he borrowed the photo and showed it to the producers, who quickly approved the deal.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=12}}

====''From Russia with Love'' (1963)====
On the next film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', the producers doubled the budget, and shot locales in Europe, which had turned out to be the more profitable market for ''Dr. No''.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=22}} Much of the team from the first film returned.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=33-35}} The film was the first to feature the pre-title sequence and the first to feature [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as Major Boothroyd, now called the Equipment Officer, who finally becomes Q in the third film. Llewelyn appears in a total of seventeen Bond films, the most for any actor playing the same role.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=56}} The final confrontation between Bond and assassin Donald Grant ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]) takes place on the [[Orient Express]] and Bond owes his life to Major Boothroyd's deadly attachÃ© case.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=29}} It is also the second and last film to feature the role of [[Sylvia Trench]], who was supposed to continue through the series as Bond's somewhat regular bed partner between assignments.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=67}}{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=30}}  The violence of the second film was decidedly pumped up from the previous film, with more than double the homicides.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=66}}

Adding to the appeal of mounting the picture, ''From Russia with Love'' was also cited by President [[John F. Kennedy]] as one of his ten favourite books,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=20}} although he was unlikely to have seen the film version, which was not released in the US until April 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodds|first=Klaus|title=Screening Geopolitics: James Bond and the Early Cold War films (1962-1967)|journal=Geopolitics|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|pages=266&amp;ndash;289|doi=10.1080/14650040590946584}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics still resisted the Bond allure on the second Connery film, branding ''From Russia with Love'' &quot;a movie made for kicks&quot;, but audiences loved it and some critics raved, such as [[Bosley Crowther]] who proclaimed &quot;Don't Miss It!&quot;.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=36}} It is the first of the series to have virtually all the elements that appear throughout the series.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=62-64}}

====''Goldfinger'' (1964)====
For the next film, ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', Guy Hamilton took over as director from Terence Young, putting more humour into Bond's character and more double entendres on the table.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=41}} For the important role of Pussy Galore, [[Honor Blackman]] was lured away from her role on the ''Avengers'' television series, which later offered up [[Diana Rigg]] as well.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=34}} For Auric Goldfinger, [[Theodore Bikel]] was considered but the role went to [[Gert FrÃ¶be]], a well-known actor in Europe, whose heavy accent required that his voice be dubbed.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=91}}

''Goldfinger'' is the most noted Bond film by popular culture. The first appearance of the Aston Martin DB5 was in this film. The use of a menacing laser, newly invented just years before and not widely known to the public, was a cutting edge demonstration of real technology, and a set-up to perhaps one of the most memorable lines of the Bond films:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;BOND:&lt;/small&gt; Do you expect me to talk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;GOLDFINGER:&lt;/small&gt; No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=48}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; The premiere in the UK created a near riot. In America, it became the fastest-grossing film ever to date. It was the first Bond film to win an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] (category: Best Effects, Sound Effects). [[Ian Fleming]] died before getting to see the film.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=41}}

====''Thunderball'' (1965)====
By 1961, the Fleming ''Thunderball'' novel had become the biggest hit in the Bond novel series and was the project that re-attracted Cubby Broccoli to consider producing Bond projects in 1961{{mdash}}most rights to which Harry Saltzman held, for he had acquired an option to the most of the Bond movie rights{{mdash}}with the notable exception of ''Thunderball'', which was turned into a script in that year which became the centre of a [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|long legal battle]] between screenwriters and Fleming.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}} Consequently ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' was not made by Eon until the legal obstacles had been cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poliakoff|first=Keith|title=License to Copyright - The Ongoing Dispute Over the Ownership of James Bond|journal=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|publisher=[[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]]|year=2000|volume= 18|pages=387â436|url=http://www.cardozoaelj.net/issues/00/Poliakoff.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a court case, McClory sued Fleming, because Fleming had used ''Thunderball'''s story and characters without permission. He won the film rights to ''Thunderball'', so when Broccoli and Saltzman made ''Thunderball'', it was a co-production with McClory. Part of the deal they made ensured McClory was unable to make ''Thunderball'' into a film for ten years.

Apart from Connery, the principal parts were hotly contested. For the lead Bond girl, Domino, a slew of top female actresses were considered including [[Raquel Welch]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Faye Dunaway]] but the role went to former Miss France [[Claudine Auger]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=45}} Always with an eye toward European audiences, the producers gave the part of supervillain Emilio Largo to popular Italian actor [[Adolfo Celi]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=46}} Connery was eager to start but admitted in a pre-production interview that &quot;My only grumble about the Bond films is that they don't tax one as an actor. All one needs is the constitution of a rugby player to get through 18 weeks of swimming, slugging, and neckingâ¦ I'd like to see someone else tackle Bond.&quot;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=46}}
{{James Bond Timeline}}
Connery would later state that ''Thunderball'' was his personal favourite performance as Bond (though in later statements, he claims that his favourite is ''From Russia with Love''). ''Goldfinger'' was the fan-favourite from ''Dr. No'' to ''Diamonds Are Forever'', though not Connery's favourite.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=103}} ''Thunderball'' was the most successful Bond film to date, based on total box office, earning $141.2 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thunderball|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1965/0THBA.php|work=The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC. http://the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|141.2|1965}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}}). It also inspired other spy films of the 1960s, including the &quot;[[Harry Palmer]]&quot; trilogy featuring [[Michael Caine]], the &quot;[[Our Man Flint|Derek Flint]]&quot; series with [[James Coburn]], and the &quot;[[Matt Helm]]&quot; series with [[Dean Martin]].{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=66}}

====''You Only Live Twice'' (1967)====
In the fifth Bond film with Connery, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', Bond comes face-to-face for the first time with arch-nemesis Blofeld ([[Donald Pleasence]]) Number One in SPECTRE, the world's most powerful criminal organisation. The title comes from a pseudo-[[haiku]] written by Fleming in the [[You Only Live Twice (novel)|source novel]], &quot;You only live twice/Once when you're born/And once when you look death in the face.&quot;{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=87}} The Bond films were hugely popular in Japan and when the crew arrived for shooting, they were treated exuberantly.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=74}} Connery, however, was somewhat resigned to the project, lacking the enthusiasm he sported for ''Thunderball''.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=82}} Glimpses of Japanese culture were progressive (again a smart bow to Asian audiences by the producers) and the martial arts and ninja sequences novel for the time.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=140}}

''You Only Live Twice'' is the very first James Bond film to jettison the plot premise of the Fleming source material, although the film retains the title, setting the plot entirely in Japan, the use of Blofeld as the main villain and a Bond girl named Kissy Suzuki-the backplot, plot and narrative were entirely screenwriter creations, and based in part on having already scouted locations such as Ninja castles and the volcanic mountains.&lt;ref&gt;The Bond Documentaries on DVD&lt;/ref&gt; After ''You Only Live Twice'', and despite the posters boasting that &quot;Sean Connery is James Bond&quot;, Connery announced that it was his last film as Bond. The producers had no desire to give up the series and launched a search for a Bond actor for the next film.

===George Lazenby (1969)===
[[File:GeorgeLazenby11.14.08ByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Lazenby]] at the November 2008 [[Big Apple Con]] in [[Manhattan]]|alt=Grey haired man in red check shirt, sitting at a table on which his hands are resting.]]
To replace Connery, Broccoli initially chose actor [[Timothy Dalton]]. However, Dalton declined, believing himself too young for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date= 2000 |title = Inside The Living Daylights |medium = DVD |publisher  = MGM Home Entertainment |location = ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', Ultimate Edition Disk 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confirmed front runners were Englishman [[John Richardson (actor)|John Richardson]], Dutchman Hans de Vries, American Robert Campbell, and Englishman Anthony Rogers.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=82}}

Broccoli and Hunt eventually chose Australian [[George Lazenby]] after seeing him in a [[Fry's Chocolate Cream]] advertisement.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHMSS documentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video| title =Inside On Her Majesty's Secret Service | medium=DVD | location= ''OHMSS'' Ultimate Edition DVD | publisher =MGM Home Entertainment Inc| date= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a [[Rolex]] Submariner wristwatch and a [[Savile Row]] suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the [[Dorchester Hotel]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title= De 'vergeten' 007| url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/andere-tijden/afleveringen/2006-2007/De-vergeten-007.html| series= Andere Tijden| serieslink   = w:nl:Andere Tijden| network = [[VPRO]]| station= [[Nederland 2]]| city= [[Amsterdam]]| airdate= 19 November 19 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broccoli noticed Lazenby as a Bond-type man based on his physique and character elements, and offered him an audition. The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a [[professional wrestler]], who was acting as [[stunt coordinator]], in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=82}} Lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, he was convinced by his agent [[Ronan O'Rahilly]] that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, and as a result he left the series after the release of ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHMSS documentary&quot;/&gt;

Lazenby's reviews were quite mixed. Many felt that he was physically convincing in the action sequences, for which he did most of his own stunts, and that his portrayal was closer to the character in Fleming's novels, but that he looked foolish in his many loud costume changes, some featuring kilts, and delivered his lines poorly,{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=159}} possibly because much of his dialogue was dubbed after the fact with the voice of a character whom he was impersonating through much of the film.&lt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/550393/credits.html|work=Screenonline|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also featured the only breaking of the &quot;[[fourth wall]]&quot; in the Eon-produced Bond series, with Lazenby saying: &quot;This never happened to the other fellow&quot;, a reference to Connery's Bond.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=161}}

In ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', a conscious attempt was made to establish continuity with previous Bond films by showing scenes from those films during the title sequence. Furthermore, when Bond is packing up items in his office, several mementos of previous cases, such as the breathing device from ''Thunderball'', are shown, while the score plays musical motifs from those previous films.

===Sean Connery's return (1971)===
After Lazenby's decision to only appear in one film, the producers decided to return to the formula of ''Goldfinger''. Director [[Guy Hamilton]] returned, as well as the regular cast. [[John Gavin]] was offered the role of Bond and accepted, but the producers were simultaneously attempting to bring Sean Connery back to the role. To clinch the deal, Connery received a remarkable contract: a record $1.25 million salary, (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.25|1971}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) plus 12.5 percent of the gross profits, and an additional $145,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|145000|1971}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) per week overtime if filming extended beyond 18 weeks. Connery admitted, &quot;I was really bribed back into it...  But it served my purpose...  Playing James Bond again is still enjoyable.&quot;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=51}} The original idea was to bring back  Auric Goldfinger for a sequel, but that was abandoned.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=173}} In Fleming's novels, Bond attempts to get revenge for the death of his wife in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' in ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]''. But since the latter had been filmed prior to the former, Blofeld (played by English actor [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]) is put into the story of ''Diamonds Are Forever'' to give Bond an opportunity to give Blofeld his comeuppance. This meant instead of Fleming's three stories about Blofeld (often published as the Blofeld trilogy), they had four. Connery returned to the role 12 years later in the non-Eon ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. For more see ''Non Eon-series'' column below.

===Roger Moore (1973â1985)===

In early 1972, the search for Connery's replacement began once again. [[Jeremy Brett]], [[Michael Billington (actor)|Michael Billington]], and [[Julian Glover]] (who would later play [[Aristotle Kristatos]] in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'') were considered for the next film in the series, ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973), with the forty-five-year-old [[Roger Moore]] getting the nod.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=106}} Moore would become the longest-serving Bond, spending twelve years in the role and making seven films.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=186}}{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=128}}

Moore wanted to avoid imitating either Connery or his own performance as [[Simon Templar]] in ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' and he opted to take a more light-hearted and comedic approach to the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;inside&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title= Inside Live and Let Die: Live and Let Die Ultimate Edition, Disc 2|date=2000|format=NTSC, Widescreen, Closed-captioned|publisher=MGM/UA Home Video| location=|medium=DVD|accessdate=22 March 2008|id=ASIN: B000LY209E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sharp contrast to Lazenby's introduction, the first two Moore films made a point to avoid common Bond film motifs: he smoked cigars rather than cigarettes and drank bourbon in place of a martini. It was during Moore's tenure in the role that Bond stopped smoking altogether. During the 1970s, the films became increasingly more comedic- mixing dark and even strange humour with violence. In regards to this new incarnation, one critic remarked &quot;Roger Moore has none of the [[gravitas]] of Sean Conneryâ¦ he does fit slickly into the director's presentation of Bond as a lethal comedian&quot;.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=126}}

Critics{{who|date= December 2010}} thought this Bond more of a charmer, more debonair, more calculating, and more casually lascivious in a somewhat detached but amused manner. He appears just as strong physically as Connery (at least in the early pictures), but not quite as graceful in action. Moore's adaptation applied more fantasy and humour than other Bonds. Despite some criticism, Moore's films proved successful enough to keep the franchise alive well into the 1980s with Moore playing the role into his fifties. The survival of the series can also be attributed to the addition of more contemporary themes (such as downplaying the Cold War era villains) and adding new characters to shore up the now-dated Fleming plots.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=117}}

====''Live and Let Die'' (1973), ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (1974) and ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (1977)====
Despite mixed reviews, ''Live and Let Die'' was a [[box office]] success. From a budget estimated to be around $7 million, (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7|1973}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) the film grossed $126.4 million  (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|126.4|1973}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/lald.php3 | title=Live and Let Die |work=The Numbers| publisher= Nash Information Service| accessdate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film holds the record for the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|most viewed broadcast film]] on television in the United Kingdom by attracting 23.5 million viewers when premiered on [[ITV]] on 20 January 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corrie.net/chat/ratucs/press/top100.html |title=TV's jewels fail to shine in list of all-time winners|publisher= [[Electronic Telegraph]]|date=7 February 1998|accessdate=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[British Film Institute]], Moore's second Bond film, ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', &quot;is widely regarded as the most disappointing of the 1970s James Bond films&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooke MTTGG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooke|first=Michael|title=The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/505543/|work=BFI Screenonline|publisher=The [[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marked the end of Harry Saltzman's role as co-producer. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in [[Eon Productions]]'s parent company, [[Danjaq, LLC]], to [[United Artists]] (then owned by [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]] Corp.) to alleviate his financial problems.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=141-142}}

Roger Moore's third film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977), became a turning point for the series in two ways: it was the first film produced by Broccoli alone and also the first to include a completely original storyline, as Ian Fleming had given permission to use only the title of [[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|the novel]].&lt;ref&gt;(2000). Inside The Spy Who Loved Me [DVD]. MGM Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Moonraker'' (1979), ''For Your Eyes Only'' (1981), ''Octopussy'' (1983) and ''A View to a Kill'' (1985)====
Moore's fourth film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', was the last Bond film to use the title of a Fleming novel until 2006's ''Casino Royale''. The next two films, ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' and ''[[Octopussy]]'', used both of the titles of Bond short story anthologies and each incorporated material from multiple stories in those anthologies. 

Moore showed interest in departing the series after 1981's ''For Your Eyes Only'', and a string of younger actors, including [[James Brolin]], [[Oliver Tobias]], and [[Michael Billington (actor)|Michael Billington]], screen-tested for the part. However, Eon eventually persuaded him to return in 1983's ''Octopussy'', due to the non-Eon Bond film, ''Never Say Never Again'', being released in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;(2000). Inside Octopussy [DVD]. MGM Home Entertainment. Retrieved on 4 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Because he was rather old for the required action and the demands of the character (Moore was 55 at the time), stunt doubles were employed often (over a hundred stuntmen in total), and only the close-ups are surely Moore.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=31}} Moore would only regret his last film, ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985), which was poorly received by critics.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=169}}

===Timothy Dalton (1987â1989)===
====''The Living Daylights'' (1987)====
[[Timothy Dalton]] had been considered to replace [[Sean Connery]] in 1968, but he walked away from his screen test feeling, at the age of 22, that he was too young for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/features/famous_derby/timothy_dalton.shtml |title=Derby - Around Derby - Famous Derby - Timothy Dalton biography |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve years later, Dalton was approached again to possibly replace [[Roger Moore]] in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' but the producers did not have a script and he feared being asked to do a ''Spy Who Loved Me''/''Moonraker'' type of film which &quot;Weren't my idea of Bond films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Copyright 1998-2007 |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/dalton_bond_era.php3 |title=James Bond 007 :: MI6 - The Home Of James Bond |publisher=MI6 |date= |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalton was the first actor to be offered ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' but initially had to turn it down as the original shooting date clashed with commitments on the film ''[[Brenda Starr (film)|Brenda Starr]]''. [[Pierce Brosnan]] was then cast, but when his cancelled television show ''[[Remington Steele]]'' was renewed in 1986, he was prevented from continuing.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=169}} Several actors were screen-tested, including [[Sam Neill]] and [[Lewis Collins]], before Dalton was offered a revised production date which he was able to accommodate, and as soon as he wrapped shooting on ''Brenda Starr'', Dalton found himself in the shoulder holster for ''The Living Daylights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Best known for his stage and television roles and trained in the British Shakespearean tradition, Dalton's Bond differs noticeably from his predecessors. ''[[The Guardian]]'' remarked, &quot;Dalton hasn't the natural authority of Connery nor the facile charm of Moore, but Lazenby he is not.&quot;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=178}} 

====''Licence to Kill'' (1989)====
To save on production costs and taxes, Eon decided to shoot the next Bond film, ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', in Mexico rather than at Pinewood Studios in the UK. The film's darker and more violent plot elicited calls for cuts by the British Board of Film Classification.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=169}} ''Licence to Kill'' is the first Bond film by Eon to not use the title of any Fleming novel or short story (although it uses material from the Fleming short story &quot;[[The Hildebrand Rarity]]&quot; and novel ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]''). It and subsequent Bond films were novelised. Reviews for the film were mixed. With box office admissions close to that of ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', the worst attended Bond film to date, some thought that replacing the basic style and elegance of a Bond film with realism was a mistake.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=192}}

In 1989, the same year of Dalton's second and last appearance, [[MGM/UA]] was sold to the Australian based broadcasting group [[Qintex]], which wanted to merge the company with [[PathÃ©]]. Danjaq, the Swiss based parent company of Eon, sued MGM/UA because the Bond back catalogue was being licensed to PathÃ©, who intended to broadcast the series on television in several countries worldwide without the approval of Danjaq. These legal disputes engendered a six-year hiatus in the series. Nonetheless, Eon pre-production of another film began in May 1990, for release in late 1991. Generic promotional materials for &quot;Bond 17&quot; were unveiled at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] at around the same time. A detailed story draft, widely available online and spread over 17 pages, was written by Alfonso Ruggiero Jr. and [[Michael G. Wilson]]. The [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] division were also involved in the development of the high-tech robots prominent in that early treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GoldenEye - The Road To Production | publisher=mi6-hq.com | url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/ge_roadtoproduction.php3 | date=23 June 2003 | accessdate=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the legal disputes, the production of Dalton's third film was postponed several times. In an interview in 1993, Timothy Dalton said that [[Michael France]] was writing the story for the film, which was due to begin production in January or February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Interview with Dalton |work = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 6 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It never began and, in April 1994, Dalton resigned from the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people = Michael G.

===Pierce Brosnan (1995â2002)===
To replace Dalton, the producers cast [[Pierce Brosnan]], whom they had met on the set of ''For Your Eyes Only'' when he came to visit his wife, Cassandra Harris (who had a small part as Countess Lisl von Schlaf), but had been prevented from taking over the role from [[Roger Moore]] in 1985 because of his contract for ''[[Remington Steele]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Maggie | last = Fox | title = Pierce Brosnan Is New James Bond | url = http://www.klast.net/bond/ge_news2.html | publisher = Reuters | date = 8 June 1994 | accessdate = 12 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kimberly | last = Last | title = Pierce Brosnan's Long and Winding Road To Bond | url = http://www.klast.net/bond/pb_road.html | work = GoldenEye (magazine) | year = 1995| accessdate = 12 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after ''Remington Steele'' was cancelled in 1987, Brosnan's wife was diagnosed with cancer and he cared for her until she died in 1991. In the next three years he worked only occasionally, and by 1994 he was ready to take on the Bond role. He stated his hopes for remaking Bond: &quot;I would like to see what is beneath the surface of this man, what drives him on, what makes him a killer. I think we will peel back the onion skin, as it were&quot;.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=192}} He also relished the fact that ''Goldfinger'' was the first film he had ever seen and now he would get to play Bond, &quot;Little did I think I would be playing the role someday.&quot;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=196}} Although little attention had been paid in the past to the Scottish background of Connery, Lazenby's Australian background, or the Welsh ancestry of Timothy Dalton, some British fans thought there was something odd about an Irishman playing Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/11/05/PK70865.DTL&amp;type=printable |title=Pierce Brosnan Spies A 'Golden' Opportunity / Actor finally gets his shot at playing James Bond |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=5 November 1995 |accessdate=6 January 2009 | first=Ruthe | last=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''GoldenEye'' (1995)====
The Brosnan Bond smoked cigars and he favoured Italian-made suits. More importantly, Brosnan's ''[[GoldenEye]]'' was the first film of the series to be produced since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This cast doubt over whether Bond was still relevant in the modern world, as many of the previous films pitted him against Soviet adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Comentale| first = Edward P. | coauthors = Stephen Watt, Skip Willman| title = Ian Fleming and James Bond: The Cultural Politics of 007| origdate = | origyear = | origmonth = | edition = | series = | date = | year = 2005 | publisher = Indiana University Press| location = | isbn = 978-0253345233| pages = | chapter = | ref =| oclc = 224330102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gone was state-sponsored crime, now replaced by Russian mobs and gangsters. Another major change was casting [[Judi Dench]] as M, the head of MI6, reflecting that [[MI5]]&lt;!--Do not change: Rimington was head of 5, not 6--&gt; (the British Security Service) was then headed by a woman, [[Stella Rimington]]. Actress [[Samantha Bond]] was cast as [[Miss Moneypenny]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=195}}

Some of the film industry felt that it would be futile to make a comeback for the Bond series, and that it was best left as &quot;an icon of the past&quot;.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=169}} However, when released, the film was viewed as a successful revivification that effectively adapted the series for the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=GoldenEye | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first=Todd | last=McCarthy | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904690.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | date= 16 November 1995 | accessdate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had the highest admissions since Connery's ''You Only Live Twice''. Tom Shone commented, &quot;Brosnan shares none of Connery's virtues but has also been careful to avoid Moore's vices. It doesn't give him much room for maneuver, but then maneuvering in tight corners is the one thing Brosnan is quite good at.&quot; Another critic stated, &quot;The film is located precisely on the cusp between fantasy and near reality. For the first time in a Bond film there is something that could be called emotion&quot;, whilst another wrote that: &quot;Bond is back with a bang.&quot;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=195}}{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=252}}

====''Tomorrow Never Dies'' (1997)====
After the success of ''GoldenEye'', there was pressure to recreate success in its follow-up, ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', also at [[MGM]]. The studio had recently been sold to billionaire [[Kirk Kerkorian]], who wanted the release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] said, &quot;You realise that there's a huge audience and I guess you don't want to come out with a film that's going to somehow disappoint them.&quot; The rush to complete it meant the budget spiralled to around $110 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Ashton|title=Tomorrow Never Dies|url=http://www.hmss.com/films/mgw/mgw97.html |publisher=hmss.com |year=1997 |accessdate=6 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|110|1997}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) Most of the locales were in Asia.

====''The World Is Not Enough'' (1999) and ''Die Another Day'' (2002)====
Brosnan portrayed Bond in two more films, ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999) and ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002), and a video game, ''[[Everything or Nothing]]'', before it was announced by Eon that Brosnan was no longer required as the film series was about to be rebooted and the search for a new 007 (eventually Daniel Craig) was on. Though strong in their action scenes, production values, and acting, some critics found the final two Brosnan films to be too hyperkinetic with little time to savour the characters.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=430}}

Following the success of ''GoldenEye'', Kevin McClory also attempted to remake ''Thunderball'' again as ''Warhead 2000''. [[Liam Neeson]] and Timothy Dalton were considered for 007, while [[Roland Emmerich]] and [[Dean Devlin]] were developing the film at [[Sony Pictures]]. MGM launched a $25 million lawsuit against Sony, and McClory claimed a portion of the $3 billion profits from the Bond series. Sony backed down after a prolonged lawsuit and McClory eventually ran out of legal avenues to go down. In exchange, MGM paid $10 million for the rights to ''Casino Royale'', which had come into Sony's possession after its acquisition of the companies behind ''Climax!'' years before.&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

===Daniel Craig (2006âpresent)===
[[Pierce Brosnan]] had originally signed a deal for three films, with an option for a fourth, when he was cast in the role of James Bond. This was fulfilled with the production of ''Die Another Day'' in 2002. However, at this stage Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday, and speculation began that the producers were seeking to replace him with a younger actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Brosnan too old to be 007?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-207653/Is-Brosnan-old-007.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 February 2004|accessdate=5 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brosnan kept in mind that both aficionados and critics were unhappy with Roger Moore playing the role until he was 58, but he was receiving popular support from both critics and the franchise fanbase for a fifth instalment and for this reason, he remained enthusiastic about reprising his role.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3592361.stm|title=Brosnan uncertain over more Bond|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2007|date=4 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2004, it was rumoured that negotiations had broken down between Brosnan and the producers to make way for a new and younger actor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Brosnan too old to be 007?|accessdate=22 February 2007|date=9 February 2004|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=207653&amp;in_page_id=1773 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was denied by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and Eon Productions. In July 2004, Brosnan announced that he was quitting the role, stating &quot;Bond is another lifetime, behind me&quot;; this is thought by some to be a failed negotiating ploy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eweekly&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,673018,00.html|title=Bond No More|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=22 February 2007|last=Rich|first=Joshua|date=27 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond and throughout 2004 and 2005, a number of potential new actors were speculated upon by the media, ranging from established Hollywood actors, such as [[Eric Bana]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[James Purefoy]], [[Dougray Scott]], [[Henry Cavill]], [[Goran ViÅ¡njiÄ]], [[Julian McMahon]], [[Gerard Butler]], and [[Clive Owen]], to many unknown actors from a number of different countries, including [[Sam Worthington]], [[Alex O'Loughlin]], and [[Rupert Friend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dallas &amp; Casino Royale Casting Rumors|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEgidojlcR2Njh|work=Variety|publisher=MovieWeb, Inc|date=28 September 2005| accessdate=21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point producer [[Michael G.

In May 2005, [[Daniel Craig]] announced that Sony and MGM and producers [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]] had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, but Eon Productions at that point had not yet approached him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Craig, Vaughn on Bond|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|date=3 May 2005|accessdate=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Craig stated that the producers had indeed offered him the role, but he had declined until a script was available for him to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seven's Deadly Sins|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/nov/17/jamesbond|publisher=Guardian|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=3 April 2007 | location=London | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Casino Royale'' (2006)====
[[File:Craig premiere new york.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Craig]] at the ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' American premiere in New York, November 2008]]
Bolstered by the success of [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]' rival [[Bourne (film series)|''Jason Bourne'' franchise]] (as well as [[Warner Bros.]]â [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman (film series)|Batman franchise]] with ''[[Batman Begins]]''), the decision was made at MGM and Eon to &quot;bring Bond back to his roots&quot; by eliminating the increasingly silly gadgets and outlandish fantasy elements that had begun to define the series, and introducing a tougher, darker, and more realistic Bond that was more in line with the Bond of Ian Fleming's original novels than with any of his previous screen incarnations. Thus, the 21st Bond film, ''Casino Royale'', in addition to being the first film adaptation of a Fleming novel since 1969's ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', was to be a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the franchise, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede any previous film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGN: Interview: Campbell on Casino Royale|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/659/659741p1.html|work=IGN.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|date=19 October 2005|accessdate=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This not only freed the Bond franchise from more than forty years of continuity, but allowed the film to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/entertainment/061116_bond_review.html|title=New James Bond Proves Worthy of Double-0 Status|accessdate=16 July 2007|publisher=SPACE.com|date=21 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the previous introductions of new Bonds, the film provided the opportunity to remove production excesses and to get back to basics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HNN/is_10_21/ai_n27098544/|title=Martin Campbell: Casino Royale; James Bond gets back to basics in this new installment|work=[[Post Magazine]]|date=October 2006|last=Blair|first=Iain|accessdate=15 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2005, speculation was high that the then 37-year-old Daniel Craig was being seriously considered, although full casting for the role was not actually completed until September. On 14 October 2005, Eon Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed to the public at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig, who would soon become one of the stars of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/oct/14/film.filmnews|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|title=Daniel Craig confirmed as 006th screen Bond|accessdate=15 May 2007 | location=London | date=14 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant controversy followed the decision, as it was doubted if the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period Internet campaigns such as &lt;code&gt;danielcraigisnotbond.com&lt;/code&gt; expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moono.com/news/news01533.html|title=Anti-Bond protests|publisher=Moono|accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Location2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Blond, James Blond|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/08/commentary/mediabiz/index.htm|work=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=2 April 2007 | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Mirror'' ran a front page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, ''The Name's Bland â James Bland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Name's Bland..

[[Columbia Pictures]] co-financed and distributed Craig's first two films because they bought MGM in 2005. However, MGM chose to cease the distribution deal with Columbia following the success of ''Casino Royale'' (for which Columbia provided 75% of the budget). In the agreement, Columbia chose to finance one more Bond film, ''Quantum of Solace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Claudia Eller|title=Sony braces for life without Bond|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 November 2008|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2008/11/the-enormous-fi.html|accessdate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in April 2011, a deal was finalized allowing Columbia/Sony to continue to be involved with the ''James Bond'' film series, picking up where they left off with ''Bond 23'' and ''Bond 24''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_23_sony_distribution.php3 | title= Sony Seals Deal For 007 | publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]] | accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the renewed 007 partnership, 20th Century Fox will continue to handle home video rights to the film series on behalf of MGM as Fox's output distribution deal was also renewed in April 2011.

==Non-Eon films==
[[Image:Barry Nelson.jpg|thumb|Barry Nelson as &quot;Jimmy Bond&quot; in ''Casino Royale'' (1954).]]
Prior to Eon's start in 1961, ''[[Casino Royale (Climax!)|Casino Royale]]'' was adapted as a one-hour television episode of [[CBS]]'s series ''[[Climax!]]''. The nationalities of James Bond and Felix Leiter were reversed making Bond American and Leiter British. Bond was nicknamed &quot;Card sense Jimmy Bond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/boston/Movies/27760-Casino-Royale-I/?rel=inf|title=Casino Royale|author=Gantz, Jeffrey|work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Eon's formation, only two James Bond films were produced without the company's consent, due to the production rights of two Ian Fleming novels being lost.
[[File:David niven in casino royal.jpg|thumb|David Niven, who played Sir James Bond in ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]] (1967)]]
In 1955, Ian Fleming sold the film rights of ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' to producers [[Michael Garrison (producer)|Michael Garrison]] and [[Gregory Ratoff]]. These were later sold to producer [[Charles K. Feldman]]. Feldman initially went to Broccoli and Saltzman with a proposition to produce the film; however, due to their negative experiences with [[Kevin McClory]] on ''Thunderball'' they declined. Feldman decided to start his own production and approached Connery who offered to do the film for $1 million dollars, which Feldman rejected. Since his previous film, the madcap comedy ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'', had been a success, Feldman decided to make a satirical Bond film in similar vein. Problems ensued, however, when the star, [[Peter Sellers]], walked off the project with scenes uncompleted, and script re-writes and directorial changes (the film ended up with five) caused the budget to escalate far beyond that of any Bond picture hitherto. The [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|''Casino Royale'' spoof]] was released in 1967.  The plot involves multiple impersonators of James Bond as the real one played by [[David Niven]] is now elderly. Thus [[Peter Sellers]]' character is engaged in the Casino showdown with LeChiffre as done by James Bond in Fleming's novel. [[Woody Allen]] in addition to playing an inept nephew of James Bond, called Jimmy Bond,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Ca-Chr/Casino-Royale.html|title=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers|year=2000|author=von Dassanowsky, Robert|authorlink=Robert von Dassanowsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; also did uncredited script work on the film,&lt;ref&gt;Both Allen and Peter Sellers are listed as uncredited writers of ''Casino Royale'' on the Internet Movie Database. Allen's work on the script is discussed in {{cite book |title=Woody Allen: A Biography |last=Baxter |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=114â137 |url= |accessdate=}} See also {{cite book |title=Columbia Pictures Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Films, 1928-1982 |last=Pitts  |first=Michael R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn= |page=32 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which his persona resembles that of his character in his earlier film ''What's New Pussycat''. &lt;ref&gt;The similarity between Allen's character in ''Royale'' and Allen's earlier character in ''Pussycat'' has been noted in {{cite book |title=Brooklyn is not expanding: Woody Allen's comic universe |last=Wernblad  |first=Annette  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992  |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |location= |isbn= |page=26 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When plans for a James Bond film were scrapped in the late 1950s, a story treatment entitled ''Thunderball'', written by Ian Fleming, [[Kevin McClory]] and [[Jack Whittingham]], was adapted as Fleming's [[Thunderball (novel)|ninth Bond novel]]. Initially the book was only credited to Fleming. McClory filed a lawsuit that would eventually award him the film rights to the title in 1963. Afterwards, he made a deal with [[Eon Productions]] to produce a [[film adaptation]] starring Sean Connery in 1965. The deal stipulated that McClory could not produce another adaptation until a set period of time had elapsed, and he did so in 1983 with ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', which featured Sean Connery for a seventh time as 007. The film was a worldwide box-office success, but since it was not made by Broccoli's production company, Eon Productions, it is not considered a part of the Eon film series. A second attempt by McClory to remake ''Thunderball'' in the 1990s with [[Sony Pictures]] was halted by a [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|legal dispute]] resulting in the studio abandoning its aspirations for a rival James Bond series.&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

MGM later acquired the rights for both films. ''Never Say Never Again'' (originally released by [[Warner Bros.]]) was bought from Taliafilm in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. announces acquisition of Never Say Never Again James Bond assets | publisher = MGM

==Bond spinoffs, unauthorized films and spoofs==
In 1991, Fred Wolf films produced a cartoon series producing 65 episodes of ''James Bond, Jr.''. The character is actually the nephew of James Bond, and the cartoon had episodes of villains from the film series, including Dr. No and Jaws.

The 1983 TV movie ''The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair'' brought back the characters from the Bond-inspired 1960s television series ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''. In one scene former Bond actor George Lazenby has a short cameo as a Bond-like character driving an Aston Martin with the license plate &quot;JB007&quot;.

Unauthorized appearances of James Bond include a few full-length spoofs, including an &quot;Agent 007&quot; character in the Spanish spoof film ''The Amazing Doctor G'' (1965) with a villain named Goldginger (sic), and the Norwegian spy spoof ''Goldenrock'' (1999).

Foreign films with James Bond include the Hong Kong Bruce Lee martial arts thriller ''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' (1977) (made after Bruce Lee's death), and the Indian film ''James Bond 777'' (1971). The Italian film ''[[OK Connery]]'' (1967) stars Sean Connery's younger brother, Neil Connery, in the role of the secret agent and additionally features stars from the Bond film series.

Bond is a character in several comedy shorts (some as short as 3 minutes) including ''Bondage'' (2001) ''Never a Day Younger'' (2006) and ''Shaken Not Stirred'' (2006), ''Casino Royale With Cheese'' (2007), ''Gold Is Not Enough''  (2009), and ''99 Cent Bond'' (2009).

The late-night British comedy TV series ''Mainly Millicent'' had a few James Bond spoofs in which  Roger Moore played Bond in 1964, 7 years before his being cast in the Eon series.

==Reception==
The films have been awarded two [[Academy Awards]]: for [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Effects]] (now Sound Editing) in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]) and for [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Visual Effects]] in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]). In 1982, Albert R. Broccoli received the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Academy Awards Database |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org |accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several of the songs, including [[Paul McCartney]]'s &quot;[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]&quot;, [[Carly Simon]]'s &quot;[[Nobody Does It Better]]&quot;, and [[Sheena Easton]]'s &quot;[[For Your Eyes Only (Sheena Easton song)|For Your Eyes Only]]&quot;, have been nominated for Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Original Song]].

The spy novelist [[John le CarrÃ©]] was severely critical of the character of James Bond, regarding Bond as potential traitor material. le CarrÃ© created his spy [[George Smiley]] as the antithesis of Bond. Smiley is shy, cerebral, and shabbily dressed; his spy work is mostly mundane and plodding; he gets caught up in morally ambiguous situations, and his wife is cheating on him. Both le CarrÃ©'s novel ''[[The Honourable Schoolboy]]'' and Fleming's Japan-based book ''You Only Live Twice'' have a character based on real journalist Richard Hughes.

Film critic [[Mick LaSalle]] notes many believe the older Bond films were superior to the later films, which he disagrees with, arguing many of the older films &quot;[benefit] mainly from a certain James Bond atmosphere and from a built-up sense of audience expectation&quot;. He also feels every James Bond actor was &quot;first rate&quot;. Upon re-watching all the films, LaSalle was surprised by how rough Connery's Bond was, and felt it was Moore &quot;who [brought] radiant [[narcissism]] and [an] effete quality&quot; to the character. He added &quot;Brosnan was superb [for] combining Moore's self-satisfaction with Dalton's sensitivity,&quot; while Craig became his favourite Bond by his second film for &quot;reconceiv[ing] the role for himself as a young tough guy with a lot of pain going on inside&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ask Mick LaSalle|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=5 December 2008|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/05/PK6114C535.DTL&amp;type=movies|accessdate=6 December 2008 | first=Mick | last=LaSalle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[IGN]] chose the James Bond series as the second best film franchise of all time, behind ''[[Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 25 Movie Franchises of All Time: #2 |publisher=IGN |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/752/752240p1.html |accessdate=16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Connery's version of James Bond was ranked #11 on Empire's 100 Greatest Movie Characters.

===Influence===
{{See also|James Bond parodies}}

The success of the James Bond series in the 1960s led to various spy TV series, both comical as in ''[[Get Smart]]'' or straight thriller series such as ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', and ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', the last having enjoyed contributions by Fleming towards its creation.  There was also an increase in the market for spy films such as the [[Harry Palmer]] films which starred [[Michael Caine]].

Bond has also received many homages and parodies in popular media. Especially notable is the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' series by writer, producer and comedian [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] as many characters in it are parodies of specific characters in the Bond films. Other notable parodies include ''[[Spy Hard]]'' (1996), ''[[Johnny English]]'' (2003), ''[[Bons baisers de Hong Kong]]'', ''[[OK Connery]]'', ''[[Undercover Brother]]'' (2002), the films ''[[Our Man Flint]]'' and ''[[In Like Flint]]'' starring [[James Coburn]] as Derek Flint, and the &quot;[[Matt Helm]]&quot; films starring [[Dean Martin]].{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=97}}

Eon productions or MGM have been known to file suit in one form or another if they think the copying of Bond is too close. A suit against the producers of [[Austin Powers in Goldmember|the third ''Austin Powers'' film]] ended in a settlement in which the distributors of the latter agreed to show a trailer of the forthcoming Bond film in cinemas prior to their film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/12/austin.powers.movie/index.html?related|title=Goldmember' approved as Austin Powers title|date=12 April 2002|first=Rachel|last=Wells|publisher=CNN|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A season 4 episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' entitled ''[[Our Man Bashir]]'' featured a virtual-reality game on the [[holodeck]] with multiple James Bond references in sufficient amount to raise the ire of MGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|author=Erdmann, Terry J.; Block, Paula M.|publisher=Pocket Books|date=1 August 2000| isbn=0671501062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Lucas]] has said on various occasions that Sean Connery's portrayal of Bond was one of the primary inspirations for the [[Indiana Jones]] character, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana's [[Henry Jones, Sr.|father]] in the third film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/08/28/indiana_jones_was_supposed_to_be_like_ja |title=Bond Inspiration For Indiana Jones |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=28 August 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fleurier |first= Nicolas |year= 2006 |title= James Bond &amp; Indiana Jones.

==DVD releases==
''GoldenEye'' and ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' were the first in the series to be released on [[DVD]] in 1998. Following ''The World Is Not Enough'' on 22 May 2000, the series proper was issued chronologically in single disc &quot;special editions&quot; over the next ten months until 26 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=3294 |title=Bond Release Dates |publisher=DVD Times |date=27 April 2000 |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, three boxed sets with the films up to ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,279414,00.html|title=TOP 10 BOXED SETS |work=Entertainment Weekly|date=19 January 2001|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, following the DVD release of ''Die Another Day'', all films were available in both a twenty-film case or three box sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=XXXSETBOND02V1 James Bond 7-Pack Giftset], [http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=XXXSETBOND03V2 James Bond 007 DVD Gift Set (Volume 2)] and [http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=XXXSETBOND03V3 (Volume 3)]. MGM.com. Retrieved 15 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the entire series was re-released in &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; two-disc sets that featured frame-by-frame digitally restored picture by [[Lowry Digital]] and remixed [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=61675 |title=James Bond Ultimate Editions in July |publisher=DVD Times |date= |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2007 these editions were released in four non-chronological boxed sets, each containing five titles. They were eventually combined in an &quot;ultimate collector's set&quot; that included the two-disc widescreen edition of ''Casino Royale''.  They also saw single-disc releases which were essentially &quot;disc one&quot; of the &quot;Ultimate Editions&quot;.

On 20 October 2008, to tie in with the cinema debut of ''Quantum of Solace'', six non-consecutive titles in the series were released on [[Blu-ray Disc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=68070 |title=James Bond on UK Blu-ray in October |publisher=DVD Times |date= |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a special edition re-release of ''Casino Royale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=68684 |title=Casino Royale Deluxe Edition in October |publisher=DVD Times |date= |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, 2009, both a third pack with three other films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/946/946342p1.html|title=More Blu Bond|publisher=IGN|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Quantum of Solace'' were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/918/918145p1.html|title=007's Solace Gets Dated|publisher=IGN|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Never Say Never Again'' was also released in this format.&lt;ref name=blu&gt;{{cite web|title=Never Say Never Yet Again|url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/946/946721p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=31 August 2011|date=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video game adaptations==
{{Main|James Bond video games}}
James Bond has starred in many [[video game]]s, with a few being direct adaptations of the films. Between 1985 and 1990, [[Mindscape (software publisher)|Mindscape]] made [[text adventure]] versions of ''Goldfinger'' and ''A View to a Kill'', and [[Domark]] produced [[side scrolling]] [[shooter game]]s based on ''[[Licence to Kill (video game)|Licence to Kill]]'', ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (video game)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', ''[[The Living Daylights (video game)|The Living Daylights]]'', ''[[Live and Let Die (video game)|Live and Let Die]]'' and ''[[A View to a Kill (video game)|A View to a Kill]]''.

The popularity of the James Bond video game did not really take off, however, until 1997's ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', a [[Nintendo 64]] [[first-person shooter]] developed by [[Rare Ltd.|Rare]] based on ''GoldenEye'', along with additional and extended missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollis-speech&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Hollis | first=Martin | authorlink=Martin Hollis|date=2 September 2004 | url=http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2004-09-02.php | title=The Making of GoldenEye 007 | publisher=Zoonami | accessdate=13 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received the [[BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards|BAFTA Interactive Entertainment]] &quot;Games Award&quot; and is widely considered one of the best games ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=100 Greatest Games Of All Time | journal=Computer and Video Games | year=2000 | month=January | issue=218|pages=53â67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060214100207/http://www.bafta.org/site/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/import/Interactive_Awards_Winners_1998-2005.pdf|archivedate=14 February 2006|url=http://www.bafta.org/site/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/import/Interactive_Awards_Winners_1998-2005.pdf | title=BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards | format=PDF | page=1 | publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts | accessdate=13 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electronic Arts]] released two tie-in games, the [[third-person shooter]] ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (video game)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997, [[PlayStation]]) and the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[The World Is Not Enough (video game)|The World Is Not Enough]]'' (2000, PlayStation, N64 and [[Game Boy Color]]) before starting original games, such as ''[[Agent Under Fire]]'' (2001, [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]] and [[GameCube]]) and ''[[Nightfire]]'' (2002, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Macintosh]] and [[Game Boy Advance]]), which were the most similar games to the style of ''GoldenEye'', and ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' (2004, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and [[Nintendo DS]]), which bears no relation to the film ''GoldenEye'', nor the game of the same title. EA also released ''[[Everything or Nothing]]'' (2004, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance), a third-person shooter starring Pierce Brosnan in his fifth and final appearance as 007. The success of this game led to a follow-up based on ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'' (2005, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and [[PlayStation Portable]]), which even included Sean Connery's likeness and voice acting.

After EA, [[Activision]] got the rights to games based on the Bond franchise, and has since released two titles based on films: 2008's ''[[Quantum of Solace (video game)|Quantum of Solace]]'', based on both the eponymous film and ''Casino Royale'', and 2010's ''[[GoldenEye 007 (2010 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', a remake of the critically acclaimed 1997 game, which updates the plot of ''GoldenEye'' to a contemporary setting and features the voice and likeness of current Bond actor [[Daniel Craig]].

==Broadcast television airings==

In the UK, Bond films became a staple of ITV's public holiday television. They have also been frequently shown as full runs in chronological order, especially prior to the premiere of the latest offering. The 1980 premiere broadcast of ''Live and Let Die'' holds the record for the most watched film of all time on British television, with an audience of 23.50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrie.net/chat/ratucs/press/top100.html |title=TV's jewels fail to shine in list of all-time winners |publisher=Corrie.net |date=7 February 1998 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1972 in television|1972]], [[The ABC Sunday Night Movie|ABC]] bought the broadcasting rights to the James Bond franchise;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shatterhand007.com/ABCArticle/TheABCsoftheOO7Films.html |title=The ABCs of the James Bond Films |publisher=Shatterhand007.com |date=17 September 1972 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critcononline.com/abc_tv_bond_films.htm |title=Butchered James Bond Films Shown On Abc Tv |publisher=Critcononline.com |date= |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commanderbond.net/article/6 |title=ABC To Show 13 Bond Films |publisher=Commanderbond.net |date= |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; this continued until [[1990 in television|1990]], when ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' was the final film aired prior to [[TBS (TV network)|Turner Broadcasting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.tbs.com/about_us/PR/90s.htm |title=November 1990 |publisher=Static.tbs.com |date= |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; buying the TV airing rights (with TBS airing them under the ''15 Days of 007''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knight-Ridder |url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/120498/UK2262.shtml |title=TBS to kick off '15 Days of 007' |publisher=Lubbockonline.com |date=4 December 1998 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; umbrella). The Bond films have also aired on several cable channels not owned by Turner. ABC broadcast the films again as a promotional tie-in when ''[[Die Another Day]]'' was in cinemas in 2002, dubbed as ''The Bond Picture Show'' on Saturday nights.
