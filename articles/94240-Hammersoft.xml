'''Long Beach''' is a city situated in [[Los Angeles County]] in [[Southern California]], on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of the United States. The city is the [[List of United States cities by population|36th-largest]] city in the [[United States|nation]] and the [[List of cities in California (by population)|seventh-largest]] in [[California]]. As of 2010, its population was 462,257. In addition, Long Beach is the second largest city within [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Greater Los Angeles]] and a principal city of the [[Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana metropolitan area]].

The city is a dominant [[sea|maritime]] center of the United States and was recently named &quot;Aquatic Capital of the Nation.&quot; It wields substantial influence critical to the [[Economic globalization|global economy]]. The [[Port of Long Beach]] is the United States' second busiest container port and one of the world's largest shipping ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polb.com/about/default.asp | title=About the Port | work=Port of Long Beach website }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also maintains a large oil industry with the substance being found both underground and offshore. Manufacturing sectors include those in aircraft, car parts, electronic and audiovisual equipment, and home furnishings. It is also home to headquarters for corporations including Epson America, [[Molina Healthcare]], and [[SCAN Health Plan]]. Long Beach has grown with the development of high-technology and aerospace industries in the area. 

Long Beach is located about {{convert|20|mi|km|0|sp=us}} south of downtown [[Los Angeles]] and {{convert|105|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north of [[San Diego]]. Long Beach borders [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] on its southeast edge and other [[Gateway Cities]] to the west and north. 

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2007}}
[[Native Americans in the United States|Indigenous peoples]] have lived in coastal southern California for at least ten thousand years. Over the centuries, several successive cultures inhabited the present-day area of Long Beach. By the time Spanish explorers arrived in the sixteenth century, the dominant group were the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] people. They had at least three major settlements within the present-day city boundaries. ''Tevaaxa'anga'' was an inland settlement near the [[Los Angeles River]], while ''Ahwaanga''  and ''[[Puvunga|Povuu'nga]]'' were coastal villages. Along with other Tongva villages, they were forced to relocate in the mid-19th century due to missionization, political change, and a drastic drop in population from exposure to European diseases.&lt;ref name=tfa&gt;{{Cite book  | last = McCawley | first = William | title=The First Angelinos: The Gabrielino Indians of Los Angeles  | origyear = 1952  | edition = Paperback | year=1996 | publisher=Malki Museum Press/Ballena Press | isbn=0965101606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784 the [[Spanish Empire]]'s, [[King Carlos III]] granted [[Rancho Los Nietos]] to the Spanish soldier, [[Manuel Nieto]].  The [[Rancho Los Cerritos]] and [[Rancho Los Alamitos]] were divided from this territory. The boundary between the two ranchos ran through the center of Signal Hill on a southwest to northeast diagonal. A portion of western Long Beach was originally part of the [[Rancho San Pedro]]. Its boundaries were in dispute for years, due to flooding changing the Los Angeles River boundary, between the ranchos of [[Manuel Dominguez#Juan Jose Dominguez|Juan Jose Dominguez]] and Manuel Nieto.

In 1843 [[Jonathan Temple]] bought Rancho Los Cerritos, after arriving in California in 1827 from New England. He built what is now known as the &quot;[[Los Cerritos Ranch House]]&quot;, an [[adobe]] which still stands and is a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Temple created a thriving cattle ranch and prospered, becoming the wealthiest man in Los Angeles County. Both Temple and his ranch house played important local roles in the [[Mexican-American War]]. On an island in the [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], [[Mormons|Mormon]] pioneers made an abortive attempt to establish a colony (as part of [[Brigham Young]]'s plan to establish a continuous chain of settlements from the Pacific to [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake]]).

[[Image:Long Beach Pier 1905.png|thumb|Long Beach pier, 1905]]

In 1866 Temple sold Rancho Los Cerritos for $20,000 to the Northern California sheep-raising firm of Flint, Bixby &amp; Co, which consisted of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint and their cousin [[Llewellyn Bixby|Lewellyn Bixby]]. Two years previous Flint, Bixby &amp; Co had also purchased along with Northern California associate [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine]], three ranchos which would later become the city that bears Irvine's name. To manage Rancho Los Cerritos, the company selected Lewellyn's brother [[Jotham Bixby]], the &quot;Father of Long Beach&quot;. Three years later Bixby bought into the property and would later form the Bixby Land Company. In the 1870s as many as 30,000 sheep were kept at the ranch and sheared twice yearly to provide wool for trade. In 1880, Bixby sold {{convert|4,000|acre|km2}} of the Rancho Los Cerritos to William E. Willmore, who subdivided it in hopes of creating a farm community, Willmore City. He failed and was bought out by a Los Angeles syndicate that called itself the &quot;Long Beach Land and Water Company.&quot; They changed the name of the community to Long Beach, which was incorporated as a city in 1888.

[[Image:LongBeach-1907.jpg|thumb|Long Beach boardwalk, 1907]]

Another Bixby cousin, [[John W. Bixby]], was influential in the city.  After first working for his cousins at Los Cerritos, J.W. Bixby leased land at [[Rancho Los Alamitos]].  He put together a group: banker [[Isaias W. Hellman|I.W. Hellman]], Lewellyn and Jotham Bixby, and him, to purchase the rancho.  In addition to bringing innovative farming methods to the Alamitos (which under [[Abel Stearns]] in the late 1850s and early 1860s was once the largest cattle ranch in the US), J.W. Bixby began the development of the oceanfront property near the city's picturesque bluffs. Under the name Alamitos Land Company, J.W. Bixby named the streets and laid out the parks of his new city.  This area would include Belmont Heights, Belmont Shore and Naples; it soon became a thriving community of its own. J.W. Bixby died in 1888 of apparent [[appendicitis]].  The Rancho Los Alamitos property was split up, with Hellman getting the southern third, Jotham and Lewellyn the northern third, and J.W. Bixby's widow and heirs keeping the central third.  The Alamitos townsite was kept as a separate entity, but it was basically run by Lewellyn and Jotham's Bixby Land Company.

When Jotham Bixby died in 1916, the remaining {{convert|3,500|acre|km2}} of Rancho Los Cerritos was subdivided into the neighborhoods of [[Bixby Knolls]], California Heights, North Long Beach and part of the city of [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]].

[[Image:LongBeach-oilfield-1920.jpg|left|thumb|Oil field in Long Beach, 1920]]

The town grew as a [[seaside resort]] with light agricultural uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.longbeachgrows.org/LongBeachGrows/Long_Beachs_Agricultural_Past.html
| title = Long Beach's Agricultural Past: A Brief Summary of Long Beach's Ag History}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Pike]] was the most famous beachside amusement zone on the West Coast from 1902 until 1969, it offered bathers food, games and rides, such at the '''Dual Ferris Wheel'' and '''Cyclone Racer''' roller coaster.  Gradually the oil industry, Navy shipyard and facilities and port became the mainstays of the city.  In the 1950s it was referred to as &quot;Iowa by the sea,&quot; due to a large influx of people from that and other [[Midwest]]ern states. Huge picnics for migrants from each state were a popular annual event in Long Beach until the 1960s.

Oil was discovered in 1921 on Signal Hill, which split off as a separate incorporated city shortly afterward.  The discovery of the [[Long Beach Oil Field]], brought in by the [[oil gusher|gusher]] at the Alamitos No. 1 well, made Long Beach a major oil producer; in the 1920s the field was the most productive in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMS&quot;&gt;Schmitt, R.

The [[Long Beach earthquake of 1933]] was a magnitude 6.3 earthquake that caused significant damage to the city and surrounding areas, killing a total of 120 people. Most of the damage occurred in [[unreinforced masonry building]]s, especially schools. [[Pacific Bible Seminary]] (now known as [[Hope International University]]) was forced to move classes out of First Christian Church of Long Beach and into a small local home due to damage from the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.hiu.edu/pbs/pbs.htm &quot;Pacific Bible Seminary&quot;, Digital Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:LongBeachFord.jpg|thumb|The new Ford assembly plant in Long Beach, 1930]] [[File:First Christian Church of Long Beach.JPG|thumb|200px|First Christian Church of Long Beach was the site of [[Pacific Bible Seminary]] (now called [[Hope International University]]) in the early 1930s|left]] 

The city was the site of &quot;The Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942&quot; during [[World War II]], when observers for the Army Air Corps reported shells being fired from the sea.  Anti-aircraft batteries fired into the night sky, although no planes were ever sighted.

Before the war, Long Beach had a sizable Japanese-American population, who worked in the fish canneries on [[Terminal Island]] and owned small truck (produce) farms in the area.  Due to exaggerated fears on the coast and racial prejudice, state officials persuaded the national government to remove Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans for [[Japanese American Internment|internment]] in 1942 to inland facilities.  Most did not return to the city after their release from the camps.  Due to this and other factors, Japanese Americans now make up less than 1% of the population of Long Beach, but the Japanese Community Center and a Japanese Buddhist Church survive.  The Japanese-American Cultural Center is located over the Gerald Desmond Bridge and the [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]] in [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]].

The nonprofit [[Aquarium of the Pacific]], located in downtown Long Beach, opened to the public in 1998.  It has become a major attraction visited by more than 13 million people since its opening. The Aquarium was rated #2 Los Angeles area Family Destination in the most recent ''Zagat U.S. Family Travel Guide'', second only to [[Disneyland]]. The Aquariumâs architecture is inspired by the breaking waves of the Pacific. Kajima International was the developer of the Aquarium of the Pacific and architects included the Los Angeles office of [[Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassanbaum]] and Esherick Homsey Dodge and Davis of San Francisco. The Aquarium of the Pacific recently made history as the first in the museum, zoo, or aquarium industry to become a Climate Action Leader for voluntarily measuring, certifying, and reporting its green house gas emissions to the Climate Action Registry and the public.

===Neighborhoods===
Long Beach is composed of many different neighborhoods, which are variously defined and delineated by residents and the local media. However, the names and boundaries of neighborhoods themselves are not officially recognized by the City, with limited exceptions for statutory purposes (the City does, however, recognize neighborhood ''advocacy groups'' representing some of these neighborhoods or portions thereof). Some neighborhoods are named after thoroughfares, while others are named for nearby parks, schools, or city features. They include (alphabetically):

==Geography==
[[Image:Long Beach CA Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Long Beach, California: '''Skyline Photo''']]
Long Beach is located at 33Â°47' North, 118Â°10' West, about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} south of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|51.437|sqmi|km2|1}}, with {{convert|50.293|sqmi|km2|1}} of its area being land and {{convert|1.144|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.22%) is water. Long Beach completely surrounds the city of [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]].


===Climate===
Long Beach, depending on the reporting location, has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with strongly [[semi-arid climate]] characteristics. Due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, temperatures in Long Beach are moderate throughout the year. Temperatures recorded at the weather station at the [[Long Beach Airport]], {{convert|4.0|mi|km}} inland from the ocean, range more greatly than those along the immediate coast. During the summer months, low clouds and fog occur frequently, developing overnight and blanketing the area on many mornings. This fog usually clears by the afternoon, and a westerly sea breeze often develops, keeping temperatures mild. Heat and humidity rarely coincide, making heat waves more tolerable than they would be otherwise.

Long Beach's geographic location directly east of the  [[Palos Verdes]] Peninsula, paired with its mostly south-facing coastline, results in the community having significantly different weather patterns than coastal communities to the north and south. The 1200' Palos Verdes hills block east to west airflow and, with it, a significant amount of the coastal moisture that marks other Los Angeles County coastal cities, such as [[Manhattan Beach]] and [[Santa Monica]].

As in most locations in southern California, rainfall occurs largely during the winter months. Storms can bring heavy rainfall, but Long Beach receives less precipitation than locations adjacent to the [[San Gabriel Mountains|San Gabriel]] or [[San Bernardino Mountains|San Bernardino]] mountains further inland, whose rainfall is enhanced by [[orographic lift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Pollution====
Long Beach suffers from some of the worst air pollution in southern California and the United States. Most of the city is in close proximity to the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the prevailing westerly-to-west-south-westerly winds bring a large portion of the twin ports' air pollution directly into Long Beach before dispersing it northward then eastward over [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], [[Covina, California|Covina]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], and [[Riverside, California|Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbds.info/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=2437| title=City of Long Beach General plan, Air Quality Element | work= City of Long Beach website| accessdate=2011-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy pollution sources at the ports include the ships themselves, which burn high-sulfur, high-soot-producing [[fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker fuel]] to maintain internal electrical power while docked, as well as heavy diesel pollution from [[drayage]] trucks at the ports, and short-haul tractor-trailer trucks ferrying cargo from the ports to inland warehousing, rail yards, and shipping centers. Long-term average levels of toxic air pollutants (and the corresponding [[carcinogenic]] risk they create) can be two to three times higher in and around Long Beach, and in downwind areas to the east, than in other parts of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]], such as the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]], [[San Fernando Valley]], or [[San Gabriel Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aqmd.gov/prdas/matesIII/matesIII.html| title=Multiple Airborne Toxics Exposure Study (MATES III) | work= South Coast Air Quality Management District website| accessdate=2011-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The smell of burning bunker fuel, which has an odor similar to a car burning motor oil, is not uncommon in downtown Long Beach and other port-adjacent areas.

Additionally, the Long Beach area is directly downwind of several of the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] [[oil refineries]]. Any refinery process or [[upset (chemical release)|upset]] that results in the atmospheric release of refinery by-products (commonly [[sulfur dioxide]]) will usually impact air in Long Beach. Air quality events where large portions of the City are affected by strong-smelling refinery gas releases occur several times a year, although they largely go unreported. 

Similarly, the water quality in the Long Beach portion of [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], which is enclosed by the [[San Pedro Breakwater|Federal Breakwater]], commonly ranks among the poorest on the West Coast. Many Long Beach beaches average a D or F grade on beach water quality in the ''Beach Report Card'' published by [[Heal the Bay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heal the Bay&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://brc.healthebay.org/?st=CA&amp;f=1&amp;tabid=2| title=Beach Report Card for California | work= Heal the Bay website| accessdate=2011-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Angeles River]] discharges directly into the Long Beach side of San Pedro Bay, and conveys a large portion of all the [[urban runoff]] from the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area directly into the harbor water. This runoff contains most of the debris, garbage, chemical pollutants, and biological pathogens that are washed into storm drains in every upstream city each time it rains. Because the breakwater prevents normal [[Tide#Current|tidal flushing]] and [[wave action]], these pollutants build up in the harbor. The water enclosed by the breakwater, along most of the City's beaches, can be subject to [[red tides]] due to this stagnation as well. Because of these factors, the water in Long Beach often is unsafe for swimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heal the Bay&quot; /&gt;

====Ecology====
[[Image:LongBeachLongView.jpg|thumb|View of Long Beach]]

The area that is now Long Beach historically included several ecological communities, with coastal scrub dominating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/biogeodata/cwhr/wildlife_habitats.asp | title=Wildlife Habitats | work=[[California Department of Fish and Game]] website | accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of the native plants of the region can still be found in the city. These include California buckwheat (''[[Eriogonum fasciculatum]]''), California sagebrush (''[[Artemisia californica]]''), and California poppy (''[[Eschscholzia californica]]''). Some stands of coast live oak (''[[Quercus agrifolia]]'') still remain in the El Dorado Nature Center.  California fan palm (''[[Washingtonia filifera]]''), a plant that is native further inland, was introduced to the city as a garden ornamental and is now naturalized. Some indigenous species of birds, mammals, and other wildlife have adapted to development.

Since the arrival of Europeans, many alien species have become naturalized in the area. Introduced plants include yellow mustard, [[eucalyptus]], [[wild radish]], and [[Salsola|tumbleweed]].  Such plants now far outnumber the indigenous plants and spread rapidly in the city's vacant lots and oil fields.

The city and its residents have initiatives underway to preserve and reclaim a small part of its ecological heritage. The RiverLink project has begun to revegetate the Long Beach stretch of the [[Los Angeles River]] with indigenous plants. Part of the remaining [[Pacific Electric Railway|Pacific Electric]] right-of-way was cleared of nonnatives, planted with indigenous plants, and made accessible with foot and bike paths. This community open space is now known as [[Long Beach Green Belt path|The Long Beach Greenbelt]] and is the focus of continuing efforts in restoration and community education.

The El Dorado Nature Center has changed its original &quot;hands-off&quot; approach and begun to actively introduce indigenous species.&lt;ref name=ednc&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.longbeach.gov/park/facilities/parks/el_dorado_nature_center.asp | title=El Dorado Nature Center | work=City of Long Beach website | accessdate=2008-02-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080223081256/http://www.longbeach.gov/park/facilities/parks/el_dorado_nature_center.asp |archivedate = February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Cerritos Wetlands]] Study Group, state government agencies, and grassroots groups are collaborating  on a plan to preserve Long Beach's last remaining [[Los Cerritos Wetlands|wetlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=33.7565,-118.104&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.756886,-118.103993&amp;spn=0.008385,0.014462&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr Overhead view of [[Los Cerritos Wetlands]].]&lt;/ref&gt; Long Beach is the first city in California to join the 'EcoZone' Program, intended to measurably improve environmental conditions through public-private partnerships. Such projects seek to reduce pollution, restore native habitat, and provide green areas for the city's residents to enjoy.

Other places in Long Beach to see natural areas include Bluff Park (coastal bluffs), the Golden Shores Marine Reserve, the Jack Dunster Marine Reserve, Shoreline Park, and DeForest Park.

===2000===
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 461,522 people, 163,088 households, and 99,646 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 9,149.8 inhabitants per square mile (3,532.8/kmÂ²). There were 171,632 housing units at an average density of 3,402.6 per square mile (1,313.8/kmÂ²). The racial makeup of the city was 45.2% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 14.9% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.8% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 12.1% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 1.2% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 20.6% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 5.3% from two or more races. [[Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 35.8% of the population.

The city has changed since the 1950s, when its population was predominantly European-American and the city was nicknamed &quot;Iowa by the Sea&quot; or &quot;Iowa under Palm Trees&quot; as it had a slower pace than that of neighboring Los Angeles. Since the second half of the 20th century, the city has been a major port of entry for Asian and Latin American immigrants headed to Los Angeles. The Harbor section of downtown Long Beach was once home to people of [[Dutch American|Dutch]], [[Greek American|Greek]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Maltese American|Maltese]], [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish American|Spanish]] ancestry, most of them employed in manufacturing and fish canneries until the 1960s.

According to a report by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2000, Long Beach is the most ethnically diverse large city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/22/AR2007012201143_2.html | title=Long Beach Awaits Hate-Crime Verdict | work=Washington Post website | first=Sonya | last=Geis | date=January 23, 2007 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Hispanic White Americans made up 30.0% of the city's population. Its Asian community includes the largest [[Cambodian American|Cambodian]] community in the United States, and the second-largest Cambodian community outside of Asia (after [[Paris]]).  A neighborhood along Anaheim Street is called &quot;[[Little Phnom Penh]]&quot;. There are also sizable populations of immigrants and descendants from [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]].

Long Beach had offered many industrial jobs to African Americans during the years of [[World War II]].  This resulted in the increase of blacks in Long Beach caused by the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]]. There are black communities in the Eastside and North Long Beach neighborhoods.

It has a relatively high proportion of Pacific Islanders (over 1% as of the 2000 Census), from [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]]. Most [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], about 0.8% of the city's population, arrived during the [[Department of Interior]]'s [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] urban relocation programs in the 1950s.

Long Beach once had a sizable [[Japanese American]] population, which largely worked in the fish canneries on [[Terminal Island]] and on small truck farms in the area. In 1942, not long after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and subsequent [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and Britain]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued United States Executive Order 9066 which allowed military commanders to designate areas &quot;from which any or all persons may be excluded.&quot; Under this order, all Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry were [[Japanese American internment|categorically removed from Western coastal regions]] and sent to [[internment camp]]s, without regard for [[due process]]. Most did not return to Long Beach after their release from the camps. Japanese Americans make up less than 1% of the population of Long Beach, yet the city still has a Japanese Community Center and a Japanese Buddhist Church from its earlier history.

As of the 2000 census, there were 163,088 households out of which 35.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.2% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 16.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.9% were non-families. 29.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.55.

In the city the population was spread out with 29.2% under the age of 18, 10.9% from 18 to 24, 32.9% from 25 to 44, 18.0% from 45 to 64, and 9.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 96.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $37,270, and the median income for a family was $40,002. Males had a median income of $36,807 versus $31,975 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $19,040. About 19.3% of families and 22.8% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 32.7% of those under age 18 and 11.0% of those age 65 or over.  In 2008, the Census Bureau showed the number of people living below the poverty line had dropped to 18.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Meeks | first =Karen Robes | coauthors = | title =Poverty rate in L.B. falls to 18.2%

===Ports and freight===
[[Image:POLB.jpg|thumb|North-west facing view of the harbor and port at dusk]]
As of 2005, the [[Port of Long Beach]] was the second busiest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aapa-ports.org/files/Statistics/2005_NORTH_AMERICAN_CONTAINER_TRAFFIC.pdf | title=2005 North American Contain Traffic | work=AAPA website |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[port#Major ports|seaport in the United States]] and the tenth busiest in the world,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} shipping some 66 million metric tons of cargo worth $95 billion in 2001. The port serves shipping between the United States and the [[Pacific Rim]]. The combined operations of the Port of Long Beach and the [[Port of Los Angeles]] are the busiest in the USA.
&lt;!-- and by 2004 the two ports had become the third busiest port in the world, behind Hong Kong and Singapore - source? Conflicts with data given in [[port]]. --&gt;

Rail shipping is provided by [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and [[BNSF Railway]], which carry about half of the trans-shipments from the port. Long Beach has contributed to the [[Alameda Corridor]] project to increase the capacity of the rail lines, roads, and highways connecting the port to the Los Angeles rail hub. The project, completed in 2002, created a trench {{Convert|20|mi|km|0}} long and {{Convert|33|ft|m|0}} deep in order to eliminate 200&amp;nbsp;[[grade crossing]]s and cost about US$2.4&amp;nbsp;billion.

===Airports===
{{Main|Long Beach Airport}}
Long Beach Airport serves the Long Beach, [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and northern [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] areas, but is relatively small, considering the area's population. It is the West Coast hub for [[JetBlue Airways]]. It is also the site of a major [[Boeing]] (formerly Douglas, then [[McDonnell Douglas]]) aircraft production facility, which is the city's largest non-government employer. [[Los Angeles International Airport]] is the nearest airport with international service. [[John Wayne Airport]] in [[Santa Ana, California]] is another alternative to the airport. However, its only international services are to [[Canada]]. Other airports with scheduled service are [[Bob Hope Airport]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[LA/Ontario International Airport]] in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]].

===Freeways and highways===

Several [[freeway]]s run through Long Beach, connecting it with the [[Greater Los Angeles area|greater Los Angeles]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] areas. The [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway (I-405)]] bisects the northern and southern portions of the city and takes commuters northwest or southeast to the [[Interstate 5 (California)|Golden State/Santa Ana Freeways (I-5)]]. The San Diego Freeway also provides regional access to Long Beach Airport, which is located on the north side of the freeway near [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]].  The [[Interstate 710 (California)|Long Beach Freeway (I-710)]] runs north-south on the city's western border, with its southern terminus adjacent to the [[Port of Long Beach]] on [[Terminal Island]] at the intersection of the [[California State Route 103|Terminal Island Freeway (SR 103)]] and [[California State Route 47|State Route 47]].  The Long Beach Freeway is the major spur route serving Long Beach from Downtown Los Angeles, with its northern terminus near Downtown Los Angeles in [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]].  Along with the [[Interstate 110 (California)|Harbor Freeway (I-110)]] to the west, the Long Beach Freeway is one of the major routes for trucks transporting goods from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to railyards and [[distribution center]]s in Downtown Los Angeles and the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]].  The southern end of the Long Beach Freeway joins Long Beach with Terminal Island via the [[Gerald Desmond Bridge]].

Southeast Long Beach is served by the [[Interstate 605 (California)|San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605)]], which joins the San Diego Freeway at the Long Beach/[[Los Alamitos, California|Los Alamitos]] border. The [[California State Route 91|Artesia Freeway (SR 91)]] runs east-west near the northern border of Long Beach.  The western portion of the [[California State Route 22|Garden Grove Freeway (SR 22)]] provides a spur off of the San Diego and 605 Freeways to 7th Street in southeast Long Beach for access to the [[Veterans Health Administration|VA Hospital]], [[California State University, Long Beach]], and Alamitos Bay.

[[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1)]] takes an east to southwest route through the southern portion of Long Beach.  Its intersection with [[California State Route 19|Lakewood Bouelvard (SR 19)]] and Los Coyotes Diagonal is the [[Traffic Circle, Long Beach, California|Los Alamitos Traffic Circle]].

===Bike paths===
The City of Long Beach's vision is to be the most bicycle-friendly urban city in the nation. The City of Long Beach has five major Class 1 bike paths (separate off road bike paths) within its boundaries, encompassing over {{convert|60|mi|km}}. The City also has many Class 2 (painted lanes on roadway) and Class 3 paths (connecting bike routes with shared use of road with cars). The {{convert|3.1|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Long Beach bicycle path|Shoreline Pedestrian Bikepath]] runs along the ocean from Shoreline Village to Belmont Shore.  The southern terminus of the [[L.A. River bicycle path]] is located in southwest Long Beach between Downtown and the Port.  The southern terminus of the [[San Gabriel River bicycle path]] is located just east of Long Beach in [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]], and the trail runs north through the [[El Dorado Park, Long Beach, California|El Dorado Park]] neighborhood in east Long Beach and adjacent to El Dorado Regional Park.

The city's  green lane project in Belmont Shore (sharrows, bike boxes) earned an award from the Institute of Transportation Engineers for best innovative project of the year (2010). In an effort to provide sustainable transportation alternatives to the community, as well as a safe route to several neighborhood schools, the City of Long Beach is also installing a âbike boulevardâ on Vista Street, extending from Temple Avenue to Nieto Avenue.

In April of 2011, new separated bikeways were added to two streets in downtown Long Beach along Broadway and 3rd Street â between Alamitos Ave. and Golden Ave. These are one way streets with two lanes of through traffic, one parking lane and a protected bikeway. Bike signals are installed at intersections to control safe crossing of cyclists in the separated lanes and regulate motor vehicle left turns across the bikeway. 

New bikeway signs can be found throughout Long Beach to identify designated bike routes and provide wayfinding information for cyclists. Generally you will find even numbers assigned to east/west routes; odd numbers assigned to north/south routes; and route numbers increasing as they progress from south to north. The signage was funded through a grant provided by Metro, and they include new route numbers that have been assigned to all bike paths, bike lanes and bike routes that correspond to the Cityâs new bike map. Complete maps of the city's bike-friendly roadways can be found at http://bikelongbeach.org/Maps/Default.aspx.

===Walkability===

A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Long Beach the eleventh most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |accessdate=Aug 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
Balboa Amusement Producing Company, also known as Balboa Studios, was located at Sixth Street and Alamitos Avenue; they used {{convert|11|acre|m2|-3}} on [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]] for outdoor locations. [[Silent film]] stars who lived in Long Beach included [[Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Theda Bara]]. The 1917 film ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'', starring Theda Bara, was filmed at the Dominguez Slough just west of Long Beach, and Moses parted the Red Sea for [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s 1923 version of ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' on the flat seashore of [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]], southeast of Long Beach. Long Beach was the famous location of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] [[newsreel]] footage of the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]], out-takes from the [[W.C. Fields]] featurette [[International House (1933 film)]] was possibly the first earthquake to be captured in action on film.

Because of its proximity to LA-area studios and its variety of locations, today Long Beach is regularly used for movies, television shows, and advertisements. The city has filled in for locations across the nation and around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filmlongbeach.com/ | title=City of Long Beach Special Events }}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage for Long Beach is that the film industry uses a zone that extends {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} from Beverly Blvd. and La Cienega Blvd. in the West Hollywood area. It is cheaper to film within that zone, so Long Beach and other South Bay cities often stand in for areas of Orange County (such as for ''[[The O.C.]]'' TV show&lt;ref name=&quot;OC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/OC/ByLocation.shtml | title=The O.C. Filming Locations }}&lt;/ref&gt;) because almost all of Orange County is outside of the zone.

One of the most famous Long Beach movie locations is the home of Ferris Bueller in ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. Though the film was set in the North Shore suburbs of [[Chicago]] the actual house is located at 4160 Country Club Dr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=4160+Country+Club+Drive,+Long+Beach,+California&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=64.241198,108.28125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.831819,-118.199008&amp;spn=0.008395,0.013218&amp;t=h&amp;z=16 http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=4160+Country+Club+Drive,+Long+Beach,+California&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=64.241198,108.28125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.831819,-118.199008&amp;spn=0.008395,0.013218&amp;t=h&amp;z=16] ''maps.google.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Long Beach's high schools are especially popular with the film industry. [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] has played host to numerous films, providing the outdoor high school grounds of ''[[Coach Carter]]'' and the indoor high school rooms and hallways of [[Robert A. Millikan High School]] ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', among others. [[Cabrillo High School (Long Beach, California)|Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo High School]] has been a very popular place to film movies as well, with 2-4 movies filmed per year, and is currently being used to film [[20th Century Fox]]'s musical comedy-drama, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. Recently, a film was shot in [[Jordan High School (Long Beach, California)|Jordan High School]]. [[St. Anthony High School (California)|St. Anthony High School]]'s gymnasium has also been featured in many movies and television shows, including ''[[Coach Carter]]'' and ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''. Long Beach [[Wilson Classical High School|Woodrow Wilson High School]] has been used to film ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel]]'' and many commercials featuring Nike and Addidas with LA Sparks Basketball star, Candace Parker.  Long Beach Woodrow Wilson was also the focus of the movie ''[[Freedom Writers]]''.

Other locations in Long Beach have been used quite frequently as well. Shoreline Drive visually approximates a freeway but is a municipal roadway and permits are accepted for its closure for filming - it has become a frequent film and television freeway stand-in. Many car chase and crash scenes have been filmed on stretches of road near the Long Beach harbor and along the city's Shoreline Drive. Among these are the 1963 movie ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and numerous episodes of the 1970s TV drama ''[[CHiPs]]. Long Beach's downtown neighborhood has stood in for various urban areas in a variety of'' films. Multiple scenes from the movie ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' and ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Speed&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Speed3.shtml | title=Speed Filming Locations }}&lt;/ref&gt; were filmed in Long Beach. ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' was also filmed in Long Beach and so was Big Momma's House 2 and Freedom Writers. Both ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', although set in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], Florida, regularly film in Long Beach. Much of [[Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny]] was filmed in Long Beach. Although there was a chase scene Downtown, most of Tenacious D was filmed at [[Alex's Bar]] at 2913 E. Anaheim St. A Punk Rock/Alternative Rock Venue. Most of the viral hit [[Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus]] was also filmed by the Belmont Veterans Memorial Pier and Alamitos power station in Long Beach.
The Long Beach Terrace Theatre has also been used for various commercials, an Episode of Glee, as well as the movie &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;.

Nine years later, dissatisfaction with [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] and high taxes led to an abortive and short-lived disincorporation. Before the year 1897 was out, the citizens voted to reincorporate, and the 1897 incorporation is shown on the city seal.

The front beach area of the city was once home to a now-defunct amusement park. Its first rollercoaster opened for business in June 1907. It was named the Figure 8 after the shape of the tracks, and was built on pilings that reached out over the water. In 1914 the [[The Pike|Pike Amusement Zone]] undertook several upgrades and a new roller coaster named the Jack Rabbit Racer was opened in May 1915 becoming the second largest racing coaster in the country. It was part of the Silver Spray Pier which included several new rides and concessions. In the mid twenties, several expansions were made to the area and the Jack Rabbit Racer was remodeled raising the ride's dips to a greater height and steepness but it was soon removed to make way for the Cyclone Racer roller coaster which opened May 1930. The new coaster was also built on pilings over the ocean, but as the breakwater was built and the harbor expanded, the sandy beach extended. Eventually the entire pier stood over the beach. When demolished in September 1968, the Cyclone Racer was the only two track roller coaster in the United States.

Although California's surfing scene is said to have gotten its start in Long Beach when in 1911 two surfers returned from Hawaii and the city hosted the first National Surfing and Paddleboard Championships in 1938, surfing is now uncommon in Long Beach due to a {{convert|2.2|mi|km|sing=on}} long breakwater built in 1949 to protect the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The breakwater reduces &quot;mighty waves to mere lake-like lapping along the city's beaches.&quot; Some Long Beach residents also cite the breakwater as a reason for the dirtiness of the water in Long Beach, as the water is not able to circulate. The fleet left in the 1990s, and now some residents are calling for it to be lowered or eliminated and the city has commissioned a $100,000 study for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schoch |first=Deborah |title=Long Beach at sea over breakwater removal plan |publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 30, 2008 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-breakwater30-2008jun30,0,3801152.story |accessdate= 2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long Beach is home to &quot;Rosie's Dog Beach&quot; -- the only legal off-leash area on the beach for dogs in all of Los Angeles County.

===Restrictions on registered sex offenders===
On March 18, 2008, Long Beach became the first city in California to heavily restrict residency and visitation rights for California [[sex offender registration|registered sex offenders]]. Triggered by a local protest of a multi-apartment dwelling which tenanted several paroled registered sex offenders, and fueled by local radio hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou of [[KFI]]'s [[John and Ken]] show, city council members voted 7-0 to enact 18 ordinances, of which the most restrictive prohibits residency by all registered sex offenders, whether they are on parole or not, within {{convert|2000|ft|m}} of any child care center, public or private school, or park. [[Google map]] measurements indicate that the total exclusion area encompasses over 96% of the area of Long Beach that is currently zoned for residential use. Registered sex offenders currently residing within the exclusion zone were given until September 2008 to vacate the restricted area. Once this happens, no sex offender will legally be able to live in the vast majority of Long Beach. While several other ordinances restrict the number of registered sex offenders who may reside in an apartment complex, there are no apartment complexes within city limits that are outside of the exclusion zone. In addition, the ordinances prohibit all registered sex offenders from using any park, beach, or facility that caters to children, such as amusement parks and restaurants with children's playgrounds, or even travel within {{convert|500|ft|m}} of such places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbreport.com/news/mar08/sexord2.htm | title=LBReport.com | work=Council Approves LB Muni Code Amendments Adding Sex Offender Residency/Loitering Restrictions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presstelegram.com/news/ci_8620321 | title=Long Beach Press-Telegram, March 19, 2008 | work=Long Beach passes sex offender rules }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://municipalcodes.lexisnexis.com/codes/longbeach/ | title=Long Beach Municipal Code Update (PDF) | work=ORDINANCE NO.
