'''CenturyTel of Ohio, Inc.''' is a telephone operating company owned by [[CenturyLink]] that provides local telephone service in [[Ohio]], including [[Amherst, Ohio|Amherst]], [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]], and [[Vermillion, Ohio|Vermillion]].&lt;Ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?ocn=0630&amp;npa=440&amp;region=OH Local Calling Guide: CenturyTel of Ohio, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was established in [[1977]] as the '''Lorain Telephone Company'''. The company was acquired by [[Centel]] and changed its corporate name to '''Central Telephone Company of Ohio'''. In [[1992]], the company was sold to Century Telephone and changed its name to '''Century Telephone of Ohio, Inc.'''. In [[1998]], Century Telephone shortened its name to CenturyTel and the Ohio company changed its corporate name to '''CenturyTel of Ohio, Inc.'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/bsqry/f?p=100:7:282166094323590::NO:7:P7_CHARTER_NUM:505379 Ohio Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company does business as '''CenturyLink''', a name it adopted in [[2009]] following the acquisition of [[Embarq]]. The acquisition is ironic because Embarq was formerly part of [[Sprint Nextel]] as its local telephone division. Sprint acquired [[Centel]] in [[1993]]; now, CenturyTel of Ohio is under the same parent as some of the other Centel companies.
