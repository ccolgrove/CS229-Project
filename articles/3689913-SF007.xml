'''Turbo C++''' was a [[C++]] compiler and [[integrated development environment]] and computer language  originally from [[Borland]].  Most recently it was distributed by [[Embarcadero Technologies]], which acquired all of Borland's compiler tools with the purchase of its [[CodeGear]] division in 2008. The original Turbo C++ product line was put on hold after 1994, and was revived in 2006 as an introductory-level IDE, essentially a stripped-down version of their flagship [[C++Builder]]. Turbo C++ 2006 was released on September 5, 2006 and was available in 'Explorer' and 'Professional' editions. The Explorer edition was free to download and distribute while the Professional edition was a commercial product. In October 2009 [[Embarcadero Technologies]] discontinued support of its 2006 C++ editions. As such, the Explorer edition is no longer available for download and the Professional edition is no longer available for purchase from [[Embarcadero Technologies]]. Turbo C++ is succeeded by [[C++Builder]].

== Historical versions ==

The first release of Turbo C++ was made available during the [[MS-DOS]] reign on personal computers. Version 1.0, running on [[MS-DOS]], was released in May 1990. An [[OS/2]] version was produced as well. Version 1.01 was released on February 28, 1991&lt;ref&gt;http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,21751,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;, running on MS-DOS. The latter was able to generate both [[COM file|COM]] and [[EXE]] programs, and was shipped with Borland's [[Turbo Assembler]] compiler for Intel [[x86]] processors. The initial version of the Turbo C++ compiler was based on a front end developed by TauMetric (TauMetric was later acquired by [[Sun Microsystems]] and their front end was incorporated in Sun C++ 4.0, which shipped in 1994).This compiler supported the AT&amp;T 2.0 release of C++.

'''Turbo C++ 3.0''' was released in 1991 (shipping on November 20), and came in amidst expectations of the coming release of Turbo C++ for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Initially released as an MS-DOS compiler, 3.0 supported C++ templates, Borland's inline assembler, and generation of MS-DOS mode executables for both 8086 real-mode &amp; 286-protected (as well as the Intel [[80186]].)  3.0's implemented AT&amp;T C++ 2.1, the most recent at the time.  The separate Turbo Assembler product was no longer included, but the inline-assembler could stand in as a reduced functionality version.

Soon after the release of Windows 3.0, Borland updated Turbo C++ to support Windows application development. The Turbo C++ 3.0 for Windows product was quickly followed by '''Turbo C++ 3.1''' (and then '''Turbo C++ 4.5'''). It's possible that the jump from version 1.x to version 3.x was in part an attempt to link Turbo C++ release numbers with Microsoft Windows versions; however, it seems more likely that this jump was simply to synchronize Turbo C and Turbo C++, since Turbo C 2.0 (1989) and Turbo C++ 1.0 (1990) had come out roughly at the same time, and the next generation 3.0 was a merger of both the C and C++ compiler.

Starting with version 3.0, Borland segmented their C++ compiler into two distinct product-lines: &quot;Turbo C++&quot; and &quot;[[Borland C++]]&quot;.  Turbo C++ was marketed toward the hobbyist and entry-level compiler market, while Borland C++ targeted the professional application development market.  Borland C++ included additional tools, compiler code-optimization, and documentation to address the needs of commercial developers.  Turbo C++ 3.0 could be upgraded with separate add-ons, such as Turbo Assembler and [[Turbo Vision]] 1.0.

Version 4.0 was released in November 1993 and was notable (among other things) for its robust support of templates. In particular, Borland C++ 4 was instrumental in the development of the [[Standard Template Library]], [[expression templates]], and the first advanced applications of [[template metaprogramming]]. With the success of the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-evolved product [[CodeGear Delphi|Delphi]], Borland ceased work on their Borland C++ suite and concentrated on [[C++Builder]] for Windows.  C++Builder shared Delphi's front-end application framework, but retained the Borland C++ back-end compiler.  Active development on Borland C++/Turbo C++ was suspended until 2006 (see below.)

==Legacy software==
*Turbo C++ v1.01 and Turbo C v2.0 can be downloaded, free of charge, from Borland's Antique Software website.
*Turbo C++ 3.0 (DOS) was included in the Turbo C++ Suite 1.0, which is no longer sold by Borland.
