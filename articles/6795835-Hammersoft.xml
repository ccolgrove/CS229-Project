<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="6795835" ns="0" title="Arch of the Centuries"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''Arch of the Centuries''' is a [[monument]] in the [[University of Santo Tomas]] (UST) at [[Manila]], that stands fifteen meters away from the University's main vehicular entrance along [[EspaÃ±a Boulevard]].  It is declared by the National Museum as a National Treasure, it serves as the link of the campus with its Intramuros roots and its Spanish heritage. It has become a symbol of learningâthe portal to greatness under which students and alumni (such as Rizal, Mabini, Quezon and OsmeÃ±a) have passed. &lt;ref &gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/artsandbooks/artsandbooks/view/20100125-249246/UST-landmarks-declared-National-Treasures?fbc_channel=1 UST landmarks declared âNational Treasuresâ] Manuel Maximo Lopez del Castillo-Noche, ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''. Published 01-25-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arch of the Centuries was originally erected in 1611 at [[Intramuros]], where UST was originally found. When the University transferred to its present location at [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]], the Arch was also carried piece-by-piece and was re-erected at the front of the main vehicular entrance of the University.

The original Arch which faces the [[Main Building (University of Santo Tomas)|Main Building]] was the main doorway to the university building before it was destroyed during [[World War II]] when it was at Intramuros. A newer arch faced EspaÃ±a Boulevard, which is a reconstruction of the original arch.&lt;ref name=&quot;UST&quot;&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/sitelinks/insideust/geninfo/landmarks.asp?recno=20 Arch of the Centuries] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph]. Accessed 2006-08-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arch contains [[Doric order|Doric]] [[column]]s, but is [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] in its details. The inscription on the arch says &quot;Gateway to the history of the finest breed of Filipinos,&quot; a reference to the numerous [[List of University of Santo Tomas people|alumni]] who have made an impact in [[History of the Philippines|Philippine history]]. On the left pillar of the facade facing EspaÃ±a Boulevard is commemorative plaque honoring [[Philippine National Heroes|national hero]] [[JosÃ© Rizal]], and on the right pillar is another plaque honoring [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]]; both being UST alumni.&lt;ref name=&quot;UST&quot;/&gt;

On the sides at the top of the Arch are panels depicting the life of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], the patron saint of the University and of all Catholic schools.

All incoming students (freshmen and transferees), as parts of their initiation rites into the University, known as the ''Thomasian Welcome Walk'' are required to pass through under the Arch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groovy07.blogspot.com/2006/07/recollection-and-freshmen-walk.html Recollection and freshmen walk] [http://groovy07.blogspot.com/ I Can Conquer All blog]. Accessed 2006-08-12&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates for graduation, on the other hand, also pass through under the Arch during a parade after their Baccalaureate Mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:lZQwHT4aGYMJ:webservice.mnl.ust.edu.ph/paao/ACAD_march03.pdf+%22Arch+of+the+Centuries%22&amp;hl=tl&amp;gl=ph&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=28&amp;client=firefox-a BACCALAUREATE 2003] [http://webservice.mnl.ust.edu.ph/paao/ACAD_march03.pdf UST Webservice] (originally in PDF but is linked to a Google HTML equivalent). Accessed 2006-08-12&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition started on June 2002. Fireworks display ends the passage and signals the party afterwards. The parade, either of freshmen or graudating seniors, is done per college/faculty in random order.

There is an old superstition that while studying at the University, one should not pass under the arch until he graduates. If done so, an event will happen that will bar his graduation from the University.
