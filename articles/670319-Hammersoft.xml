'''Poul Holmskov SchlÃ¼ter''' ({{IPA-da|pÊÊÌ¯l hÊlmsÉ¡ÊÊÌ¯ slydÉ}}, 3 April 1929) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] politician, who served as [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 1982 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_efter_1945/Poul_Schl%C3%BCter?highlight=poul%20schl%C3%BCter Poul SchlÃ¼ter] Den Store Danske, Gyldendals Ã¥bne encyclopÃ¦di&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/FactsheetDenmark/Politics/html/chapter01.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/23/world/decision-for-europe-danes-will-vote-again-europe-but-treaty-may-see-some-changes.html?pagewanted=all |title=DECISION FOR EUROPE; Danes Will Vote Again on Europe, But Treaty May See Some Changes |work=The New York Times  |date=23 September 1992 |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/eu-gravy-train-must-run-to-new-timetable-1351268.html |title=EU gravy train must run to new timetable |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=8 November 1996 |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[TÃ¸nder]], south [[Jutland]], he graduated from the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1957 with a degree in law, and joined the bar in 1960. SchlÃ¼ter was a member of the Danish Parliament ([[Folketinget]]) for the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] from 1964 to 1994. He was also Chairman of the Conservative People's Party from 1974 to 1977 and from 1981 to 1993.

In 1982, after Prime Minister [[Anker JÃ¸rgensen]] was forced to resign, SchlÃ¼ter cobbled together a four-party coalition and was appointed his successor.  He was the first member of the Conservative People's Party to become Prime Minister, as well as the first conservative to hold the office since 1901.  During his time as Prime Minister, he was named &quot;Nordic Politician of the Year&quot; (in 1984). He has since been granted a large number of Danish and international awards and medals.

Previously, he had served as a member of the [[Council of Europe]] from 1971 to 1974, and had headed the Danish Delegation to the [[Nordic Council]], where he served as a member of the Council Presidium, in 1978 and 1979. He retired as Prime Minister in 1993 after an inquiry found that he had misinformed the Danish Parliament. The case was known as the [[Tamil Case (Denmark)|Tamil Case]], (in Danish: &quot;Tamilsagen&quot;), as it involved asylum requests from [[Tamil people|Tamil]] refugees.

Following his retirement as Prime Minister in 1993, SchlÃ¼ter served as a member of the [[European Parliament]] from 1994 to 1999, the first three years as Vice-President of the body.

In 2003, SchlÃ¼ter was appointed by the Swedish Minister of Co-operation as her special envoy to promote freedom of movement in the Nordic countries. Poul SchlÃ¼ter was to work on ways of increasing individual freedom of movement and present specific proposals to the [[Nordic Council]] Session in October 2003.

In 2004, Poul SchlÃ¼ter co-founded the first Danish free-market think tank [[CEPOS]], and gave the opening speech at CEPOS' opening reception at the Hotel D'Angleterre in Copenhagen.

SchlÃ¼ter's autobiography, ''Sikken et liv'' (''What a Life''), was published in 1999 and has been reprinted several times.
