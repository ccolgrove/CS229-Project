'''Huntington Park''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California]], [[United States]].  As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 58,114, down from 61,348 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
Named for prominent industrialist [[Henry Huntington]], Huntington Park was incorporated in 1906 as a [[streetcar suburb]] for workers in the rapidly expanding industries to the southeast of downtown Los Angeles.  (To this day, about 30% of its residents work at factories in nearby [[Vernon, California|Vernon]] and [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/ http://factfinder.census.gov/] ''Factfinder.census.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;)  The stretch of [[Pacific Boulevard]] in downtown Huntington Park was a major commercial district serving the city's largely working-class residents, as well as those of neighboring cities such as [[Bell, California|Bell]], [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]],   [[South Gate, California|South Gate]], and Downey. As with most of the other cities along the corridor stretching along the [[Los Angeles River]] to the south and southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Huntington Park was an almost exclusively white community during most of its history; Alameda Street and [[Slauson Avenue]], which were fiercely defended segregation lines in the 1950s, separated it from black areas.

The changes that shaped Los Angeles from the late 1970s onwardâthe decline of American manufacturing that began in the 1970s; the rapid growth of newer suburbs in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], the eastern [[San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel]], western [[San Fernando Valley|San Fernando]] and [[Conejo Valley|Conejo]] valleys; the collapse of the aerospace and defense industry at the end of the [[Cold War]]; and the implosion of the Southern California real estate boom in the early 1990sâresulted in the wholesale departure of virtually all of the white population of Huntington Park by the mid-1990s.  The vacuum was filled almost entirely by two groups of [[Latino]]s: upwardly mobile families eager to leave the barrios of [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], and recent [[Mexico|Mexican]] immigrants.  Today, Pacific Boulevard is once again a thriving commercial strip, serving once again as a major retail center for working-class residents of southeastern Los Angeles Countyâbut unlike its previous heyday of the 1930s, the signs along the avenue's storefronts are now primarily in Spanish.
