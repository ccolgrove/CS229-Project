The '''1913 Copa del Rey''' were two different competitions held the same year.

Due to disagreements between the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] and some clubs, in 1913 two parallel competitions were held: an &quot;official&quot;, organized by the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|FEF]] (in [[Madrid]]) and an &quot;unofficial&quot;, organized by the Spanish Union Football Club (in [[Barcelona]]). Both are currently recognized as official by the RFEF.
