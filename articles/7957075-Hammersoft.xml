The '''Arizona State Sun Devils' football''' program represents [[Arizona State University]] in [[college football]], and competes in [[NCAA Division I FBS]] as a member of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]].

The Sun Devils had their greatest success in the 1960s and 1970s under [[head coach]] [[Frank Kush]]. In that 22-year stretch, they compiled a 176â54â1 record, putting Arizona State on the college football map. From 1969 to 1971, the team put together a school-record 21-game winning streak. In 1996, the Sun Devils came within a matter of seconds of pulling out a win in the Rose Bowl against [[Ohio State]] that would have given them an undefeated season and (potentially) a share of the national championship.

The team plays its home games at [[Sun Devil Stadium]], which currently has a capacity of 72,955.

==Practice facilities==
=== Bill Kajikawa Practice Fields===

Bill Kajikawa Practice Fields located on Sixth Street and Rural Road is normally where Sun Devil football team practices when weather permits.

===Camp Tontozona===
An Arizona State University property, is a {{convert|36|acre|m2|adj=on}} camp just outside of [[Payson, Arizona]] created by former legendary coach [[Frank Kush]] was used as a bonding place for his players. Tontozona has marked the unofficial start of the Sun Devilsâ seasons from 1960-2008. Due to the knack of losing practices to rainouts, short and torn up fields leading to excessive injuries, and travel costs, the team decided to move camp back to Tempe campus with the arrival of the Devil Dome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/119952&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verde Dickey Center===
Formerly opened as Devil Dome and nicknamed,&quot;The Bubble&quot;, $8.4 million practice facility broke ground on May 15, 2008&lt;ref&gt;http://asunews.asu.edu/20080515_indoorpracticefacility&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a climate controlled space for the Sun Devil football team, [[Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band|Sun Devil Marching Band]], ASU Intramurals and for other athletic department events. Before its full completion and turn over from the contractor to the university on the night of August 28, 2008 a powerful storm brought it down.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2008/08/29/20080829spt-asububble-ON.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Bubble was re-inflated early October and was fully repaired for use in July 2009. During the 2009 season the facility was renamed and dedicated to generous donor Dr. Verde Dickey as the Verde Dickey Center, to not only commemorate his donation for the facility but also his donations to Sun Devil Marching Band and projects such as renovation of locker rooms in Wells Fargo Arena and Sun Devil Stadium, Weatherup Basketball Center, The Athletes Performance Center, John Spini Gymnastics Center, and wrestling practice facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2009/10/08/20091008spt-asudickeydome.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalry==
Arizona State's primary rivals are [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]] and [[USC Trojans Football]]. 

[[ASU]] has had a long standing rivalry with [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]].The football rivalry game between the schools is known as &quot;[[The Duel in the Desert]]&quot; and is played for the [[Territorial Cup]]. The [[University of Arizona]] has the all-time series lead with a record of 47-37-1. This record dates back to 1899 before Arizona State was recognized as a University; however ASU was an NCAA participating university/college as an independent member and member of the Border Conference prior to 1958.  All games played prior to the establishment of ASU as a university in 1958 are officially counted by the NCAA and are official games against all opponents in every NCAA recognized sport. Tempe Normal (ASU) won the first matchup in 1899, 11-2.

Since becoming an official university in 1958,&lt;ref name=&quot;ASUhistory&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/about/history/|title=Brief History of ASU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona State has the overall lead in the rivalry series with a record of 29 wins, 22 losses, and one tie, though they went 0â8â1 during a nine-year stretch from 1982-90.   Since ASU and Arizona have become major conference members of the Pacific 10 Conference in 1978, the University of Arizona leads the series 18-14-1.  ASU has recently enjoyed more success in the series, winning three out of the past six meetings and six of the last eleven.  They lost the most recent contest on November 19, 2011, 31-27 in Tempe.

[[ASU]] has had a long standing rivalry with [[USC Trojans Football]]. After leaving the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) to join the [[Pac-10]] in 1978, the Sun Devils shocked the #2 USC Trojans 20-7 at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on Oct. 14, 1978, to earn the program's first ever Pac-10 win.&lt;ref&gt;http://asunews.asu.edu/20110928_gallery_asugame1978&lt;/ref&gt; Since then ASU has trailed USC 10-18 wins respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://football.stassen.com/cgi-bin/records/opp-opp.pl?start=1869&amp;end=2011&amp;team1=Arizona+State&amp;team2=Southern+California&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams have displayed an at home advantage. On September, 24th 2011 Arizona State ended an 11-game losing streak to USC with a 43-22 victory in front of an inspired home crowd. The win pushed the Sun Devils back into the national rankings and bolstered their position in the Pac-12 South Division.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/tag/_/name/weekend-rewind-092611&lt;/ref&gt;
