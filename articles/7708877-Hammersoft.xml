'''Necros''', played by [[Andreas Wisniewski]], is [[General Georgi Koskov|General Koskov's]] highly trained and disciplined [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[assassination|assassin]] with [[KGB]] affiliations, but ultimately loyal to Koskov. He is very tall (6 foot 4 Â½ inch), blond and muscular with chiselled features in the Bond henchman stereotype based on the [[Red Grant]] model. Necros uses a great number of disguises and many techniques of killing, although [[strangulation]] (many times with his [[Walkman]]'s headphones) seems to be a preferred method. 

His first priority is to see that Koskov is brought safely to [[Brad Whitaker]]'s Tangier estate from the safe house in England, where Koskov is being held by British Intelligence. He completes this mission by disguising himself as a [[milkman]], whereby he gains access to the intelligence compound. Subsequently, he radios in a report of a major gas leak within the building. This causes security to order an immediate evacuation. In the confusion, he disguises himself as a doctor and &quot;abducts&quot; Koskov via helicopter before securing his escape with the help of explosive grenades that look like milk bottles, killing several Secret Service agents who attempt to apprehend him. 

Necros later whilst disguised as a balloon vendor kills Saunders, head of Station V in [[Vienna]], which becomes part of the operation to make the British Secret Service believe the Soviets have instituted a &quot;Smiert Spionem&quot; or &quot;Death to Spies&quot; operation. 

In [[Tangier]] Necros helps kidnap 007 and takes him to a Soviet cargo plane, which delivers them and General Koskov to Colonel Fayador's airbase in Afghanistan.  Later, Necros buys Mujahadin opium on behalf of Fayador with smuggled diamonds and takes it back to the airbase.  Bond, who is disguised as a Mujahadin fighter, is discovered and begins the rebels' attack on the base.  Necros, Feyador, and Koskov take cover under a truck.  After Koskov spots Kara Milovy in a speeding army jeep headed for the cargo plane that Bond is piloting to escape, Necros and Koskov commandeer another vehicle with a machine gun turret mounted on it.  Necros fires at Milovy but is told to cease fire by his boss, as the gunfire would strike the cargo plane carrying the opium shipment.  Just before the plane takes off, Necros leaps into the plane's open hatch. Necros himself is killed after a midair fight with Bond on the holding net of the cargo plane. Necros is about to fall to the ground, but he grabs onto Bond's boot. Necros pleads for his life, but Bond uses a knife to cut the boot's laces. Necros, still holding onto the boot, plummets to his death.

This '''00 imposter''' is an assassin disguised as a 00 agent who killed agent 004 during a training mission at the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], leaving a tag reading ''[[SMERSH (James Bond)|Smert Shpionam]]''. Afterwards, he kills two British guards and steals a [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover]] loaded with [[ammunition]] and attempts to escape, but Bond pursues him and jumps onto the top of the vehicle, using his knife to cut through the Land Rover's cloth top. As Bond forces his way inside the vehicle and the two men fight for control of the steering wheel, they inadvertently smash through a military [[blockade]]. In retaliation one of the guards fires on them with a machine gun, setting fire to the ammunition the Land Rover is carrying in the back. Ultimately the vehicle drives off a cliff. Bond escapes by using his [[parachute]] to let the updraft pull him safely from the falling Land Rover; the assassin is not so lucky and dies when the ammo finally explodes as the vehicle hits the water.

'''Colonel Feyador''' is an old friend of [[Georgi Koskov]], and the head officer of a Russian military base in the middle of [[Afghanistan]]. Feyador provided Koskov with men and trucks necessary for his Koskov's [[opium deal]] with the [[Mujahadin]], and on Koskov's request has the captured Bond and [[Kara Milovy]] locked up in the base's brig. However, they escape and later attacke the base in full force with Kamran Shah and his men. When Bond seizes control of the Russian cargo plane Koskov intended to use to fly the opium to [[Tangier]], a furious Koskov orders Feyador to block the runway with something, ''anything''. Feyador jumps into a fuel truck and tries to drive it into the path of the plane. Kamran Shah, seeing what Feyador is trying to do, throws a grenade underneath the vehicle. Although Feyador notices the grenade, he is unable to get out in time and dies when the truck exploded.

'''Sergeant Stagg''' is one of &quot;General&quot; [[Brad Whitaker]]'s men at his mansion in [[Tangier]]. Like most of Whitaker's men, Stagg appears to be fanatically devoted to Whitaker and fully embraces his pseudo-military lifestyle. Stagg is first seen when [[List of James Bond allies in The Living Daylights#General Leonid Pushkin|General Leonid Pushkin]] arrives to meet with Whitaker, Stagg instructing him to wait for &quot;the Major.&quot; At the end of the film, after Bond has killed Whitaker, he attempts to take Bond by surprise with a machine gun but is shot and killed by Pushkin.
