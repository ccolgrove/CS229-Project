'''CRUX''' is a lightweight, [[i686]]-optimized [[Linux distribution|GNU/Linux distribution]] targeted at experienced [[Linux|GNU/Linux]] users and delivered by a [[tar.gz]]-based package system with [[BSD]]-style initscripts. It also utilizes a [[ports system]] to install and upgrade applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://crux.nu&lt;/ref&gt;  The current release is 2.7.1.

Although ''[[wikt:crux#Latin|crux]]'' is the Latin word for &quot;cross,&quot; the choice of the name &quot;CRUX&quot; itself has no meaning. Per LidÃ©n created it for &quot;sounding cool&quot;, using an ending &quot;-X&quot; to evoke Linux and [[Unix]].&lt;ref&gt;http://crux.nu/Main/Faq#ntoc2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==

CRUX, unlike many other GNU/Linux distributions, doesn't include a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] installation program.  Instead, the user boots the [[Linux kernel|kernel]] stored on either a [[Compact Disc|CD]] or [[Floppy disk|diskette]]; [[Disk partitioning|partitions]] the [[Hard disk drive|hard disk drive(s)]] to which the [[operating system]] will be installed (using a program such as [[fdisk]] or [[cfdisk]]); creates the appropriate [[file system]]s on the various partitions; [[mount (Unix)|mounts]] the CD or [[Distributed file system|NFS]] share along with the partitions made previously for use by the package installation script; compiles a new kernel; and installs a [[Booting|bootloader]], all via [[Command-line interface|shell commands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://crux.nu/Main/Handbook2-6#ntoc9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://crux.nu/Wiki/NFSInstall&lt;/ref&gt;

==Package Management==
{{See|Ports system}}

CRUX implements an infrastructure similar to that of [[BSD]]-based operating systems for package management.  Packages consist of a [[makefile]], any [[patch (computing)|patches]] required to adjust the program to work, [[md5sum]] hashes used to verify the integrity of the downloaded files, a footprint file listing the files to be included in the packages, and the package source [[archive file|archived]] in [[tar.gz]] format.  These files are downloaded from a CRUX [[software repository]], [[compiled]], and installed using the prt-get frontend to pkgutils.&lt;ref name=&quot;pkgmgmt&quot;/&gt;
