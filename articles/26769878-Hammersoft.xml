==History==
VMI basketball started in 1908 under head coach Pete Krebs. The team went 3-3. In 1924, they joined the SoCon, and would leave nearly 80 years later for the Big South in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;VMI&quot;/&gt; 

Perhaps the most famous run for the team was in 1976 and 77. The first year in 1975-76, the Keydets went 22-10 under head coach [[Bill Blair (basketball)|Bill Blair]]. After winning the SoCon tournament, VMI defeated [[Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball|Tennessee]] and [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]] before falling to Rutgers 91-75. The next year, VMI went 26-4 under first-year head coach Charlie Schmaus. After defeating [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]] 73-66, they fell in the Sweet Sixteen to [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] 93-78.

When VMI joined the Big South in 2003, they had regular season records of 6-22, 9-18, and 7-20 over the next 3 years. In 2006-07, VMI reached the Big South Championship for the first time, losing to [[Winthrop Eagles men's basketball|Winthrop]] 84-81.&lt;ref name=&quot;VMI&quot;/&gt; In 2008-09, VMI reached the championship again, but fell to [[Radford Highlanders men's basketball|Radford]] 108-94. The Keydets fell in the 2011 Big South semifinals to [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers men's basketball|Coastal Carolina]] 89-81 to end an 18-13 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmikeydets.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9800&amp;ATCLID=205108383 #4 VMI Falls to #1 Coastal Carolina in Semifinals of Big South Championship, 89-81]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Cormack Field House]] (1930's-1980)'''
'''Cormack Field House''', nicknamed &quot;The Pit&quot;, served as the home of VMI basketball from the 1930's through 1980. There were many notable performances in its time, including a trio of [[SoCon]] championships and [[Elite 8]] and [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]] VMI squads.
*'''[[Cameron Hall]] (1981-present)'''
The 5,800-seat '''Cameron Hall''' has housed VMI basketball since 1981, and does so today. It replaced aging Cormack Field House, which is now used for indoor track and field.
