'''Wikinews''' is a [[free content|free-content]] [[news source]] [[wiki]] and a project of the [[Wikimedia|Wikimedia Foundation]]. The site works through [[collaborative journalism]]. Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] has distinguished Wikinews from [[Wikipedia]] by saying &quot;on Wikinews, each story is to be written as a news story as opposed to an encyclopedia article.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Joanna Glasner | title = Wikipedia Creators Move Into News | url = http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/11/65819 | publisher = WIRED | date = 29 November 2004 | accessdate = 2007-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Objectivity (journalism)|neutral point of view]] policy espoused in Wikinews distinguishes it from other [[citizen journalism]] efforts such as [[Indymedia]] and [[OhmyNews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Aaron Weiss | title = The Unassociated Press | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/10/technology/circuits/10wiki.html?ex=1177300800&amp;en=024e251d2c696137&amp;ei=5070 | publisher = The New York Times | date = 10 February 2005 | accessdate = 2007-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to most projects of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikinews allows original work under the form of original reporting and interviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;OR&quot;&gt;[[n:Wikinews:Original reporting|Wikinews:Original reporting]].&lt;/ref&gt; The English Wikinews is the only Wikimedia site that grants [[press pass]]es to reporters endorsed by the local community.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:WN:CV|Wikinews:Credential verification]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thelwall et al., Wikinews has been most successful in covering large news events involving large numbers of people, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the [[Virginia Tech Shootings]], where first hand experience, or the availability of first hand accounts, forms a larger part of the entry, and where the wealth of reportage makes a central &quot;clearing house&quot; valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thelwall, Mike and Stuart, David|title=RUOK?

== History ==

[[File:Wikinews logo.png|thumb|left|200px|The beta version logo, used until February 13, 2005]]

The first&lt;ref name=eloquence&gt;Erik MÃ¶ller: [http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:Eloquence/History The history of Wikinews and my role in it] Wikinews.org, accessed July 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; recorded proposal of a Wikimedia news site was a two-line [[anonymous post]] on January 5, 2003, on [[Wikipedia]] community's [[Meta-Wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wikinews/Archive&amp;oldid=4306 Archived log entry of the anonymous post] on Meta-Wiki.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Alston, who edited Wikipedia as Fonzy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Fonzy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1315899 Archived log entry of the userpage of User:Fonzy] on the English Wikipedia, which states his real name.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to have been the one who posted it.&lt;ref name=eloquence/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikinews&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27867383 Log entry of User:Fonzy editing this article] on the English Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was then further developed by German freelance journalist, software developer and author [[Erik MÃ¶ller]].&lt;ref name=eloquence/&gt; Early opposition from long-time Wikipedia contributors, many of them pointing out the existence of Wikipedia's own news summaries, gave way to detailed discussions and proposals about how it could be implemented as a new project of the [[Wikimedia|Wikimedia Foundation]].

In November 2004, a [[technology demo|demonstration]] wiki was established to show how such a [[collaborative]] [[news site]] might work. {{As of|2004|alt=In December 2004}}, the site was moved out of the &quot;demo&quot; stage and into the [[beta version|beta]] stage. A [[German language]] edition was launched at the same time. Soon editions in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Esperanto]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (in that chronological order) were set up. 

On March 13, 2005, the English edition of Wikinews reached 1,000 news articles. Just a few months later in September 2005, the project moved to the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution 2.5 license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_switches_to_Creative_Commons_license Wikinews switches to Creative Commons license]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2006, the English edition of Wikinews reached 5,000 news articles. On September 5, 2007, just over a year later, the English edition of Wikinews reached 10,000 news articles.

In September, 2011, a large part of the Wikinews user base announced that they were dissatisfied with the site and created a [[fork (software)|fork]] called [[OpenGlobe|TheOpenGlobe.org]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2011/10/wikipedia-isnt-journalism-but-are-wikipedians-reluctant-journalists290.html Wikipedia Isn't Journalism, But Are Wikipedians Reluctant Journalists?]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikinewspar|English Wikinews publishes 10000th article}}

== Additional projects ==

While Wikinews focuses primarily on text articles, members are expanding the site into other media. These projects include [[n:Wikinews:Audio Wikinews|Audio Wikinews]], which delivers [[Ogg Vorbis]] audio files, [[n:Wikinews:Video 2.0|Wikinews Video 2.0 (test phase)]] and [[n:Wikinews:Print edition|Wikinews Print edition]], which is a daily edition intended to be printed.

On April 28, 2008 Wikinews also started the plans for ''[[m:Wikimedia Radio|Wikimedia Radio]]'' which is aimed at a 24/7 streaming audio broadcast of various programs and news, mainly from participating Wikimedia projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WM:RADIO Wikimedia Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interviews ==

[[File:David Shankbone and Shimon Peres.jpg|right|thumb|Wikinews reporter David Shankbone with Israeli president [[Shimon Peres]] in 2007.]]

Wikinews reporters have conducted interviews with several notable people. In December 2007, Wikinews interviewed [[Israeli President]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient [[Shimon Peres]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biginterview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=205604529 |title=Wikinews Gets Big Interview: Israeli President Shimon Peres |author= K.C. Jones |newspaper=[[Information Week]] |date= January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other notable interviews have included writers, actors and politicians, such as [[Augusten Burroughs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/04/books/david-shankbone-with-colleen-asper |title=David Shankbone with Colleen Asper |first=Colleen |last=Asper |publisher=[[The Brooklyn Rail]] |date=April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 Republican nomination hopefuls and independent/third party candidates for President, [[Tony Benn]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Nick Smith (New Zealand)|Nick Smith]] and [[John Key]], and World Wide Web co-inventor [[Robert Cailliau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biginterview&quot; /&gt;

== Criticism ==
As stated above, many Wikinews users are disappointed with the management of the website, leading to the creation of a fork.

Like Wikipedia (see [[Reliability of Wikipedia]]), Wikinews is criticized for its perceived inability to be neutral or include only verified and true information. [[Robert McHenry]], former editor-in-chief of the [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]] criticized&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorktimes1&quot;/&gt; the credibility of the project:

{{bquote|Above all, the central question about the Wikinews effort is its credibility. Making a newspaper is hard...Someone who wants to do it but doesn't really know how hasn't solved the problem by gathering a lot of other people who don't know, either.}}

McHenry was skeptical about Wikinews' ability to provide a neutral point of view and its claim to be evenhanded: &quot;The naÃ¯vetÃ© is stunning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorktimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/10/technology/circuits/10wiki.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;nbsp;â |title=[[Jimmy Wales]], president of Wikimedia, where articles written by users are open to revision by others |first= Aaron |last=Weiss |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=February 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 interview [[Sue Gardner]], at that time a special adviser to the board of the Wikimedia Foundation and former head of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Internet division, CBC.ca, dismissed McHenry's comment, stating &quot;Journalism is not a profession ... at its heart, it's just a craft. And that means that it can be practiced by anyone who is sensible and intelligent and thoughtful and curious ... I go back to the morning of [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech]]&amp;nbsp;â the morning I decided I wanted to work here [WMF]. The conversation on the talk page that day was extremely thoughtful. I remember thinking to myself that if my own newsroom had been having a conversation that intelligent (I was offsite that day) I would have been delighted. So yes, [in my opinion] you absolutely have proved Robert McHenry wrong. And you will continue to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[n:Interview with Sue Gardner of the Wikimedia Foundation|Interview with Sue Gardner of the Wikimedia Foundation]]&quot;, Wikinews; October 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikinews has also had issues with maintaining a separate identity from Wikipedia, which also covers major news events in real-time.  Columnist [[Jonathan Dee]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out in 2007 that &quot;So indistinct has the line between past and present become that Wikipedia has inadvertently all but strangled one of its sister projects, the three-year-old Wikinews... [Wikinews] has sunk into a kind of torpor; lately it generates just 8 to 10 articles a day... On bigger stories there's just no point in competing with the ruthless purview of the encyclopedia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Dee |title=All the News Thatâs Fit to Print Out |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/magazine/01WIKIPEDIA-t.html |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andrew Lih]] and Zachary M. Seward commented on the continuing issue in a 2010 piece in the [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|Nieman Journalism Lab]], &quot;Why Wikipedia beats Wikinews as a collaborative journalism project.&quot;  Lih wrote &quot;it's not clear that the [[wiki]] process really gears itself towards deadlines and group narrative writing&quot; and that &quot;if you're trying to write something approaching a feature piece, it's much harder to get more than two or three people to stay consistent with the style.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lih&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/02/why-wikipedia-beats-wikinews-as-a-collaborative-journalism-project/ |title=Why Wikipedia beats Wikinews as a collaborative journalism project |last=Seward |first=Zachary M. |date=2009-02-08 |work=[[Nieman Journalism Lab]] |publisher=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] |accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lih considers Wikipedia's stricter &quot;formula&quot; for article composition an advantage in a large wiki with many editors.&lt;ref name=&quot;lih&quot; /&gt;
