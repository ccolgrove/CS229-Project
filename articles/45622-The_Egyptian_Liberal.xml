The '''Green Movement''' refers to a [[2009â2010 Iranian election protests|series of actions]] after the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]], in which protesters demanded the removal of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] from office. Green was initially used as the symbol of [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]]'s campaign, but after the election it became the symbol of unity and hope for those asking for annulment of what they regarded as a fraudulent election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.nowpublic.com/world/green-movement-during-irans-presidential-election| title = Green movement during Iran's Presidential Election}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Where is my vote?'' ({{lang-fa|Ø±Ø£Û ÙÙ Ú©Ø¬Ø§Ø³ØªØ}} [[Romanization of Persian|{{unicode|''raye-man kojast?''}}]]) is a motto which was used during the protests.

Although the Iranian government prohibited any form of gathering by opposition-supporters in [[Tehran]] and across the country, significantly slowed down internet access and censored any form of media agreeing with the opposition, hundreds of thousands of Iranians chanted this motto, defying the law and challenging the Islamic Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/story/1098601.html Iranians, by hundreds of thousands, ask: Where is my vote?]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}

== Legal ways ==
Mousavi and the reformists are now working in legal ways to put into force reforms. They had set up a new coalition, named [[The Green Path of Hope]], to support this way.

== Calls for a revolution ==
Many of the protesters tried to turn the movement into a revolution to overthrow the Islamic Republic. For some Iranians protesting mostly  outside of Iran, the Green Movement is what the international media is calling the massive mobilization to dismantle the Islamic Republic of Iran. Chants such as &quot;down with the system&quot; and &quot;down with the dictator&quot; were heard across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shirin-sadeghi/irans-green-movement-lie_b_825737.html Iran's Green Movement Lie]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Green Path of Hope====
{{Main|The Green Path of Hope}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Official portrait of Mir-Hossein Mousavi.jpg|thumb|left]] --&gt;

Mousavi and other reformist leaders are now working in peaceful and legal methods to widen the influence of their reforms. They have set up a new coalition named &quot;The Green Path of Hope&quot;. Iranian political parties and movements need to be authorized by the [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Interior Ministry]]. Mousavi neither recognizes the current government as legitimate nor is likely to receive permission; so, the movement was named a &quot;path&quot; in order bypass this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.gooya.com/politics/archives/2009/08/092369.php |title=Ø²ÙÙØ§Øª &quot;Ø±Ø§Ù Ø³Ø¨Ø² Ø§ÙÙØ¯&quot; Ø§Ø² Ø²Ø¨Ø§Ù Ø¹ÙÙØ±Ø¶Ø§ Ø¨ÙØ´ØªÛ: Ø®Ø§ØªÙÛ Ù Ú©Ø±ÙØ¨Û Ø¹Ø¶Ù Ø´ÙØ±Ø§Û ÙØ±Ú©Ø²Û |publisher=Gooya News |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Path of Hope claims it seeks to continue protests against Ahmadinejad's presidency following lawful and peaceful methods, and the full execution of the constitution, as Mousavi says:

{{epigraph
 | quote =  &lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt; &quot;You can't follow some parts of the constitution and throw the rest into a bin.&quot; &lt;/font&gt; |cite = }} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlemannews.ir/index.aspx?n=2694 |title=Ø¯ ÙÛâÚ©ÙÛÙ ØªØ§ Ø­ÙÙÙ ÙØ±Ø¯Ù Ø±Ø§ Ø§Ø³ØªÛÙØ§ Ú©ÙÛÙ/|publisher=Parlemann News |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to organization officials, the movement functions encompasses numerous political parties, NGO's and social networks.  Mousavi emphasized that existent, autonomous social networks in the community are part of this movement:&lt;ref name=&quot;ilna2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilna.ir/fullStory.aspx?ID=71086|title=Green path of hope, Mousavi's new organization |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{epigraph
 | quote = &lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt; &quot;During the election, our mottos supported and remained in the framework of the constitution; today we are devoted to those slogans. We believe that if the people's demands were treated fairly, instead of being distorted by the media and linked to foreigners, and the government promoted truth by fair criticism, our mottos could satisfy the public.&quot;&lt;ref name=ilna2/&gt;&lt;/font&gt; |cite = }}

The &quot;Green Path&quot; has six main members of the central council, who are connected to reformist parties, NGOs, and social networks. The main body will be ordinary protesters. The strategy is to connect existent pressures and issues in society in a social network, and to therefore lead protests in a lawful manner.

=====Green Wave=====
Abroad, the &quot;Green Wave&quot; movement is based in Europe. Founded by [[Amir Hossein Jahanchahi]], it &quot;claims to be the only exiled opposition group to provide logistical and financial assistance to democracy-seeking opponents of the Iranian regime.&quot; It has &quot;announced the defection of several Iranian diplomats in Europe&quot; (such as [[Mohammad Reza Heydari]]) as well as an Iranian ex-Air Force pilot, [[Behzad Masoumi Legwan]], who claims that dissidence against the Islamic Republic &quot;in Iran's military is widespread.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hm0m4rLdl94N8vJpgspS24s3D3mQ?docId=5161599 Exiled Iranian ex-Air Force pilot claims Iran's military rife with rebellion] By Elaine Ganley (Canadian Press), 11-17-2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/19/iran-green-wave-opposition-jananchahi Iranian exile calls for overthrow of Ahmadinejad] 19 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
