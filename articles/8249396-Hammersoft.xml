'''Ronald Ludington''' (born September 4, 1934) is an [[United States|American]] [[figure skating|figure skater]] and coach. He was born in  [[Boston]].

==Biography==
With his then-wife, [[Nancy Rouillard Ludington]], he won the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] in [[pair skating]] four times, between 1957 and 1960, after having been the junior national champions in 1956.  They won bronze medals at the 1959 [[World Figure Skating Championships]] and [[1960 Winter Olympics]].  Ludington also won the 1958 U.S. junior (silver) dance championship, partnered with Judy Ann Lamar.

Following his competitive career, Ludington took up coaching.  His first pupils included [[Patricia Dineen|Patricia]] and [[Robert Dineen]], who were killed along with the rest of the U.S. team in the crash of [[Sabena Flight 548]] on their way to the 1961 World Championships.  Ludington was not on the plane because neither he nor the Dineens had the money to fund his travel expenses; it was the only World Championships between 1957 and the end of the century which he did not attend as either a competitor or a coach.

Ludington's best-known pupils include U.S. pair champions, Melissa Militano and Johny Johns, and [[Kitty Carruthers|Kitty]] and [[Peter Carruthers (figure skater)|Peter Carruthers]], the silver medalists in pair skating at the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].  He was also the coach of ice dancers [[Carol Fox (figure skater)|Carol Fox]] and [[Richard Dalley]] at those Olympic Games.  Ludington also coached Stacey Smith and John Summers, three-time national champion ice dancers, and US national pair silver medalists, Gale and Joel Fuhrman, and Lee Ann Miller and Billy Fauver, and US pair bronze medalists, Cozette Cady and Jack Courtney. 

After his divorce from [[Nancy Rouillard Ludington|Nancy Rouillard]], Ludington was married to Mary Batdorf, who is now better known as [[Mary Scotvold]].  They both taught skating at the Skating Club of Wilmington, in Wilmington, Delaware, and had a son, Michael. They were divorced in the mid-1970s.  He is now married to [[Karen Ludington]], another skating coach.
Their current students include [[Melissa Bulanhagui]].

Ludington is director of the Skating Science Development Center the [[University of Delaware Figure Skating Club]].  He was named to the [[World Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] in 1999 and the [[Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame]] in 2000.
