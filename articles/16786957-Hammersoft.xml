The name &quot;[[Preuschoff-Rucken]]&quot; was applied in the general area by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â1939), led by Capt. [[Alfred Ritscher]], for [[Franz Preuschoff]], [[engineer]] on the flying boat name with this feature may be arbitrary but is recommended for the sake of international uniformity and historical continuity.
