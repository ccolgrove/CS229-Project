A '''personal computer''' ('''PC''') is any general-purpose [[computer]] whose size, capabilities, and original sales price make it useful for individuals, and which is intended to be operated directly by an [[end-user]] with no intervening computer operator. In contrast, the batch processing or [[time-sharing system|time-sharing]] models allowed large expensive [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems to be used by many people, usually at the same time. Large data processing systems require a full-time staff to operate efficiently.

Software applications for personal computers include, but are not limited to, [[word processing]], [[spreadsheets]], [[databases]], [[Web browser]]s and [[e-mail]] clients, [[digital media]] playback, [[Personal computer game|games]], and myriad personal productivity and special-purpose software applications.  Modern personal computers often have connections to the [[Internet]],  allowing access to the [[World Wide Web]] and a wide range of other resources. Personal computers may be connected to a [[local area network]] (LAN), either by a cable or a wireless connection. A personal computer may be a [[desktop computer]] or  a [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], or a [[handheld PC]]. 

While early PC owners usually had to write their own programs to do anything useful with the machines, today's users have access to a wide range of [[commercial software]] and [[free software]], which is provided in ready-to-run or ready-to-[[compiler|compile]] form. Since the early 1990s, [[Microsoft]] software and [[Intel]] hardware have dominated much of the personal computer market, first with [[MS-DOS]] and then with the [[Wintel]] platform. Alternatives to Microsoft's [[Windows]] operating systems include [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Mac OS X]] and the open-source [[Linux]] OSes. [[AMD]] is the major alternative to Intel's [[central processing units]]. Applications and games for PCs are typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or OS manufacturers, whereas software for many mobile phones and other portable systems is approved and distributed through a centralized online store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Conlon, Tom |url=http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2010-01/ipad%E2%80%99s-closed-system-sometimes-i-hate-being-right |title=The iPadâs Closed System: Sometimes I Hate Being Right |publisher=Popular Science |date=29 January 2010 |quote=The iPad is not a personal computer in the sense that we currently understand. |accessdate-2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://gawker.com/5539717/steve-jobs-offers-world-freedom-from-porn?skyline=true&amp;s=i |title=Steve Jobs Offers World 'Freedom From Porn' |publisher=Gawker.com |date=15 May 2010 |quote=some traditional PC folks feel like their world is slipping away. |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July and August 2011, marketing businesses and journalists began to talk about the 'Post-PC Era', in which the desktop form factor was being replaced with more portable computing such as [[netbook|netbooks]], [[Tablet computer|Tablet PCs]], and [[smartphones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/virtualization/the-dawn-of-the-post-pc-era-not/3714?tag=nl.e539|title=The Dawn of the Post-PC Era.

{{Main|History of personal computers}}
{{See also|Microcomputer revolution}}

In what was later to be called [[The Mother of All Demos]], [[SRI International|SRI]] researcher [[Douglas Engelbart]] in 1968 gave a  preview of what would become the staples of daily working life in the 21st century - e-mail, hypertext, word processing, video conferencing, and the mouse. The demonstration required technical support staff and a mainframe time-sharing computer that were far too costly for individual business use at the time.

By the early 1970s, people in academic or research institutions had the opportunity for single-person use of a [[LINC|computer system]] in interactive mode for extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person.

In the 1970s [[HP 9800 series desktop computers|Hewlett Packard]] introduced fully [[BASIC]] programmable computers that fit entirely on top of a desk, including a keyboard, a small one-line display and printer. The [[Xerox Alto]], developed in 1973 at [[Xerox|Xerox's]] [[PARC_(company)|Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)]], had a graphical operating system ([[GUI]]) that later served as inspiration for [[Apple_Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s [[Macintosh]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows]] operating system. The [[Wang 2200]] of 1973 had a full-size [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) and cassette tape storage. The [[IBM 5100]] in 1975 had a small CRT display and could be programmed in BASIC and [[APL (programming language)|APL]]. These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses. The introduction of the [[microprocessor]], a single [[integrated circuit|chip]] with all the circuitry that formerly occupied large cabinets, led to the proliferation of personal computers after 1975.

Early personal computers&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; generally called [[microcomputers]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; were sold often in [[Electronic kit|kit]] form and in limited volumes, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. Minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions, and output was provided by front panel lamps. Practical use required adding peripherals such as keyboards, [[computer display]]s, disk drives, and printers. [[Micral]] N was the earliest commercial, non-kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor, the Intel 8008. It was built starting in 1972 and about 90,000 units were sold. In 1976 [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]] sold the [[Apple I|Apple I computer]] circuit board, which was fully prepared and contained about 30 chips. The first successfully mass marketed personal computer was the [[Commodore PET]] introduced in January 1977.  It was soon followed by the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] (usually referred to as the &quot;Apple ][&quot;) in June 1977, and the TRS-80 from Radio Shack in November 1977.  Mass-market ready-assembled computers allowed a wider range of people to use computers, focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware.

Through the late 1970s and into the 1980s, [[home computer|computer]]s were further developed for household use, with software for personal productivity, programming and games. One such machine, the [[Commodore 64]], totaled 17 million units sold, making it the best-selling single personal computer model of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reimer1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeremyreimer.com/total_share.html |title=Personal Computer Market Share: 1975â2004 |date=2 November 2009 |last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat larger and more expensive systems (although still low-cost compared with [[minicomputer]]s and [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s) were aimed at office and small business use. [[Workstation]]s are characterized by high-performance processors and graphics displays, with large local disk storage, networking capability, and running under a multitasking operating system.
[[Image:IBM PC 5150.jpg|thumb|[[IBM 5150]] as of 1981]]

Eventually, due to the [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market]], personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction. Business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound, and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers. Mass-market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before. Even local area networking, originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals, became a standard feature of personal computers used at home.

In 1982 &quot;The Computer&quot; was named [[Time Person of the Year|Machine of the Year]] by [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]].

===Market and sales===

[[File:Personal computers (million) ITU.png|thumb|Personal computers worldwide in million distinguished by developed and developing world]]
In 2001, 125 million personal computers were shipped in comparison to 48 thousand in 1977. More than 500 million personal computers were in use in 2002 and one [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] personal computers had been sold worldwide from the mid-1970s up to this time. Of the latter figure, 75 percent were professional or work related, while the rest were sold for personal or home use. About 81.5 percent of personal computers shipped had been [[desktop computer]]s, 16.4 percent [[laptop]]s and 2.1 percent [[Server (computing)|server]]s. The United States had received 38.8 percent (394 million) of the computers shipped, Europe 25 percent and 11.7 percent had gone to the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest-growing market as of 2002. The second billion was expected to be sold by 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanellos |first=Michael |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-940713.html |title=personal computers: More than 1 billion served |publisher=cnet news |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of all the households in [[Western Europe]] had a personal computer and a computer could be found in 40 percent of homes in United Kingdom, compared with only 13 percent in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2077986.stm |title=Computers reach one billion mark |publisher=BBC News |date=1 July 2002 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2008, the number of personal computers in use worldwide hit one billion, while another billion is expected to be reached by 2014. Mature markets like the United States, [[Western Europe]] and Japan accounted for 58 percent of the worldwide installed PCs. The [[emerging market]]s were expected to double their installed PCs by 2012 and to take 70 percent of the second billion PCs. About 180 million computers (16 percent of the existing installed base) were expected to be replaced and 35 million to be dumped into landfill in 2008.

In the [[developed world]], there has been a vendor tradition to keep adding functions to maintain high prices of personal computers. However, since the introduction of the [[One Laptop per Child]] foundation and its low-cost [[OLPC XO-1|XO-1]] laptop, the computing industry started to pursue the price too. Although introduced only one year earlier, there were 14 million [[netbook]]s sold in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olpcnews.com/use_cases/technology/4p_computing_olpc_impact.html |title=4P Computing - Negroponte's 14 Million Laptop Impact |publisher=OLPC News |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the regular computer manufacturers, companies making especially rugged versions of computers have sprung up, offering alternatives for people operating their machines in extreme weather or environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruggedpcreview.com/2_leaders.html |title=Rugged PC leaders |author=Conrad H.

[[Deloitte]] consulting firm predicts that in 2011 [[smartphones]] and [[tablet computers]] as computing devices will surpass the PCs sales. Pc era is far from over as PCs will remain the main computing platform.&lt;ref&gt;Tablets, smartphones to outsell PCs http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110210/tc_afp/itinternettelecomequipmentmobileconsumerproduct&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Average selling price ===
Selling prices of personal computers, unlike other consumer commodities, steadily declined due to lower costs of production and manufacture. Capabilities of the computers also increased.  In 1975, an Altair kit sold for only around US $400, but required customers to solder components into circuit boards; peripherals required to interact with the system in alphanumeric form instead of blinking lights would add another $2000, and the resultant system was only of use to hobbyists.&lt;ref name=Sussman85&gt;Marvin B. Sussman  ''Personal Computers and the Family'' Routledge, 1985 ISBN 086656361X  page 90&lt;/ref&gt;

At their introduction in 1981, the US $1,795 price of the [[Osborne 1]] and its competitor [[Kaypro]] was considered an attractive price point; these systems had text-only displays and only floppy disks for storage. By  1982, [[Michael Dell]] observed that a personal computer system selling at retail for about $3,000 US was made of components that cost the dealer about $600; typical gross margin on a computer unit was around $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;Kateri M. Drexler ''Icons of business: an encyclopedia of mavericks, movers, and shakers, Volume 1'',Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 ISBN 0313338639  page 102&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of personal computer purchases in the US in 1983 was about $4 billion, comparable to total sales of pet food.  By late 1998, the average selling price of personal computer systems in the United States had dropped below $1000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/9150/average_pc_price_drops_below_1000.html Nancy Weil , ''Average PC Price drops below $1000'', ''PC World'' December 1998, retrieved 2010 Nov 17&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Microsoft Windows]] systems, the [[average selling price]] (ASP) showed a decline in 2008/2009, possibly due to low-cost [[netbook]]s, drawing $569 for [[desktop computer]]s and $689 for [[laptop]]s at U.S. retail in August 2008. In 2009, ASP had further fallen to $533 for desktops and to $602 for notebooks by January and to $540 and $560 in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Netbooks-Are-Destroying-the-Laptop-Market-and-Microsoft-Needs-to-Act-Now-863307/ |title=Netbooks Are Destroying the Laptop Market and Microsoft Needs to Act Now |publisher=eWeek.com |author=Joe Wilcox |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research firm NPD, the average selling price of all Windows portable PCs has fallen from $659 in October 2008 to $519 in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/509556/Falling_PC_Prices_Pit_Microsoft_Against_PC_Makers |title=Falling PC Prices Pit Microsoft Against PC Makers |author=Shane O'Neill |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stationary===
==== Workstation ====
[[Image:SPARCstation 1.jpg|right|thumb|Sun [[SPARCstation]]

{{Main|Workstation}}
A workstation is a high-end personal computer designed for technical or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time, they are commonly connected to a [[local area network]] and run multi-user [[operating system]]s. Workstations are used for tasks such as [[computer-aided design]], drafting and modeling, computation-intensive scientific and engineering calculations,  image processing, [[architecture|architectural]] modeling, and [[computer graphics]] for animation and motion picture visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ralston | first=Anthony | coauthors=Reilly, Edwin | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Computer Science | title=Workstation | edition=Third Edition | year=1993 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold | location=New York | isbn=0442276796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Desktop computer ====
{{Main|Desktop computer}}
[[Image:Desktop personal computer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dell OptiPlex]] [[desktop computer]]]]


Prior to the wide spread of PCs a computer that could fit on a [[desk]] was considered remarkably small. Today the phrase usually indicates a particular style of [[computer case]]. Desktop computers come in a variety of  styles ranging from large vertical [[tower case]]s to [[small form factor]] models that can be tucked behind an [[LCD monitor]]. In this sense, the term 'desktop' refers specifically to a horizontally oriented case, usually intended to have the display screen placed on top to save space on the desk top. Most modern desktop computers have separate screens and keyboards.


===== Gaming Computer =====
{{Main|Gaming computer}}
Games have been on computers since 1962 when [[Spacewar!]] was released. Today Personal Computer Gaming or PC gaming is a very popular pastime. Gaming computers tend to also be about the looks of the case rather than just the specifications of the hardware. A gaming computer needs to be much more powerful than a PC that someone is using to do office work and to surf the internet. A Gaming Computer has to have a good graphics card so that it can process all the 3D models and shapes that are on the screen. In addition the [[Central processing unit]] or CPU has to do more work to calculate game mechanics, figure out gravity, and assist with the graphics and process the sound. Most serious gamers prefer to build their own computer or rig. This is because they can get exactly what they want and the price is a lot cheaper. When building a âhigh endâ computer the price is generally over $1000 with the motherboard costing from $300-$800 and the processor costing around $400-$500 and graphics cards that can cost more than $600. Many people say this is expensive but it's comparable to a video game console such as an [[Xbox 360]] or a [[PlayStation 3]] as proced when released. In addition, a computer can be used for much more than just gaming, and a $1000 computer will last at least 5 years. The choice of parts to build a computer are vast as many companies build different parts of the system.

===== Single unit =====
{{further|[[Desktop computer#All-in-one|All-in-one computer]]}}
Single unit PCs (also known as all-in-one PCs) are a subtype of desktop computers, which combine the monitor and case of the computer within a single unit. The monitor often utilizes a [[touchscreen]] as an optional method of user input, however detached keyboards and mice are normally still included. The inner components of the PC are often located directly behind the monitor, and many are built similarly to laptops.

==== Nettop ====
{{Main|Nettop}}
[[Image:ASUS Win dev.....jpg|thumb|Asus I7 High-Res Notebook]] 
A subtype of desktops, called [[Nettop (computer)|nettop]]s, was introduced by [[Intel]] in February 2008 to describe low-cost, lean-function, desktop computers. A similar subtype of laptops (or notebooks) are the [[netbook]]s (see below). The product line features the new [[Intel Atom]] processor which specially enables them to consume less power and to be built into small enclosures.

==== Home theater PC ====
{{Main|Home theater PC}}
[[Image:Home theater PC front with keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|[[Antec]] Fusion V2 [[home theater PC]] with [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] on top.]]

A home theater PC (HTPC) is a convergence device that combines the functions of a personal computer and a [[digital video recorder]].  It is connected to a [[television]] or a television-sized [[computer display]] and is often used as a digital photo, music, video player, TV receiver and digital video recorder. Home theater PCs are also referred to as media center systems or [[media server]]s. The general goal in a HTPC is usually to combine many or all components of a [[home cinema|home theater]] setup into one box.  They can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the PC, or can be cobbled together out of discrete components as is commonly done with [[MythTV]], [[Windows Media Center]], [[GB-PVR]], [[SageTV]], Famulent or [[LinuxMCE]].

===Mobile===
==== Laptop ====
{{Main|Laptop}}


[[File:MSI Laptop computer.jpg|thumb|A modern laptop computer]] 

A laptop computer or simply [[laptop]], also called a notebook computer, is a small personal computer designed for portability. Usually all of the interface hardware needed to operate the laptop, such as [[USB|USB ports]] (previously [[parallel port|parallel]] and [[serial port]]s), graphics card, sound channel, etc., are built in to a single unit. Laptops contain high capacity [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] that can power the device for extensive periods of time, enhancing portability. Once the battery charge is depleted, it will have to be recharged through a power outlet. In the interest of saving power, weight and space, they usually share RAM with the video channel, slowing their performance compared to an equivalent desktop machine.

One main drawback of the laptop is sometimes, due to the size and configuration of components, relatively little can be done to upgrade the overall computer from its original design. Internal upgrades are either not manufacturer recommended, can damage the laptop if done with poor care or knowledge, or in some cases impossible, making the desktop PC more modular. Some internal upgrades, such as memory and hard disks upgrades are often easy, a display or keyboard upgrade is usually impossible. The laptop has the same access as the desktop to the wide variety of devices, such as external displays, mice, cameras, storage devices and keyboards, which may be attached externally through USB ports and other less common ports such as external video.

A subtype of notebooks, called [[subnotebook]]s, are computers with most of the features of a standard laptop computer but smaller. They are larger than [[hand-held computer]]s, and usually run full versions of desktop/laptop operating systems. [[Ultra-Mobile PC]]s (UMPC) are usually considered subnotebooks, or more specifically, subnotebook [[tablet computer|Tablet PC]]s (see below). [[Netbook]]s are sometimes considered in this category, though they are sometimes separated in a category of their own (see below).

===== Desktop replacement =====
{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}
[[File:Acer Aspire 8920 Gemstone by Georgy.JPG|thumb|An Acer 18'4 inch screen Desktop Replacement Laptop]] 

A '''desktop replacement computer''' ('''DTR''') is a personal computer that provides the full capabilities of a [[desktop computer]] while remaining [[Mobile computing|mobile]].  They are often larger, bulkier [[laptop]]s. Because of their increased size, this class of computer usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally used in smaller portable computers and can have a relatively limited battery capacity (or none at all). Some use a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance at the expense of battery life. These are sometimes called '''desknotes''', a [[portmanteau]] of the words &quot;desktop&quot; and &quot;notebook,&quot; though the term is also applied to desktop replacement computers in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html Desktop notebooks stake their claim], accessed October 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short period since their appearance, netbooks have grown in size and features, now converging with new smaller, lighter notebooks. By mid 2009, CNET noted &quot;the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other,&quot; noting &quot;the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnogg&quot;/&gt;

==== Tablet PC ====
{{Main|Tablet personal computer}}

A tablet PC is a [[Laptop|notebook]] or slate-shaped [[mobile computer]].&lt;!-- hid the following unsourced and incomprehensible (what does &quot;their&quot; refer to?) clause: first introduced by [[Pen computing]] in the early 90s with their PenGo Tablet Computer and popularized by Microsoft.--&gt; Its [[touchscreen]] or [[graphics tablet/screen hybrid]] technology allows the user to operate the computer with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]] or digital pen, or a fingertip, instead of a keyboard or mouse. The form factor offers a more mobile way to interact with a computer. Tablet PCs are often used where normal notebooks are impractical or unwieldy, or do not provide the needed functionality.

==== Ultra-mobile PC ====
{{Main|Ultra-mobile PC}}
[[Image:UMPC Samsung-Q1-Ultra.JPG|thumb|[[Samsung Q1]] [[Ultra-Mobile PC]].]]
The ultra-mobile PC (UMPC) is a specification for a [[small form factor]] of [[tablet computer|tablet PC]]s. It was developed as a joint development exercise by [[Microsoft]], [[Intel]], and [[Samsung]], among others. Current UMPCs typically feature the Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Linux [[operating system]] and low-voltage Intel [[Atom]] or [[VIA C7-M]] processors.

==== Pocket PC ====
{{Main|Pocket PC}}
[[Image:O2xda2i.jpg|thumb|right|110px|An O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[pocket PC]]]]
A pocket PC is a hardware specification for a handheld-sized computer ([[personal digital assistant]]) that runs the [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Mobile]] [[operating system]]. It may have the capability to run an alternative [[operating system]] like [[NetBSD]] or [[Linux]]. It has many of the capabilities of modern desktop [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]].

Currently there are tens of thousands of [[software|applications]] for handhelds adhering to the Microsoft Pocket PC specification, many of which are [[freeware]]. Some of these devices also include [[mobile phone]] features and thus actually represent a [[smartphone]]. Microsoft compliant Pocket PCs can also be used with many other add-ons like [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]], [[barcode]] readers, [[RFID]] readers, and cameras. In 2007, with the release of Windows Mobile 6, Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme. Devices without an integrated phone are called Windows Mobile Classic instead of Pocket PC. Devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called Windows Mobile Professional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketpcmag.com/_archives/jun07/newwmdev.aspx New Windows Mobile 6 Devices :: Jun/Jul 2007]{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}

Mass-market consumer computers use highly standardized components and so are simple for an end user to assemble into a working system. A typical [[desktop computer]] consists of a [[computer case]] which holds the [[Computer power supply|power supply]], [[motherboard]], [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] and often an [[optical disc drive]]. External devices such as a [[computer monitor]] or [[visual display unit]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], and a [[pointing device]] are usually found in a personal computer.

The motherboard connects all processor, memory and peripheral devices together. The [[RAM]], graphics card and processor are mounted directly onto the motherboard. The [[central processing unit]] microprocessor chip plugs into a [[cpu socket|socket]]. Expansion memory plugs into memory sockets. Some motherboards have the video display adapter, sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard.  Others use [[expansion slot]]s for graphics cards, network cards, or other [[Input/output|I/O]] devices.  Disk drives for mass storage are connected to the mother board with a cable, and to the power supply through another cable. Usually disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard; formerly, expansion chassis were made for additional disk storage.

The graphics and sound card can have a [[break out box]] to keep the analog parts away from the [[electromagnetic radiation]] inside the computer case. For really large amounts of data, a [[tape drive]] can be used or (extra) hard disks can be put together in an external case.

The keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an I/O panel on the back of the computer. The monitor is also connected to the I/O panel, either through an onboard port on the motherboard, or a port on the graphics card.

The [[computer hardware|hardware]] capabilities of personal computers can sometimes be extended by the addition of [[expansion card]]s connected via an expansion [[computer bus|bus]]. Some standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers as of 2005 are [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] (a high-speed PCI bus dedicated to graphics adapters), and [[PCI Express]]. Most personal computers as of 2005 have multiple physical [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] expansion slots. Many also include an AGP bus and expansion slot or a PCI Express bus and one or more expansion slots, but few PCs contain both buses.

Toxic chemicals, such as lead and mercury, are found in certain pieces of PC hardware. 
[[Lead]] is found in the [[Cathode ray tube]] (CRT), which is located inside the [[Computer monitor|monitor]], as well as in the [[Printed circuit board]]. While daily PC users are not exposed to these toxic elements, danger arises in [[computer recycling]], and thus stems the controversy of [[electronic waste]] (e-Waste). The process of computer recycling involves workers responsible for manually breaking down computers, which leads to inevitable exposure to these toxic chemicals and serious health issues. Lead is known to cause damage to the central nervous system, kidneys, and slow down child brain development. 
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], another toxic element found in PCs, is located in the screen's [[fluorescent lamp]], laser light generators in the [[optical disk drive]], and in mercury batteries in the circuit board and [[expansion cards]]. Even the smallest amount of mercury, if it is inhaled or digested can cause serious brain damage.
Other chemicals found in PCs are [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), and [[barium]], which are also found in the [[motherboard]] and other crucial pieces of the computer.
In each individual computer, about 17% of the computer is lead, [[copper]], [[zinc]], mercury, and cadmium, 23% is [[plastic]] (which usually gets burned and causes extreme air pollution), and 14% is [[Aluminium]] and 20% is [[Iron]] (the last two do not cause extreme health risks, however they are natural elements and do not decompose, which means they continue to take up space unless they are recycled into new computers). Although there is not a huge amount of these hazardous chemicals in each individual computer, even the smallest amount of lead or mercury can ruin a communityâs drinking water, or cause serious brain damage.

=== Computer case ===
{{Main|Computer case}}
[[Image:Stripped-computer-case.JPG|right|thumb|A stripped [[ATX]] case lying on its side.]]
A computer case is the enclosure that contains the main components of a [[computer]]. Cases are usually constructed from [[steel]] or [[aluminum]], although other materials such as [[wood]] and  [[plastic]] have been used. Cases can come in many different sizes, or ''[[motherboard form factor|form factor]]s''. The size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the form factor of the [[motherboard]] that it is designed to accommodate, since this is the largest and most central component of most computers. Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only the ''internal'' dimensions and layout of the case.  Form factors for [[rack-mounted]] and [[blade server|blade]] [[server (computing)|servers]] may include precise ''external'' dimensions as well, since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures.

Currently, the most popular form factor for desktop computers is [[ATX]], although [[microATX]] and [[small form factor]]s have become very popular for a variety of uses.  Companies like [[Shuttle Inc.]] and [[Acer (company)|AOpen]] have popularized small cases, for which [[FlexATX]] is the most common motherboard size.

=== Power supply unit ===
{{Main|Power supply unit (computer)}}
[[Image:PSU-Open1.jpg|right|thumb|Computer [[power supply]] unit with top cover removed.]]
The power supply unit converts [[mains electricity|general purpose electric current from the mains]] to [[direct current]] for the other components of the computer.

===Processor===
{{Main|Central processing unit}}
[[Image:AMD 64X2 Dual-Core.jpg|thumb|right|[[AMD]] [[Athlon 64 X2]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]].]]
The central processing unit, or CPU, is that part of a computer which executes software [[computer program|program]] instructions. In older computers this circuitry was formerly on several [[printed circuit board]]s, but in PCs is a single integrated circuit. Nearly all PCs contain a type of CPU known as a [[microprocessor]]. The microprocessor often plugs into the motherboard using one of many different types of sockets. [[IBM PC compatible]] computers use an [[x86]]-compatible processor, usually made by [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[VIA Technologies]] or [[Transmeta]]. Apple Macintosh computers were initially built with the [[Motorola]] 680x0 family of processors, then switched to the [[PowerPC]] series (a [[RISC]] architecture jointly developed by [[Apple Computer]], [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]]), but as of 2006, Apple switched again, this time to x86-compatible processors by [[Intel]]. Modern CPUs are equipped with a [[computer fan|fan]] attached via [[heat sink]].
{{-}}

=== Motherboard ===
{{Main|Motherboard}}
[[Image:Asus a8n VMCSM02.jpg|thumb|right|A [[motherboard]]]]
The motherboard, also referred to as systemboard or mainboard, is the primary [[circuit board]] within a personal computer. Many other components connect directly or indirectly to the motherboard. Motherboards usually contain one or more CPUs, supporting circuitry - usually [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) - providing the interface between the [[central processing unit|CPU]] memory and input/output peripheral circuits, main memory, and facilities for initial setup of the computer immediately after power-on (often called boot [[firmware]] or, in IBM PC compatible computers, a [[BIOS]]). &lt;!-- BIOS is software, remember? --&gt; In many portable and embedded personal computers, the motherboard houses nearly all of the PC's core components. Often a motherboard will also contain one or more peripheral buses and physical connectors for expansion purposes. Sometimes a secondary [[daughter board]] is connected to the motherboard to provide further expandability or to satisfy space constraints.

=== Main memory ===
{{Main|Primary storage}}
[[Image:DDRSDRAM400-1GB.jpg|thumb|right|1GB [[DDR SDRAM]] PC-3200 module]]
A PC's main memory is fast storage that is directly accessible by the CPU, and is used to store the currently executing program and immediately needed data. PCs use [[semiconductor]] [[random access memory]] (RAM) of various kinds such as [[dynamic random access memory|DRAM]], SDRAM or [[static random access memory|SRAM]] as their primary storage. Which exact kind depends on cost/performance issues at any particular time. Main memory is much faster than mass storage devices like [[hard disk]]s or [[optical disc]]s, but is usually [[volatile memory|volatile]], meaning it does not retain its contents (instructions or data) in the absence of power, and is much more expensive for a given capacity than is most mass storage. Main memory is generally not suitable for long-term or archival data storage.

=== Hard disk ===
{{Main|Hard disk drive}}
[[Image:Hdd.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Western Digital]] 250 GB [[hard disk drive]].]]
Mass storage devices store programs and data even when the power is off; they do require power to perform read and write functions during usage. Although [[flash memory]] has dropped in cost, the prevailing form of mass storage in personal computers is still the [[hard disk]].
&lt;!-- Generalize and clean up this article section. --&gt;
The disk drives use a sealed head/disk assembly (HDA) which was first introduced by IBM's &quot;Winchester&quot; disk system. The use of a sealed assembly allowed the use of positive air pressure to drive out particles from the surface of the disk, which improves reliability.

If the mass storage controller provides for expandability, a PC may also be upgraded by the addition of extra hard disk or [[optical disc drive]]s. For example, [[Blu-ray|BD-ROM]]s, [[DVD-RW]]s, and various optical disc recorders may all be added by the user to certain PCs. Standard internal storage device connection interfaces are [[Parallel ATA|PATA]], [[Serial ATA]], [[SCSI]]

=== Video card ===
{{Main|Video card}}
[[Image:PowerColor Radeon X850XT PE.jpg|thumb|right|[[ATI Technologies|ATI]] [[Radeon]] [[video card]]]]

The [[video card]] - otherwise called a graphics card, graphics adapter or video adapter - processes and renders the graphics output from the computer to the [[computer display]], and is an essential part of the modern computer. On older models, and today on budget models, graphics circuitry tended to be integrated with the motherboard but, for modern flexible machines, they are supplied in [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]], or [[PCI Express]] format.

When the IBM PC was introduced, most existing business-oriented personal computers used text-only display adapters and had no graphics capability. Home computers at that time had graphics compatible with television signals, but with low resolution by modern standards owing to the limited memory available to the eight-bit processors available at the time.

=== Visual display unit ===
{{Main|Visual display unit}}
[[Image:Flat monitor.svg|thumb|right|A flat-panel [[LCD monitor]].]]
A visual display unit (or monitor) is a piece of [[electrical equipment]], usually separate from the computer case, which displays viewable [[image]]s generated by a [[computer]] without producing a permanent record. The word &quot;monitor&quot; is used in other contexts; in particular in [[television broadcasting]], where a [[television]] picture is displayed to a high standard on a [[broadcast reference monitor]]. A computer display device is usually either a [[cathode ray tube]] or some form of flat panel such as a [[TFT LCD]]. The monitor comprises the display device, [[electronic circuit|circuitry]] to generate a picture from [[electronics|electronic]] [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] sent by the computer, and an [[enclosure (electrical)|enclosure]] or case. Within the computer, either as an integral part or a plugged-in [[Expansion card]], there is circuitry to convert internal [[data (computing)|data]] to a format compatible with a monitor.  The images from monitors originally contained only text, but as [[Graphical user interface]]s emerged and became common, they began to display more images and multimedia content.

=== Keyboard ===
{{Main|Keyboard (computing)}}
[[Image:ModelM.jpg|thumb|right|A computer keyboard]]
In computing, a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] is an arrangement of buttons that each correspond to a function, letter, or number.  They are the primary devices of inputting text.  In most cases, they contain an array of keys specifically organized with the corresponding letters, numbers, and functions printed or engraved on the button.  They are generally designed around an operators language, and many different versions for different languages exist.
In English, the most common layout is the [[QWERTY]] layout, which was originally used in [[typewriter]]s.  They have evolved over time, and have been modified for use in computers with the addition of function keys, number keys, arrow keys, and OS specific keys.  Often, specific functions can be achieved by pressing multiple keys at once or in succession, such as inputting characters with accents or opening a task manager.  Programs use keyboard shortcuts very differently and all use different keyboard shortcuts for different program specific operations, such as refreshing a [[web page]] in a [[web browser]] or selecting all text in a word processor.

=== Mouse ===
{{Main|Mouse (computing)}}
[[File:Assorted computer mice - MfK Bern.jpg|thumb|Computer mice built between 1986 and 2007]]
A [[Mouse (computing)|Mouse]] on a computer is a small, slideable device that users hold and slide around to point at, click on, and sometimes drag objects on screen in a graphical user interface using a pointer on screen.  Almost all Personal Computers have mice.  It may be plugged into a computer's rear mouse socket, or as a [[USB]] device, or, more recently, may be connected wirelessly via a USB antenna or Bluetooth antenna.  In the past, they had a single button that users could press down on the device to &quot;click&quot; on whatever the pointer on the screen was hovering over.  Now, however, many Mice have two or three buttons(possibly ''more''); a &quot;right click&quot; function button on the mouse, which performs a secondary action on a selected object, and a scroll wheel, which users can rotate using their fingers to &quot;scroll&quot; up or down.  The scroll wheel can also be pressed down, and therefore be used as a third button. Some mouse wheels may be ''tilted'' from side to side to allow sideways scrolling. Different programs make use of these functions differently, and may scroll horizontally by default with the scroll wheel, open different menus with different buttons, among others. These functions may be user defined through software utilities.

Mice traditionally detected movement and communicated with the computer with an internal &quot;mouse ball&quot;; and used optical [[encoders]] to detect rotation of the ball and tell the computer where the mouse has moved.  However, these systems were subject to low durability, accuracy and required internal cleaning.  Modern mice use optical technology to directly trace movement of the surface under the mouse and are much more accurate, durable and almost maintenance free.  They work on a wider variety of surfaces and can even operate on walls, ceilings or other non-horizontal surfaces.

;Mass storage
All computers require either fixed or removable storage for their operating system, programs and user generated material.&lt;br /&gt;
Formerly the  5Â¼&amp;nbsp;inch and 3Â½&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy drive]] were the principal forms of removable storage for backup of user files and distribution of software.

As memory sizes increased, the capacity of the floppy did not keep pace; the [[Zip drive]] and other higher-capacity removable media were introduced but never became as prevalent as the floppy drive.

By the late 1990s the [[optical drive]], in [[CD]] and later [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]], became the main method for software distribution, and writeable media provided backup and file interchange. Floppy drives have become uncommon in desktop personal computers since about 2000, and were dropped from many laptop systems even earlier.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[NeXT]] computer introduced in 1988 did not include a floppy drive, which at the time was unusual.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[home computer]]s used [[Compact Cassette|compact audio cassettes]] for file storage; these were at the time a very low cost storage solution, but were displaced by floppy disk drives when manufacturing costs dropped, by the mid 1980s.

A second generation of tape recorders was provided when [[Videocassette recorder]]s were pressed into service as backup media for larger disk drives.  All these systems were less reliable and slower than purpose-built magnetic tape drives. Such tape drives were uncommon in consumer-type personal computers but were a necessity in business or industrial use.

Interchange of data such as photographs from digital cameras is greatly expedited by installation of a [[card reader]], which often is compatible with several forms of [[flash memory]]. It is usually faster and more convenient to move large amounts of data by removing the card from the mobile device, instead of communicating with the mobile device through a [[USB]] interface.

A [[USB flash drive]] today performs much of the data transfer and backup functions formerly done with floppy drives, [[Zip disk]]s and other devices.  Main-stream current operating systems for personal computers provide standard support for flash drives, allowing interchange even between computers using different processors and operating systems. The compact size and lack of moving parts or dirt-sensitive media, combined with low cost for high capacity, have made flash drives a popular and useful accessory for any personal computer user.

The operating system (e.g.: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Linux or many others) can be located on any storage, but typically it is on a hard disks. A [[Live CD]] is the running of a OS directly from a CD. While this is slow compared to storing the OS on a hard drive, it is typically used for installation of operating systems, demonstrations, system recovery, or other special purposes. Large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard drives of similar size (as of mid-2008) but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight, small size and low power requirements.

== Software ==
{{Main|Computer software}}
[[Image:OpenOffice.org Writer.png|thumb|A [[screenshot]] of the [[OpenOffice.org Writer]] software]]
Computer software is a general term used to describe a collection of [[computer program]]s, [[procedures]] and documentation that perform some tasks on a computer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0
| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ
| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software
| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term includes [[application software]] such as [[word processor]]s which perform productive tasks for users, [[system software]] such as [[operating system]]s, which interface with [[hardware]] to provide the necessary services for application software, and [[middleware]] which controls and co-ordinates [[Distributed computing|distributed systems]].

Software applications for [[word processing]], [[Internet]] browsing, [[Internet fax]]ing, [[e-mail]] and other digital messaging, [[multimedia]] playback, [[computer game]] play and [[computer programming]] are common. The user of a modern personal computer may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs, but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer. Therefore, most [[software]] written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use, or &quot;[[usability|user-friendliness]]&quot; in mind. However, the [[software industry]] continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers, targeted at both the expert and the non-expert user.

=== Operating system ===
{{Main|Operating system}}{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}
An operating system (OS) manages computer resources and provides programmers with an [[User interface|interface]] used to access those resources. An operating system processes system data and user input, and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system. An operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating [[Computer data storage|memory]], prioritizing system requests, controlling [[input/output|input and output]] devices, facilitating [[computer networking]] and managing files.

Common contemporary desktop OSs are Microsoft Windows, [[Mac OS X]], Linux, [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[FreeBSD]]. Windows, Mac, and Linux all have server and personal variants. With the exception of Microsoft Windows, the designs of each of the aforementioned OSs were inspired by, or directly inherited from, the [[Unix]] operating system. [[Unix]] was developed at [[Bell Labs]] beginning in the late 1960s and spawned the development of numerous free and proprietary operating systems.

==== Microsoft Windows ====
{{Main|Microsoft Windows}}
Microsoft Windows is the collective brand name of several [[software]] [[operating system]]s by [[Microsoft]]. Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named ''Windows'' in November 1985 as an add-on to [[MS-DOS]] in response to the growing interest in [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs)&lt;ref name=aboutcomnov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/Windows.htm?rd=1 |title=The Unusual History of Microsoft Windows |author=Mary Bellis |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=linuxworld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;940707233;fp;2;fpid;1 |title=IDC: Consolidation to Windows won't happen |publisher=Linuxworld |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; generated by Apple's [[1984 (advertisement)|1984]] introduction of the [[Macintosh]]. The most recent client version of Windows is [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] which was available at retail on October 22, 2009.

==== Mac OS X ====
{{Main|Mac OS X}}
Mac OS X is a line of [[operating system]]s developed, marketed, and sold by [[Apple Inc.]]. Mac OS X is the successor to the original [[Mac OS]], which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. Mac OS X is a Unix-based [[graphical user interfaces|graphical]] operating system. The most recent version of Mac OS X is [[Mac OS X Lion]].

====AmigaOS====
{{Main|AmigaOS}}
AmigaOS is the default native operating system of the Amiga personal computer. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Early versions (1.0-3.9) run on the Motorola 68k series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors, while the newer AmigaOS 4 runs only on PowerPC microprocessors.
On top of a preemptive multitasking kernel called Exec, it includes an abstraction of the Amiga's unique hardware, a disk operating system called AmigaDOS, a windowing system API called Intuition and a graphical user interface called Workbench. A command line interface called AmigaShell is also available and integrated into the system. The GUI and the CLI complement each other and share the same privileges.
The current holder of the Amiga intellectual properties is Amiga Inc. They oversaw the development of AmigaOS 4 but did not develop it themselves, contracting it instead to Hyperion Entertainment. On 20 December 2006, Amiga Inc terminated Hyperion's license to continue development of AmigaOS 4. However, in 30 September 2009, Hyperion was granted an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to use, develop, modify, commercialize, distribute and market AmigaOS 4.x and subsequent versions of AmigaOS (including AmigaOS 5).

==== Linux ====

Linux is a family of [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of [[free software]] and [[open source]] development: typically all underlying [[source code]] can be freely modified, used, and redistributed by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Linux Online â About the Linux Operating System | url = http://www.linux.org/info/index.html | publisher = Linux.org | accessdate = 2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Linux&quot; comes from the [[Linux kernel]], started in 1991 by [[Linus Torvalds]]. The system's [[system utility|utilities]] and [[library (computer science)|libraries]] usually come from the [[GNU]] operating system, announced in 1983 by [[Richard Stallman]]. The GNU contribution is the basis for the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|alternative name]] GNU/Linux.&lt;ref name=&quot;lsag&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/sag.html#GNU-OR-NOT | title = Linux System Administrator's Guide | chapter = 1.1 | edition = version 0.9 | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2007-01-18 | first = Alex | last = Weeks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for its use in [[server (computing)|server]]s as part of the [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] application stack, Linux is supported by corporations such as [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Novell]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Red Hat]], [[Canonical Ltd.]] and [[Sun Microsystems]]. It is used as an operating system for a wide variety of computer [[hardware]], including [[desktop computer]]s, [[netbooks]], [[supercomputers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Linux rules supercomputers | url = http://www.forbes.com/home/enterprisetech/2005/03/15/cz_dl_0315linux.html | last = Lyons | first = Daniel | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | work=Forbes | date=15 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; video game systems, such as the [[PlayStation 3]], several [[arcade games]], and [[embedded devices]] such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[portable media player]]s, [[Router (computing)|routers]], and [[stage lighting]] systems.

=== Applications ===

A computer user will apply application software to carry out a specific task.  [[System software]] supports applications and provides common services such as memory management, network connectivity, or device drivers; all of which may be used by applications but which are not directly of interest to the end user.  A simple, if imperfect [[analogy]] in the world of hardware would be the relationship of an electric light bulb (an application) to an electric power generation plant (a system).  The power plant merely generates electricity, not itself of any real use until harnessed to an application like the electric light that performs a service that benefits the user.

Typical examples of software applications are [[word processor]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s, and [[media player (application software)|media player]]s. Multiple applications bundled together as a package are sometimes referred to as an ''application suite''. [[Microsoft Office]] and [[OpenOffice.org]], which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several other discrete applications, are typical examples. The separate applications in a suite usually have a [[user interface]] that has some commonality making it easier for the user to learn and use each application. And often they may have some capability to interact with each other in ways beneficial to the user. For example, a spreadsheet might be able to be embedded in a word processor document even though it had been created in the separate spreadsheet application.

[[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software include spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, graphics and animation scripts. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.

==Disposal of==
Personal Computers are recycled in different methods, but they can also become a large contributor to the 50 million tons of waste of discarded electronic goods that is being generated annually, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. In order to solve the issue of [[electronic waste]] affecting developing countries and the environment, an [[Extended producer responsibility]] act was implemented. Organizations, such as, the [[Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition]], [[Basel Action Network]], Toxics Link India, SCOPE, and [[Greenpeace]] contribute to the strategy. The [[Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition]] and BAN (Basel Action Network) teamed up with 32 electronic recyclers in the US and Canada to create an e-steward program due to the lack of national legislation an regulation for the exporting and importing of electronic waste. The creation of an e-steward program created another option for manufacturers and customers to dispose of their electronic waste properly. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition founded the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, which is a coalition that advocates for the production of environmentally friendly products. The TakeBack Coalition works with policy makers, recyclers, and smart businesses to get manufacturers to take full responsibility of their products. There are organizations opposing EPR, such as the [[Reason Foundation]] opposes the EPR for two main reasons.  The first reason is that the EPR relies on the idea that is the manufacturers pay for the harm they do to the environment, they will learn their lesson.  The second reason is that the EPR assumes the current design practices are environmentally inefficient.  The Reason Foundation claims that manufacturers are moving toward reduced material use and energy use instead.
