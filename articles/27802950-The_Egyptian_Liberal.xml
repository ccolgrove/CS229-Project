The '''Jebel al-Zayt oil spill''' was an  [[oil spill]] in the [[Red Sea]], considered to be the largest [[offshore drilling|offshore]] spill in [[Egypt]]ian history. The spill polluted around {{convert|100|mi}} of coastline including tourist beach resorts. Oil company officials in the port city of [[Suez]] said the spill was caused by a leak from an offshore oil platform in [[Jebel al-Zayt]] north of [[Hurghada]] owned by the [[Egyptian government]]'s state-owned oil company, [[Geisum Oil]].

The platform began leaking on about 16 June 2010, and the leak was sealed by June 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt Eco-Group HEPCA Reports Red Sea Spill is Capped, Beaches Cleaned |author=Karin Kloosterman |url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2010/06/24/23137/egypt-oil-spill-hurgada/ |newspaper=Green Prophet |date=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
