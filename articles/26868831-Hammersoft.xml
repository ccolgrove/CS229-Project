In the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections]] on 30 September 2007, the bloc was part of the [[Our UkraineâPeople's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] alliance, that won 72 out of 450 seats.

[[Yuriy Lutsenko]] is the party leader.

==History==
The electoral bloc was created on April 13, 2007 and was based on the [[Civil Movement &quot;People's Self-Defense&quot;|civil movement]] that was created several months earlier. The bloc consists of two parties ''[[Forward, Ukraine!]]'' and ''[[Christian Democratic Union (Ukraine)|Christian-Democratic Union]]''. It participated in the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections]] of 2007 later forming a deputy group within the [[Our UkraineâPeople's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] alliance.

In July 2007, the old [[Our Ukraine bloc]] had been reorganized with Civil Movement &quot;People's Self-Defense&quot; into the [[Our UkraineâPeople's Self-Defense Bloc]] for the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]] in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 parties signed declaration on creating united democratic forces bloc|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-202196.html|work=The Jameston Foundation|date=July 5, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The member parties had planned to merge into a single party in December 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New bloc backs Ukraine president|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6929336.stm|work=The Jameston Foundation|date=August 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on November 16, 2007 [[Peopleâs Self-Defense]] decided to end its participation in the process of forming a united party&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/11/16/9443.htm Lutsenko Refuses to Join New NU-NS Party / Ukrayinska Pravda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; since then that process is unclear&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.razom.org.ua/en/news/20086/ News Site RAZOM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. The alliance currently holds 72 out of 450 parliamentary seats.
