==Background/history==
{{Ref improve section|date=March 2010}}
Around [[500 B.C.]], a band of [[Shoshone]]an-speaking Indians established settlements in what is now the [[San Gabriel Valley]]. These [[Native Americans in the United States|native Americans]] came to be called the GabrieliÃ±o Indians (after San Gabriel, the local mission) by early [[Spain|Spanish]] explorers, but now prefer to be called the [[Tongva people|Tongva]]. The Tongva did not practice agriculture, but instead relied upon the wild seeds, berries, and plants that grew near the rivers and marshlands. Since the San Gabriel Valley area was home to large numbers of oak trees such as [[coast live oak]] and [[interior live oak]], a staple of the Tongva diet was an [[acorn]] mush made by boiling acorn flour.

Duarte's history with [[Europe]]ans dates back to 1769, when all land in [[California]] was claimed by the [[Spanish monarchy|king of Spain]]. The first Europeans visited the San Gabriel Valley, including Duarte, during a 1769 expedition from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to [[Monterey Bay]] commanded by [[Gaspar de PortolÃ |Don Gaspar de PortolÃ ]]. Accompanying PortolÃ  was a [[Franciscan]] priest from [[JunÃ­pero Serra|Father Junipero Serra's]] order in [[Mexico]], [[Juan Crespi]], who served as the diarist of the expedition. Much of what is known of early California is known only from the detailed descriptions recorded by Crespi.

On September 8, 1771, the Franciscans established the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcangel]] in the San Gabriel Valley.&lt;ref&gt;''Duarte View'', March/April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} The mission was a resting point for early California travelers and gathered most of the native Tongva into an agricultural lifestyle. Following [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican independence]] in 1821, the mission lands were nationalized.

On May 10, 1841, the governor of [[Alta California]], [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], granted to former Mexican corporal AndrÃ©s Duarte and his wife nearly {{convert|7000|acre|km2|0}} of prime land in the central-northern San Gabriel Valley. Duarte named his new holdings &quot;[[Rancho Azusa de Duarte]]&quot;. The name ''Azusa'' was derived from ''Asuksa-gna'', the name of the Tongva settlement on the [[Foothills of California]], on the western side of the alluvial fan where the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] exits the San Gabriel Mountains; a portion of this area forms the northeastern-most corner of Duarte.  That land grant now comprises portions of [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], portions of [[Monrovia, California|Monrovia]], all of [[Bradbury, California|Bradbury]], all of Duarte, portions of [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]], portions of [[Azusa, California|Azusa]] and a portion of [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]].  Corporal Duarte had the local Indians build a small hut for his family and help him plant a kitchen garden and orchards near &quot;the Indian Springs of the Asuksas&quot; in Fish Canyon.

Mexico ceded Alta California to the United States in 1848.  In 1851, the American Congress passed a bill that established a [[Public Land Commission|Board of Land Commissioners]] whose duty was to determine the validity of all grants of Alta California land by Spanish and Mexican authorities.
  
Corporal Duarte began incurring legal expenses and other debts, which he defrayed by selling portions of his Rancho.  This first sale was a {{convert|225|acre|km2|sing=on}} parcel at the southern end of the Rancho to Michael Whistler and two unidentified colleagues.  Whistler later bought out his colleagues and sold the entire parcel to Dr. Nehemiah Beardslee, who started the first school in Duarte (which now bears his surname) and laid out the first section of Duarteâs water lines.  Corporal Duarte divided much of the Rancho's remainder into {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} plots and sold them individually.  Corporal Duarte finally won a favorable ruling from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] for his land grant case in 1878, but by then he had sold the entire Rancho.

Many of Duarteâs earliest pioneer families came to Duarte in the mid-19th century for their health, the pleasant climate, and the fertile soil. English settlers, Americans from the [[Midwest]] and [[Deep South]], [[Latino]]s who remained from the Rancho and Japanese immigrants enabled Duarte to grow into a thriving agricultural community specializing in citrus production.

Two medical institutions were started in Duarte in the early part of the 20th century. In 1928, the Jewish Consumptive Relief Association started a tuberculosis sanitarium in the form of a small [[tent city]] on {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of land south of Duarte Road. This later evolved into the world-renowned [[City of Hope National Medical Center]], a recognized leader in fighting cancer and other catastrophic diseases. In 1930, a group of [[Carmelite]] nuns known as the [[Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles]] established the Santa Teresita Rest Home, known until recently as Santa Teresita Medical Center. After decades as a full-service hospital, Santa Teresita was downgraded to &quot;medical center&quot; in the early 21st century, after financial problems, caused both by administrative missteps as well as the costs of providing medical coverage to the uninsured, forced the hospital to close its emergency room.  Santa Teresita now operates as an &quot;outpatient services only&quot; facility.

In 1957, a dedicated group of community members, fearing annexation by neighboring cities, led a fight for incorporation.  Indeed, parts of the original Rancho had already been annexed by neighboring Monrovia, Azusa, Irwindale, and Baldwin Park.  At the same time, a rival group representing an affluent enclave in the foothills started a competing drive for incorporation, and broke off to form the separate City of Bradbury.  A 2001 [[Los Angeles Times]] article stated that their petition for incorporation arrived in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] on August 22, 1957, &quot;mere moments&quot; before the petition that would have included them in the City of Duarte.  Still, many ties between the two communities remain in that they both form the Duarte Unified School District; they both share the same post office and(until October 2008) a ZIP code(91010); and they both share combined public services such as the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] and [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]], and garbage pickup(provided by Burrtec Waste Services).

The original city logo was created by Bill Botts Sr. in 1957.It consisted of a double-circular seal, with the inner circle containing an adobe arch featuring the Rancho Azusa de Duarte &quot;d&quot; brand (inside the arch is the original date of the Rancho's establishment, 1841) while the outer circle features the year of Duarte's incorporation (1957).  The current city logo was created in early 1982 to mark Duarte's 25th anniversary of cityhood.

Like many of its neighbors, modern Duarte is a [[bedroom community]].  The City of Duarte is geographically isolated from population centers to the east and south due to the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] and rock quarry operations in [[Irwindale]] and [[Azusa]].  These factors have proven to be an ongoing economic challenge for local businesses as the city attracts little outside spending, and most residents spend their money elsewhere.  Due to air quality and noise concerns, the City of Duarte has sought repeatedly to halt expansion of neighboring quarry operations, but has had no success against the monied interests behind the quarries and the neighboring city governments beholden to them.  Still, over the past few decades, the city leadership has succeeded in bringing retail development to the western portion of Duarte beginning, notably, with the redevelopment of the Big Sky Drive-in Theater as a shopping plaza with a [[Gemco]] superstore (which is now a [[Target Corporation|Target]]). Later, the city's obsolete municipal pool, known as Aqualand, and a well known Route-66 diner (known as the &quot;Boulevard Cafe&quot;) were replaced with a Ralphs shopping center.  In the early 21st century, [[Wal-Mart]] opened on the western edge of the city, as did a [[CarMax]] used-car superstore. In 2009, the city welcomed a new mini-shopping center, including a [[Best Buy]], around the site of its [[Staples Inc.|Staples]] store, as well as a Tesco [[Fresh &amp; Easy]] Neighborhood Market further east at the former Pantry Market site. As of January 2010, a [[Sonic Drive-In]] opened in the Target Shopping Center.

==Government==
The city has a [[council-manager government]] with a five-member city council.

==Schools==
The Duarte Unified School District contains five elementary schools (Maxwell, Andres Duarte, Beardslee, Royal Oaks, and Valley View), one junior high school (Northview Intermediate School), one high school ([[Duarte High School]]) and one continuation high school ([[Mt. Olive Alternative High School]]).  There are also at least two private elementary schools.

==Public safety==
The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD) operates the Temple Station in [[Temple City, California|Temple City]], serving not only Duarte, but also neighboring [[Bradbury]], while fire protection services are provided by the [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] through Station 44(paramedic services are provided by nearby Stations 29[Baldwin Park] and 32[Azusa]).
