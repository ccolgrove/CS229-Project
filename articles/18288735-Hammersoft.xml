The '''Pakistan Super League''' (or PSL{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}) is a proposed [[Twenty20]] [[cricket]] competition created by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] (PCB). The first season of the Pakistan Super League is expected to begin in [[2011]] and will replace Pakistan's current [[ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup|RBS League]].

== Structure ==
The structure of the league will be modeled on the [[Indian Premier League]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Pakistan Super League Structure&quot; &gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan invited to Champions League - Ashraf| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/asiacup/content/current/story/359725.html | publisher=Cricinfo|date=2008-07-04| accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pakistan Super League Structure Secondary&quot; &gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan to play T20 Champions League| url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtvcricket/showstory.aspx?id=SPOEN20080055711 | publisher=NDTV|date=2008-07-04| accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, making use of the franchise model.

== Current franchises ==
At the current moment the following thirteen teams are thought to make up the PSL. They are to be shuffled into one group of 4 and three groups of 3 every year unless and until one or more of the proposed teams are inducted. The Afghuan national team has also asked PCB to play in the tournament. The PCB has said them playing is likely.
