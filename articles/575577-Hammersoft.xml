'''Sky Network Television Limited''' ({{asx|SKT}}; {{nzx|SKT}}), (often stylised '''SKY'''), is a [[New Zealand]] pay [[television]] service. On 30 June 2011, Sky had 829,421 subscribers, which comprises:
*808,617 digital subscribers
*20,840 other subscribers
All up, Sky was in 50.5% of New Zealand homes, making it the largest television platform in New Zealand.

==History==
Founded by [[Terry Jarvis]], [[Craig Heatley]], Trevor Farmer and [[Alan Gibbs]] in 1987 as Sky Media Limited.

Sky Media Limited originally formed to investigate the possibility of beaming sports programming into [[club]]s and [[pub]]s using high performance 4 metre satellite dishes by Jarvis and an [[engineering]] associate Brian Green but was redirected into pay television following successful bidding in 1990 for four groups of UHF frequencies in the [[Auckland]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Tauranga]] [[region]]s.

The first Sky subscriber was former [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives]] [[Jonathan Hunt (New Zealand)|Jonathan Hunt]], according to Helen Clark, Former Prime Minister of New Zealand.

Sky rapidly won long term rights from US sports network [[ESPN]] (which became a 1% shareholder) as well as [[CNN]] and [[HBO]] providing it with a supply of sports, news and movies for three channels: Sky Sport, Sky News (a mix of [[CNN International]] and [[BBC]] bulletins) and Sky Movies (later renamed HBO, before reverting to its original name.)

Initially only operating in the Auckland region Sky contracted Broadcast Communications to provide the broadcast service and transmission from its Panorama Road studios formerly owned by defunct [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]] [[Northern Television]]. 

Later, as funding allowed Sky extended its coverage throughout most of New Zealand, in 1994, Sky launched two further channels, [[Discovery Channel (Australia)|Discovery]] and [[The Box (New Zealand TV channel)|Orange]]. The company expanded to [[Hawkes Bay]], [[Manawatu]], [[Southland Region|Southland]] and [[Otago]], follow by the [[Wairarapa]], [[Taupo]] and [[Wanganui]] regions in 1995. Its final UHF expansion, in 1996, was to [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]], [[Whangarei]] and eastern [[Bay of Plenty]].

In April 1997, Sky introduced a nationwide analogue [[Satellite television#Direct broadcast via satellite|direct broadcasting via satellite]] (DBS) service over the Optus B1 satellite. The DBS services gave Sky the opportunity to offer its customers more channels and [[interactive]] options. It upgraded it to a digital service in December 1998.

The concept of a pay television service was new to New Zealand and Sky had early problems. These included [[viewer]] acceptance of subscriber television. It faced difficulty in educating [[retailer]]s and [[customer]]s on the use of the original [[decoder]]s. However, this problem was eased with the introduction of easier-to-use decoders that allowed greater viewer flexibility.

Channels that are no longer carried by Sky TV include [[Granada UKTV]], [[Hallmark Channel]], [[TVSN]], HBO (renamed Sky Movies) and Property TV. A SkyMail [[email]] service was also featured for a time, but was later pulled due to lack of interest, (including the wireless keyboards they had produced for it).

===Purchase of Prime Television (2005)===
In November 2005, Sky announced it had purchased the free-to-air channel [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime Television]] for [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]30 million. Sky uses Prime to promote its pay content and to show delayed sports coverage. [[Commerce Commission|New Zealand's Commerce Commission]] issued clearance for the purchase on 8 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcom.govt.nz//MediaCentre/MediaReleases/200506/skyclearedtoacquireprimetelevision.aspx Commerce Commission Website - Sky cleared to acquire Prime Television&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite Upgrade (2006) ===
The unreliability of the ageing Optus B1 satellite was highlighted when the [[direct broadcasting satellite]] (DBS) service went offline just before 7p.m. [[Time in New Zealand|NZST]] (8 a.m. London, 3 a.m. New York) on 30 March 2006. The interruption affected service to over 550,000 customers and caused many decoders to advise customers of &quot;[[rain fade]].&quot; Due to excessive volume of calls to the Sky toll-free helpdesk Sky posted update messages on their website advising customers that they were working with Optus to restore service by midnight. SKY credited customers with one day's subscription fees as compensation for the downtime at a cost to the company of [[NZ$]] 1.5 million. Sky switched its DBS service to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus D1|Optus D1]] satellite on 15 November 2006. It later expanded its transponder capacity on this satellite to allow for extra channels and HD broadcasts.

===UHF shutdown (2010)===
Sky has recently switched off their UHF service.  All of its analogue UHF pay TV networks shut down on 11 March 2010 at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1003/S00254.htm Scoop: SKY to shut down UHF network]&lt;/ref&gt;

They plan to hand their UHF and radio spectrum back to the Government and trade them for digital terrestrial bandwidth.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_10583747&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10583747 |title=Sky TV ready to flick its UHF switch |author=Eriksen, Alanah |date=11 July 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership with TVNZ (2011 - present)===
On 24 November 2011 Sky announced they had formed a partnership with [[Television New Zealand]] to launch a new low-cost pay television service during the first half of 2012, codenamed ''Igloo''. &lt;ref name=&quot;Sky Current Media Releases&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skytv.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=202&amp;art_id=37722|title=Media Release: SKY and TVNZ Partner To Launch A New Digital Pay Television Service|author=Sky Television|date=24 November 2011|work=[[Sky Network Television]] |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;The new service will provide [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview]] channels along with around 12 pay channels to a set top box, being developed by Sky. It will use digital terrestrial frequencies owned by Sky. The initial planned cost is $25 and per month and is a cheaper option than the full sky package ($50 per month). The target audience is those who aren't ready to pay a large amount of money every month but want more content than what is available on free-to-air televsion. &lt;ref name=&quot;Sky, TVNZ in new low cost pay TV deal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10768519|title=Sky, TVNZ in new low cost pay TV deal|author=John Drinnan|date=25 November 2011|work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital video recorders====
=====My Sky=====
In December 2005, Sky released its own [[Digital Video Recorder]] (DVR), which essentially is an upgraded set top box similar to [[Foxtel IQ]] in [[Australia]] or [[TiVo]] in the [[United States|U.S.]]. Called '''My Sky''', it offers viewers the ability to pause live television, rewind television, record up to two channels at once straight to the set top box and  watch the start of a recorded programme while still recording the end. It also gives viewers access to a revamped Guide and the new Planner, used to plan and access recordings at the touch of a button. However the PVR box remains the property of SKY Television. 

One of the advertised features of My Sky is the ability of the system to record series of programs using the &quot;Series Link&quot; feature. But this has proven to be somewhat unreliable in that on occasions, intended future recordings are not made. This has occurred since the inception of the service. Sky TV say they are working to determine the cause of the random failures, and to rectify it. Soft rebooting the decoder appears to temporarily overcome the problem.

There was software in My Sky that after an hour of no signal from Sky then the decoder locks playback of pre-recorded programmes. This was discovered after the Optus B1 satellite was unable to broadcast Sky to over 600,000 subscribers.

This generation of box was replaced by '''My Sky HDi''' when it launched on 1 July 2008.

=====My Sky HDi=====
[[File:Myskyhdilogo.png|thumb|right|The My Sky HDi logo]]
[[Image:Myskyhdi.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The My Sky HDi decoder and remote control]]
On 1 July 2008, a service called '''My Sky HDi''' was launched, and is the successor to the '''My Sky''' service released in 2006. The HD channels available are [[Sky Movies (New Zealand)|Sky Movies]], [[Sky Movies (New Zealand)|Sky Movies Greats]], [[Sky Sport (New Zealand)|Sky Sport 1]], [[Sky Sport (New Zealand)|Sky Sport 2]], as well as free-to-air channels [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV ONE]], [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]], and [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]].

The boxes allow connection of to up to four satellites which can work with its four TV tuner cards in any combination. Two channels can be recorded at once, while another can be watched live and the fourth is for a non-real time pay per view service. 
The device has a 320GB HDD however only 160GB is available for recording, the remaining is reserved for on-demand downloads. 
The quality of My Sky HDi is 576i via component and 720/1080i via HDMI.

A new feature was released exclusive to MY SKY HDi on 6 July 2010 called Record Me. This feature allows subscribers to press the green button on programme advertisements to record that advertised programme.

As of 31 December 2010, there are 231,072 My Sky HDi subscribers.

=====My Sky +=====
[[File:Myskypluslogo.png|thumb|right|The My Sky + logo]]
On 1 July 2011, a new service called '''My Sky +''' was launched, and is the successor to the '''My Sky HDi''' service released in 2008. 

It has a 1T hard drive which makes it capable of recording 4 times the amount of content than its predecessor.

The box is [[3D television|3D]] ready in preparation for the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] which will be screened on Sky Sport in 3D.

=====Sky On Demand=====
Sky announced late 2006 that it will be using the 30% reserved disk space in the PVR to offer a [[video on demand]] service to its My Sky customers. This service commenced in 2007 offering 12 - 15 titles at any one time. New titles are downloaded automatically from the Optus D1 satellite to the PVR and listed only when they are available for purchase and instant playback.

=====Copy Protection=====
In May 2009 Sky introduced copy protection on My Sky and My Sky HDi decoders limiting the ability to copy material from My Sky/My Sky HDi to DVD/HDD recorders and to PCs. TV One, Two and Three, Sky Movies, Sky Movies 2, Sky Movies Greats, MGM &amp; TCM have a copy-once encoding meaning movies can be copied however any further copying is prevented. Sky Box Office channels, including Adult channels are copy protected so DVD/HDD recorders &amp; PCs will not record from these channels. Other channels are not copy protected.

==Technical==
Sky Digital subscribers get a standard 60-centimetre satellite dish installed on their home along with set-top boxes including modems for a return path.

Sky switched from the elderly [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus B1|Optus B1]] to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus D1|Optus D1]] satellite for its DBS service on 15 November 2006. Initially, Sky used vertically polarised transponders on Optus D1 (as it had on Optus B1). However, on 31 July 2007 it moved its programming to horizontally polarised transponders with New Zealand-specific beams to be consistent with [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview]] and to gain access to more transmission capacity. Sky have also purchased some of the capacity of [[Optus D3]], which was launched mid August 2009, this gives Sky the ability to add more channels and upgrade existing channels to HD in the future.

A [[set-top box]] (STB) is used to [[decrypt]] the satellite signals. Digital broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2 (MPEG-4 AVC for HD broadcasts). Interactive services and the [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] use the proprietary OpenTV system.
