'''Bonsai''' is a web-based [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] repository browser designed for large programming projects.  It was initially developed to fill the [[Mozilla]] project's need for good tools to allow multiple developers to edit its extremely large codebase.

== Features ==

Among other features, Bonsai allows complex queries to be performed, as well as near real-time updates of check-ins to the CVS server.  Bonsai is released under the [[Mozilla Public License]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/#source-code |title=Mozilla Code Licensing }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is thus [[free software]].

== History ==

Bonsai was founded by [[Terry Weissman]]. It was first written in [[Tcl]], then later ported to Perl. It still uses [[Perl]], but runs off a [[MySQL]] database, and can be served using any [[Perl]] aware webserver, such as [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]].
