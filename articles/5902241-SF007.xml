'''''Hackers Wanted''''' is an unreleased [[United States|American]] [[documentary film]].

Directed and written by [[Sam Bozzo]], the film explores the origins and nature of hackers and [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] by following the adventures of [[Adrian Lamo]], and contrasting his story with that of controversial figures throughout history. The film is narrated by [[Kevin Spacey]].

Originally named &quot;Can You Hack It?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The film failed to get a conventional release, according to Lamo, because of conflicts between its producer and others on the team. The more commonly cited reason is a problem with the quality of the finished product.  On May 20, 2010, a version of the film was leaked to [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. Lamo has stated that he had no involvement in the leak.&lt;ref name=&quot;TorrentFreak&quot;&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;âItâs ironic that a film about overcoming barriers, about new technologies, about thinking differently, had to come to the public eye by being hacked out of the hands of people who, after making a film about the free flow of information, tried to lock away that information forever. The truth tends to itself.â -Adrian Lamo&lt;ref name=&quot;TorrentFreak&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 12, 2010, a director's cut version of the film was also leaked onto torrent sites.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the film contains additional footage and is significantly different from the one previously leaked.
