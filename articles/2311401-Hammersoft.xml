'''Vodafone EspaÃ±a, S.A.U.''' is a [[mobile telecommunications]] operator in [[Spain]] headquartered in [[Alcobendas]], [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]. The company was founded in 2000, as a result of the merger of the shares held by [[Vodafone Group plc]] and [[British Telecommunications plc]] in [[Airtel MÃ³viles|Airtel MÃ³viles, S.A.]] (formed 3 October  1995). Vodafone is the second biggest cellphone carrier in Spain with 14 million customers.

Vodafone (Vodafone ES) offers GSM900/1800&amp;nbsp;MHz (2G), UMTS (3G) and HSDPA (3.5G) services in Spain, with a good coverage.
