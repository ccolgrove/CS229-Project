The company also manages subscription-based online entertainment services including SuperPass and [[GameHouse]] RealNetworksâ software as a service group also provides mobile entertainment and messaging services to mobile carriers.

==History==
RealNetworks (then known as '''Progressive Networks''') was founded by ex-[[Microsoft]] executive [[Rob Glaser]] in 1995.  The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically [[progressivism|progressive]] content.  It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the [[Internet]] as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.

RealNetworks were pioneers in the [[streaming media]] markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet - a baseball game between the Yankees and Seattle Mariners - in 1995. They went on to launch the first streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts, by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/RealNetworks-Inc-Company-History.html |publisher=Funding Universe |title=RealNetworks Inc. |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of servers, and [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetvideomag.com/Articles-2004/022324Real.htm |title=The History &amp; Future of Real Networks |publisher=Internet Video Magazine |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music store==
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's ''Rhapsody'' music service, and renamed it ''[[Rhapsody (online music service)|RealRhapsody]]'' (which includes [[Rhapsody Radish]]).  It offers streaming music downloads for a monthly fee. On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks. 

In January 2004, RealNetworks announced that they are creating [[RealPlayer Music Store]], featuring [[digital rights management|DRM]]-restricted music in the [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] file format.  After some initial tries to push their own DRM scheme (named ''Helix DRM'') onto all device manufacturers with the [[Creative Zen|Creative Zen Xtra]] and the Sansa e200r  as the only existing compliant devices, they sparked controversy by introducing a technology called [[FairPlay#Harmony|Harmony]] that allowed their music to play on [[Apple iPod|iPods]] as well as [[Windows Media Audio|Microsoft Windows Media Audio]] DRM-equipped devices using a &quot;wrapper&quot; that would convert Helix DRM into the two other target DRM schemes.

The domain ''real.com'' attracted at least 67 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a [[Compete.com]] study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteanalytics.compete.com/real.com?metric=uv Real.com attracts 67 million visitors annually]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subscription services==
In 2000, one of the initial products, the [[download manager]] RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a $10 a month fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamingmedia.com/article.asp?id=6013 Streamingmedia.com: RealNetworks Launches Subscription Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; More content was added through deals with [[CBS]] for the reality show ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball.

After the [[dot-com crash]], RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets (e.g., [[Ministry of Sound]] was available only to UK subscribers). With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to [[UEFA Champions League]] full-length game recordings.

==RealNetworks Vs. StreamBox==
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.&lt;ref&gt;(January 18, 2000) [http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/cjoyce/copyright/release10/Real.html REALNETWORKS, INC. v. STREAMBOX, INC. CASE SUMMARY], Retrieved on 2009-08-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==RealDVD==
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] and RealNetworks' contract with the [[DVD CCA]], as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own.  (See [[RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc.]]).&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times (October 1, 2008) [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/01/technology/01film.php Studios sue to bar a DVD copying program], Retrieved on 2009-08-02&lt;/ref&gt;  The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Real Alternative==
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play [[RealMedia]] files without installing RealPlayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;filehippo-ra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Alternative 2.02|url=http://www.filehippo.com/download_real_alternative/|work=[[FileHippo]]|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;download.com-ra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Alternative|url=http://download.cnet.com/Real-Alternative/3000-2139_4-10698783.html|work=[[Download.com]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=August 29, 2011|date=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included [[Media Player Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Alternative 2.02 - Technical details|url=http://www.filehippo.com/download_real_alternative/tech/|work=FileHippo|accessdate=August 29, 2011|date=February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Alternative 2.0.2|url=http://www.free-codecs.com/download/real_Alternative.htm|work=Free-Codecs.com|accessdate=August 29, 2011|date=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year old Dutch webmaster for having inserted [[hyperlink]]s to Real Alternative on his website www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a [[reverse engineer]]ed package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=De Winter |first=Brenno |title=RealNetworks crushes Dutch webmaster for hyperlink |url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/tech-industry/3299285/realnetworks-crushes-dutch-webmaster-for-hyperlink/ |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |newspaper=PC Advisor |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Download.com]]&lt;ref name=&quot;download.com-ra&quot; /&gt; and [[FileHippo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;filehippo-ra&quot; /&gt; continue to host the software product, unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=RealNetworks Destroying Dutch Webmaster's Life Because He Linked To A Reverse Engineered Alternative|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110826/00013315692/realnetworks-destroying-dutch-webmasters-life-because-he-linked-to-reverse-engineered-alternative.shtml|accessdate=August 29, 2011|newspaper=TechDirt|date=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
