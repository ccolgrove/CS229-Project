{{Politics of Hungary}}

The '''[[Prime Minister]] of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|miniszterelnÃ¶k, literally translated &quot;'''Minister-President'''&quot;}}) is the [[head of government]] of [[Hungary]]. He or she is the leader of a political coalition in the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] and the leader of the [[Government of Hungary|cabinet]]. The current Prime Minister is [[Viktor OrbÃ¡n]], who has served since 29 May 2010.

==Official title==
The title of Hungary's head of government in Hungarian is ''miniszterelnÃ¶k''. Literally translated, this means &quot;[[Minister-President]]&quot;. However, because &quot;[[Prime minister]]&quot; or &quot;[[premier]]&quot; is the more usual title in a parliamentary system for a head of government in English-speaking nations, the head of the Hungarian government is usually referred to by English speakers as the &quot;Prime Minister of Hungary&quot;.

==Election and appointment of the Prime Minister==
The Prime Minister is officially appointed by the [[President of Hungary]]. According to the [[Constitution of Hungary|Hungarian Constitution]], the President shall appoint the leader of the political party with the [[parliamentary majority|majority of the votes]] in the [[Hungarian Parliament|Parliament]] as Prime Minister. If there is no party with a majority, the leader of the largest party is asked to attempt to form a government. Therefore, the election of members of a certain party to parliament is the equivalent to a vote for that party's leader for Prime Minister.

==History of the office==

===Palatine of Hungary===
{{main|Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)}}
The '''palatine''' ({{lang-la|comes palatii, comes palatinus}}, later ''{{lang|la|palatinus (regni)}}'',  {{lang-hu|nÃ¡dorispÃ¡n/ nÃ¡dor}}, {{lang-sk|nÃ¡dvornÃ½ Å¾upan/ nÃ¡dvornÃ½ Å¡pÃ¡n}}, later: ''{{lang|sk|palatÃ­n / nÃ¡dvornÃ­k}}'', {{lang-de|Palatin}}) was the highest dignitary in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] after the [[monarch|king]] (a kind of powerful [[Prime Minister]] and supreme judge) from the kingdom's rise up to 1848/1918.

Initially, he was in fact the representative of the king, later the vice-regent ([[viceroy]]). In the early centuries of the kingdom, he was appointed by the king, later elected by the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of the Kingdom of Hungary. After the [[Habsburg]]s solidified their hold of Hungary, the dignity became an appointed position once again. Finally, it became hereditary in a cadet (junior) branch of the Habsburg dynasty after [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Francis]] appointed his brother [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary|Joseph]].

===Creation of the position===
{{main|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}
During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 the revolutionaries wanted the creation of a Hungarian cabinet which would be independent from the [[Austrian Empire]] and the Buda Chancellery (which was office of the Imperial Governor-General). One of the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] said: ''2. A responsible government in [[Buda]]-[[Pest, Hungary|Pest]].''

[[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand V]] appointed Count [[Lajos BatthyÃ¡ny]] for the position of Prime Minister of Hungary on 17 March 1848. The government was called ''ministry'', differently from the current acceptation. The ministries were called ''departments''. BatthyÃ¡ny resigned on October 2, 1848 he was succeeded by [[Lajos Kossuth]] as President of the Committee of National Defence. This executive body has not been allocated the portfolios. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, Kossuth issued the celebrated [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]]. In May [[Bertalan Szemere]] was appointed Prime Minister. The position was vacant after the defeat of the freedom fight.
