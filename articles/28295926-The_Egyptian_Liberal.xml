== Biography ==
El Lozy was born in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] in 1985.  Her father, Mahmoud El Lozy, is a Theatre Professor at the [[American University in Cairo]] (AUC). El Lozy is majoring in Political Science at the [[American University in Cairo|AUC]] and minoring in Theatre and Modern History. Her first experience in professional acting was in [[Youssef Chahine]]'s ''[[Alexandria... New York|Iskendria..New York]]'' &quot;Alexandria..New York&quot; where she played the role of young Ginger. It was a mere coincidence that [[Youssef Chahine]], the film director, was looking for someone with certain characteristics and she happened to have them at the time, a 17-year-old girl who looks like [[Yousra]] and is a ballet dancer. As [[Youssef Chahine]] was looking for someone with certain characteristics, a glamorous face, exceptional talent and striking personality, is the Yosra El Lozy many of us know from her screen roles. A down-to-earth, simple and passionate young woman, Yosra El Lozy happens to have them at the time, a 17-year-old girl who looks like [[Yousra]], the Veteran [[Egypt]]ian [[actress]] [[Yousra]] played the older Ginger.

== Yosra El Lozy and the revival of classical cinema industry==
=== The clash with the concept of the &quot;Clean Cinema&quot; ===

In 1997, the Clean Cinema, a new cinematic principle, that aimed at keeping the cinema industry in Egypt sex-free appeared to surface. The leading female actresses that acquire these principles of the new wave are [[Mona Zaki]], [[Hanan Tork|Hanan Turk]], [[Ghada Adel]], and [[Hala Shiha]]. These actresses among others refused to perform any love scenes or kisses on screen.

Apart from the works of the auteurs [[Daoud Abdel Sayed]], [[Samir Seif]] and [[Khaled Youssef]], Yosra El Lozy is considered on of the only active film auteur working today to perform love scenes. 

Many critics criticized the terminology of &quot;Clean Cinema&quot; as they see that the current state of cinema is a far cry from the earlier eras that says more about present society than the concealed backstage dynamics of Egyptian filmmaking.

Instead, the sexless stars are always seen cuddling in an unconvincing brotherly fashion. Films could contain vulgarity, stereotyping and racial and sexist slurs as long as sex was kept at bay. Moreover, some sexless stars are always seen cuddling in an unconvincing brotherly fashion. Films could contain vulgarity, stereotyping and racial and sexist slurs as long as sex was kept at bay.

=== Classic vs 80s conservatism  ===

In the 1920s, the first female artists of the [[Cinema of Egypt|Egyptian film industry]] were either [[Jewesses]] or [[Syrian]] [[Christian]]s due to the bad reputation of singers and dancers in the [[Arab World]]. Later on, the status of female entertainers had improved, allowing [[Muslim]] [[performer]]s, along with legions of other players from various ethnicities, to enter the industry. Founded by expatriates, the industry adopted the Hollywood model, focusing primarily on musicals and [[comedy|comedies]]. Legendary belly dancers, such as [[Taheyya Kariokka]], [[Samia Gamal]] and [[Naima Akef]], were as popular and respected as the more conservative chanteuses [[Umm Kulthum]] and [[Leila Mourad]], until the subsequent [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] regime that encourage production of religious works alongside films with strong social messages, comedies and musicals remained the top drawers for decades to come.

For more than 60 years, [[Cinema of Egypt|Egyptian cinema]] remained [[secular]], for the most part. [[Sex]] was not the intimidating [[taboo]], it was regarded as an integral part of the Egyptian films. Great filmmakers such as Barakat, [[Youssef Chahine]], [[Salah Abou Seif]] and [[Hussein Kamal]], didnât shy from confronting it. But sexual scenes, nowadays, have grown to be a social taboo as the public become too judgmental. 

The rise of religious feelings that engage in [[politics]] in an effort to combat [[communism]] â changed the Egyptian social landscape for good. The crumbling Egyptian film industry became another battleground between religious and the secular government. 
The fact of the matter is the religious views were actually rooted in Victorian Christian Protestant doctrines few dared to question or oppose. The wave of actresses veiling was the most immediate consequence of the campaign and an unheralded wave of conservatism took over Egyptian cinema.

The biggest casualties of this wave were the aforementioned film auteurs. The mavericks of the 80s â Abdel Sayed, Seif, [[Khairy Beshara]] and until recently, [[Mohamed Khan]] â struggled to fit in with the new system. Abdel Sayed, arguably the greatest living Egyptian filmmaker, has been struggling for a number of years to find funding for his script âRasaâil Al-Bahrâ (Messages from the Sea), which centers on a morose handicapped man caught in a mysterious erotic relationship.

According to Shafik, the countryâs two biggest stars [[Ahmed Helmy]] and [[Ahmed El Sakka]] turned the role down because it &quot;seemed incompatible with their prevalent personas&quot;. The film finally found its leading man this year with heartthrob [[Asser Yassin]] after the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]] agreed to finance the film.

== Political views ==
She is a firm believer in [[Nasserism]], and choses not to own a car, imitating the choice of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] who rarely used the presidential automobile. Recently, she has participated in many demonstrations. One of them was because of [[1993 Lebanon war]] as she demanded the expulsion of the [[Israel]]i [[ambassador]] from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.farfesh.com/Display.asp?catID=159&amp;mainCatID=158&amp;sID=53609 | work= Farfesh.com | title=Yusra al-Lawzi: I love acting, but fear fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;
