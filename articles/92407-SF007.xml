'''LiveJournal''' ('''LJ''') is a [[virtual community]] where [[Internet]] users can keep a [[blog]], [[diary|journal]] or [[diary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;macworld_weblogs&quot;&gt;
{{Cite news| last =Hacker  | first =Scot  | title = Put Weblogs to Work
| newspaper = Macworld: the Macintosh magazine | volume = 9 | year = 2003   | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveJournal is also the name of the [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/code/ |title=LiveJournal Code |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[server (computing)|server]] [[software]] that was designed to run the LiveJournal virtual community.

LiveJournal was started on April 15, 1999 by [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] as a way of keeping his high school friends updated on his activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=4&amp;view=full |title=LiveJournal FAQ: How did LiveJournal get started? Who runs it now? |publisher=Livejournal.com |date=2009-06-21 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2005, blogging software company [[Six Apart]] purchased [[Danga Interactive]], the company that operated LiveJournal, from Fitzpatrick. Six Apart sold LiveJournal to Russian media company [[SUP Fabrik|SUP]] in 2007, but continued to develop the site by the San Francisco-based company LiveJournal, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.livejournal.com/104520.html |title=news: LiveJournal &amp; SUP |publisher=News.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 LiveJournal laid off some employees and moved product development and design functions to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/06/AR2009010601216.html |title=paidContent.org - LiveJournal Lays Off San Francisco Staff, Will Operate From Moscow |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2009-01-06|accessdate=2010-03-29 | first=Robert | last=Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournalinc.com/press_releases/20090106.php |title=Press Releases |publisher=LiveJournal Inc. |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
* Each journal entry has its own web page, which includes the comments left by other users. In addition, each user has a journal page, which shows all of his or her most recent journal entries, along with links to the comment pages.
* The most distinctive feature of LiveJournal is the &quot;friends list,&quot; which gives the site a strong social aspect in addition to the [[blog]] services. The friends list provides various [[Web syndication|syndication]] and privacy services as described below. Each user has a friends page, which collects the most recent journal entries of the people on his or her friends list.
* LiveJournal allows users to customize their accounts in several ways. The [[S2 programming language]] allows journal templates to be modified by members. Users may upload graphical [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]s, or &quot;userpics,&quot; which appear next to the username in prominent areas as it would on an [[Internet forum]]. Paid account holders are given full access to S2 management and more userpics, as well as other features.
* Each user also has a &quot;User Info&quot; page, which contains a variety of data including contact information, a biography, images (linked from off-site sources) and lists of friends, interests, communities and even schools which the user has attended in the past or is currently attending.
* LiveJournal also allows &quot;voice posts&quot; to their paid and sponsored users, where one can call into the system and record an entry.
* Currently LiveJournal has five account levels: basic (comprising approximately 95% of the network); plus (sponsored with more advertising); &quot;early adopters&quot; who were registered prior to 14 September 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/legal/tos.bml |title=LiveJournal Terms of Service |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid and permanent. Permanent accounts are normally not available to the &quot;average user;&quot; there have been occasional sale days or special offers, but such sales are not guaranteed in the future. Prior to March 12, 2008, &quot;basic&quot; accounts were ad-free; in August, 2008, LiveJournal resumed new basic account creation but changed that account level to display ads to non-logged-in readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;no basic&quot;&gt;This change first appeared [http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=38&amp;view=full in the LiveJournal FAQ], then, after being omitted from an [http://news.livejournal.com/106731.html official LiveJournal news post discussing changes in the first 100 days of SUP ownership], was itself the subject of a [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html later news post]. A LiveJournal spokesman said that LJ management [http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2008/03/13/291948 did not consider it necessary to inform users of this change].&lt;/ref&gt; Basic users also see advertising, but not on other &quot;basic&quot; journals.

==Social networking==
The unit of [[social networking]] on LiveJournal is [[quaternary numeral system|quaternary]] (with four possible states of connection between one user and another). Two users can have no relationship, they can list each other as friends mutually, or either can &quot;friend&quot; the other without reciprocation. On LiveJournal, &quot;friend&quot; is also used as a verb to describe listing someone as a friend.

The term &quot;friend&quot; on LiveJournal is mostly a technical term; however, because the term &quot;friend&quot; is emotionally loaded for many people, there have been discussions in such LiveJournal communities as ''[http://community.livejournal.com/lj_dev/profile lj_dev]'' and ''[http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/profile lj_biz]'', as well as ''[http://community.livejournal.com/suggestions/profile suggestions]'' about whether the term should be used in this way; this conflict is discussed in greater detail below.

A user's list of friends (''friends list'', often shortened to ''flist'') will often include several communities and [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds in addition to individual users. Generally, &quot;friending&quot; allows the friends of a user to read protected entries and causes the friends' entries to appear on the user's &quot;friends page.&quot; Friends can also be grouped together in &quot;friends groups,&quot; allowing for more complex behavior in both of these features.

===Privacy===
LiveJournal provides an option intended to reduce the chances of search engines indexing a journal; however, the only way to make it completely impossible for such indexing to occur is to set the entry security to &quot;friends only&quot; or higher when first posting the entry. If an entry is first posted publicly, and then edited to reflect a higher security level, it may have already been indexed by a search engine in the time between the security edit. The popular &quot;friends only&quot; security option, which has since been adopted by [[Xanga]] and [[MySpace]], hides a post from the general public so that only those on the user's friends list can read it. Some users keep all their posts friends-only (except for a single post explaining that the journal is friends-only). LiveJournal also allows users to create custom user groups within their group of friends to further restrict who can read any particular post, and to allow easy reading of subsets of a user's friends list.

LiveJournal additionally has a &quot;private&quot; security option which allows users to make a post that only the poster can read, thus making their LiveJournal a private diary rather than a blog. It is also possible to choose a default security setting for one's journal, so that all entries are posted at that security level by default even if one forgets to alter the security setting at the time of posting.

Users may restrict who can comment on their posts in addition to who has the ability to read their posts. Comments on a given entry may be allowed from anyone who can read the entry or restricted. Commenting may be restricted by disabling commenting altogether or by screening comments. Screened comments are visible only to the original posters until the journal owner approves the comment. These restrictions can be applied to just anonymous users, users who aren't listed as a friend, or everyone. The IP address of commenters can be logged as well if the journal owner wishes to enable it.

An option allows users to hide their 'friend of' list from public view, but leaves the list visible to the user. In this case, only the friends list is shown. When 'friend of' is allowed, journal accounts who have friended the user and who are also friended are listed in neither 'friend of' nor 'friend', but rather a third category, 'mutual friends'. This was eventually made a separate option, like the 'friend of' list, and reworded so that the lists would have to be selected to include them in a profile, rather than to select an option to remove them.

LiveJournal lists that users can hide communities from their profile page by not friending them (friended communities are 'watched') and by either banning the community from posting in their journal (which has no effect since they cannot anyway, but does remove them from the 'member of' list) or by removing the 'friend of' list, which removes the 'member of' list in addition to the 'friend of' list.

LiveJournal allows paid account users to change privacy settings on past entries in bulk. Basic and plus accounts do not have an official web-based method, and normally must manually change such settings one by one; some third party clients, such as  [http://jehy.ru/soft.en.html Livejournal Visibility Changer], provide this functionality for non-Paid users.

==Community==
===User interaction===
As with most weblogs, people can comment on each other's journal entries and create a [[internet forum|message board]]-style thread of comments â each comment can be replied to individually, starting a new thread. All users, including non-paying users, can set various options for comments: they can instruct the software to only accept comments from those on their friends list or block anonymous comments (meaning only LiveJournal users can comment on their posts). They can also screen various types of comments before they are displayed, or disable commenting entirely. Users can also have replies sent directly to their registered e-mail address.

In addition, LiveJournal acts as host to group journals, dubbed &quot;communities&quot; (frequently abbreviated as ''comms''). Anyone who joins a community can make posts to it as they would on a regular journal; communities also have &quot;maintainers&quot;, ordinary users who run the community and oversee membership and moderation.

Some areas of LiveJournal rely heavily on user contributions and volunteer efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/site/contributors.bml |title=LiveJournal Contributors |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the LiveJournal Support area is run almost entirely by unpaid volunteers. Similarly, the website is translated into other languages by volunteers, although this effort is running down due to a perceived lack of involvement from the LiveJournal administration.

The development of the LiveJournal software has seen extensive volunteer involvement in the past. In February and March 2003, there was even an effort, nicknamed the ''Bazaar'', to boost volunteer performance by offering money in return for &quot;wanted&quot; enhancements or improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_dev/493562.html |title=Announcement of the Bazaar in LiveJournal Development |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bazaar was intended to follow a regular monthly pay-out scheme, but it ended up paying out only once, after which it was neglected without a word from the management until about one year later when it was shut down.

Nowadays, voluntary contributions to the software are considered for inclusion less and less as the company has acquired more and more paid employees who focus on the organization's commercial interests. This has led to the formation of several [[fork (software)|forks]], many of which introduce new features that users would like to see at LiveJournal, especially features that are brought up repeatedly in LiveJournal's own ''suggestions'' journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/suggestions/profile |title=LiveJournal.com |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases legal and administrative concerns have led LiveJournal to prohibit some people from volunteering.

===Oh No They Didn't!===
{{Main|Oh No They Didn't}}
'''Oh No They Didn't''', also known as '''ONTD''', is the most popular&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livejournalinc.com/aboutus.php &quot;Livejournal Inc. â About Us&quot;], retrieved on 2009-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; community on LiveJournal, with over 100,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/profile &quot;ohnotheydidnt - Community Profile&quot;], retrieved on 2009-02-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/32794378.html?thread=4477264650#t4477264650 &quot;Exact number of comments&quot;], retrieved on 2009-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The community is centered around celebrity gossip, and most of its posts are taken and sourced from other gossip blogs.

In the end of January 2009, ''Oh No They Didn't!'' was the first LiveJournal to surpass 16,777,216 comments (2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;), effectively breaking LiveJournal's previously undocumented limit on comments.&lt;ref&gt;Livejournal responds: [http://community.livejournal.com/lj_maintenance/122809.html &quot;Minor database maintenance &amp;ndash; ONTD!!!1&quot;], 2009-01-28. Retrieved 2009-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Continually updated ONTD post detailing the issue: [http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/31879100.html &quot;It appears that ONTD has reached an undocumented limit - journals can only have approximately 16.7 million total comments made to them before running out of room in the database to store more comments.&quot;], 2009-01-28. Retrieved 2009-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in almost a week of downtime for the community, while LiveJournal worked to fix the issue.

In April 2010, the Oh No They Didn't community was moved to its own database cluster to improve site performance for all users, due to its size and the amount of traffic it was receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_maintenance/128204.html |title=Website Performance - UPDATE |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frank the Goat===
Frank the Goat is LiveJournal's [[mascot]]. Frank is treated like an actual living being by much of the LiveJournal userbase, and his brief &quot;biography&quot; as well as his &quot;journal&quot; reflect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/site/goat.bml |title=About: Frank the Goat |publisher=LiveJournal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frank.livejournal.com/profile |title=User Profile: Frank the Goat |publisher=LiveJournal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, callers to LiveJournal's Voice Post service are informed &quot;Frank the Goat appreciates your call.&quot; This occurs randomly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.livejournal.com/75379.html?thread=10040435#t10040435 |title=Brad Fitzpatrick Comments on Voice Post Easter Egg |publisher=News.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A weekly comic about Frank, written and drawn by cartoonist [[Ryan Estrada]], is updated every Thursday on the &quot;Frank: The Comic Strip&quot; community on LiveJournal. As of July 2009 the community has roughly 8,000 members, and is watched by more than 7,000 LiveJournal users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/frankthecomic/profile |title=Frank: The Comic Strip |author=Estrada, Ryan |work=Community Info |publisher=LiveJournal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning at the end of January 2010, LiveJournal's weekly news posts included references to Frank's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.livejournal.com/121612.html |title=LiveJournal Major Notes: Speedier servers, Haiti gift drive, Blurberati |publisher=News.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming works of short fiction at the end of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.livejournal.com/122786.html |title=LiveJournal Major Notes: Charitable vgifts, Balloon bouquet, Header contest |publisher=News.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are often tied to weekly virtual gift promotions, where commenters that meet a certain criteria will receive a free v-gift sent by Frank.

==Controversies and criticism==
===Invite system===&lt;!-- This section is linked from LiveJournal --&gt;
From September 2, 2001, until December 12, 2003, the growth of LiveJournal was checked by an [[invitation system|&quot;invite code&quot; system]]. This curbing of membership was necessitated by a rate of growth faster than the server architecture could handle. New users were required to either obtain an invite code from an existing user or buy a paid account (which reverted to a free account at the expiration of the period of time paid for). The invite code system serendipitously reduced abuse on the site by deterring people from creating multiple throw-away accounts. The invite code system was lifted after a number of major improvements to the overall site architecture.

Elimination of the invite code system was met with mixed feelings and some opposition. LiveJournal's management pointed out that the invite code system was always intended to be temporary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.livejournal.com/74165.html |title=Post Announcing the End of Invite Codes |publisher=News.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The word &quot;friend&quot;===
The dual usage of &quot;friend&quot; as those whose journals one reads, and those one trusts to read one's own journal, has been criticized for being at odds with everyday use of the term. The individual users on a user's friends list may contain a mixture of people met through real world friendships, online friendships and general interests, as well as [[courtesy]] friendships where a user has &quot;friended&quot; someone who friended them. A friends list may represent something entirely unrelated to social relationships, such as a reading list, a collection or a puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;Fono, D. and K. Raynes-Goldie.  [http://k4t3.org/publications/hyperfriendship.pdf &quot;Hyperfriends and Beyond: Friendship and Social Norms on LiveJournal&quot;]. Internet Research Annual Volume 4: Selected Papers from the Association of Internet Researchers Conference (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between online and real-world friendships is sometimes a source of conflict, hurt feelings, and other misunderstandings. LiveJournal friendships are not necessarily mutual; any user can befriend or &quot;defriend&quot; any other user at any time.&lt;ref&gt;boyd, danah.  [http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_12/boyd/index.html &quot;Friends, friendsters, and top 8: Writing community into being on social network sites&quot;].  ''First Monday'', vol. 12, no. 2 (December 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Russian LiveJournal community, the word ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð´ (&quot;friend&quot;, an English borrowing) is often used to describe this relationship instead of the native Russian word &quot;Ð´ÑÑÐ³&quot; that translates to &quot;friend&quot;.

The [[Dreamwidth]] code fork of LiveJournal has split the 'friend' concept into its two component pieces of subscription and access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreamwidth.org/support/faqbrowse?faqid=124 |title=If you're coming from LiveJournal to Dreamwidth: Terminology: Subscribe/Access |publisher=Dreamwidth.org |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse Prevention Team decisions===
As LiveJournal has grown, it has had to deal with issues involving the content it hosts. Like most web logging hosts, it has adopted a basic [[Terms of Service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TOS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/legal/tos.bml |title=LiveJournal Terms of Service |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Terms of Service simultaneously expresses a desire for [[free speech]] by the users while outlining impermissible conduct such as [[spamming]], [[copyright]] violation, [[harassment]], ''etc''. LiveJournal created an Abuse Prevention Team and processes to handle claims about violations of the Terms of Service, violations of copyright, violations of the [[law]], and other issues.

If the Abuse Prevention Team determines that a violation has occurred, the user will be either required to remove the infringing material (as in the case of copyright violations);&lt;ref name=&quot;TOS&quot;/&gt; the journal will be suspended until such time as the material can be removed (e.g., posting of home addresses or other various contact information of another); or, in cases of severe or multiple violations, the journal will be suspended (e.g., account hijacking, multiple instances of copyright violation, child pornography).&lt;ref name=&quot;TOS&quot;/&gt;  The offending user is notified by email of any journal suspension or, if any offending material must be removed, the user is given a deadline for its removal. When a journal is suspended, it effectively removes from sight everything the user has written on LiveJournal, including comments in other people's journals; however, the user is able to download the material while suspended. Those suspended users who have paid for LiveJournal's service do not have payments refunded.

A small controversy arose in November 2004 when a policy document used by the Abuse Prevention Team was leaked to a group of its critics before it was due to be released. The policy document has since been officially released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/abuse/policy.bml |title=LiveJournal Abuse Policies and Procedures |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy arose when users complained after an unknown number of users were asked to remove default user pictures containing images of breast feeding that were considered inappropriate as they contained a view of nipples or areolae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Response from Six Apart May. 24th, 2006 at 3:00 PM |url=http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1763041.html |title=Response from Six Apart on Breastfeeding Userpic Controversy |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date=2006-05-24 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident attracted the attention of [[lactivism|breast feeding advocacy]] groups such as Pro-Mom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.promom.org/bf_info/pr.html |title=Popular Blogging Site Restricts Use of Breastfeeding Photos |publisher=Promom.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who publicized the issue to gain larger media awareness. LiveJournal responded by changing the FAQ on appropriate content for default user pictures. The current FAQ 111 says that nudity is not appropriate in ''default'' user pictures; the original FAQ 111 said that graphic sexual content was not appropriate. Breastfeeding pictures were not restricted by the original FAQ, and the current FAQ reflects the fact that they are only restricted from use as a default user picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Haines |first=Lester |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/01/livejournal_kerfuffle/ |title=LiveJournal tells lactating mums to put 'em away |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2006-06-01 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that breastfeeding pictures are still allowed as user pictures that may be manually chosen while posting but may not be the default.

===Account vulnerabilities===
In January 2006 the site had to make emergency changes to the way the site hosts [[user accounts]] due to a [[web browser]]-side security [[vulnerability]]. The hacker group responsible was later identified as &quot;Bantown&quot;. Approximately 900,000 accounts were at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Krebs |first=Brian |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/01/account_hijackings_force_livej.html |title=Account Hijackings Force LiveJournal Changes |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |work=Security Fix |date=January 20, 2006 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LiveJournal and advertisements===
In April 2006, LiveJournal [http://news.livejournal.com/91919.html announced] it was introducing a new user type that gave free users some of the features available to paid members in exchange for ad sponsorship. This user type was initially called Sponsored+, but was later renamed to Plus.

This announcement was met with a whirlwind of controversy. Between April 2004 and January 2005, one of LiveJournal's Social Contract promises stated the site would, &quot;Stay advertisement free.&quot;  The Social Contract went on to say, &quot;It may be because it's one of our biggest pet peeves, or it may be because they don't garner a lot of money, but nonetheless, we promise to never offer advertising space in our service or on our pages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040401175244/http://www.livejournal.com/site/contract.bml LiveJournal Social Contract] (old page, archived by the Internet Archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ad-related controversy occurred in June 2006, when ads for Kpremium began installing [[malware]] and triggering [[pop-up ads]] on Australian and Western European users' computers,&lt;ref name=&quot;community.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;http://community.livejournal.com/lj_ads/4176.html&lt;/ref&gt; against the LiveJournal ad guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=265 |title=What are LiveJournal's guidelines on acceptable ads? |publisher=Livejournal.com |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LiveJournal responded by removing the advertisement from the website and issuing an apology to its users.&lt;ref name=&quot;community.livejournal.com&quot;/&gt;

In March 2008, LiveJournal discontinued the ability for new users to select the &quot;basic&quot; level of journal, which allowed for a minimal set of features with no advertising at no cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;no basic&quot;/&gt; However, in August of the same year, the company reversed the decision, reviving &quot;basic&quot; service as a manual, post-registration downgrade. However, the resumed basic service level is no longer ad-free: advertisements are displayed when readers who are not logged in to livejournal view postings on a basic account.&lt;ref name=&quot;basic returns&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_2008/4979.html |title=Basic Accounts Decision |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Account suspension controversy===
In May 2007, LiveJournal suspended approximately 500 accounts and communities, causing what [[news.com]] referred to as a &quot;revolt&quot; from &quot;thousands of LiveJournal customers&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|first=Declan|last=McCullagh|url=http://news.com.com/Mass+deletion+sparks+LiveJournal+revolt/2100-1025_3-6187619.html|title=Mass deletion sparks LiveJournal revolt|date=May 30, 2007|publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNet News.com]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a number of activist groups, including one named Warriors for Innocence, reported pedophilic material on its website.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=McCullagh |first=Declan |url=http://news.com.com/Mass+deletion+sparks+LiveJournal+revolt/2100-1025_3-6187619.html |title=Mass deletion sparks LiveJournal revolt - CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inquirer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=40013 |title=Live Journal does a u-turn on online book burning |publisher=Theinquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;firefox&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=Published 30 May 2007 |url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/408/1/Six-Apart-Deletes-500-LiveJournals-Many-Fannish/Page1.html |title=Six Apart Deletes 500 LiveJournals, Many Fannish |publisher=Firefox.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2009}}&lt;ref name=&quot;informationweek&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/05/child_sex_crack.html |title=Child Sex Crackdown Causes Problems For LiveJournal |publisher=Informationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;afterelton&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Keith |first=Christie |url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/christiekeith/live-journal-the-blogging-platform-that-gay-sex-built |title=LiveJournal: The blogging platform that gay sex built |publisher=Afterelton.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Six Apart chairman and chief executive Barak Berkowitz, &quot;We did a review of our policies related to how we review those sites, those journals, and came up with the fact that we actually did have a number of journals up that we didn't think met our policies and didn't think they were appropriate to have up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot; /&gt;  In a subsequent [http://news.livejournal.com/99159.html posting to the LiveJournal news community], he apologized, discussed some of the circumstances behind the suspensions, and indicated that the suspended journals would be reviewed and potentially brought back online. In particular, he noted that Livejournal's normal practice of reviewing suspensions and notifying suspended account holders had not been followed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]hese&lt;/nowiki&gt; journals were suspended for easily correctable problems &lt;nowiki&gt;[...] [T]his&lt;/nowiki&gt; was not communicated to the journal or community owners at all.
&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]hese&lt;/nowiki&gt; journals were taken down before review could be completed to avoid mistakes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the backlash was from [[fan fiction]] writers whose communities and personal journals were among those suspended, seemingly because they listed interests such as &quot;[[incest]]&quot; or &quot;non-con&quot; (short for non-consensual).&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot; /&gt; Although these communities did not necessarily encourage illegal behavior, it has been reported that there was no further investigation into the content of these journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.livejournal.com/99159.html |title=Apology for Mass Account Suspensions |publisher=News.livejournal.com |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond merely fan communities, many were initially upset that communities entirely unrelated to anything but the discussion, sometimes therapeutic and other times literary, of rape or child molestation were among those suspended.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot; /&gt;

On May 31, 2007, Berkowitz [http://news.livejournal.com/99515.html released a statement to the LiveJournal news community] announcing that Six Apart was currently in the process of unsuspending about half of suspended journals. The journals being reinstated fell into fandom or fiction categories or were journals that were suspended for problems related only to the contents of their profiles. In an earlier interview with [[news.com]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;/&gt; he had stated that he would be &quot;shocked&quot; if &quot;more than a dozen&quot; journals would be reinstated.

On July 19, 2007, Abe Hassan at LiveJournal [http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/241428.html released a statement clarifying LiveJournal's suspension policies]. [http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/241884.html A further statement] was made on August 7, 2007.

===Advisory Board election===
As previously announced, SUP, the latest owners of LiveJournal, decided to create an Advisory Board to help it make decisions. The first members were distinguished people in the areas of law and technology, [[Danah Boyd]], [[Esther Dyson]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and the original LiveJournal founder, Brad Fitzpatrick. SUP announced two other members would be appointed from the LiveJournal userbase, one Russian and one English speaking.&lt;ref&gt;

===Distributed Denial of Service Attacks===
LiveJournal has been the victim of several [[DoS|DDoS]] attacks in 2011. The first attack on March 30th took down the site for several hours. The attack is reported to be the largest DDoS attack against LiveJournal since the site's creation. A second attack continued through April 4th and 5th, causing service disruption for some users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Sale to Six Apart==
[[File:Brad Fitzpatrick by Anton Nossik cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Brad Fitzpatrick]]]]
LiveJournal's parent company, Danga Interactive, was initially formed and held entirely by Brad Fitzpatrick. However, as LiveJournal became more popular, Fitzpatrick was approached by multiple parties who wished to purchase it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} He initially resisted many of these offers, not wanting his pet project (which he has characterized as his &quot;baby&quot;) in the hands of those who did not understand the site's core principles â reliance on paid memberships to fund site operations, the absence of advertising, the volunteer support model, and LiveJournal's support of the [[free software]] movement. Nonetheless, as the administrative aspect of LiveJournal began to consume more of Fitzpatrick's time, which he would have rather spent working on the site's technical workings, he began to take the acquisition offers more seriously.  In August 2007, Fitzpatrick left to work for [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://valleywag.com/tech/brad-fitzpatrick/livejournal-creator-leaves-as-six-apart-fails-to-spin-286218.php |title=Brad Fitzpatrick: LiveJournal creator leaves as Six Apart fails to spin |publisher=Valleywag.com |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2007/08/07/261770 |title=CNews: Live Journal creator leaves for Google |publisher=Eng.cnews.ru |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/bradfitz |title=Brad Fitzpatrick |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community reaction===
Rumors of Danga's impending sale to Six Apart were first reported by [[Business 2.0]] [[journalist]] [[Om Malik]] in his blog, on January 4, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2005/01/04/six-apart-to-buy-live-journal/ GigaOM: Six Apart to buy Live Journal][sic]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the next evening, speculation of major changes, including a rumor that LiveJournal would require non-paying users to purchase memberships, had caused enough users to [[backup]] their journals to impact the site's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_maintenance/99736.html |title=LiveJournal Maintenance: Archive Paranoia |publisher=Community.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours later, Fitzpatrick confirmed the sale, and insisted the site's core principles would not be discarded by the new ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.livejournal.com/82926.html |title=Confirmation of Sale in LiveJournal News |publisher=News.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stressed that he and other Danga employees would still continue to manage LiveJournal and that he had determined that Six Apart was committed to the site's core principles before selling.

Fitzpatrick's supporters offered rebuttals to many of these arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evan.livejournal.com/769381.html |title=Post Discussing Sale of LiveJournal |publisher=Evan.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that the bulk of the code running LiveJournal at the time of the acquisition would continue to be open source, as it was licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

Finally, Fitzpatrick himself noted he was growing tired of the administrative aspects of the site â to the point where he had contemplated shutting down the service â and &quot;I knew I would've shut down the site on my own if I didn't get help.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evan.livejournal.com/769381.html?thread=4897125#t4897125 |title=Brad Fitzpatrick Comments on Decision to Sell |publisher=Evan.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzpatrick left Six Apart in August 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brad.livejournal.com/2334177.html |title=On Leaving Six Apart |publisher=Brad.livejournal.com |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is no longer involved in the development of LiveJournal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brad.livejournal.com/2324293.html |title=LiveJournal drama |publisher=Brad.livejournal.com |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fitzpatrick continued to serve on the Advisory Board of LiveJournal, Inc until it was retired in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_2008/3384.html|title=We have LiveJournal Advisory Board members to announce!|date=2002-08-28|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/lj_advisory/1840.html|title=Our heartfelt thanks to the LiveJournal Advisory Board|date=2010-06-23|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale to SUP==
LiveJournal became extremely popular in Russia. The Russian translation of LiveJournal â ÐÐ (''ZheZhe'', which stands for ÐÐ¸Ð²Ð¾Ð¹ ÐÑÑÐ½Ð°Ð») â has become a [[genericized trademark]] for blogging in Russia, and the community boasts something close to 700,000 Russian LiveJournals, perhaps 300,000 of them active.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia Growls at LiveJournal Deal&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=Quinn Norton |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2006/11/72060 |title=Russia Growls at LiveJournal Deal |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six Apart licenced the Livejournal brand to the Russian company [[SUP Fabrik|SUP]] in August 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia Growls at LiveJournal Deal&quot;/&gt; The deal was brokered with the assistance of founder Brad Fitzpatrick. However, expatriated Russians have expressed concerns, citing links between the company and state security. Some have also worried that SUP's purchasing of the community was less to make a profit and more to curtail or even dissolve the strong independent Russian blogging community, silencing dissent the government found inconvenient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia Growls at LiveJournal Deal&quot;/&gt; These concerns started with the licensing deal, and have grown with the announcement of the sale.

LiveJournal was sold to SUP in December 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Six Apart Announces New Home for LiveJournal&quot;&gt;{{cite pressrelease|title=Six Apart Announces New Home for LiveJournal|url=http://www.sixapart.com/about/press/2007/12/acquisition-of.html|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Six Apart Sells LiveJournal To Russia's SUP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Six Apart Sells LiveJournal To Russia's SUP|author=Michael Arrington|authorlink=Michael Arrington|url=http://techcrunch.com/2007/12/02/six-apart-sells-livejournal-to-sup/|work=[[TechCrunch]]|date=2007-02-12|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton Nossik]], an advisor to [[SUP Fabrik|SUP]], has not reacted favourably to criticism by site users. In an interview given in March 2008, he accused LiveJournal users of &quot;trying to scare and blackmail us, threatening to destroy our business,&quot; and stated that a large class of users have as their only purpose bringing harm to LiveJournal and its founders; &quot;their goal is to criticize, destablilize and ruin our reputation.&quot; In the interview, he predicted that his likely reaction to such pressure would be to retaliate against the users rather than bowing to their pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.izbrannoe.info/30184.html |title=ÐÐ·Ð±ÑÐ°Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ðµ: ÐÐµÐ»Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ð¼ Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´Ð¾ÑÑÐ°Ð²ÑÑ Ð¿ÐµÑÐµÑÑ |publisher=Izbrannoe.info |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch of LiveJournal Inc==
Following SUP's acquisition of LiveJournal, SUP announced that the service would be run by LiveJournal Inc.; this newly launched company is based in San Francisco and continues to run the site under US law.

==Global expansion==
Following LiveJournal's acquisition SUP identified three international markets (Singapore, the UK and India) which it hoped to support the services growth and seed new communities. LiveJournal recently launched new communities in India and has undertaken a reach-out programme with bloggers in Singapore. On June 8, 2011, it was announced that &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.sup.com/en/news_339.html|title=LiveJournal to launch South-East Asian country portals; appoints Singapore media partner|publisher=SUP Media|date=June 8, 2011|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}: &quot;LiveJournal will launch local start pages in South-East Asia and India through a partnership with Singapore digital publishing house Tickled Media.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; LiveJournal will launch local start-pages across South-East Asia and India catering to the large community the site has built here. It appointed local Singapore digital publisher [[Tickled Media]] to run the LiveJournal service in the region.

==Other sites running the LiveJournal engine==
{{details|Comparison of sites using the LiveJournal codebase}}
The software running LiveJournal is open source and primarily written in Perl. Because of this, many other communities have been designed using the LiveJournal software. These sites have very similar features and formats to LiveJournal itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|first=Emily|last=Nussbaum|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E6D61531F932A25752C0A9629C8B63|title=My so-called blog|publisher=New York Times|date=January 11, 2004|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}: &quot;While the sites that are hosts to online journals may attract different crowds, their formats vary only slightly: a LiveJournal is a Blurty is a Xanga is a DeadJournal is a DiaryLand.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, they often have different [[terms of service]] than LiveJournal's, making them attractive to users who have become disenchanted with LiveJournal's rules and wish to move their journals to other hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;/&gt;
