'''JBoss Application Server''' (or '''JBoss AS''') is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]]-based [[application server]]. An important distinction for this class of software is that it not only implements a server that runs on Java, but it actually implements the Java EE part of Java. Because it is [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based, the JBoss application server operates cross-platform: usable on any operating system that supports Java. JBoss AS was developed by [[JBoss (company)|JBoss]], now a division of [[Red Hat]].

== Origin ==

In 1999, Marc Fleury started a free software project named ''EJB-OSS'' (stands for ''Enterprise Java Bean Open Source Software'') implementing the [[Enterprise JavaBeans|EJB]] [[API]] from [[Java EE|J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition)]]. [[Sun Microsystems]] asked the project to stop using the ''EJB'' trademark within its name. ''EJB-OSS'' was then renamed to ''JBOSS'', then ''JBoss'' later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jamae |first1=Javid |last2=Johnson |first2=Peter |title=JBoss in Action: Configuring the JBoss Application Server |accessdate=2011-12-01 |date=2009-01-20 |publisher=Manning Publications |language=en |isbn=978-1-933988-02-3 |page=4 |pages=496 |chapter=1.1 Introducing JBoss |chapterurl=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/java/9781933988023/vote-for-jboss/ch01lev1sec1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==
JBoss AS 4.0, a Java EE 1.4 application server, features an embedded [[Apache Tomcat]] 5.5 [[servlet container]]. It supports any [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM) between versions 1.4 and 1.6. JBoss can run on numerous [[operating system]]s including many [[POSIX]] platforms (like [[GNU/Linux]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[Mac OS X]]), [[Microsoft Windows]] and others, as long as a suitable JVM is present. JBoss AS 4.2 also functions as a Java EE 1.4 application server, but deploys [[Enterprise JavaBean]]s 3.0 by default. It requires the [[Java Development Kit]] version 5. Tomcat 5.5 comes bundled with it.

JBoss AS 5.1, released in 2009, operates as a Java EE 5 application server. It is a minor update of the major release JBoss AS 5.0, which was in development for at least three years and was built on top of a new JBoss microcontainen in startup time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jboss.org/as7.html JBoss Application Server 7].&lt;/ref&gt; JBoss AS 5.1 contains a preview of some elements from the Java EE 6 specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossas/tags/JBoss_5_1_0_GA/build/docs/readme.html |title=JBoss 5.1.0.GA Release Notes |date=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JBoss AS 6.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home / JBoss / 6.0.0.Final|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/JBoss/JBoss-6.0.0.Final|publisher=JBoss Community|date=2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unofficial implementation of Java EE 6, was released on December 28, 2010. Although JBoss AS 6 supports almost all the technologies required by the full Java EE 6 spec,&lt;ref&gt;http://community.jboss.org/thread/160813&lt;/ref&gt; it chose not to pursue certification from Oracle.&lt;ref&gt;http://dandreadis.blogspot.com/2011/01/introducing-brand-new-jboss-as-60.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://community.jboss.org/message/574581&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, however, officially certified to support the Java EE 6 Web Profile.

JBoss AS 7,&lt;ref name=JBoss_downloads/&gt; the current stable version, was released on July 12, 2011, only six months after the last major release, JBoss AS 6. Unlike previous increments of the major [[versioning]] number, JBoss AS 7 supports the same Java EE specification as the last major release, namely Java EE 6. The Java EE profile is only partially implemented in JBoss AS 7, e.g. it includes MDBs, but listening to JMS destinations (which is mandated by the full spec) is not supported.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.jboss.org/thread/169508&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, certified for the Web Profile. The software code has been completely rewritten for JBoss AS 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.jboss.org/message/595453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://planet.jboss.org/post/why_is_jboss_as_7_so_fast&lt;/ref&gt; Major changes visible to the user are the inability to define resources like JMS destinations and datasources inside archives (war/ear),&lt;ref&gt;http://community.jboss.org/message/606449&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossAS7VsAS6&lt;/ref&gt; the way datasources are defined,&lt;ref&gt;http://community.jboss.org/wiki/DataSourceConfigurationInAS7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.javalinux.it/wordpress/2011/07/14/how-to-create-an-manage-datasources-in-as7/&lt;/ref&gt; a much smaller size (less than half of JBoss AS 6)&lt;ref name=JBoss_downloads/&gt; and a 10-fold reduction in startup time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jboss.org/as7.html JBoss Application Server 7].&lt;/ref&gt;
