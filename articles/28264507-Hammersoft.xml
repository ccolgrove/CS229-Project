The '''[[Atlanta Falcons]]â[[New Orleans Saints]] rivalry''', originally known as the Dixie Championship and now more often called the Southern Showdown, is a divisional rivalry in the [[NFC South]] of the [[National Football League]]. At 85 games played, the series is by far the oldest and most established rivalry in the division. Born one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the [[Deep South]] (Washington and Dallas being arguably southern but not in the traditional Deep South). They have shared many of the same players, such as [[Morten Andersen]] (the leading scorer in both franchises' histories), [[Bobby Hebert]] (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and [[Joe Horn]] (the [[Pro Bowl]] Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach [[Jim L. Mora]] is the son of longtime Saints coach [[Jim E. Mora]], and former Falcons and Saints coach [[Wade Phillips]] is the son of former Saints coach [[Bum Phillips]]. Although rarely noted by the national media - no doubt due to both teams' long stretches of futility - games between the Falcons and Saints have riveted their respective regions for more than 40 years. Fans of both teams consider the other their most important and hated opponent.

ESPN.com writer [[Len Pasquarelli]] has cited the rivalry as one of the best in all of sports: &quot;Every year, bus caravans loaded with rowdy (and usually very inebriated) fans make the seven-hour trip between the two cities. Unless you've attended a Falcons-Saints debauchery-filled afternoon, you'll just have to take my word for how much fun it really can be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Len Pasquarelli|first=Len|last=Pasquarelli|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&amp;id=2549313|title=Super Bowl or bowl games? Enough said|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-time series is currently led by Atlanta at 46-39 (45-39 regular season, 1-0 playoffs). The series began in 1967, the first year of play for the Saints, and press accounts from that game, including the Rome (Ga.) News-Tribune and Los Angeles Times, refer to it as the &quot;Dixie Championship.&quot; In recent years, the game has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;Southern Showdown.&quot; This has especially been the case leading up to the first of the two 2011 games, by WWL radio in New Orleans.

==History==
===Notable games===
:* In the midst of New Orleans' [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints|troubled]] 2005 season in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]] they suffered a bitter loss at [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] to the Falcons on October 16.  The Saints raced to a 10-3 lead in the second quarter before a fumble was returned by [[DeAngelo Hall]] of the Falcons for a 66-yard touchdown and a tie game.  On the final play of the second quarter the Falcons blocked a field goal try and [[Demorrio Williams]] ran back a 59-yard touchdown.  An exchange of six touchdowns ensued and [[Devery Henderson]] caught a 15-yard game-tying score, leaving the game 31-31 in the final minute of regulation.  A penalty on the Saints helped the Falcons set up [[Todd Peterson (place kicker)|Todd Peterson]]'s 36-yard field goal on the final play, ending a 34-31 Falcons win.  Saints coach [[Jim Haslett]] was so angry over the late penalty that he repeatedly ripped the &quot;chicken (blank)&quot; calls by the referees.

:* The Falcons were the opponent in the Saints' first game in the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]], held on September 25, 2006. The Saints won the nationally televised match 23-3; the game was the highest-rated program in the history of [[ESPN]] and the second-highest-rated cable program of all time.

:* The Falcons hosted the Saints on November 26, 2006 at the [[Georgia Dome]].  [[Michael Vick]] rushed for 166&amp;nbsp;yards but threw for only 84&amp;nbsp;yards while [[Drew Brees]] of the Saints threw for 349&amp;nbsp;yards (a week after a 510&amp;nbsp;yard performance against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]), including a 48-yard heave to [[Terrance Copper]] caught in heavy traffic in the Falcons endzone for a Saints touchdown. The Saints routed the Falcons 31-13, and after the game Vick flashed an obscene gesture to booing Falcons fans.

:* In 2008 the Falcons flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 14 NFC South rematch with the New Orleans Saints. Atlanta trailed fairly early in the first quarter as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to RB Reggie Bush. In the second quarter, the Falcons continued to trail as kicker Garrett Hartley got a 26-yard field goal. Atlanta would respond RB Michael Turner getting a 5-yard TD run, yet Hartley gave New Orleans a 46-yard field goal. The Falcons struck back with rookie QB Matt Ryan completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Brian Finneran, but the Saints closed out the half with Hartley's 25-yard field goal.  Atlanta would get the third quarter's only points as kicker Jason Elam nailed a 23-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans tried to pull away as Brees completed a 7-yard touchdown pass to RB Pierre Thomas, yet their 2-point conversion attempt failed. The Falcons would then take the lead as Ryan got a 12-yard touchdown run, followed by a 2-point pass to wide receiver Michael Jenkins. However, the Saints got the last laugh as Thomas got a 5-yard TD run for a 29-25 New Orleans win.

:* The Saints were on a quest for an undefeated season in 2009 when on November 2 they hosted the Falcons on [[Monday Night Football]].  The Falcons got on the board first in the first quarter on a 13-yard [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] rushing touchdown, answered later in the quarter by [[Pierre Thomas (American football)|Pierre Thomas]], who scored from 22&amp;nbsp;yards out.  After forcing a Falcons punt the Saints were hemmed in at their own four-yard line - [[Drew Brees]] was sacked and fumbled to [[Kroy Biermann]], who ran in a Falcons touchdown and a 14-7 Atlanta lead after one quarter.  New Orleans then erupted with 21&amp;nbsp;second-quarter points on touchdowns by [[Marques Colston]] and [[Reggie Bush]] and a [[Jabari Greer]] interception returned 48&amp;nbsp;yards for the touchdown.  Atlanta's struggles were exacerbated when kicker [[Jason Elam]] missed two second-quarter field goal tries, but the Falcons stayed close as [[Matt Ryan]] found [[Roddy White]] deep and connected on a 68-yard score.  Elam connected on a 25-yard field goal early in the fourth and the Falcons forced a Thomas fumble, but Ryan was then picked off by [[Tracy Porter]].  Brees led the Saints down field and connected with Thomas from one yard out and a 35-24 lead, but after turning the ball over on downs and then forcing yet another Saints fumble the Falcons got another Elam field goal in the final two minutes.  [[Coy Wire]] then got the ensuing Falcons onside kick at the Saints 49, but Ryan's throw was picked off by [[Darren Sharper]] at the Saints 5, ending a 35-27 Saints win.

:* In the 2010 season, both teams meet for the fifth time in six seasons on Monday Night Football. Playoff implications were on the line for both teams, specifically the [[NFC South]] title and potentially the top overall seed in the NFC Playoffs. In Week 15, Atlanta, with a 12-2 record at the time, had already secured a playoff berth, needing a win in either of their last two games to win the division, while a loss for New Orleans, with a 10-4 record at the time, set them back, needing to win their last two games and for Atlanta to lose against Carolina in Week 17 to repeat as division champions. New Orleans would score first with [[Garrett Hartley]] kicking a FG from 52 yards late in the first quarter. RB [[Pierre Thomas]] would add to the Saints' lead with a 2-yard TD run; however, Atlanta would respond with a [[Matt Ryan]] 7-yard TD pass to [[Roddy White]] to cut the lead to three. After a scoreless third quarter, the Falcons took the lead with [[Chauncey Davis]] returning an interception 26 yards for a touchdown. New Orleans reclaimed the lead late in the 4th with a [[Drew Brees]] 6-yard TD pass to [[Jimmy Graham]]. Atlanta attempted a comeback; however, New Orleans held on for a 17-14 win, clinching a playoff berth in the process. In Week 17, Atlanta eventually won the division and top seed in the NFC with a victory over Carolina while New Orleans settled for a wild-card spot with a loss to Tampa Bay. In the [[2010â11 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], New Orleans lost to the [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] 41-36 in the Wild-Card Round, while Atlanta was routed by the eventual [[Super Bowl XLV]] champion [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in the Divisional Round 48-21.
