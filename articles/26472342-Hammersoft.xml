'''WENY-DT2''' is the [[CBS]]-affiliated [[television station]] for the Central and Western [[Southern Tier]] of [[New York State]] and Northern [[Pennsylvania]]. The station is a second digital subchannel of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WENY-TV]] that is owned by [[Lilly Broadcasting]]. Over-the-air, it broadcasts a digital signal on [[UHF]] channel 36.2 from a transmitter on Higman Hill in [[Corning (town), New York|Corning]]. The station can also be seen on [[Time Warner Cable|Time Warner]] channel 12 and in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on digital channel 701. Its parent station has studios on Old Ithaca Road in [[Horseheads (town), New York|Horseheads]]. Syndicated programming on WENY-DT2 includes: ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[TMZ on TV]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', and ''[[The Insider]]''. There is no separate website for this channel. 

==History==
On October 20, 2008, CBS signed an affiliation agreement with WENY to air the network on a new second digital subchannnel with a proposed launch date of January 1, 2009. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbscorporation.com/news/prdetails.php?id=3763&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/10/cbs_to_add_wenydt_as_affiliate.php TV Week: CBS to add WENY-DT as affiliate, October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; This would mark the first time that CBS has ever had an affiliate based in Elmira. The area had been served by longtime default affiliate [[WBNG-TV]] in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] while [[Ithaca, New York|Ithica]] was served by [[WTVH]]. [[Canisteo (town), New York|Canisteo]] and [[Hornell, New York|Hornell]] were covered by [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]'s [[WIVB-TV]]. According to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), WENY had a request to [[flash-cut]] from analog to digital broadcasting after the old transition date of February 17, 2009. &lt;ref&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-288530A2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

On that date, WENY-DT2 launched on Time Warner systems in Elmira, [[Corning (city), New York|Corning]], Hornell, and Ithaca. &lt;ref&gt;[http://weny.com/News-Local.asp?ARTICLE3864=9142484 WENY-TV Takes Over Local CBS Affiliate Thursday], Scott Cook, WENY-TV, February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stargazette.com/article/20081231/NEWS01/812310322 WENY-TV to add HD channels in new year: Station will provide both ABC and CBS programs soon â¢ Roger Neumann â¢ Star-Gazette â¢ December 31, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theithacajournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081202/NEWS01/812020301 Time Warner to swap CBS affiliate channel â¢ Tim Ashmore â¢ Ithaca Journal â¢ December 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of May, WENY performed a flash-cut and began broadcasting exclusively in digital. The new CBS station began its transmission over-the-air at this point. WENY-DT2's coverage area includes [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]] and [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung]] Counties in New York which borders the [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] [[media market|market]] and sister station CBS affiliate [[WSEE-TV]]. It is unknown if there is any coordination of the two CBS stations that come within one county of each other in coverage and serve an area reaching between [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and Binghamton (not inclusive).

==Newscasts==
Compared with rival [[NBC]] affiliate [[WETM-TV]], WENY's news department is quite small for a [[Big Three television networks|big three]] affiliate. There is an hour-long weekday morning show at 6 that is simulcasted on WENY-DT2. Although there is no news in the 5 o'clock hour on weeknights, WENY airs broadcasts at 6, 7, and 11. The prime time show at 7 is seen exclusively on WENY-DT2 and this channel simulcasts the late news at 11 from the main channel. There are no weekend newscasts on either station.
