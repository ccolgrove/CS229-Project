==History==

Concordia was created with the 1974 merger of Loyola College (1896) and Sir George Williams University (1926).

===Loyola College===
{{Main|Loyola College (Montreal)}}
[[File:Loyola college 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Loyola College in 1937.]]
Loyola College was founded on [[Sherbrooke Street|Sherbrooke Street West]] in 1896 as an English-language program of the Jesuit [[CollÃ¨ge Sainte-Marie de MontrÃ©al]] (since merged into [[UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al]]). It was originally located at the Sacred Heart Convent in downtown Montreal. The college moved into the present west-end campus in 1916. Although founded as a ''collÃ¨ge classique'' (the forerunners of Quebec's [[CEGEP]]s), Loyola began granting university degrees through [[UniversitÃ© Laval]] as early as 1906. By 1940, ''collÃ¨ge classique'' programs were gone and Loyola became a four-year university, although it never obtained its own charter, granting its degrees through Laval or, after 1920, the [[UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al]].

===Sir George Williams University===
[[File:Sir george william 1970.jpg|thumb|left|Sir George Williams University's Henry F. Hall Building in 1970.]]
In 1851, the first [[YMCA]] in [[North America]] was established&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ymca.net/about_the_ymca/history_of_the_ymca.html YMCA History] YMCA International.&lt;/ref&gt; on what is now [[De Maisonneuve Boulevard]] in [[Downtown Montreal]], in a district now known as [[Quartier Concordia]].  From its early years, the YMCA offered evening classes to allow working people in the [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking community]] to pursue their education while working during the day.  In 1926, the education program was re-organized as Sir George Williams College, named after [[George Williams (YMCA)|George Williams]], founder of the YMCA. In 1934, Sir George Williams College offered the first undergraduate credit course in adult education in Canada.

The College became Sir George Williams University (SGWU) in 1948, when it received a university charter from the provincial government, though it remained the education arm of the Montreal YMCA.  SGWU expanded into its first standalone building, the Norris Building, in 1956. It established a Centre for Human Relations and Community Studies in 1963. SGWU continued to hold classes in the YMCA building until the construction of the Hall Building in 1966. The university gained international attention in 1969, when a group of students occupied the Hall Building's 9th floor computer lab (see [[Sir George Williams Computer Riot]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordia.ca/about/whoweare/ourhistory/sgw.php History of Sir George Williams University], Concordia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1974-present===
The merger of Loyola College and Sir George Williams University was recommended in 1969 by the [[royal commission|Parent Commission]], as part of the [[secularism|secularization]] of Quebec's educational system (see [[Quiet Revolution]]).
In August 1974, the two schools would follow the commission's recommendations and merge, thus creating Concordia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://www.concordia.ca/about/whoweare/ourhistory/ |title=Concordia University History |publisher=Concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was taken from the motto of the city of Montreal, ''Concordia salus'' (meaning 'well-being through harmony').&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives3.concordia.ca/timeline/histories/naming_b.html Concordia Timeline], Concordia University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1968, in the wake of the Parent Commission Report, the Quebec government asked Loyola and Sir George Williams to consider some form of union. Negotiations began in 1969 and continued on and off over the next four years.

While a number of possible models were considered, including that of a loose federation, the solution finally adopted was that of an integrated institution, Concordia University, operating under the existing Sir George Williams charter. The legal existence of Concordia dates from August 24, 1974.

Today, the school is one of three English-language universities in the province of Quebec. The other two institutions are [[Bishop's University]] in the [[Lennoxville, Quebec|Lennoxville]] borough of [[Sherbrooke]], and [[McGill University]], also in Montreal.

===Logos===
Concordia University has changed its logo four times in its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web2.concordia.ca/mrkcom/newvision/index.php A new visual identity for the university], Concordia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
[[Image:Concordia University.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The Henry F. Hall Building (left) and the John Wilson McConnell Library Building (right) on the Sir George Williams campus.]]
The university has two campuses, set approximately 7&amp;nbsp;km apart: Sir George Williams Campus in the downtown core of Montreal, in an area known as [[Quartier Concordia]] (at [[Guy-Concordia (Montreal Metro)|Guy-Concordia]] [[Montreal Metro|Metro]] station), and Loyola Campus in the residential west-end district of [[Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce]]. They are connected by free shuttle-bus service for students, faculty and staff.

===Libraries===

Concordia University has two library locations, Webster Library located in the McConnell Building of the Sir George Williams Campus and Vanier Library on the Loyola Campus. Concordia Libraries house several special and unique collections including the Azrieli Holocaust Collection and the Irving Layton Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.concordia.ca/services/collections/unique/ |title=Unique Collections |publisher=Library.concordia.ca |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Special Collections are located in the Vanier Library. The Libraries also maintains the University's institutional repository, Spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/ |title=Welcome to Spectrum: Concordia University Research Repository - Spectrum: Concordia University Research Repository |publisher=Spectrum.library.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concordia Libraries are members of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carl-abrc.ca/about/members-e.html |title=CARL - Members Phone List |publisher=Carl-abrc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New buildings===
Completed in 2009, the MB Building houses the [[John Molson School of Business]]. In 2001, Concordia embarked on a mission to develop and expand the quality of the downtown campus, and to revive the west end in Montreal. The development is set to conclude by 2010 (though construction is currently behind schedule).

The university has also acquired the historic [[Grey Nuns]] property near its Sir George Williams Campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ingrid |last=Peretz |title=Montreal nuns moving&amp;nbsp;â with saint's remains |curly= |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081223.wnuns23/BNStory/National/home |publisher=[[Globe and Mail]] |date=24 December 2008 |accessdate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for $18 million. Built in 1879, it would alone double the size of the current downtown campus. From 2007 to 2022, the university will begin occupying the building in 4 separate phases. The large property will house the faculty of Fine Arts and possibly the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, and other departments.  Currently the Grey Nuns building is only partially owned by Concordia (about 1/3 of the building on Saint-Mathieu Road), however full control of the building will be given to Concordia University in 2011.  Concordia Residence Life currently houses nearly 250 students each year in the Grey Nuns building.  The dorm-rooms are among the largest in the country, as many of the rooms have been transformed from when the section of the Grey Nuns building was occupied by the Grey Nuns.

[[File:Concordia EV Building.jpg|right|thumb|The Integrated Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Complex on the corner of [[Saint Catherine Street]] and [[Guy Street]].]]
The Integrated Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Complex at [[Saint Catherine Street]] and [[Guy Street]] was opened in September 2005. The building is directly connected to the [[Guy-Concordia (Montreal Metro)|Guy-Concordia metro station]] and also houses Le Gym, a facility of Athletics and Recreation.

Across the street, the 100-year-old [[TD Canada Trust]] building was donated to Concordia in 2005 by the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]]. The university had planned to begin using this space in 2006.

Construction of the new [[John Molson School of Business]] Building that is located on the corner of Guy and de Maisonneuve streets began in February 2007. The [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Quebec Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports]], [[Jean-Marc Fournier]], on October 30, 2006 announced an investment of $60 million towards the construction of the new building. The minister made the announcement during a ceremony at Concordia. The governmentâs $60 million represents about half of the total construction costs. Construction started on January 22, 2006 and the building was completed and opened in September, 2009. The fifteen story building now houses the JMSBâs 6,000 full and part-time students under the same roof for the very first time. The dance and theatre departments at Concordia have also moved into the new JMSB building. It is connected to the EV building by a tunnel under Guy Street.

In April, 2010, a 120-metre tunnel completed the underground connections of the Guy-Concordia metro station with the Hall Building and the McConnell Library building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://news.concordia.ca/main_story/016628.shtml |title=New tunnel linking Concordia buildings now open |publisher=News.concordia.ca |date=2010-04-09 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==
[[File:Concordia campus map-2.png|thumb|250px|right|The location of Concordia's two campuses in Montreal.]]
Concordia has more than 180 [[undergraduate]] programs, divided into four faculties:
*'''Faculty of [[Arts]] and [[Science]]'''
*'''Faculty of [[Engineering]] and [[Computer Science]]''' (ENCS) students can choose to specialize in the following disciplines: [[Building Engineering]], [[Civil Engineering]], [[Computer Engineering]], [[Computer Science]], [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Industrial Engineering]], [[Information Systems Security]],  [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Quality Systems Engineering]], [[Software Engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cemf.ca/Engineering/UniversityList.htm Canadian Engineering Memorial Foundation - University List]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Faculty of [[Fine Arts]]''', including [[The Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema]].
*'''[[John Molson School of Business]]''' (formerly the Faculty of [[Commerce]] and Administration)

Students are normally enrolled in one of these Faculties, but they may take courses from any of the others as part of their studies. Many programs also offer a 'co-operative' component, whereby students get work experience while they study. Class sizes vary from 85-400 students.

In addition, the School of Graduate Studies offers about 70 programs leading to Master's and doctoral degrees, as well as graduate diplomas and certificates for professionals seeking to upgrade their knowledge and skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://graduatestudies.concordia.ca/ |title=Deanâs Message - School of Graduate Studies - Concordia University - Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=Graduatestudies.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School of Extended Learning offers programs and services designed to make it easier for students to attend the university and be successful at their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://extendedlearning.concordia.ca/ |title=Homepage - School of Extended Learning - Concordia University - Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=Extendedlearning.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students enter the university in September, or, in some cases, in January or May. An undergraduate degree normally takes three or four years studying full-time to complete, a Master's takes from a year and a half to three years, and a Ph.D. is at least four years long. Certificates and diplomas usually take no longer than a year and a half to complete.

In addition to regular academic programs, Concordia University has five outstanding units (three colleges, one school and one institute), which aim at introducing students to special topics in a more intensive and intimate setting:

*'''[[Liberal Arts College]]'''
*'''[[Loyola International College]]'''
*'''School of Community and Public Affairs'''
*'''[[Science College]]'''
*'''[[Simone de Beauvoir]] Institute'''

==Student life==
[[File:Loyola concordia.jpg|thumb|Concordia's Loyola Campus in the fall.]]

===Campus media===
Concordia University has student-run media outlets, including newspapers (''[[The Link (newspaper)|The Link]]'', ''[[The Concordian (Montreal)|The Concordian]]'' and ''L'Organe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorgane.org/ |title=l'Organe magazine, MontrÃ©al |publisher=Lorgane.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio ([[CJLO]]) and TV ([[Concordia University Television|CUTV]]) stations.

The university presses, ''The Concordian'', ''The Link'', and ''L'Organe'' are members of [[Canadian University Press|CUP]].

===Athletics===
{{Main|Concordia Stingers}}
Concordia University's athletic teams are called the [[Concordia Stingers]]. They compete with other schools in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]], and more specifically, in the [[Quebec Student Sports Federation]] and the [[Quebec University Football League]]. The university has ten varsity teams. In the fall, teams compete in [[Canadian football]], men's and women's [[soccer]], men's and women's [[rugby union]] and [[sport wrestling]]. There are female and male wrestlers on the team from year to year, however they compete as one team. In the winter, teams compete in men's and women's [[ice hockey]] and men's and women's [[basketball]].

Concordia won a national championship in 1999, when the women's hockey team beat the [[University of Alberta]] in the final game of the season. Recently, the Stingers beat Cape Breton University Capers 12-2 and won the 2009 National Baseball Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athletics.concordia.ca/sports/news/Newnews.php?f=detail&amp;news_id=358&amp;start=0&amp;sportype=DEPT |title=Concordia Department of Recreation and Athletics &amp;#124; News [Concordia wins national baseball crown&amp;#93; |publisher=Athletics.concordia.ca |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge Building Competition===
The [[Troitsky Bridge Building Competition]] brings together engineering students from across Canada and parts of the United States. Teams of students representing their universities must build a 1-metre-long bridge using only regular popsicle sticks, [[toothpick]]s, [[dental floss]], and white [[Polyvinyl acetate|glue]]. A panel of judges grades the bridges based on originality and presentation while a hydraulic loading device is used to determine the maximum load and performance.

===Fraternities and sororities===
&lt;!--- Please discuss on talk page before removing section. Thanks. ---&gt;
Concordia University is home to local and international fraternities and sororities. These organizations exist under, and intercommunicate through the Interfraternal Council, known as the &quot;IFC&quot;. In Greek alphabetical order, they are:

The [[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]] Sorority Beta Pi chapter was founded in 1994 at Concordia University, it is the only sorority at Concordia that is International, i.e., with chapters in both the United States and Canada.

===Student activism===
{{Multiple issues| section =January 2010 | POV = March 2008 | disputed = March 2008}}
Concordia has made media headlines for issues involving politically active students. The first major incident was [[Sir George Williams Computer Riot|SGW Computer Riots]] in 1969, before the merger that created today's university. Concordia supports a vibrant student and community level [[civil society]] including well over 60 [[academic]], [[environmentalist]], [[socialist]], [[international development]], [[anarchist]], [[feminist]], [[religious]], [[gay rights]] and [[hacktivist]] organizations, as well as cultural clubs and federal political parties. The level of politicization and activity of student groups is dependent on the group and its purpose, and varies according to changing membership from year to year.

In 1989, Concordia students voted in a referendum to directly fund their [[PIRG]] with a fee-levy. With the support of this social-justice organization, which now had stable funding and a staff of paid workers, student activism flourished in the 1990s. A number of organizations that are now based at the university have their origins as QPIRG Concordia Working Groups. These include The People's Potato, a vegan soup-kitchen; Le Frigo Vert, a non-profit natural food co-op; and Right To Move/La Voie Libre, a fully equipped, volunteer-run bicycle repair workshop. All of these organizations are open to the general public and have strong representations of non-student community members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qpirgconcordia.org/Sections-article2-p1.phtml QPIRG Concordia: ''About Us'']{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concordia students took an active role in the province-wide student strikes of 1996, which resulted in the renewal of a tuition freeze which was later revoked in 2007.

As the 1990s progressed, student activism became more militant, coming to a head in 1999 with the election of the first in a series of radical slates to the Concordia Student Union. Under the presidency of Rob Green, a referendum regarding of another strike garnered 2,284 votes of support. This was an unusually strong show of support, as student governments at Concordia are often elected on the basis of less than 1000 votes in their favor. The strike lasted from November 3 to 5th and targeted a range of issues, including student representation in the university senate, corporate presence and advertising on campus, and government cuts to education. There were several demonstrations in which both protesters and police were reported to be injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctr.concordia.ca/archives/is181199/art9.html |title=Concordia's Thursday Report: '&amp;#39;Students Hold Protest'&amp;#39; |publisher=Ctr.concordia.ca |date=1999-11-18 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2000/042000/cover2.html |title='&amp;#39;Wild in the Streets'&amp;#39; |publisher=Montreal Mirror |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concordia students voted in favor of accreditation of their student union in a referendum in December 2000. As a result, the CSU is now legally accountable only to its student constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bokser |first=Howard |url=http://magazine.concordia.ca/2001-02/december/features/StudentUnion.shtml |title=Concordia University Magazine |publisher=Magazine.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many incidents over the last several years have had their roots in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflict has been largely represented as a one between two student groups: the pro-Palestinian [[Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights]] and pro-Israeli [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]]. In general most student activism is conducted at a lower profile level.

===Netanyahu protest===
[[File:Concordia Netanyahu incident.jpg|thumb|Anti-[[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] protesters break windows of Hall Building, September 9, 2002.]]
On September 9, 2002, a scheduled visit from the then former (and now current) [[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was cancelled after police and protestors clashed inside the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20030115/concordia030115?s_name=&amp;no_ads=|title=Concordia U. regrets anti-Netanyahu riot|coauthors=Canadian Press|date=January 15, 2003|publisher=CTV.ca|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestors and students who were not involved in the protest were stopped at the escalator leading to the lobby by police in riot gear. Protesters engaged in attacks on police officers, and police engaged in attacks on protestors. Innocent bystanders were forced to defend themselves from police and protestors alike, as captured on Concordia's internal security footage as well as RCMP and SPVM footage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} At this point protesters, as well as bystanders witnessing the mutual violence between police and protestors, began banging on the large window front of Concordia's Hall building.

For the duration of the standoff, ticket-holders pushed their way through a thick crowd of protesters and police outside the building, entering the Hall building through a secured access point complete with metal detector. They were then escorted to the auditorium where the lecture was to take place. Ticket holders later complained that the protesters had subjected them to antisemitic slogans and even physical attack. Holocaust survivor Thomas Hecht was kicked in the groin by protesters and a local Rabbi was also physically assaulted. 

Shortly after ticket holders were escorted into the Hall building the large window front that protestors and bystanders were banging on shattered, prompting a police officer to immediately discharge [[pepper spray]] through the window of the Hall building, poisoning both the small minority of protestors involved and the large majority of innocent bystanders. The spray entered the building's ventilation system forcing an evacuation of the entire building. At approximately the same time, a second window on the building's first floor, on the western side was broken when protesters threw a metal barricade into it because they were being intimidated by police.

The immediate result of the protest and subsequent evacuation was the cancellation of the lecture. The university instituted additional measures to avert future incidents, including the banning of any events related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as enabling the use of new student disciplinary rules in case of emergency.

Five demonstrators were arrested,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2248555.stm Canada protests stop Netanyahu speech. 10 September 2002. BBC World News.]''&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional 12 faced internal disciplinary hearings under the University's Code of Rights and Responsibilities&lt;ref&gt;''[http://mediarelations.concordia.ca/mediaroom/pressreleases/2002/10/000560.shtml Concordia University Press Release. 31 October 2002.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary &quot;[[Discordia (film)|Discordia]]&quot;, produced by
Adam Symansky, documents the fallout from the &quot;Concordia riot&quot; by following three young Concordia campus activists.&lt;ref&gt;

===Concordia University massacre===
{{Main|Concordia University massacre}}
On August 24, 1992, [[Valery Fabrikant]], a Mechanical Engineering professor, [[Concordia University massacre|shot five colleagues]] on the ninth floor of the Hall Building.

Civil Engineering professor Matthew McCartney Douglass, Chemistry professor Michael Gorden Hogben, and Mechanical Engineering Professor Aaron Jaan Saber died that day, while Electrical and Computer Engineering Chair Phoivos Ziogas passed on a month later from his wounds.  Elizabeth Horwood, secretary in the Mechanical Engineering department, recovered from her injuries.

Fabrikant was convicted of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment.  The university erected a memorial to the slain professors (four granite tables) in the Hall Building lobby.
