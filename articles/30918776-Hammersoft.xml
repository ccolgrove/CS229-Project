The '''WWW Interactive Multipurpose Server (WIMS)''' (sometimes referred to as ''WWW Interactive Mathematics Server'') project is designed for supporting intensive mathematics exercises via the [[Internet]] or in a computer-equipped classroom with server-side interactivity, accessible at the address http://wims.unice.fr.

The system has the following main features:
*A modular design allowing applications and software interfaces to be created and maintained independently from each other.
*Features interfaces for software including MuPAD, PARI/GP, [[Gnuplot]], [[Povray]], Co.
*Dynamic rendering of mathematical formulas and animated graphics.
*A structure of virtual classes, including mechanisms for automatic score gathering and processing.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://wims.unice.fr/paper/wims/wims.html WIMS Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is open source and freely available under the [[GNU General Public Licence]], however each WIMS module has its own copyright policy, which may differ from that of the server program.&lt;ref name=&quot;copyr&quot;/&gt;

It is often cited and linked&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=wims.unice.fr List of Wikipedia articles linking to WIMS modules/applets]&lt;/ref&gt; for its sophisticated &quot;online calculator&quot; tools capable of generating animated [[GIF]]s of parametric 2D or 3D graphs or allowing prime tests with very large numbers.
