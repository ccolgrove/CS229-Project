In [[military]] terminology, '''desertion''' is the [[abandonment]] of a &quot;[[duty]]&quot; or post without permission and is done with the intention of not returning. &quot;Absence Without Leave&quot; (AWOL) can refer to either desertion or a temporary absence.

== Absence without leave ==
In the [[British Armed Forces|United Kingdom]], [[United States Armed Forces|United States]] and [[Canadian Forces|Canada]], military personnel will become '''AWOL''' ({{IPA-en|ËeÉªwÉËl|pron}}; U.S.: Absence Without Leave&lt;ref&gt;Manual For Courts-Martial United States, 1995 Edition, U.S. Government Printing Office (1995), Article 86, Absence without leave&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''AWL''' (pronounced the same; U.K., Canada, and Australia: Absent Without Leave) when they are absent from their post without a valid [[pass (U.S. military)|pass]] or [[leave (U.S. military)|leave]]. The United States Marine Corps and United States Navy generally refer to this as '''Unauthorized Absence''', or &quot;'''UA'''&quot;. Such people are dropped from their unit rolls after 30&amp;nbsp;days and then listed as ''deserters''. However, as a matter of U.S. [[military law]], desertion is not measured by time away from the unit, but rather:
* by leaving or remaining absent from their unit, organization, or place of duty, where there has been a determined [[intent (law)|intent]] to not return;
* if that intent is determined to be to avoid hazardous duty or shirk contractual obligation;
* if they enlist or accept an appointment in the same or another branch of service without disclosing the fact that they have not been properly separated from current service.

People who are away for more than 30&amp;nbsp;days but return voluntarily or indicate a credible intent to return may still be considered ''AWOL''. Those who are away for fewer than 30&amp;nbsp;days but can credibly be shown to have no intent to return (for example, by joining the armed forces of another country) may nevertheless be tried for ''desertion''. In rare occasions, they may be tried for [[treason]] if enough evidence is found.

In the United States, before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], deserters from the Army were [[flogging|flogged]]; while, after 1861, [[tattoo]]s or [[branding persons|branding]] were also adopted. The maximum U.S. penalty for desertion in wartime remains [[death penalty|death]], although this punishment was last applied to [[Eddie Slovik]] in 1945. No U.S. serviceman has received more than 18&amp;nbsp;months imprisonment for desertion or missing movement during the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlgmltf.org/onWatch/Onwatch_xx-3_Jan_Feb_2009.pdf ''On Watch'' &quot;AWOL in the Army, version 2.0&quot;, James M. Branum and updated by and Susan Bassein.]&lt;/ref&gt;

AWOL/UA may be punished with [[non-judicial punishment]] (NJP) and may punished by [[Court Martial]] under Article 86 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] for repeat or more severe offenses.

Also, &quot;Missing Movement&quot; is another term which is used to describe when a particular serviceman fails to arrive at the appointed time to deploy (or &quot;move out&quot;) with his assigned [[military unit|unit]], ship, or aircraft; in the [[Military of the United States|United States military]], it is a violation of the Article 87 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The offense is similar to AWOL, but considered more severe.

Less severe is [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/1999Term/98-0825.htm &quot;Failure to Report&quot;], consisting of missing a formation, or failing to appear at an assigned place and time when so ordered.

== Rogue units ==
Rogue [[military units]] are usually when an officer deserts with most or all troops under his command. This usually leads to a creation of a new faction. This is typically caused when their country is near defeat, during a [[societal collapse]], or following a [[mutiny]]. Examples include rogue units during the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], during the Soviet advance toward Germany in World War II when the [[Russian Liberation Army]] deserted, fighting both German and Soviet forces and during [[World War I]] when hundreds of Russian units deserted to head home and participate in the [[Russian Revolution]].

==U.S. War of 1812 ==
The desertion rate for American soldiers in the [[War of 1812]] was 12.7%, according to available service records. Desertion was especially common in 1814, when enlistment bonuses were increased from $16 to $124, inducing many men to desert one unit and enlist in another to get two bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;J.C.A. Stagg, &quot;Enlisted Men in the United States Army, 1812-1815: A Preliminary Survey,&quot; William and Mary Quarterly, 43 (1986), 615-45, esp. pp. 624-25, in [http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1923685.pdf in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==MexicanâAmerican War, 1846-48==
In the [[MexicanâAmerican War]], high desertion rates were a major problem for the Mexican army, depleting forces on the eve of battle. Most of the soldiers were peasants who had a loyalty to their village and family but not to the generals who conscripted them. Often hungry and ill, never well paid, under-equipped and only partially trained, the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the Americans. Looking for their opportunity, many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Meed, ''The Mexican War, 1846-1848'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The desertion rate in the U.S. army was 8.3% (9,200 out of 111,000), compared to 12.7% during the War of 1812 and usual peacetime rates of about 14.8% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0195045556/ref=sib_dp_srch_pop?v=search-inside&amp;keywords=desertion&amp;go.x=8&amp;go.y=12 see Edward M. Coffman, ''The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784-1898'' (1988) p 193]&lt;/ref&gt; Many men deserted in order to join another U.S. unit and get a second enlistment bonus. Others deserted because of the miserable conditions in camp, or were using the army to get free transportation to California, where they deserted to join the [[California gold rush]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Foos, ''A Short, Offhand, Killing Affair: Soldiers and Social Conflict during the Mexican-American War'' (University of North Carolina Press. 2002) p 25, 103-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred deserters went over to the Mexican side; nearly all were recent immigrants from Europe with weak ties to the U.S. The most famous group was the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]], about half of whom were Catholics from Ireland. The Mexicans issued broadsides and leaflets enticing U.S. soldiers with promises of money, land bounties, and officers' commissions. Mexican guerrillas shadowed the U.S. Army, and captured men who took unauthorized leave or fell out of the ranks. The guerrillas coerced these men to join the Mexican ranksâthreatening to kill them if they failed to comply. The generous promises proved illusory for most deserters, who risked getting shot if captured by U.S. forces. About fifty of the San Patricios were tried and hanged following their capture at Churubusco in August 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Foos (2002) p 105-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
Desertion was a major factor for the Confederacy in the last two years of the war. According to Weitz (2000), Confederate soldiers fought to defend their families, not a nation. He argues that a hegemonic &quot;planter class&quot; brought [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] into the war with &quot;little support from non-slaveholders&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;12), and the ambivalence of non-slaveholders toward secession, he maintains, was the key to understanding desertion. The privations of the home front and camp life, combined with the terror of battle, undermined the weak attachment of southern soldiers to the Confederacy. For Georgia troops, Sherman's march through their home counties triggered the most desertions.

Adoption of a localist identity caused soldiers to desert as well. When soldiers implemented a local identity, they neglected to think of themselves as Southerners fighting a Southern cause. When they replaced their Southern identity with their previous local identity, they lost their motive to fight and, therefore, deserted the army.&lt;ref&gt;Bearman, P. (1991). ''Desertion as Localism: Army Unit Solidarity and Group Norms in the U.S. Civil War.'' Social Forces, 70(2), 321-342. Retrieved from Academic Search Premier Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of desertion in the Civil War was Confederate soldier Arthur Muntz, who was killed by his fellow soldiers after deserting at [[The First Battle of Bull Run]]. In many cases, in the early years of the war, the [[Confederate Home Guard]] dealt with deserters. For a time, the [[Confederate State of America|Confederate]] government offered a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] to be paid for the capture and return of deserters. However as the war progressively got worse for the south, often Home Guard units would deal with desertion as they saw fit, whether that be by execution or imprisonment. The lynching of [[Bill Sketoe]], a Methodist minister from [[Newton, Alabama]] who had allegedly deserted the Southern army in late 1864, is a case in point.

In [[Arkansas]], many units deserted completely when rumors spread that local [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] had raided towns and scalped citizens, with the soldiers feeling their place was at home rather than fighting in the war. There were also instances across the southern states where whole units deserted together, banding together and living in the mountains, at times fighting against [[Union Army]] regulars if forced to do so, but also raiding civilian farms to obtain food or supplies. [http://www.civilwarhome.com/desertion.htm] The fictional story of a wounded Confederate deserter is told in the novel ''[[Cold Mountain (novel)|Cold Mountain]]'', who at the end of the Civil War walks for months to return home to the love of his life after receiving her letters pleading him to come home. Many Confederate units had signed on, initially, for a one year service, and felt completely justified in walking away when they'd reached their breaking point. By the war's end, it was estimated that the Confederacy had lost 103,400 soldiers to desertion. [http://www.etymonline.com/cw/desert.htm]

The Union Army also faced large scale desertions. Confederate forces lost fewer to desertion than did the northern forces. This has been partly attributed to the southern soldiers fighting a defensive war, on their own ground, rather than an offensive war of invasion, which gave the southern soldiers a sense that they were defending their homeland which is always an advantage in any war. In addition, up until late 1863 the South had many victories (in fact more than the North), and many northern soldiers felt the war was a lost cause. For example, [[New York]] alone suffered 44,913 desertions by the war's end, with [[Pennsylvania]] having 24,050 and [[Ohio]] having 18,354, not to mention the desertions faced by the other northern states.

==World War I==
&quot;306 British and Commonwealth soldiers [were] executed for...desertion during World War I,&quot; records the [[Shot at Dawn Memorial]].
&quot;During the period between August 1914 and March 1920 more than 20,000 servicemen were convicted by courts-martial of offences which carried the death sentence. Only 3,000 of those men were ordered to be put to death and of those just over 10% were executed....&quot; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1399983.stm]

==World War II==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
Over 21,000 US military personnel were convicted and sentenced for desertion during the 3.5&amp;nbsp;years of American involvement in World War II. More than 16,000 men escaped by air stowed away and flying stolen fighter planes. 4,000 men escaped by sea in war ships and small canoes/dinghies. The other 1,000 tried running through war ground, only half succeeding. Of these, 49 were [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], but only one soldier, [[Eddie Slovik]], was actually executed for desertion; he is the only American soldier to be executed since the [[American Civil War]].

The 'Lost Division' was a term given to the estimated 19,000 [[U.S. Army]] soldiers absent without leave in [[France]] at the close of [[World War II]].

Of the Germans who deserted the [[Wehrmacht]], 15,000 men were executed. In June 1988 the Initiative for the Creation of a Memorial to Deserters came to life in [[Ulm]]. A central idea was, &quot;Desertion is not reprehensible, war is&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sites-of-memory.de/main/ulmdeserters.html|title=Memorial to Deserters in Ulm |author=Mark R.

[[Order No. 270]], dated August 16, 1941, was issued by [[Joseph Stalin]]. The order required superiors to shoot deserters on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stalinism.ru/army/prik270.htm Text of Order No. 270]&lt;/ref&gt; Their family members were subjected to arrest.&lt;ref name&gt;Roberts, Geoffrey.

==Vietnam War==
Approximately 50,000 American servicemen deserted during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=24009b4dc8fe8dadcfa96c37bce9dea6 Vietnam War Resisters in Canada Open Arms to U.S. Military Deserters].

For example, Sweden allows asylum for foreign soldiers deserting from war, if the war does not align with the current goals of Swedish foreign policy. Deserted U.S. soldiers in Vietnam were given asylum in Sweden.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Iraq War==
===United Kingdom===
On May 28, 2006, the UK military reported over 1,000 deserters since the beginning of the [[Iraq war]], with 566 deserting since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5024104.stm | work=BBC News | title=At least 1,000 UK soldiers desert | date=May 28, 2006 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], more than 5,500 military personnel deserted in 2003&amp;ndash;2004, following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq invasion and occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/12/06/60II/main659336.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Deserters: We Won't Go To Iraq | date=December 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number had reached about 8,000 by the first quarter of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Bill|last= Nicholas|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= 8,000 desert during Iraq war|url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-03-07-deserters_x.htm|work= |publisher= [[USA Today]]|date= March 6, 2006|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report stated that since 2000, about 40,000 troops from all branches of the military have deserted, also according to the Pentagon. More than half of these served in the US Army &lt;ref&gt; http://www.truthout.org/article/40000-us-troops-have-deserted-since-2000&lt;/ref&gt;. Almost all of these soldiers deserted within the USA. There has only been one reported case of a desertion in Iraq. The Army, Navy and Air Force reported 7,978 desertions in 2001, compared with 3,456 in 2005. The Marine Corps showed 1,603 Marines in desertion status in 2001. That had declined by 148 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Bill|last= Nicholas|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= 8,000 desert during Iraq war|url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-03-07-deserters_x.htm |work= |publisher= [[USA Today]]|date= March 6, 2006|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situations in which desertion is legal and/or required under international law==
Under [[international law]], ultimate &quot;[[duty]]&quot; or &quot;[[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]&quot; is not necessarily always to a &quot;Government&quot; nor to &quot;a superior,&quot; as seen in the fourth of the [[Nuremberg Principles]], which states:{{bquote|&quot;The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.&quot;}}This Nuremberg Principle of &quot;moral choice,&quot; &quot;[[morality]],&quot; or &quot;[[conscience]]&quot; being the higher authority was subsequently formulated into [[International Law]] by the [[United Nations]] as we see in this quote: {{bquote|&quot;Under UN General Assembly Resolution 177 (II), paragraph (a), the International Law Commission was directed to 'formulate the principles of international law recognized in the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and in the judgment of the Tribunal.'&quot;}} In 1998, the [[United Nations]] [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] document called â[[Conscientious objection]] to military service, [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] resolution 1998/77â recognized that âpersons [already] performing military service may ''develop'' conscientious objectionsâ while performing military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/5bc5759a53f36ab380256671004b643a?Opendocument |title= Conscientious objection to military service; Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77; see preamble &quot;Aware...&quot;|author= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=April 22, 1998 |work= |publisher= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=3b00f0be10&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;query=1998/77|title=Conscientious objection to military service; E/CN.4/RES/1998/77; See introductory paragraph|date=April 22, 1998|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=1&amp;se=10&amp;t=11|title= Conscientious objection to military service, Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77, Navigation to document: press ânextâ four times, see bottom listing, and at the right choose letter for language (âEâ for English) Document: CHR 54th 4/22/1998E/CN.4/RES/1998/77 |year=1998|publisher= United Nations Human Rights, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |title= THE STATUS OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, 33 N.Y.U.
