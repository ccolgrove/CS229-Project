'''Lubuntu''' (pronounced {{IPA-en|luËËbuËntuË|}} &quot;loo-BOON-too&quot;) is a [[Lightweight Linux distribution|lightweight]] [[Linux]] [[operating system]] based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] but using the [[LXDE]] [[desktop environment]] in place of Ubuntu's [[Unity (desktop environment)|Unity shell]] and [[GNOME]] desktop. LXDE is touted as being &quot;lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DistroWatch11May09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090511#news|title = Another day, another Ubuntu derivative.|accessdate = 2009-05-21|last = Smart|first = Chris|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LXDEBlog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.lxde.org/?p=208|title =Lubuntu?

Lubuntu received official recognition as a formal member of the Ubuntu family on 11 May 2011, commencing with Lubuntu 11.10, which was released on 13 October 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG11May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/lubuntu-made-official-ubuntu-derivative/|title = Lubuntu made âofficial Ubuntu derivativeâ|accessdate = 11 May 2011|last = Sneddon|first =Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuUser11May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.ubuntu-user.com/Online/News/Ubuntu-Makes-Lubuntu-Official-Derivative|title = Ubuntu Makes Lubuntu Official Derivative|accessdate = 15 May 2011|last =Kissling|first =  Kristian and Rikki Kite|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = [[Ubuntu User]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Behling23May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-track-official-status-ubuntu-flavour|title = lubuntu on track to official status as Ubuntu flavour|accessdate = 28 May 2011|last = Behling|first = Mario|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Xubuntu]], Lubuntu is intended to be a low-system-requirement, low-RAM environment for [[netbook]]s, [[mobile device]]s and older PCs - but tests show it can use half as much RAM as Xubuntu making it an attractive choice for installing on older hardware being refurbished for charitable distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;DistroWatch11May09&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Linux-mag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7520/1.html|title = Lubuntu|accessdate = 2009-10-12|last = [[Linux Magazine]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosdick01Mar11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.osnews.com/story/24476/Lubuntu_Finally_a_Lightweight_Ubuntu_|title = Lubuntu: Finally, a Lightweight Ubuntu!|accessdate = 1 March 2011|last = Fosdick|first = Howard|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = February| work = OS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Lubuntu'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''LXDE'' and ''Ubuntu''.&lt;ref name=&quot;LXDEBlog&quot; /&gt; LXDE stands for ''Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Licensing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lxde.org/|title = LXDE|accessdate = 2008-10-26|last = LXDE Team|authorlink = |year = undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the word ''[[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]]'' means &quot;humanity towards others&quot; in the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The LXDE desktop was first made available for Ubuntu in October 2008, with the release of [[Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex]]. These early versions of Lubuntu, including 8.10, 9.04 and 9.10, were not available as separate [[ISO image]] downloads, and could only be installed on Ubuntu as separate ''lubuntu-desktop'' packages from the Ubuntu repositories. LXDE can also be retroactively installed in earlier Ubuntu versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;LXDEwiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Ubuntu|title = Ubuntu|accessdate = 2008-12-03|last = LXDE Wiki|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intervista1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tuxjournal.net/?p=8508|title = Interview with Mario Behling of LXDE page 1|accessdate = 2009-07-21|last = TuxJournal.net|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gilir&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gilir.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/lubuntu-9-10-and-plan-for-lucid/|title = Lubuntu 9.10 and plan for Lucid|accessdate = 2 May 2010|last = Lavergne|first = Julien |authorlink = |year = 2009|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, [[Mark Shuttleworth]] invited the LXDE project to become a self-maintained project within the Ubuntu community, with the aim of leading to a dedicated new official Ubuntu derivative to be called ''Lubuntu''.&lt;ref name=&quot;LXDEBlog&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intervista4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tuxjournal.net/?p=8508&amp;page=4|title = Interview with Mario Behling of LXDE page 4|accessdate = 2009-07-21|last = TuxJournal.net|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbu01Sep09&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/First-Lubuntu-Test-ISOs-Available-120608.shtml|title = First Lubuntu Test ISOs Available|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Barbu|first = Doru|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = September| work = Softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the Lubuntu project was started on [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] by Mario Behling, including an early project logo. The project also established an official Ubuntu wiki project page, that includes listings of applications, packages, and components.&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Launchpad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-desktop|title = Lubuntu|accessdate = 2009-05-24|last = Behling|first = Mario|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, the first test ISO was released as a [[Live CD]], with no installation option.&lt;ref name=&quot;testISO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.lxde.org/?p=514|title = First Lubuntu test ISO available|accessdate = 2009-09-04|last = Behling|first = Mario|year = 2009|month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DW07Sep09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090907#news|title = DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 319, 7 September 2009|accessdate = 2009-09-08|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial testing in September 2009 by [[Linux Magazine]] reviewer Christopher Smart showed that Lubuntu's RAM usage was about half of that of Xubuntu and Ubuntu on a normal installation and desktop use, and one third less on live CD use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linux-mag&quot; /&gt;

===Lubuntu 10.04===
[[File:LXDE Ubuntu.png|thumb|right|Lubuntu 10.04, the first stand-alone version of Lubuntu available]]
On 30 December 2009 the first Alpha 1 &quot;Preview&quot; version ISO for Lubuntu 10.04 ''Lucid Lynx'' was made available for testing, with Alpha 2 following on 24 January 2010. The first Beta was released on 20 March 2010 and the stable version of Lubuntu 10.04 was released on 2 May 2010, four days behind the main Ubuntu release date of 28 April 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;alphaISO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://lists.launchpad.net/lubuntu-desktop/msg00396.html|title = Lubuntu Lucid Alpha 1 &quot;Preview&quot;|accessdate = 2010-01-08|last = Lavergne|first = Julien|year = 2009|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.04releaseISO&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-1004-now-available-download|title = Lubuntu 10.04 is now available for download|accessdate = 15 October 2010|last = Behling|first = Mario|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubuntu1004beta&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-lucid-beta-1-released|title = lubuntu Lucid Beta 1 released|accessdate = 31 December 2010|last = Behling|first = Mario|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = December| work = Lubuntu Official Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DistroWatch25Jan10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100125#news|title = Booting Ubuntu in 15 seconds, Lubuntu update, Slackware articles round-up, insecurity of OpenBSD, Qimo 4 Kids 2.0|accessdate = 2010-01-25|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Launchpad24Jan10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://lists.launchpad.net/lubuntu-desktop/msg00450.html|title = Lubuntu-desktop - Lubuntu Lucid Alpha 2 &quot;Preview 2&quot;|accessdate = 2010-01-15|last = Lavergne |first = Julien |authorlink = |year = 2010|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG18Jan10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/01/lubuntu-10-04-alpha-1-visual-overview/|title = Lubuntu 10.04 Alpha 1 â Visual Overview|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = January| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubuntu 10.04 was only released as a [[32-bit]] ISO file, but users could install a [[64-bit]] version though the 64-bit Mini ISO and then install the required packages.&lt;ref name=&quot;DocumentationHelp&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url =https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/DocumentationHelp#Minimal%20Install%20and%2064%20Bit|title = Documentation Help|accessdate = 11 May 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MinimalInstall&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/DocumentationHelp/MinimalInstall |title = Minimal Install|accessdate = 11 May 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubuntu 10.04 was not intended to be a long-term support release, unlike [[List of Ubuntu releases#Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx)|Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx]], and was only going to be supported for 18 months. However, since the infrastructure of Ubuntu 10.10 ''Maverick Meerkat'' (and thus Lubuntu 10.10) dropped support for [[i586]] processors, including [[VIA C3]], [[AMD K6]], and [[Geode (processor)|AMD Geode]]/[[National Semiconductor]] CPUs, the release of Lubuntu 10.10 prompted the community to extend support until April 2013 for Lubuntu 10.04, as if it were a long term support version.&lt;ref name=&quot;1104Sysreq&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ReleaseNotes/NattyNarwhal|title = Natty Narwhal System Requirements|accessdate = 30 April 2011|last = Lavergne|first =Julien |authorlink = |year = 2011|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Lubuntu 10.04 Alpha 1 in January 2010, Joey Sneddon of ''OMG Ubuntu'' wrote, &quot;Not having had many preconceptions regarding LXDE/Lubuntu i {{sic}} found myself presently surprised. It was pleasant to look at, pleasant to use and although I doubt I would switch from GNOME to LXDE, it can give excellent performance to those who would benefit from doing so.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG18Jan10&quot; /&gt; In writing about the final 10.10 release, on 10 October 2010 Sneddon termed it &quot;A nimble and easy-to-use desktop&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG10Oct10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/10/lubuntu-10-10-released/|title = Lubuntu 10.10 Released|accessdate = 05 December 2010|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about Lubuntu 10.04 in May 2010 Damien Oh of ''Make Tech Easier'' said: &quot;If you are looking for a lightweight alternative to install in your old PC or netbook, Lubuntu is a great choice. You wonât get any eye candy or special graphical effects, but what you get is fast speed at a low cost. Itâs time to put your old PC back to work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oh06May10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://maketecheasier.com/lubuntu-review-a-lightweight-ubuntu-variant/2010/05/06|title = Lubuntu Review: A Lightweight Ubuntu Variant|accessdate = 05 December 2010|last = Oh|first = Damien|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = May| work = Make Tech Easier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also reviewing Lubuntu 10.04 in May 2010 Robin Catling of [[Full Circle magazine]] said: &quot;The first thing that impresses on running Lubuntu on my modest Compaq Evo laptop (Pentium-M, 512 MB RAM) is the small memory footprint...It beats Karmic on Gnome, and Xubuntu on Xfce, by a mile. The Evo used to take 60 seconds-plus to boot to the desktop, LXDE takes exactly 30. Yet you're not restricted; gtk2 applications are well supported, and Synaptic hooks up to the Ubuntu repositories for package management (so you can pull down Open Office to replace the default Abi-Word without crippling the machine).&quot; Catling did note of the file manager, &quot;The PCManFM file manager needs a little more maturity to compete with Thunar, but it's a competent and robust
application that doesn't hog resources like Nautilus or Dolphin.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CatlingMay10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue37_en.pdf |title = Review - Lubuntu |accessdate = 30 December 2010|last = Catling|first = Robin|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October| work = [[Full Circle magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010 Jim Lynch reviewed Lubuntu 10.04, saying, &quot;One thing youâll notice about using the Lubuntu desktop is that itâs fast. Very, very fast. Even on an underpowered machine, Lubuntu should perform very well. Itâs one of the best things about this distro; it leaves behind the bloated eye candy that can sometimes bog down GNOME and KDE...I didnât run into any noticeable problems with Lubuntu. It was very fast and stable, and I didnât see noticeable bugs or problems. I hate it when this happens since itâs so much more interesting for my readers when I run into one nasty problem or another. Hopefully the next version of Lubuntu will be chock full of horrendous problems and bugs. Just kidding.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch12Jun10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2010/06/12/lubuntu-10-04/|title = Lubuntu 10.04|accessdate = 11 January 2011|last = Lynch|first = Jim|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = June| work = Desktop Linux Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 lead developer Julien Lavergne&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubuntu1010Release&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://lubuntu.net/newsletter/lubuntu-1010-released|title = lubuntu 10.10 released|accessdate = 14 December 2010|last = Behling | first = Mario |authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that the Lubuntu project had not been granted official status as a derivative of Ubuntu as part of the Ubuntu 10.04 release cycle, but that work would continue on this goal for Ubuntu 10.10. Lavergne explained the reasons as &quot;there is still a resource problem on Canonical /Ubuntu infrastructure, which was not resolved during this cycle. Also, they are writing a real process to integrate new member in the Ubuntu family, but itâs still not finished.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMGU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/lubuntu-fails-to-gain-official-ubuntu-spin-status-this-cycle/|title = Lubuntu fails to gain official Ubuntu spin status this cycle|accessdate = 4 September 2010|last = OMG Ubuntu|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lubuntu 10.10===
 [[File:Lubuntu 10.10 default desktop.png|thumb|right|Lubuntu 10.10]]
Lubuntu 10.10 was released on schedule on 10 October 2010, the same day as [[Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat]], but it was not built with same underlying infrastructure as Ubuntu 10.10. Developer Julien Lavergne said about it, &quot;Lubuntu is actually not part of the Ubuntu family, and not build [sic] with the current Ubuntu infrastructure. This release is considered as a Â«stable betaÂ», a result that could be a final and stable release if we was [sic] included in the Ubuntu family.&quot; Version 10.10 introduced new artwork to the distribution, including new panel and menu backgrounds, a new [[Openbox]] theme, new Lubuntu menu logo, splash images and desktop [[Computer wallpaper|wallpaper]]. Lubuntu 10.10 was not accepted as an official Ubuntu derivative at this release point due to &quot;a lack of integration with the infrastructure Canonical and Ubuntu&quot; but work is continuing towards that goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Behling10Oct10&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-1010-released|title = Lubuntu 10.10 released|accessdate = 13 October 2010|last = Behling|first = Mario|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew24Jul10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.webupd8.org/2010/07/new-artwork-for-lubuntu-1010-maverick.html|title = New Artwork For Lubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat [Screenshots]|accessdate = 14 October 2010|last = Andrew|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = July| work = Web Upd8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TuxJournal&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.tuxjournal.net/?p=15136|title = Lubuntu 10.10 non farÃ  parte della famiglia Canonical (Italian language)|accessdate = 16 October 2010|last = Tux Journal|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = September| work = Tux Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubuntu 10.10 was only released as a 32-bit ISO file, but users could install a 64-bit version though the 64-bit Mini ISO and then install the required packages.&lt;ref name=&quot;DocumentationHelp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MinimalInstall&quot; /&gt;

Developer Julien Lavergne wrote that while 10.10 incorporated many changes over 10.04, not all of the changes were considered improvements. The improvements included a new theme designed by Rafael Laguna, the incorporation of ''xpad'' for note taking, ''Ace-of-Penguins'' games, ''LXTask'' the LXDE task manager in place of the Xfce application, replacing the ''epdfview'' PDF reader with [[Evince]], due to a memory leak problem, and removing ''pyneighborhood''. The minuses included a last minute re-write of the installer to integrate it properly, which resulted in some installation instability and the raising of the minimum installation RAM from 180 MB to 256 MB. The other issue was the incorporation of the Ubuntu [[Update Manager]] which increased RAM usage by 10 MB. Lubuntu 10.04 had no indication of updates being available, so this was deemed necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;LavergneBlog11Oct10&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://gilir.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/lubuntu-10-10-est-sortie/|title = Lubuntu 10.10 is out|accessdate = 1 January 2011|last = Lavergne|first = Julien|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Launchpad11Oct10&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://lists.launchpad.net/lubuntu-desktop/msg02557.html|title = Lubuntu-desktop Lubuntu 10.10 released|accessdate = 1 January 2011|last = Lavergne|first = Julien|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum system requirements for Lubuntu 10.10 were described by Mario Behling as &quot;comparable to Pentium II or Celeron systems with a 128 Mb RAM configuration, which may yield a slow yet usable system with lubuntu.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubuntu1010Release&quot; /&gt; Chief developer Julien Lavergne stated that the minimum RAM to install Lubuntu 10.10 is 256 MB.&lt;ref name=&quot;LavergneBlog11Oct10&quot; /&gt;

In reviewing Lubuntu 10.10 right after its release in October 2010, Jim Lynch of ''Eye On Linux'' said &quot;Lubuntuâs biggest appeal for me is its speed; and itâs no disappointment in that area. Applications load and open quickly, and my overall experience with Lubuntu was quite positive. I detected no stability problems, Lubuntu 10.10 was quite solid and reliable the entire time I used it.&quot; Lynch did fault the choice of Synaptic as the package manager: &quot;One of the strange things about Lubuntu is that it only offers Synaptic as its package manager. Xubuntu 10.10, on the other hand, offers the Ubuntu Software Center as well as Synaptic. Iâm not sure why the Ubuntu Software Center is missing from Lubuntu; it would make a lot of sense to include it since it is a much easier and more attractive way to manage software.

By mid-December 2010 Lubuntu had risen to 11th place on [[DistroWatch]]'s six month list of most popular Linux distributions out of 319 distributions, right behind [[Puppy Linux]] and well ahead of Xubuntu which was in 36th place.&lt;ref name=&quot;DistrowatchPop&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/stats.php?section=popularity|title = Linux Distributions - Facts and Figures|accessdate = 14 December 2010|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing [[Linux distribution]] rankings for DistroWatch in early January 2011 for the year 2010 versus 2009, [[DistroWatch|Ladislav BodnÃ¡r]] noted, &quot;Looking through the tables, an interesting thing is the rise of distributions that use the lightweight, but full-featured LXDE desktop or the Openbox window manager.

===Lubuntu 11.04===
[[File:Lubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal.png|right|thumb|Lubuntu 11.04]]

Lubuntu 11.04 was only released as a 32-bit ISO file, but users could install a 64-bit version through the 64-bit Mini ISO and then install the required packages. An unofficial 64-bit ISO of 11.04 was also released by Kendall Weaver of [[Peppermint OS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DocumentationHelp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MinimalInstall&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG11May11A&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/lubuntu-64bit-image-available-for-download/|title =Lubuntu 64bit image available for download|accessdate = 11 May 2011|last =Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in Lubuntu 11.04 included replacing Aqualung with [[Audacious (software)|Audacious]] as the default music player, elimination of the [[hardware abstraction layer]], introducing movable desktop icons, [[Ubuntu font]] by default, improved menu translations and reorganized menus. In the 11.04 release announcement Mario Behling said &quot;Lubuntu is actually not part of the Ubuntu family, and not build [sic] with the current Ubuntu infrastructure. This release is considered as a Â«stable beta Â», a result that could be a final and stable release if we was [sic] included in the Ubuntu family.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG09Feb11&quot; /&gt; The release also introduced a new default theme and artwork designed by Raphael Laguna, known as Ozone, which is partly based on Xubuntuâs default ''Bluebird'' theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG13Feb11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/02/lubuntus-new-theme-ozone-ready-for-testing/|title = Lubuntuâs new theme âozoneâ ready for testing|accessdate = 16 February 2011|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = February| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ozone&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Lubuntu/Artwork/Incoming/Natty/Ozone|title = LubuntuArtworkIncomingNattyOzone|accessdate = 16 February 2011|last =[[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = January| work = Kubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Behling28Apr11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-1104-released|title = Lubuntu 11.04 released|accessdate = 30 April 2011|last =Behling|first = Mario|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubuntu 11.04 can be run with as little as 128 MB of RAM, but requires 256 MB of RAM to install from the graphics installer.&lt;ref name=&quot;1104Sysreq&quot; /&gt;

While Lubuntu 11.04 had not completed the process for official status as a member of the Ubuntu family, Mario Behling stated: &quot;The next goals of the project are clear. Apart from constantly improving the distribution, the lubuntu project aims to become an official flavour of Ubuntu.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Behling29Apr11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url =http://lubuntu.net/blog/mark-shuttleworth-says-thank-you-lubuntu-community |title = Mark Shuttleworth says &quot;Thank you&quot; to lubuntu community|accessdate = 30 April 2011|last =Behling|first = Mario|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Shuttleworth remarked to the Lubuntu developers upon the release of 11.04:

{{cquote|Thanks for the great work and progress of Lubuntu in the past 2 years. The fact that you are now 100% in the archive, and using PPA's and other tools effectively, makes it possible for us to consider recognising Lubuntu as an official part of the project. ... From my perspective, I see no problem in providing Lubuntu with the means to book sessions at UDS [Ubuntu Developer Summit], and for us to call attention to Lubuntu in the project release notes. ... Our goal with Ubuntu is to ensure that the archive contains the full richness of free software. LXDE is definitely part of that, and with the other desktop environments making greater demands on PC resources, LXDE has a continued role to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Behling29Apr11&quot; /&gt; }}

In reviewing Lubuntu 11.04 just after its release, Joey Sneddon of ''OMG Ubuntu'' commented on its look: &quot;Lubuntuâs 'traditional' interface will be of comfort to those agitated by the interface revolution heralded in GNOME 3 and Ubuntu Unity; it certainly wonât appeal to 'bling' fans! But thatâs not to say attention hasnât been paid to the appearance. The new default theme by Raphael Laguna and the use of the Ubuntu font helps to give the sometimes-basic-feeling OS a distinctly professional look.&quot; On the subject of official status Sneddon said, &quot;Lubuntu has long sought official sanction from the Ubuntu Project family to be classed as an official 'derivative' of Ubuntu, earning a place alongside Kubuntu and Xubuntu. With such an accomplished release as Lubuntu 11.04 the hold out on acceptance remains disappointing if expected.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG29Apr11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/04/lubuntu-11-04-released-project-on-the-way-to-official-ubuntu-spin-status/|title = Lubuntu 11.04 released; project on the way to official Ubuntu spin status|accessdate = 2 May 2011|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = April| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review on 12 May 2011 Jim Lynch of ''Desktop Linux Reviews'' faulted 11.04 for not using the [[Ubuntu Software Center]], the lack of alternative wallpapers and the use of [[AbiWord]] in place of [[LibreOffice]]. He did praise Lubuntu, &quot;speed is one of the nice things about Lubuntu; even on a slow or older system itâs usually quite fast. Itâs amazing what you can achieve when you cut out the unnecessary eye-candy and bloat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch13May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2011/05/12/lubuntu-11-04/6/ |title = Lubuntu 11.04|accessdate = 6 June 2011|last = Lynch|first = Jim|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 12 May 2011 Koen Vervloesem writing in ''Linux User &amp; Developer'' criticized the applications bundled with Lubuntu, saying &quot;Some of the software choices are rather odd, however. For instance, Chromium is the default web browser, which is a sensible move for a distro aimed at low-end computers, but the developers also ship Firefox, so Lubuntu shows both web browsers in the Internet menu. Also, the default screenshot program is scrot, but this is a command-line program and it is not shown in the Accessories menu, so not everyone will find it. Another odd choice is that you install your applications with Synaptic: by default Lubuntu doesnât have the Ubuntu Software Center, which has been the preferred software installation program in Ubuntu for a good few releases now. These are just minor inconveniences, though, since you get access to the full Ubuntu software repositories, meaning you can install your favourite applications in a blink of the eye.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vervloesem12May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/reviews/lubuntu-11-04-review-if-its-good-enough-for-mark-shuttleworth/ |title = Lubuntu 11.04 review â If itâs good enough for Mark Shuttleworthâ¦|accessdate = 14 October 2011|last = Vervloesem|first = Kowen|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = Linux User &amp; Developer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month after its release Lubuntu 11.04 had risen to ninth place on the [[DistroWatch]] 30 day list of most popular distributions.&lt;ref name=&quot;DistrowatchPop28May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/stats.php?section=popularity|title = Linux Distributions - Facts and Figures|accessdate = 28 May 2011|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lubuntu 11.10===
[[File:Lubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot.png|thumb|right|Lubuntu 11.10]]
Lubuntu 11.10 is the first version of Lubuntu with official sanction as a member of the Ubuntu family. As part of this status change Lubuntu 11.10 uses the latest Ubuntu infrastructure and the ISO files are hosted by Ubuntu. The release did not include many new features as work focused on integration with Ubuntu instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG11May11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuUser11May11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Behling23May11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavergne13Oct11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://gilir.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/lubuntu-11-10-released/|title = Lubuntu 11.10 released|accessdate = 14 October 2011|last = Lavergne|first = Julien|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

11.10 was released on 13 October 2011, the same day that [[Ubuntu 11.10]] was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG26May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/lubuntu-11-10-release-schedule/|title = Lubuntu 11.10 release schedule|accessdate = 27 May 2011|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = [[OMG! Ubuntu!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 it was announced that work on a ''Lubuntu Software Center'' was progressing. The [[Ubuntu Software Center]] is too resource intensive for Lubuntu and so Lubuntu has been using the less user-friendly [[Synaptic package manager]] in recent releases. The development of a new lightweight application manager for Lubuntu is intended to rectify this problem, although users can, of course, install the Ubuntu Software Center using Synaptic.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG09Sep11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/lubuntu-software-center|title = Progress Continues On âLubuntu Software Centerâ; Hereâs How To Install It|accessdate = 9 September 2011|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = September| work = [[OMG! Ubuntu!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in Lubuntu 11.10 include that it was built with the Ubuntu official build system using the current packages by default, alternative install and 64-bit ISOs were provided, use of xfce4-power-manager, a new microblog client, pidgin-microblog and a new theme by Rafael Laguna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavergne13Oct11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubuntu1110RelAnnon&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Announcement/11.10|title = 11.10|accessdate = 13 October 2011|last = Lubuntu|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubuntu 11.10 requires a minimum of 128 MB of RAM to run and 256 MB of RAM to install with the graphic installer. The recommended minimum RAM to run a [[live CD]] session is 384 MB.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubuntu1110RelNotes&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ReleaseNotes/OneiricOcelot|title = OneiricOcelot|accessdate = 14 October 2011|last = Lubuntu|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lubuntu 11.10 ISO file contains a known issue that causes it to fail to load a live CD session on some hardware, instead loading to a command prompt. Users are required to enter &lt;code&gt;sudo start lxdm&lt;/code&gt; at the prompt to run the live CD session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubuntu1110RelNotes&quot; /&gt;

In a review of Lubuntu 11.10 on ''PC Mech'', writer Rich Menga described it as &quot;simple, rock-solid, reliable, trustworthy&quot;. He added &quot;Ubuntu at this point is suffering from major bloat on the interface side of things, and you can even say that about Xubuntu at this point â but not Lubuntu, as it gets back to what a great Linux distro should be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Menga21Oct11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.pcmech.com/article/a-quick-look-at-lubuntu-11-10-video/|title = A Quick Look At Lubuntu 11.10 (Video)|accessdate = 14 October 2011|last = Menga|first = Rich|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = October| work = PC Mech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of October 2011 Lubuntu had risen to seventh place on the [[DistroWatch]] one month popularity list.&lt;ref name=&quot;DW23Oct11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/stats.php?section=popularity|title = Linux Distributions - Facts and Figures|accessdate = 14 October 2011|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in [[Linux User and Developer]] in November 2011, Russell Barnes praised Lubuntu 11.10 for its low system hardware requirements, for providing an alternative to GNOME and KDE, saying that its &quot;aesthetic appeal and functionality is minimally compromised in its effort to be as sleek and light as possible&quot;. Barnes noted that [[Mark Shuttleworth]] may have been wise to offer full status to Lubuntu for this release given the &quot;fuss and bluster surrounding Unity&quot;. Of the aesthetics he stated &quot;the now trademark pale blue of the desktop is almost hypnotic. Itâs incredibly clean, clear and logically laid out â a user experience a million miles away from that of Ubuntu 11.10âs Unity or GNOME Shell counterparts. In comparison thereâs an almost cleansing nature about its simplicity.&quot; Barnes rated it as 4/5 and concluded &quot;While itâs not as flexible or pretty as [GNOME 2], Lubuntu 11.10 has certainly got everything you need to keep your computer happy and your desktop clean and clutter-free&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BarenesNov11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url =http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/reviews/lubuntu-11-10-%E2%80%93-a-cure-to-ubuntu%E2%80%99s-unity-blues/|title = Lubuntu 11.10 review â a cure to Ubuntuâs Unity blues?|accessdate = 20 November 2011|last = Barnes|first = Russell|date = 16 November 2011| work = [[Linux User and Developer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lubuntu 12.04===
Planning for this release took place at the [[Ubuntu Developer Summit]] held in early November 2011. Changes expected include the use of [[LightDM]] as the [[X display manager (program type)|X display manager]] and the use of Viewnior as the default image viewer. The Lubuntu Software Center will be the default package manager, with the [[Synaptic package manager]] also retained.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebUpd805Nov11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.webupd8.org/2011/11/expected-changes-in-ubuntu-1204-precise.html|title = Expected Changes In Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin |accessdate = 8 November 2011|last = |first = Andrew|date = 15 November 2011| work = Web Upd8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
