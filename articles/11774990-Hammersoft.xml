The first recorded use of the term upcycling was by Reiner Pilz of Pilz GmbH in an interview by Thornton Kay of Salvo in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton Kay, Salvo in Germany - Reiner Pilz, p14 SalvoNEWS No99 11 October 1994 [http://www.salvoweb.com/files/salvonews/sn99v3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

We talked about the impending EU Demolition Waste Streams directive. &quot;Recycling,&quot; he said, &quot;I call it downcycling. They smash bricks, they smash everything. What we need is upcycling where old products are given more value not less.&quot; He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg while just down the road a load of similar blocks was scrapped. In the road outside his premises, was the result of the Germans' demolition waste recycling. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick, old tiles and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
The upcycling concept was also the theme of the 1999 book with the same title written by [[Gunter Pauli]] and Johannes F. Hartkemeyer. The concept was later incorporated by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]''. They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new [[raw materials]] when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]] and even [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

Upcycling is the opposite of [[downcycling]], which is the other half of the [[recycling]] process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa&quot;&gt;Wastes - Resource Conservation - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. &quot;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm]&quot;.

For example, during the recycling process of plastics other than those used to create bottles, many different types of plastics are mixed together, resulting in a hybrid. This hybrid is used in the manufacturing of plastic lumber applications.  However, unlike the engineered polymer ABS which hold properties of several plastics well, recycled plastics suffer phase-separation that causes structural weakness in the final product.

In developing countries, where new raw materials are often expensive, upcycling is commonly practiced, largely due to impoverished conditions.

Upcycling has seen an increase in use due to its current marketability and the lowered cost of reused materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;Goldsmith, Belinda (2009-09-30). &quot;[http://www.reuters.com/article/smallBusinessNews/idUSTRE58T3HX20090930 Trash or treasure?

In recent years, the US-based company [[TerraCycle]] has brought upcycling into mainstream by creating partnerships with major brands, such J&amp;J, Kraft Foods, BIC, and Aveeno, to upcycle their packaging into new items, all while donating money to schools and charity. Such a large scale operation is only possible with the help of thousands of consumers around the world committed to divert the (otherwise) garbage from the landfill, who send them their used products and packaging.

Upcycling has shown significant growth across the United States. For example, the number of products on [[Etsy]] tagged with the word &quot;upcycled&quot; increased from about 7,900 in January 2010 to nearly 30,000 a year later--an increase of 275 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entrepreneur&quot;&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219310

In addition, an online retailer called [http://hipcycle.com Hipcycle] is now dedicated to upcycled products, offering âproducts that are as attractive, durable, and otherwise as desirable as traditional equivalent products.â
