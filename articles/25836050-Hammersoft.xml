The '''2010 Champions League Twenty20''' was the second edition of the [[Champions League Twenty20]], an international [[Twenty20]] [[cricket]] tournament. The tournament, which was held from [[September 10|10]] to [[26 September]] [[2010]] in [[South Africa]], featured 10 domestic Twenty20 sides from [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[New Zealand]], the [[West Indies Cricket Board|West Indies]] and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cricinfo staff|title=Ten teams for 2010 Champions League|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/t20champions2010/content/story/460726.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=15 June 2010|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clt&gt;{{cite web|title=CLT20 to feature 10 teams|url=http://www.clt20.com/news/index.php?id=1796|publisher=Champions League Twenty20|accessdate=15 June 2010|date=24 May 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chennai Super Kings]] emerged the winners of the tournament, defeating the [[Warriors (cricket team)|Warriors]] in the final. [[Murali Vijay]] from the Chennai Super Kings won the Golden Bat Award and was declared the Man of the Match of the final, while [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] was awarded the Golden Wicket Award and declared the Player of the Tournament.

The song &quot;[[I Like It (Enrique Iglesias song)|I Like It]]&quot; by [[Enrique Iglesias]] was taken as the official song for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20. Enrique performed the song along with &quot;[[Be With You (Enrique Iglesias song)|Be With You]]&quot; at the opening ceremony of the tournament.

==Host selection==
In February 2010, [[Cricket South Africa]] announced that [[South Africa]] was chosen as the host of the tournament. This was later denied by tournament chairman [[Lalit Modi]], who listed South Africa, [[Australia]], [[England]], [[India]] and the [[Middle East]] all as possible contenders for hosting the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/southafrica/content/current/story/449105.html |title=Champions League venue undecided - Modi |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |publisher=CricInfo }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[April 25]] [[2010]], at the conclusion of the [[2010 Indian Premier League]], it was announced that South Africa was officially chosen as the host of the tournament. South Africa had previously hosted other major [[Twenty20]] tournaments, including the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] and the [[2009 Indian Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/t20champions2010/content/story/457206.html |title=South Africa to host Champions League |date=2010-04-25 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |publisher=CricInfo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The tournament consisted of the ten top domestic teams from six countries as determined by the domestic [[Twenty20]] tournaments of those countries. The tournament consists of 23 matches, and is divided into a group stage and a knockout stage. If a match ends in a tie, a [[Super Over]] will be played to determine the winner.

The group stage has the teams divided into two equal groups, with each playing a [[round-robin tournament]]. The top two teams of each group advances to the advance to the knockout stage. The knockout stage consists of two semi-finals, with the top team of one group facing the second from the other. The winners of the semi-finals play the grand final to determine the winner of the competition.&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/t20champions2010/content/story/465152.html |title=2010 Champions League T20 to have new format |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-07-22 |publisher=CricInfo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prize money===
Same as the previous tournament, the total prize money for the competition is [[United States dollar|US$]]6 million. In addition to the prize money, each team receives a participation fee of $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/472111.html |title=Guyana aim for Champions League glory |date=2010-08-12 |publisher=CricInfo |accessdate=2010-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize money will be distributed as follows:

*$200,000 â Each team eliminated in the [[#Group stage|group stage]]
*$500,000 â Each [[#Semi-finals|semi-finalist]]
*$1.3 million â [[#Final|Runners-up]]
*$2.5 million â [[#Final|Winners]]

Controversies arose after the conclusion of the tournament, when teams reported to have not received their tournament prize money, which was due to be paid by the end of January 2011. As of [[March 9]] [[2011]], the full $6 million has yet to be paid to the teams. The participation fees have also yet to be paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/story/498998.html |title=South African franchises yet to receive CLT20 prize money |first=Firdose |last=Moonda |date=2011-01-31 |publisher=ESPN |work=CricInfo |accessdate=2011-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/fica-urges-players-boycott-champions-league-t20-20110308-210900-449.html |title=FICA urges players to boycott Champions League T20 |publisher=PTI |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2011-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8221304 |title=May slams Twenty20 prizemoney debacle |first=Liam |last=FitzGibbon |date=2011-03-08 |publisher=ninemsn |work=Wide World of Sports |accessdate=2011-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teams==
This tournament had two teams less compared to the previous tournament due to the absence of [[County cricket|English county teams]] because the tournament dates clashed with the end of England's domestic season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cricinfo staff|title=No English counties in Champions League Twenty20|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/t20champions2010/content/story/460432.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=15 June 2010|date=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[England cricket team|England national team]] also had a [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010|One Day International series]] with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] during the tournament period. The format of the tournament was modified to accommodate this.

Apart from [[England]], [[Pakistan]] is the only other top-eight [[Test cricket#Test cricket playing teams|Test-playing nation]] not to be represented in the tournament. In February 2010, [[Ijaz Butt]], the chairman of the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]], had reportedly refused participation in the tournament due to the snubbing of Pakistani cricketers in the [[2010 Indian Premier League]] player auction. The auction resulted in none of them being bought for the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/450018.html |title='No Pakistan team in Champions League' - Butt |date=2010-02-25 |publisher=CricInfo |accessdate=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Butt later stated his comments were misunderstood, but the Champions League administrators had already decided to leave out Pakistan due to Butt's statements. Champions League officials have made contradicting statements as to whether a Pakistan team would have been considered regardless of Butt's statement. Pakistan was also absent from the previous tournament due to the deterioration of relations between host nation India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/461164.html |title=Pakistan disappointed at Champions League exclusion |author=Samiuddin, Osman |date=2010-05-28 |publisher=CricInfo |accessdate=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Squads==
{{main|2010 Champions League Twenty20 squads}}
Several teams were missing star players that helped them qualify for the tournament, mostly due to their commitment to another qualified team or to their national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/t20champions2010/content/story/469993.html |title=Bangalore keen to retain foreign players |date=2010-07-30 |publisher=CricInfo |accessdate=2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a player being a part of more than one qualified team, he can play for his &quot;home&quot; team (the team from the country he is eligible to represent in international cricket) without consequence. If he plays for any other team, that team must pay the home team [[United States dollar|US$]]200,000 as compensation.&lt;ref name=format /&gt; The [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] were the only team to pay the compensation, forcing three international players to play for them instead of their home team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/t20champions2010/content/story/471910.html |title=Bangalore retain foreign players for CLT20 |date=2010-08-10 |publisher=CricInfo |accessdate=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Kallis]], [[Cameron White]] and [[Ross Taylor]] were obligated to play for Bangalore as their contracts stated Bangalore had first rights over them should they qualify for the tournament with another team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/t20champions2010/content/story/472536.html |title=Kallis obligated to play for Bangalore - Warriors chief |date=2010-08-15 |publisher=CricInfo |accessdate=2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
The tournament was hosted at four venues across [[South Africa]]. All four venues were used in the group stage. Both the [[Warriors (cricket team)|Warriors]] and [[Highveld Lions]] played some of their group stage matches at their respective home grounds of [[St George's Oval|St George's Park]] and [[Wanderers Stadium]]. The semi-finals were held at [[Sahara Stadium Kingsmead]] and [[Supersport Park]] while the final was held at Wanderers Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airtel CLT20 schedule announced|url=http://www.clt20.com/news/index.php?id=1798|publisher=The Official CLT20 Website|accessdate=30 June 2010|date=2010-06-29|accessdate=2010-08-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
