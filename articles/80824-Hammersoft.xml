'''Athletic Club''', also known as '''Athletic Bilbao''', is an [[association football]] club from [[Bilbao]] in [[Biscay]], [[Spain]]. The club has played in the ''Primera DivisiÃ³n'' of [[La Liga]] since its start in 1928.  They have won La Liga on eight occasions. In the historical classification of La Liga Athletic Bilbao are in 4th place and one of only three clubs which have never been relegated from La Liga (the others being [[Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]). The club also has a women's team, which has won four championships in the Spanish Superliga.

They are known as the ''Los Leones'' (the lions) because their stadium was built near a church called ''San MamÃ©s'' (Saint Mammes). [[Mammes]] was an early [[Christian]] thrown to the lions by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The lions refused to eat Mammes and he was later made a [[saint]]. The [[San MamÃ©s Stadium]] is hence nicknamed &quot;the football cathedral&quot;.

The club is known for its [[cantera]] policy of bringing young [[Basque people|Basque]] players through the ranks, as well as recruiting top Basque players from other clubs (like [[Joseba Etxeberria]] or [[Javi MartÃ­nez]]). Athletic official policy is signing professional players native to the [[Basque Country (greater region)|greater Basque Country]], including [[Biscay]], [[GuipÃºzcoa]], [[Ãlava]] and [[Navarre]] (in Spain); and [[Labourd]], [[Soule]] and [[Lower Navarre]] (in France). Still, in recent times, this policy has been somewhat relaxed and players with direct Basque ancestry or with no Basque ancestry but formed in Basque clubs have played for the team. This has gained Athletic both admirers and critics. The club has been praised for promoting home grown players and club loyalty. Athletic is one of only four professional clubs in Spain (the others being Real Madrid, Barcelona and [[Osasuna]]) that is not a sports corporation; the club is owned and operated by its associates (socios).


== History ==
=== Bilbao FC, Athletic Club and Bizcaya ===
[[File:Athletic Club 1903.jpg|thumb|240px|Athletic Club with the first [[Copa del Rey 1903|Copa del Rey]] in 1903.]] 
Football was introduced to [[Bilbao]] by two distinct groups of players, both with British connections; British steel and [[shipyard]] workers and Basque students returning from schools in Britain.

In the late 19th century Bilbao was a leading port of an important industrial area with iron mines and shipyards nearby. It was the driving force of the Spanish economy and as a result attracted many migrant workers. Among them were miners from the north-east of England, and shipyard workers from [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]]. The British workers brought with them (as to so many other parts of the world) the game of football. In the early 1890s these workers came together and formed ''Bilbao Football Club''.

Meanwhile, sons of the [[Basque people|Basque]] educated classes had made the opposite journey and went to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to complete their studies in civil engineering and commerce. While in the United Kingdom these students developed an interest in football and on their return to Bilbao they began to arrange games with British workers. In 1898 students belonging to the ''Gymnasium Zamacois'' founded the ''Athletic Club'', using the English spelling. In 1901 a meeting was held in the Cafe Garcia which established more formal rules and regulations.

In 1902 the two Bilbao clubs formed a combined team, known as ''[[Club Bizcaya|Bizcaya]]'', in the first [[Copa del Rey]]. They returned with the trophy after defeating [[FC Barcelona]] in the final. This  would lead to the eventual merger of the two clubs as ''Athletic Club'' in 1903. In the same year Basque students also formed ''Athletic Club Madrid''. This club later evolved into [[AtlÃ©tico Madrid]]. The club's foundation date is a subject of debate among football historians. The club itself declares 1898, but others claim 1901 or 1903 as the true founding year.

=== Club Colours ===
[[File:Ath 1921.JPG|300px|thumb|Athletic's team champions of 1921 [[Copa del Rey]].]]
Atletic Bilbao began playing in an improvised white kit, but in the 1902â03 season the clubs first official strip became half blue, half white shirts similar to those worn by Blackburn Rovers, which were donated by Juan Moser. Later a young student from Bilbao named Juan Elorduy, who was spending Christmas 1909 in London was charged by the club to buy 25 new shirts, but was unable to find enough. Waiting for the ship back to Bilbao and empty handed, Elorduy realised that the colours of the local team [[Southampton Football Club]] matched the colours of the City of Bilbao, and bought 50 shirts to take with him. Upon arriving in Bilbao, the clubs directors decided almost immediately to change the teams strip to the new colours, and since 1910 Athletic Club have played in red and white stripes. Of the 50 shirts bought by Elorduy half were then sent to AtlÃ©tico Madrid which had originally begun as a youth branch of Bilbao. Before the switch from blue &amp; white to red &amp; white, only one other team wore red &amp; white, [[Sporting de GijÃ³n]], since 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Agiriano|first=Jon|url=http://www.canalathletic.com/noticias/2010-01-06/colores-siglo-20100106.html|title=Los Colores del Siglo (In Spanish)|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/pdfsrevista/234.pdf|title=Camisetas Inglesas (In Spanish)|publisher=Athletic Club|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Athletic were one of the last major clubs who did not have the logo of an official sponsor emblazoned on their kit.
In the [[UEFA cup]] and the ''Copa del Rey'' of 2004â2005, the shirt sported the word &quot;[[Euskadi]]&quot; in green in exchange for hundreds of thousands of euros from the [[Basque Government]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Deia&quot;&gt;''[http://www.deia.com/es/impresa/2004/11/30/bizkaia/kirolak/40029.php La estrenan maÃ±ana]'', [[Deia]] daily, 30 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; (red, white and green are the [[IkurriÃ±a|Basque colours]]).
This policy was changed for the three seasons starting from 2008, with Athletic playing with the logo of the Biscay-based [[Petronor]] oil company&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Press&quot;&gt;''[http://www.europapress.es/euskadi/noticia-athletic-firma-petronor-acuerdo-lucir-publicidad-camiseta-millones-euros-20080729171622.html El Athletic firma con Petronor un acuerdo para lucir publicidad en su camiseta por 2 millones de euros]'', [[Europa Press]], 29 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on their shirts in exchange for over 2 million euros.

In 2011 Athletic revealed the Away kit which has been inspired by the Colours of the Basque Flag.

=== Copa del Rey ===

The club featured prominently in early Copa del Rey competitions. Following the inaugural win by ''Club Vizcaya'', the newly formed Athletic Bilbao won it again in 1903. In 1904 they were declared winners after their opponents, [[Club EspaÃ±ol de Madrid]], failed to turn up. In 1907 they revived the name ''Club Vizcaya'' after entering a combined team with ''Union Vizcaino''. After a brief lull they won the competition again in 1911 and then won it three times in a row between 1914 and 1916. The star of this team was [[Pichichi (footballer)|Pichichi]], a prolific goalscorer who scored the very first goal in the San MamÃ©s stadium, on August 21, 1913 and a hat-trick in the 1915 final. Today the La Liga top-scorer is declared the [[The Pichichi Trophy|''Pichichi'']] in his honour.

=== The First La Liga ===

Athletic were not the only Basque team represented in the 1920 squad. Other clubs such as [[Real UniÃ³n]], [[Arenas Club de Getxo]] and [[Real Sociedad]] also provided players. These four clubs were all founding members of La Liga in 1928 and by 1930 they were joined by [[Deportivo Alaves|CD Alaves]].  This meant that five of the ten clubs in the ''Primera DivisiÃ³n'' of Spainâs national league were from the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. The saying ''Con cantera y aficiÃ³n, no hace falta importaciÃ³n'', translated as ''With home-grown teams and supporters, there is no need for imports'' made sense during these early days.

=== The Fred Pentland Era ===
[[File:Athletic 1931.jpg|thumb|250px|[[1930-31 La Liga]] winner team.]]
In 1921 a new coach, [[Fred Pentland]] arrived from [[Racing Santander]]. In 1923 he led the club to victory in the Copa del Rey. He revolutionised the way Athletic played, favouring the short-passing game. In 1927 he left Athletic and coached [[AtlÃ©tico Madrid|Athletic Madrid]], [[Real Oviedo]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. In 1929 he rejoined Athletic and he subsequently led Athletic to La Liga/Copa del Rey doubles in 1930 and 1931. The club won the Copa del Rey four times in a row between 1930 and 1933 and they were also La Liga runners-up in 1932 and 1933. In 1931 Athletic also defeated [[FC Barcelona]] 12â1, the latterâs worst ever defeat.

=== AtlÃ©tico Bilbao ===
In 1941 the club changed its name to ''AtlÃ©tico Bilbao'', following [[Language politics in Francoist Spain|a decree issued by Franco]], banning the use of non-Spanish language names and scrapping the policy of only letting Basque-born players in the team (see origins of the &quot;grandparent rule&quot;). The same year also saw [[Telmo ZarraonaindÃ­a|Zarra]] make his debut. Over the next thirteen seasons he went on to score 294 goals in all competitions for Atletico, plus another 20 for [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in as many games. His 38 goals in the 1950/51 season stood as a record for 50 years before being broken by Real Madrid's [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]. Another great player from this era was [[JosÃ© Luis Lopez Panizo|Panizo]]. In the 1943 the club won a La Liga/''Copa del Generalisimo'' double and they subsequently retained the Copa del Rey in both 1944 and 1945.

During the early 1950s the club featured the legendary forward line of [[Telmo ZarraonaindÃ­a|Zarra]], [[JosÃ© Luis Lopez Panizo|Panizo]], [[Rafa Iriondo]], [[Venancio]] and [[AgustÃ­n GaÃ­nza]]. They helped the club win another [[Copa del Rey|''Copa del Generalisimo'']] in 1950. The arrival of coach [[Ferdinand DauÄÃ­k]] improved the club's fortunes further. He led the team to another  double in 1956 and to further ''Copa del Generalisimo'' victories in 1955 and 1958. In 1956 the club also made their debut in the [[European Cup 1956â57|European Cup]], eventually been knocked out by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

What helped the club succeed in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s were the strict limits imposed on foreign players. In most cases clubs could only have three foreign players in its squad, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. While [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona]] circumnavigated these rules by playing dual citizens such as [[Alfredo Di StÃ©fano]], [[Ferenc PuskÃ¡s]], [[JosÃ© Santamaria]] and [[Ladislao Kubala]], Athletic adhered strictly to their cantera policy, showing little or no flexibility. The 1960s, however were dominated by [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and ''AtlÃ©tico Bilbao'' only had a single Copa del Rey win in 1969.

Like international teams, the club has used the ''grandparent rule'', allowing the recruitment of some players of Basque descent. This enabled [[Barcelona]]-born [[Armando Merodio]] to play for the club. However during 1960s other players such as [[JesÃºs MarÃ­a Pereda]], [[Miguel Jones]], and [[JosÃ© Eulogio GÃ¡rate]] were overlooked. Although none of them were Basques by birth, all three grew up in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and could be classified as naturalised Basques. GÃ¡rate even had Basque parents.

On a positive note the 1960s saw the emergence of an Athletic legend [[JosÃ© Ãngel Iribar]]. The 1970s were not much better with only another single Copa del Rey win in 1973. In December 1975, before a game against [[Real Sociedad]], Iribar and the Real captain [[Ignacio Kortabarria]], carried out the [[IkurriÃ±a]], the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] flag and placed it ceremonially on the centre-circle. This was the first public display of the flag since the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. In 1977 the club reached the [[UEFA Cup]] final, only losing on away goals to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. By now the club had reverted to using the name ''Athletic Bilbao''.

=== The Clemente Era ===
In 1981 the club appointed [[Javier Clemente]] as manager. He soon set about putting together one of the most successful Athletic Bilbao teams in the clubs history. Young players from the cantera such as [[Santiago Urkiaga]], [[Miguel De Andres]], [[Ismael Urtubi]], [[Estanislao Argote]] and [[Andoni Zubizarreta]] joined veterans [[Daniel Ruiz|Dani]] and [[Andoni Goikoetxea Olaskoaga|Goikoetxea]]. In his first season in charge, Clemente led the team to 4th place in La Liga. In 1983 the club won La Liga and in 1984 they won a La Liga/Copa del Rey double. In 1985 and 1986 Athletic finished 3rd and 4th respectively. Clementeâs Athletic acquired notoriety for its aggressive style of play, personified by hard man [[Andoni Goikoetxea Olaskoaga|Goikoetxea]]. He favoured two defensive midfielders playing in front of twin centre backs and a sweeper and as a result critics regarded his teams as dour but effective.

Athletic Bilbao has failed to win a major trophy since the success of the Clemente era. A succession of coaches including [[JosÃ© Ãngel Iribar]], [[Howard Kendall]], [[Jupp Heynckes]] and [[Javier Irureta]] and even a returning Clemente failed to reproduce his success.

=== The FernÃ¡ndez Era ===
The most successful Athletic coach since Clemente has been [[Luis FernÃ¡ndez]], appointed in 1996. In 1998 he led the club to second in [[La Liga]] and [[UEFA Champions League 1998-99|UEFA Champions League]] qualification. Fernandez benefited from the club adopting a more flexible approach to the cantera. Now anybody could play for Athletic, just as long as they acquired their skills in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. Thus Patxi Ferreira from [[Salamanca]] and [[Biurrun]], a [[Brazil]]ian-born player who immigrated to the region at a young age, played for the club in the late 1980s. Despite this new approach, their definition of a Basque is still open to interpretation, with both [[Roberto LÃ³pez Ufarte]] and [[BenjamÃ­n Zarandona|BenjamÃ­n]] being overlooked despite having Basque parents.

Fernandez signed [[Bixente Lizarazu]], the first French-born Basque to join the club, [[Ismael Urzaiz]] and JosÃ© Mari.
Athletic also began to recruit players from the canteras of other [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] clubs, leading to allegations of poaching. In 1995 Athletic signed [[Joseba Etxeberria]] from regional rivals [[Real Sociedad]], causing considerable bad feeling between the two clubs. Although [[Bixente Lizarazu|Lizarazu]] left after one season, [[Ismael Urzaiz|Urzaiz]], JosÃ© Mari Garcia Lafuente and [[Joseba Etxeberria|Etxeberria]], were prominent members of the 1997/98 squad along with [[Rafael Alkorta]], [[Julen Guerrero]] and Patxi Ferreira.

==XXI Century==
=== The &quot;black biennium&quot; ===
[[File:AficiÃ³n de San MamÃ©s.png|thumb|200px|Athletic Bilbao fans in San Mames Stadium.]]
After [[Jupp Heynckes]] second cycle (2001-2003) and [[Jose Valverde]] (2003-2005), the club was embroiled in a relegation battle during the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. In 2006 top-flight survival was ensured on the 37th match day when Deportivo de la CoruÃ±a were beaten at Riazor 2â1. [[Javier Clemente]] began his third spell as club coach in 2005, at a time when the club were last in the table. He is widely acknowledged to have brought defensive stability to the team, and so is also credited with having saved the club from relegation, despite this he was not left in charge for the 2006â2007 season. The 2006â2007 season has been the worst in the club's history, top-flight survival was ensured on the last match day when Levante were beaten at San MamÃ©s 2â0.

=== The Caparros Era ===
In the [[La Liga 2008â09]] season Athletic again achieved unspectacular results and finished in mid-table, though they ensured safety from relegation earlier than in the previous campaigns.  In the Copa del Rey 2008â09 however the team managed to pull through some tough ties including local rivals Osasuna and the strong Sevilla side to reach their first final in the competition in 24 years.  The final in Valencia against Barcelona was a great occasion for the fans, and though they lost 4â1 the result was no disgrace, as the expensively assembled Barcelona side of that season also proved unbeatable in La Liga and the UEFA Champions League.  Athletic's reward for their efforts was a place in the 'new' [[UEFA Europa League]] tournament for the following campaign.

The 2009â2010 season saw Athletic make steady progress in the league and in Europe.  Decent home form, including a victory over Real Madrid, led to the team sitting comfortably in the top half of the Liga and qualifying from their Europa League group, although poorer performances away from Bilbao meant that a really successful run never materialised.  In 2010 the home games often resulted in draws rather than victories, and this also proved to be the case in the Europa League, where a draw at San Mames against [[RSC Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] was followed by a heavy defeat in Belgium.  Ultimately a promising season delivered little, with Athletic finishing 8th, just out of the European places.  But in comparison to most recent seasons it was an improvement. Young stars [[Javi Martinez]], [[Markel Susaeta]] and [[Ãscar de Marcos]] performed well, if inconsistently, providing for main striker [[Fernando Llorente]], and 16-year-old forward [[Iker Muniain]] made a successful breakthrough into the senior squad. At the other end of the career scale, 500-game man [[Joseba Etxeberria]] retired after 15 seasons at the club, and [[Francisco Yeste]], who had also played over 300 games in the red-and-white shirt, left rather abruptly at the end of the campaign.

=== The Bielsa era ===
Going into 2010â11 Athletic were looking to build on the previous season and claim a European placing. The season started positively, with Llorente scoring several times in early games. The team's form, particularly away from home, was not consistent enough for them to mount a challenge for 4th (Champions League) but similar lapses by other teams meant there was still a chance of qualifying for the Europa League. This was eventually achieved with one match remaining, with Athletic moving clear of early-season successes Espanyol after a series of narrow victories including 2â1 wins over basque rivals Osasuna and Real Sociedad in successive weeks. A defensive injury and suspension crisis midway through the season led to [[Borja Ekiza]], previously only a member of the B squad, being drafted in at centre-half, and his performances were solid enough for him to retain his place for the remaining games. Teenager Muniain also started almost every match, mostly on the left wing where he could use his trickery to supply Llorente and his hard-working but technically limited support striker [[Gaizka Toquero]], and fellow 18-year-old [[Jon Aurtenetxe]] also impressed coach Caparros enough to claim the starting place at left-back for the start of the campaign before a bad injury finished his season early. The signing of Spanish Under-21 midfielder [[Ander Herrera]] was agreed well before the end of the season, although the young star elected to stay with formative club Real Zaragoza as a gesture of respect as they battled against relegation.

==== National tournaments ====

'''[[La Liga]]'''
:* '''Winners (8):''' 1929â30, 1930â31, 1933â34, 1935â36, 1942â43, 1955â56, 1982â83, 1983â84.

''' [[Copa del Rey]]'''
:* '''Winners (23&lt;ref name=1902cup&gt;Note:''The number of Copa wins ''Athletic Club'' have been credited with is disputed. The 1902 competition was won by ''Bizcaya'', a team made up of players from ''Athletic Club'' and ''Bilbao FC''. In 1903 these two clubs merged as  ''Athletic Club''. The 1902 cup is on display in the Athletic museum [http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/spancup1902.html] and the club includes it in its own honours list.[http://www.athletic-club.net/acc/home.asp?a=7&amp;b=2&amp;idi=2]. However LFP and [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|RFEF]] official statistics do not include this as an Athletic win.''&lt;/ref&gt; ):''' 1903, 1904, 1910, 1911, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1921, 1923, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1950, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1969, 1973, 1984.
:* Runners-up (12): 1905, 1906, 1913, 1920, 1942, 1949, 1953, 1966, 1967, 1977, 1985, 2009.

'''[[Supercopa de EspaÃ±a]]'''
:* '''Winners (1):''' 1984.
:* Runners-up (2): 1983, 2009.

'''[[Copa Eva Duarte]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Note:&quot;Eva Duarte Cup&quot; competition was the predecessor of the current &quot;Spanish Supercup&quot;, because they face the league champion against the champion of the &quot;Copa del Rey&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Winners (1):''' 1950.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Copa Eva Duarte]] was only recognized and organized with that name by the RFEF from 1947 until 1953, and therefore Athletic Bilbao's runners-up medal in the &quot;Copa de Oro Argentina&quot; of 1945 is not included in this count.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Quarter Finalists (1): 1956â77.
