'''''The Lord of the Rings: Conquest''''' is an action game developed by [[Pandemic Studios]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is based on ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, and borrows many gameplay mechanics from Pandemic's ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront (series)|Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' games. The game allows the player to play as both the forces of good and evil, but unlike ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', the latter option is based around [[Sauron]] stopping the [[One Ring]] from being destroyed and using it to regain his lost power.&lt;ref name=&quot;gerwitz&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=What is &quot;THE LORD OF THE RINGS: CONQUEST&quot;?

Pandemic was aided by [[Weta Digital]] in developing the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the [[fell beasts]]. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings|original]] [[fantasy]] novel&lt;!---LotR is not really a trilogy--&gt;, such as a level based loosely around [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]'s conquest of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], in which [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] attempts to retake the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarven]] city from the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. Some inspiration was less direct: the [[army|armies]] of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] decide not to attack [[Minas Morgul]] in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have happened if they had. The game uses [[Howard Shore]]'s score to the films as its soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;gerwitz&quot;/&gt;

On March 16, 2010, the online multiplayer modes of The Lord of the Rings: Conquest were shut down for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&lt;ref name=&quot;onlineshutdown&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates|title=Online Play Shut Down|date=2010-02-16|accessdate=2010-02-16|publisher=[[EA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 2010 a group of fans launched the non-profit CNQReboot servers, allowing users of the PC version to play online using [[virtual private network|tunnelling]] software that allows network play via the [[local area network]] option.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Lotr conquest oliphant.png|thumb|left|Players have the ability to ride animal mounts and slay large enemies, such as the [[MÃ»makil|Oliphaunt]].]]
In the &quot;[[War of the Ring]]&quot; [[Campaign setting|campaign]], containing eight levels, the player loosely follows the major battles of the films with some additions such as Moria and Minas Morgul. In the &quot;''Rise of Sauron''&quot; campaign, the player controls the forces of Sauron in a reworking of the storyline set over seven levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurogamer review&quot;/&gt; In this [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative]] sequence of events, [[Frodo Baggins]] was corrupted by and failed to destroy the One Ring before being killed by the [[resurrection|resurrected]] [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]], leading to Sauron subsequently conquering [[Middle-earth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gi183&quot;&gt;&quot;The Lord of the Rings: Conquest,&quot; Previews, ''[[Game Informer]]'' Issue #183, pages 54&amp;ndash;55. Retrieved on 2008-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Both campaigns are [[Narrative|narrated]] by [[Hugo Weaving]], who played [[Elrond]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film trilogy.

The game uses a class-based character system, similar to the system found in Pandemic's previous game, ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]''. There are four playable classes, barring heroes:

* [[Warrior]]: A [[melee]] combat unit which uses [[swordsmanship]]. Unlike the other classes, whose special attacks recharge over time, warriors can only gain [[Mana|strength]] by defeating enemies, which allows them to unleash more powerful attacks with a [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]], such as spinning to hit every adjacent enemy. They are the only class that can [[Parry (fencing)|block]] or perform [[counterattack]]s with special moves. The warrior also has a [[throwing axe]] as a secondary, medium ranged weapon.
* [[Archery|Archer]]: A long ranged unit with a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow]] that plays like a [[third-person shooter]].  Different types of arrows can be equipped: [[Fire Arrow|fire arrows]], which can knock down enemies and deal explosive damage; [[Arrow poison|poison arrows]], which slow enemies down and do damage over time, and the ability to fire a volley of three normal arrows at multiple enemies at once. They also have a kick for use in [[Hand to hand combat|close-quarters]], which knocks back the enemy. They can also hit stealthed Scouts with the multiple arrow skill. A headshot will allow the archer to kill most enemies in a single hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurogamer review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/lord-of-the-rings-conquest-review|title=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest Review|first=Simon|last=Parkin|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Eurogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reconnaissance|Scout]]: A master in the art of moving unseen. The scoutâs primary weapons are two daggers, and he has the ability to become temporarily [[invisibility|invisible]] and [[Assassination|assassinate]] units instantly from behind with a [[Ambush|sneak attack]]. As a secondary attack, he carries satchel [[bomb]]s filled with [[gunpowder|blasting powder]] as a ranged attack. The scout can also block melee attacks.
* [[Magician (fantasy)|Mage]]: A mage's primary attack is a [[bolt of lightning]], which can be charged up for a more powerful attack that can also damage other enemies in close proximity to the target. He also wields a âfirewallâ attack, which creates an expanding circle of flames that will heavily damage if not kill enemies who are within the circle. For close range attacks, they have a [[Shock wave|shockwave]] attack, which knocks enemies back and allows the mage to finish them off with his [[Magic wand|staff]]. Mages can also [[Healer (gaming)|heal]] allies. For defensive purposes, a mage can create a magical [[shield]] around himself to protect anyone inside from ranged attacks of any sort, provided the attacker is outside of the shield, which allows people to walk through. While the shield ability is active, the mage is unable to do anything else and is therefore highly vulnerable to melee attacks.

The player can occasionally gain the opportunity to play as a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]] or an [[Ent]], which are also used by [[3D interactive characters|non-player characters]] and, while far stronger than any normal class, are vulnerable to instantaneous kills by Warriors and Scouts through the use of [[Quick Time Event]]s. Any class can ride a mount, [[horse]]s for the Men of the West and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|wargs]] and [[MÃ»makil|Oliphaunts]] for Sauron and [[Saruman]]âs forces). Mounts are useful for quickly traversing large areas, but are highly vulnerable and a single hit against one will result in the player being knocked off (with the exception of the oliphaunt, which has an enormous amount of health). The player wields a [[sword]] when [[Equestrianism|mounted]], regardless of their class, and is only allowed to use basic attacks. Mounts also have the power to trample enemies when riding at [[Horse gallop|top speed]].

In the Nintendo DS version, gameplay features are greatly reduced. The Scout class is unavailable and mounts are non-existent. In addition, the playing perspective is [[Isometric projection#Isometric projection in video games and pixel art|isometric]] and only 6 maps were shipped with the game. All classes start out relatively weak, but fallen enemies will drop orbs that allow the player to [[power-up]] their current characterâs attack power and speed, resetting after the player [[Spawning (computer gaming)|respawns]]. After a level is over, a post-game statistics screen will appear to show the playerâs performance and to award them in-game achievements for their accomplishments (not allowing allies to die, for instance).&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN DS review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/944/944770p1.html|title=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest Review|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception for ''The Lord of the Rings: Conquest'' has been mixed to poor. The majority of reviews claim that the game lacks any of the epic feel of the movies or novel,&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN US PS3 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/944/944751p1.html|title=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest Review|first=Nate|last=Ahearn|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN UK 360 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/945/945215p1.html|title=Lord of the Rings Conquest UK Review|first=Dave|last=McCarthy|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GR 360 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox360/lord-of-the-rings-conquest/review/the-lord-of-the-rings-conquest/a-20090114173537989064/g-2007032811532443061|title=One ring to screw it all up|first=Michael|last=Gapper|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Games Radar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN PC
review&quot;/&gt; CVG commenting on Sauron's appearance in the War of the Last Alliance [[Tutorial#Computer-based tutoring|tutorial]] as akin to a &quot;''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' villain&quot; chasing the player while &quot;you backtrack and shoot arrows into his face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=205568|title=Gandalf, forgive me|first=Andy|last=Robinson|date=2009-01-15|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Computer and Video Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battles are criticised by many reviewers as being repetitive, becoming mere &quot;hack {{sic|'n}} slash scuffles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG review&quot;/&gt; CVG also commented on the lack of difficulty in killing some of the larger enemies, such as trolls and Oliphaunts, slating the quick-time events that allow them to be killed with a single blow, making them lose all of their [[intimidation]] potential when fighting against them and making them &quot;frustrating&quot; to control in multiplayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG review&quot;/&gt; Another common complaint is the &quot;parody-style liberties&quot; it takes with the ''Lord of the Rings'' licence that would have &quot;Tolkien [[Breakdance|break dancing]] in his grave&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG review&quot;/&gt;

Other reviews were even more critical of the game, Games Radar stating that ''The Lord of the Rings: Conquest'' lacked even &quot;one redeeming quality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR PC review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/lord-of-the-rings-conquest/review/the-lord-of-the-rings-conquest/a-200901141751098358765/g-20070328115442394017|title=One ring to screw it all up|first=Michael|last=Gapper|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Games Radar}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common complaint was graphics well below modern standards, Games Radar likening the troll and Ent models to &quot;[[Clay animation|claymation]] [[Diarrhea|diarrhoea]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GR PS3 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/ps3/lord-of-the-rings-conquest/review/the-lord-of-the-rings-conquest/a-20090114175100234986/g-20070328115228680017|title=One ring to screw it all up|first=Michael|last=Gapper|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Games Radar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IGN stating that &quot;friend and foe alike blend into one messy brown blur&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN UK 360 review&quot;/&gt; Most reviews cited poor characterisation and plot, most often in regards to [[GrÃ­ma Wormtongue|Wormtongue]]'s participation in the battle of [[Isengard]]. Another common source of annoyance was the in-game announcer, who &quot;bellows&quot; objectives and hints to the player incessantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GR 360 review&quot;/&gt;

IGN criticised the &quot;redundancy&quot; of combat, stating that all four classes were essentially identical to play as, even between the two separate campaigns, and that heroes were merely &quot;class characters on [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN US 360 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/944/944390p1.html|title=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest Review|first=Nate|last=Ahearn|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-01-23|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also complained about the combat system as a whole, in that the player can &quot;[slam] buttons and [see] no result&quot;. Other reviews also mentioned combat as being unrealistic, one example being if the player falls from a high position they &quot;won't so much as buckle at the knee&quot; which gives a &quot;weightless, videogamey feel&quot; that contradicts the &quot;grand scale... of the universe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurogamer review&quot;/&gt; IGN did, however, praise the game for its &quot;easily recognisable&quot; locations, though said that the plot for the ''Rise of Sauron'' campaign could have been &quot;stronger&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN US PS3 review&quot;/&gt; while Game Informer believing that there is no story of any kind &quot;outside of clips stolen from the motion picture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI 360 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/FADFCF36-F841-4E48-9B2E-D28550FBAD46.htm?CS_pid=200506|title=Worse than a job as a hobbit pedicurist|first=Andrew|last=Reiner|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Game Informer}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GI PS3 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/78B444EE-5279-4324-BDA0-7142D9801644.htm?CS_pid=270246|title=Worse than a job as a hobbit pedicurist|first=Andrew|last=Reiner|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=Game Informer}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN commended the game's musical score and claimed that &quot;diehard fans of both online, class-based games and ''The Lord of the Rings''&quot; would enjoy the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN PC

The game's [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] is often cited as another weakness of the game, IGN listing two glitches, such as an enemy [[Boss (video games)|boss]] walking off a cliff and &quot;saving us the bother of having to defeat him in combat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN UK 360 review&quot;/&gt; Eurogamer stated that the player's allies are &quot;AI-impoverished&quot;, stepping into the player's line of fire &quot;before sauntering off [[friendly fire|unscathed]] and oblivious&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurogamer review&quot;/&gt; while Game Informer says that the AI appears to be &quot;[[Psychedelic experience|tripping]] on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] as they stare blankly at walls and sunsets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI PS3 review&quot;/&gt; The lack of mid-level [[Saved game|saves]] or a [[Checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint system]] was also quoted as a weakness, forcing the player to restart a level if they fail to complete an objective.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN UK PS3 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/945/945207p1.html|title=Lord of the Rings Conquest UK Review|first=Dave|last=McCarthy|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balance issues with the game are commented on by reviewers as needing work, IGN saying that the mage class is &quot;clearly overpowered&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN UK 360 review&quot;/&gt; and [[The A.V. Club]] believing that, due to the mage's ability to heal himself, the class is &quot;the correct choice 90 percent of the time&quot;. The A.V. Club also stated that the scout class is &quot;a [[griefer]]'s dream&quot; in multiplayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;A.V. Club review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin.avclub.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-conquest,23064/|title=Lord Of The Rings: Conquest|first=John|last=Teti|date=2009-01-26|accessdate=2009-05-29|publisher=A.V. Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Official Xbox Magazine cites objectives where the player must hold a position for a certain length of time while being [[siege|besieged]] by enemy forces, a common problem being that, if the player is killed, by the time the player has respawned, the location has been overrun before they have a chance to fight back. Many reviewers also complained about the lack of enemies on screen, CVG saying that the &quot;cardboard cut-outs in the background&quot; are the most exciting part of a battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;OXM review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG review&quot;/&gt;

Multiplayer was regarded as a disappointment, the game's servers &quot;plagued by connection problems and lag&quot;, even without the full sixteen players possible. They also cited a lack of [[Computer game bot|bots]] as a weakness, the &quot;wide, open levels [feeling] sparse and under-populated&quot; without them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurogamer review&quot;/&gt; The A.V. Club slated multiplayer as &quot;glitchy&quot;, sometimes placing the player &quot;in a one-on-one match of capture the flag&quot;.

In the DS version of the game, AI problems are again mentioned, the player's allies &quot;[running] around like a Hobbit with its head cut off&quot;. The lack of checkpoints and sub-standard graphics were also raised, along with lag during multiplayer and combat being unsatisfying, the reviewer not getting &quot;a sense that you are clashing swords and [[armour]] with your opponents&quot;. The review also points out that the game seems much as though &quot;the licence is really just skinned onto capture the flag&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN DS review&quot;/&gt;

===Downloadable content===
The first downloadable content was released on January 29, 2009, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It featured 2 maps for hero team deathmatch, which was not in the shipped game due to time constraints. This mode allows for [[arena]]-style battles with up to three friends. The maps themselves are merely broken down versions of levels in the campaigns, specifically sections of [[Osgiliath]] and Moria. OXM labelled the DLC as &quot;another way to play a terrible game&quot;, stating that the combat was still fundamentally unbalanced, with ranged attacks still having an advantage and that the action was &quot;even less dramatic when whittled down to four players&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OXM Hero Arena DLC review&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-03-12|title=OXM UK Hero Arena Bonus DLC Review|journal=Official Xbox Magazine UK|issue=45|page=103|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second pack of downloadable content was released February 26, 2009, on the same platforms which contained 3 new heroes ([[Boromir]], [[Arwen]] and [[Gothmog (Third Age)|Gothmog]]), 2 new maps ([[Amon Hen]] and [[War of the Last Alliance|Last Alliance]]) and 2 new Hero Arenas ([[Minas Tirith]] and [[Weathertop]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN DLC review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Hero Arena Bonus| publisher=IGN | date=2009-02-24|url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/956/956840p1.html|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; OXM, however, complained about the price tag of 800 [[Microsoft Points]], stating that &quot;the price rise is in sharp contrast to the free DLC EA trundled out&quot; before.&lt;ref name=&quot;OXM DLC review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Todayâs Lord of the Rings DLC will cost you| publisher=OXM | date=2009-02-26 | url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/article.php?id=8674|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
