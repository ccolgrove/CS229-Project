==History of the Jets' Logos and Uniforms==
During their previous incarnation as the Titans, the team's jerseys were navy blue combined with gold lettering and a navy blue helmet.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;&gt;Chastain, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The gold pants included two thin blue stripes that ran the length of the pant legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; The uniform designs resembled those of Notre Dame's due to &quot;some&quot; relationship between Wismer and the Fighting Irish;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A tribute to Titans of 1960s|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/nfl/magee/20071204-9999-1s4nflcol.html|work=|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|author=Magee, Jerry|date=December 4, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x3yYLrAo|archivedate=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wismer, who was considered a sportscasting pioneer, broadcast replays of Notre Dame football games prior to owning the Titans.&lt;ref&gt;Chastain, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The uniforms have also drawn comparisons to the University of Michigan jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;Chastain, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

When the syndicate led by [[Sonny Werblin]] purchased the team, renamed the Jets, the uniform underwent significant changes. The color scheme of the uniforms were changed to the now familiar green and white; white pants and green or white jerseys.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; On either side of the now white helmet was the logo of a green airplane with &quot;JETS&quot; written in white inside the shape of the plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, a green stripe ran down the midsection of the helmet, front to back.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt;

In 1965, the logo was changed to the shape of a green football with &quot;JETS&quot; written in white inside of the football; in the background of the logo was an outline of the letters &quot;NY.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; The uniforms underwent minor changes in 1968 when the shoulder stripes were slightly altered and a green belt replaced the former white belt on the pants.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; Ten years later, in 1978, the team again
changed the design and logo. The new uniform consisted of kelly green or white jerseys combined with white pants and a kelly green helmet with the logo, on either side of the helmet, spelling &quot;JETS&quot; in a &quot;sleek, modern font&quot; resembling the wing of a Jet.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt;

Minor changes were made to the uniform in 1986; a thin green or white ring was added around the jersey collar contrasting with the jersey color.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; Additionally, a green stripe was added to both of the pant legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; In 1990, the team added thin black stripes that outlined the stripes and numbers on the jersey; the Jets also began to wear kelly green pants when they wore their white road jerseys.&lt;ref name=&quot;C185&quot;/&gt; The signature NFL logo was added to the collar of the jerseys and on the left thigh of the pants in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;C186&quot;&gt;Chastain, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, all teams in the NFL wore a patch commemorating the NFL's 75th anniversary.&lt;ref name=&quot;C186&quot;/&gt; The Jets also reintroduced their 1963 jerseys and 1965 helmet logo for a few games in 1994; one such instance was against the Miami Dolphins in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;C186&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Pro Football; His Championship Seasons: Ewbank Reflects|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/sports/pro-football-his-championship-seasons-ewbank-reflects.html?scp=2&amp;sq=New York Jets uniforms&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=2|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|author=Anderson, Dave|date=September 18, 1994|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xBpkf70c|archivedate=March 14, 2011|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrator and head coach [[Bill Parcells]] took the initiative in 1998 and began to the process of redesigning the team's uniforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Parcells design&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Pro Football: Jets Notebook; Parcells Tailored Dress for Success|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/sports/pro-football-jets-notebook-parcells-tailored-dress-for-success.html?pagewanted=1|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|author=Eskenazi, Gerald|date=January 9, 1999|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x3ywMgIi|archivedate=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[Super Bowl III|Super Bowl]] veterans felt the previous design change in 1978 tampered with history.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Parcells design&quot;/&gt; Parcells, who sought to form the team's identity, changed the logo reverting to the 1965 logo, or rather, a modified version of the logo, since the oval was now more rounded at the ends and no longer resembled a football.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Parcells design&quot;/&gt; The Jets did not return to the kelly green of the AFL days, but adopted a shade close to forest green for both logo and uniforms.;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Parcells design&quot;/&gt; A white helmet was introduced to contrast the green logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;C186&quot;/&gt; For the first time, the Jets logo was placed on the jersey on a patch on the left front shoulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;C186&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, the team introduced an updated away uniform that consisted of white pants and a white jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=New York Jets Road Uniform (2002 - )|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?id=qa7jykw92h6xu4a0oz0pfhw94|work=|publisher=SportsLogos.net|author=|date=September 1, 2005|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x44cMWjL|archivedate=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets also introduced an alternative uniform completely green with white sleeves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=New York Jets Alternate Uniform (2002 - )|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?id=gpkho0mhg8rphfre0khv51fjg|work=|publisher=SportsLogos.net|author=|date=September 1, 2005|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x44slCdi|archivedate=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the team unveiled another alternative jersey, which features a white jersey with green pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=New York Jets Alternate Uniform (2003 - )|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?id=u4kq2hvgsfkd58no4n1kbhb45|work=|publisher=SportsLogos.net|author=|date=September 1, 2005|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x454BA0p|archivedate=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2007, the Jets celebrated their heritage with a special Titans Throwback Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titans Throwbacks&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title='Titans Throwback Day' Set|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/news/article-1/Titans-Throwback-Day-Set/4b3c8766-79f7-11df-ba56-acc8e62813e9|work=|publisher=New York Jets|author=Shorenstein, Melissa|date=August 22, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x40YFvYw|archivedate=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets wore their navy blue and gold uniforms, in honor of their previous incarnation, during their home game against the Philadelphia Eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titans Throwbacks&quot;/&gt; They also honored the four original Titans who played as Jets in Super Bowl III, [[Don Maynard]], [[Bill Mathis]], [[Larry Grantham]] and [[Curley Johnson]],.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titans Throwbacks&quot;/&gt; New York wore the throwback uniforms once more in December when the team played the Miami Dolphins at [[Sun Life Stadium|Dolphins Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Year in Review: 2007&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Year in Review - 2007|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/2007.html|work=|publisher=New York Jets|author=|date=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets went 1â1 in their throwbacks, dropping a 16â9 decision to the [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]] on October 14, 2007 and defeating the Dolphins, 40â13, on December 2, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year in Review: 2007&quot;/&gt;

The throwback uniforms made another appearance in 2008. Originally scheduled for the home opener against the Patriots, the throwback days were changed to the second and third home games, against the Arizona Cardinals and Cincinnati Bengals, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;In Green for Pats&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=EA: Yes, Jets Will Be in Green for Patriots|url=http://blog.newyorkjets.com/2008/08/21/ea-yes-jets-will-be-in-green-for-patriots/|work=|publisher=New York Jets|author=Allen, Eric|date=August 21, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x42F53ch|archivedate=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victories over the Cardinals (56â35) and Bengals (26â14) improved the Jets to 3â1 in Titan throwbacks. On October 26, 2008, the Jets honored the 1968 championship team displaying a commemorative 40th anniversary Super Bowl III patch on their left chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;In Green for Pats&quot;/&gt; The team also held a halftime ceremony to honor the championship alumni.&lt;ref name=&quot;In Green for Pats&quot;/&gt;

In 2009, the Jets introduced a modified version of the Titan's throwbacks, a white jersey with gold pants.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Jerseys Pop&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=New White Jerseys?
