'''Enrico Crivellaro''' (born [[Padua|Padova]], [[Italy]]) is an Italian [[blues]] musician,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enricocrivellaro.com/biography.htm Biography - EnricoCrivellaro.com]&lt;/ref&gt; who current lives in [[Los Angeles]].

Several record stores in the United States have moved his CDâs from the âBluesâ shelves to the âGuitar Heroâ section{{cn|date=October 2011}}, and have put them next to those by Chet Atkins, Eric Clapton, and so forth. The definition of Guitar Hero might not look compatible with Enrico Crivellaroâs unassuming nature{{cn|date=October 2011}} and with his genuine and humble devotion to music{{cn|date=October 2011}}, but it definitely serves to perfectly photograph the status of a guitarist who has earned international fame{{what|date=October 2011}}, and who is considered to be one of the most influential of his generation, thanks to a style that bridges Blues with Jazz and American Roots Music.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

Enricoâs latest album, âMojo Zoneâ (on the Canadian/US label Electro-Fi Records) has contributed to elevate him to such status. The record has been widely acclaimed and has received excellent reviews, among which stands out a 4-star review by Downbeatâthe worldâs most prestigious Jazz and Blues magazine.{{cn|date=October 2011}} Downbeat traditionally bestows four stars only to few selected records, and justifies them with the acknowledgment that âMojo Zone sets the gold standard for blues instrumental albums,â pouring âinspiration, hypnotic feeling and emotional delicacyâ{{cn|date=October 2011}} into the songs, and that Enricoâs âstellar techniqueâ will allow him to âconquer blues Americaâ. A fantastic{{cn|date=October 2011}} show at the 2009 Montreal Jazz Festival, in a packed{{cn|date=October 2011}} venue in front of an enthusiastic{{cn|date=October 2011}} audience, has proved that all this holds true, putting Enrico on the spot in the festival circuit in North America.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

A former student of Ronnie Earl, Duke Robillard and Kenny Burrell{{cn|date=October 2011}}, Enrico Crivellaro has developed a refined yet explosive guitar style which has led him to tour, play and record with an impressive number of major-league artistsâamong them James Harman, the late Lester Butler of the Red Devils, Jeff Healey, Janiva Magness, Finis Tasby, Bruce Katz, the Royal Crown Revue (the band from âThe Maskâ movie), and legendary harmonica player Lee Oskar.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

Born in Padova, Italy, but later relocating to Los Angeles, and now literally living in a suitcase{{dubious|date=October 2011}} and taking his music all around the world, Enrico Crivellaro has been able to prove that passion and talent can transcend political and cultural borders.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

His reputation is growing all over the world{{cn|date=October 2011}} as he tours regularly from the Americas to Europe, to Australia, to Asia and even Polynesia, playing the most renowned clubs and festivals (among them: Livid Festival, Brisbane, Australia; 2000 Paralympics Games, Sydney, Australia; Philips Dubai International Jazz Festival, Dubai, UAE; Belgium RhythmânâBlues Festival; Lucerne Blues Festival, Switzerland; Southside Shuffle, Toronto, Canada; Montreal International Jazz Festival, Canada; Boston Blues Festival; Sacramento Heritage Festival, California; Tucson Blues Festival, Arizona; Moulin Blues Festival, Holland; Universal Blues Festival, Singapore; Manly Jazz Festival, Australia; and many, many more!) and having often shared the bill with the likes of John Lee Hooker, B.B.King, Mose Allison, and so forth.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

Enricoâs musical taste and guitar licks have been refined during his studies with several blues masters at the National Guitar Workshop, in Connecticut, and later at the University of California with jazz legend Kenny Burrell. But he has learned his trade âthe old wayââby playing, literally, thousands of gigs everywhere, with some of the best artists in the contemporary blues scene. Enricoâs strength lies in his extraordinary versatility in different musical genres, which has allowed him to build an extraordinary experience playing with bands and artists of all extractionsâsoul jazz, country, funk and even zydeco. Yet his playing is firmly rooted in the blues language and his passion for Earl Hooker, Pee Wee Crayton and Lowell Fulson is pleasantly noticeable.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

Signed by the excellent Canadian-US label Electro-Fi Records, Enrico has debuted with a well-arranged CD, âKey To My Kingdomâ. His affiliation with Electro-Fi has opened the way to new opportunitiesâin fact Enrico has co-produced Finis Tasbyâs CD âWhat My Blues Are All Aboutâ and has appeared with label-mate Mel Brown and his band, which comprises Bob Stroger and Willie âBig Eyesâ Smith of the Muddy Waters Band.

The latest CD, âMojo Zoneâ, is a 2009 Electro-Fi release which features 70 minutes of genre expanding blues guitar instrumentals, showcasing the incredible sonic range of one of the most gifted young guitarists working on the blues scene today.{{cn|date=October 2011}}
