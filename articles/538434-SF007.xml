'''I2P''' (originally from pseudomathematical notation IÂ²P, short for '''Invisible Internet Project''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i2p2.de/meeting59 IRC Meeting #59]: &lt;jrand0m&gt; i2p = i^2p (invisible internet project)&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not commonly referred to by this name anymore) is a mixed-license, [[Free software|free]] and [[open source]] project building an [[anonymity|anonymous]] network (or, more accurately, a [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] [[overlay network]]).

The network is a simple [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layer]] that applications can use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other. Possible uses include anonymous surfing, chatting, blogging and file transfers.

The application itself is called an ''I2P router'' and a computer running I2P is called an ''I2P node'' - whereas those, too, are often referred to as ''routers''.

== Technical design ==
I2P is [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] software. Developers emphasize that there are likely to be bugs in the software and that there has been insufficient [[peer review]] to date. However, they believe the code is now reasonably stable and well-developed, and more exposure can help development of I2P.

The network itself is strictly message-based (like [[Internet Protocol|IP]]), but there is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (similar to [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], although from version 0.6 there is a new [[User datagram protocol|UDP]]-based SSU transport). All communication is end-to-end [[encryption|encrypted]] (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message), and even the end points (&quot;destinations&quot;) are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of [[public key]]s), so that neither sender nor recipient of a message need to reveal their [[IP address]] to the other side or to third-party observers.

Although many of the developers had been a part of the [[Invisible IRC Project|IIP]] and [[Freenet]] communities, there are significant differences between their designs and concepts. IIP was an anonymous centralized [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] server. Freenet is a [[censorship]]-resistant [[distributed data store]]. I2P is an [[Anonymous P2P|anonymous peer-to-peer]] distributed communication layer designed to run ''any'' traditional internet service (e.g. [[Usenet]], [[E-mail]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[file sharing]], [[Web hosting]] and [[HTTP]], [[Telnet]]), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a web proxy network using [[Squid (software)|Squid]], or [[Domain Name System|DNS]]).

Many developers of I2P are known only under [[Pseudonymity|pseudonyms]]. While the previous main developer, ''[[J. Random Hacker|jrandom]]'', is currently on hiatus, others, such as zzz and Complication have continued to lead development efforts, and are assisted by numerous contributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i2p2.de/statnotes0108 Status Update 01 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==

[[file:IMule.png|thumb|iMule]]

Since I2P is an anonymous [[network layer]], it is designed so other software can use it for anonymous communication. As such there are a variety of tools currently available for I2P or in development.

The I2P router is controlled through the router console which is a web frontend accessed through a web browser.

=== General networking ===

* ''I2PTunnel'' is an application embedded into I2P that allows arbitrary TCP/IP applications to communicate over I2P by setting up &quot;[[Tunneling protocol|tunnels]]&quot; which can be accessed by connecting to pre-determined ports on [[localhost]].
* ''SAM'' is a protocol which allows a client application written in any language to communicate over I2P, by using a socket-based interface to the I2P router.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i2p2.de/sam SAM - I2P&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== File sharing ===

* Several programs provide [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] functionality for use within the I2P network. Each relies on the user being able to access the I2P network with a [[web browser]] to download the .torrent files. Users cannot connect to non-I2P torrents or peers from within I2P, nor can they connect to I2P torrents or peers from outside I2P.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?t=2068 I2P Bittorrent FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; ''I2PSnark'', included in the I2P install package, is a port of the BitTorrent client named Snark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klomp.org/snark/ The Hunting of the Snark Project - BitTorrent Application Suite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vuze]]'', formerly known as Azureus, is a [[BitTorrent client]] that includes a plugin for I2P, allowing anonymous swarming through this network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azureus.sourceforge.net/plugin_details.php?plugin=azneti2p Azureus: Plugin Details for I2P Network Plugin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A tutorial exists for setting it up at [http://azureus.sourceforge.net/doc/AnonBT/i2p/I2P_howto.htm azureus.sourceforge.net]&lt;/ref&gt; This plugin is still in an early stage of development, however it is already fairly stable. ''I2P-BT'' is a [[BitTorrent client]] for I2P that allows anonymous [[Segmented downloading|swarming]] for [[file sharing]]. This client is a modified version of the original BitTorrent 3.4.2 program which runs on Windows and most dialects of [[Unix]] in a GUI and command-line environment. It was developed by the individual known as 'duck' on I2P in cooperation with 'smeghead'. It is no longer being actively developed; however, there is a small effort to upgrade the I2P-BT client up to par with the BitTorrent 4.0 release. ''I2PRufus'' is an I2P port of the Rufus BitTorrent client.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rufus.sourceforge.net/ Rufus - BitTorrent Client : Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://sponge.i2p/files/  Robert] is the most actively maintened I2PRufus fork. (i2p-internal link) And there is &quot;I2P-Transmission&quot;.
* [[iMule]] (''invisible Mule'') &lt;ref&gt;[http://aceini.no-ip.info/imule iMule download]&lt;/ref&gt; is a port of the 'All-Platform' client [[aMule]] for I2P network. iMule is made for anonymous [[file sharing]]. In contrast to other [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]] clients, iMule only uses the [[Kademlia]] proceeding to connect trough I2P network, so no servers are needed.
* [[I2Phex]] is a port of the popular [[Gnutella]] client [[Phex]] to I2P. It is stable and fairly functional.

=== E-mail ===

* I2P has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called ''Postman''. The mail transfer servers are ''pop.mail.i2p'' ([[Post Office Protocol|POP3]]) and ''smtp.mail.i2p'' ([[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]). ''Susimail'' was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the user's hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. Susimail is a web-based e-mail client intended primarily for use with Postman's mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. (Note that this is only used to read and send e-mail, not to create or manage your mail.i2p account; the latter must be done at ''hq.postman.i2p''.)
* ''I2P-Bote'' is an end-to-end encrypted, network-internal, fully decentralized (serverless) e-mail system. It supports different identities and does not expose e-mail headers. Currently, it is still alpha software and can only be accessed via its web interface, but it will soon have pop3 support. All bote-mails are automatically end-to-end encrypted and optionally signed and thus authenticated, so that there's no need to set up e-mail encryption apart (though you can do that). I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by providing a high-latency transport option. As it is decentralized, there is no e-mail server that could link different e-mail identities as communicating with each other (''profiling''): Even the nodes relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-latency mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which anonymous identity, yet of course not the real world identity) the mail is destined. The original sender can have gone offline long before the mail becomes available on the other side. This adds on the degree of anonymity that can be reached with I2P. For those who do not want high delays: All these settings are user-adjustable, so each user decides on how much anonymity he wants.

=== Instant messaging ===

* ''I2P-Messenger'' is a simple Qt-based, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted [[instant messenger]] for I2P. No servers can log your conversations, no ISP can log with whom you chat, when, or for how long. As it is serverless, it can make use of I2P's end-to-end encryption, preventing any node between you and your contacts from having access to the plain text. I2P-Messenger can be used for fully anonymous instant communication with persons you don't even know, or, alternatively, to communicate securely and untraceably with friends, family members, or colleagues. Thus, it is also a useful tool against data retention in a surveillance society. In addition to messaging, file transfer is also supported.

=== Blogging ===

* ''[[Syndie]]'' is a [[blog]]ging application for I2P which is also usable through the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network; it is currently at an alpha release.

== Terminology ==

; Eepsite: Eepsites are [[website]]s that are hosted anonymously within the I2P network. Eepsite names end in ''.i2p'', such as ugha.i2p or forum.i2p. EepProxy can locate these sites through the cryptographic identifier keys stored in the hosts.txt file found within the I2P program directory. Typically, I2P is required to access these eepsites.
; EepProxy: The EepProxy program handles all communication between the browser and any eepsite. It functions as a [[proxy server]] that can be used by any [[web browser]].
'''.i2p''' is a [[pseudo-top-level domain]] which is only valid within the I2P [[overlay network]] scope. &lt;tt&gt;.i2p&lt;/tt&gt; names are resolved by browsers by submitting requests to EepProxy which will resolve names to an I2P peer key and will handle data transfers over the I2P network while remaining transparent to the browser.
; Peers: Other machines using I2P that are connected to your machine within the network. Each machine within the network shares the routing and forwarding of encrypted packets.
; Tunnels: Every ten minutes, a connection is established between your machine and another peer. Data to and from your machine, along with data for other users, passes through these tunnels, and are forwarded such that the packets eventually reach their final destination.
