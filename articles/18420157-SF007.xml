'''OpenOffice.org''', commonly known as '''OOo''' or '''OpenOffice''', is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[application suite]] whose main components are for [[Word processor|word processing]], [[spreadsheet]]s, [[Presentation program|presentations]], [[Graphics software|graphics]], and [[Relational database management system|databases]].&lt;ref name=&quot;why1&quot;/&gt; OpenOffice is available for a number of different computer [[operating system]]s, is distributed as [[free software]] and is written using its own [[Widget toolkit|GUI toolkit]]. It supports the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard [[OpenDocument]] Format (ODF) for data interchange as its default [[file format]], as well as [[Microsoft Office]] formats among others. {{As of|2011|6}}, OpenOffice.org supports over 120 languages.&lt;ref name=langcount/&gt;  As free software, users are free to download, modify, use and distribute OpenOffice.org. [[LibreOffice]] is a fork of OpenOffice.org which was formed by many of the original developers of OpenOffice.

OpenOffice.org originated as [[StarOffice]], an office suite developed by [[StarDivision]] and acquired by [[Sun Microsystems]] in August 1999. The [[source code]] of the suite was released in July 2000 with the aim of reducing the [[Dominance (economics)|dominant]] [[market share]] of [[Microsoft Office]] by providing a free and open alternative {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}. OpenOffice.org was an open-source version of the StarOffice suite, with development sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems. After acquiring Sun in 2010, [[Oracle Corporation]] stopped supporting commercial development&lt;ref name=&quot;ARS18Apr11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/04/oracle-gives-up-on-ooo-after-community-forks-the-project.ars|title = Oracle gives up on OpenOffice after community forks the project|accessdate =19 April 2011|last = Paul|first = Ryan|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = April| work = [[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2011 contributed the suite to the [[Apache Incubator]] to become a project of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MW01June&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/statements-on-openofficeorg-contribution-to-apache-nasdaq-orcl-1521400.htm|title = Statements on OpenOffice.org Contribution to Apache |accessdate =15 Jun 2011|author = Oracle Corporation|publisher = MarketWire| year = 2011|month = June| work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ApacheOOo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://incubator.apache.org/projects/openofficeorg.html|title = OpenOffice.org Incubation Status|accessdate =18 Jun 2011|author =|publisher = Apache Software Foundation| year = 2011|month = June| work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project and software are commonly known as ''OpenOffice'', but this term is [[trademark]]ed both in the [[Netherlands]], by a company co-founded by Wouter Hanegraaff, &lt;!--This name is not the same person in another WP article.--&gt; and, independently, in the [[UK]] by [[Orange U.K.|Orange UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Originally the German company [[StarDivision]] developed the application as the [[proprietary software]] suite [[StarOffice]]. In 1999 Sun Microsystems purchased the code. In August 1999 version 5.2 of StarOffice was made available free of charge.

===OpenOffice.org 1===
On 19 July 2000, Sun Microsystems announced that it would make the source code of StarOffice available for download under both the [[LGPL]] and the [[Sun Industry Standards Source License]] (SISSL) with the intention of building an open-source development community around the software. The new project was known as OpenOffice.org,&lt;ref&gt;http://sun.systemnews.com/articles/29/1/news/2477&lt;/ref&gt; and its website went live on 13 October 2000. OpenOffice.org 1.0 was released on 1 May 2002 for MS Windows, Linux and Solaris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/news.html |title=News: The Press on OpenOffice.org and Open Source (archived website) |date=5 June 2002 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020607182735/www.openoffice.org/news.html |archivedate=7 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/1.0.0/release_notes_1.0.0.html |title=Release Notes for the OpenOffice.org 1.0.0 Release (archived website) |year=2002 |month=May |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020504114841/www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/1.0.0/release_notes_1.0.0.html |archivedate=4 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/05/01/openoffice_suite_goes/ |title=OpenOffice suite goes 1.0 |publisher=The Register |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenOffice.org 1.0 for MacOS X (X11) was released on 23 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/index.html  |title=Mac OS X OpenOffice.org Port (archived website) |date=29 June 2003 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030801095825/http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/index.html |archivedate = 1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/ooo-osx_downloads.html |title=OpenOffice.org 1.0 for Mac OS X (X11) (archived website) |date=7 July 2003 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030801095614/porting.openoffice.org/mac/ooo-osx_downloads.html |archivedate=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenOffice.org 1.1 introduced One-click Export to PDF and can Export presentations to Flash (.SWF). It also added the 3rd Party Add-ons ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;ooo11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/1.1/index.html |title=1.1 Features |publisher=Openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OpenOffice.org 2===
Work on version 2.0 began in early 2003 with the following goals: better interoperability with [[Microsoft Office]]; better performance, with improved speed and lower memory usage; greater [[Scripting language|scripting]] capabilities; better integration, particularly with [[GNOME]]; an easier-to-find and use database front-end for creating reports, forms and queries; digital signatures (only in ODF format; this feature is not defined in ODF 1.1 specification); a new built-in [[SQL]] database; and improved [[usability]]. Sun released a [[beta version]] on 4 March 2005.

On 2 September 2005 Sun announced that it was retiring the SISSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=addressing_proliferation_deeds_not_just | title = Sun announces the SISSL retirement|accessdate =3 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the OpenOffice.org Community Council announced that it would no longer [[dual license|dual-license]] the office suite, and future versions would use only the [[LGPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/license-change.html | title = OpenOffice.org community council announcement of license change|accessdate =3 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2005, [[Sun Microsystems]] formally released OpenOffice.org 2.0 to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
 | url=http://www.openoffice.org/press/2.0/press_release.html
 | title=OpenOffice.org 2.0 Is Here (OpenOffice.org 2.0 Announcement)

 | date=20 October 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight weeks after the release of Version 2.0, an update, OpenOffice.org 2.0.1, was released. It fixed minor bugs and introduced new features.

As of the 2.0.3 release, OpenOffice.org changed its release cycle from 18 months to releasing updates, feature enhancements and bug fixes every three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2153630/openoffice-zooms-lagging

 | accessdate=20 April 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of | 2010}}, new versions (including new features) are released every six months (so-called &quot;feature releases&quot;) alternating with so-called &quot;bug fix releases&quot; which are being released between two feature releases (every three months).

===OpenOffice.org 3===
[[Image:Sun Start Center.png|thumb|220px|left|The Sun Start Center for versions between 3.0 and 3.2.0]]

In October 2008, version 3.0 was released, featuring the ability to import, but not export, [[Office Open XML]] documents, support for the new ODF 1.2 document format, improved support for [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] [[Macro (computer science)|macros]], and a native port for [[Mac OS X]]. It also introduces the new Start Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.0 | title=OpenOffice.org 3.0 Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 3.2 included support for PostScript-based [[OpenType]] fonts. In addition, the software will now warn users when ODF 1.2 Extended features have been used. An improvement to the document integrity check will determine if an ODF document conforms to the ODF specification and offer a repair if necessary. The Calc and Writer components both have a reduced &quot;cold start&quot; time by 46% compared to version 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.2/ |title=3.2 New Features |publisher=Openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New features in version 3.3 include an updated print form, a FindBar and interface improvements for Impress.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki.services.openoffice.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title      = Project Renaissance Roadmap

  | url        = http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Renaissance:The_Roadmap
  | accessdate =3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In future versions, the user interface will receive incremental improvements. This work began with Impress in version 3.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The new version 3.4 will include &quot; new SVG import, the improved ODF 1.2 support and other enhancements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openoffice.org/news/index.html#OOo340beta&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

OpenOffice.org 1.0 was launched under the following [[mission statement]]:
{{quotation|'''To create, as a community, the leading international office suite that will run on all major platforms and provide access to all functionality and data through open-component based APIs and an XML-based file format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OpenOffice.org community announces OpenOffice.org 1.0: free office productivity software''' | url = http://www.openoffice.org/about_us/ooo_release.html | date = 30 April 2002 |accessdate =16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

OpenOffice.org 3 is promoted as being available in many languages, working on all common computers, storing data in an international open standard format and being able to read and write files from other common office software packages, as well as being available for download and use completely free of charge for any purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;why1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Why OpenOffice.org|url=http://why.openoffice.org/|publisher=Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the publishers of the office suite stress that it is the result of over twenty years' software engineering, it is easy to use, and it is free, released under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] licence.&lt;ref name=&quot;why1&quot;/&gt;

=== Platforms ===
Platforms supported by OO.o include [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[BSD]], [[OpenVMS]], [[OS/2]] and [[IRIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Porting: The OpenOffice.org Porting Project: home| url = http://porting.openoffice.org/| accessdate =31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current primary development platforms are Microsoft Windows, Linux and Solaris.

Support for [[Mac OS X]] exists for OS X's native [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua user interface]], as of version 3.0.  Previous versions required installing the [[X Window System]] component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OpenOffice.org Mac OS X Delivery Schedule | url = http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/timeline.html | accessdate =7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NeoOffice]] is an independent [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of OpenOffice, specially adapted for Mac OS X.

Impress can export presentations to [[Adobe Flash]] (SWF) files, allowing them to be played on any computer with a Flash player installed. It also includes the ability to create PDF files, and the ability to read Microsoft PowerPoint's .ppt format. Impress lacks ready-made presentation designs but this can be overcome by downloading free templates on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template/presentations/index.html |title=Presentation templates at OpenOffice.org |publisher=Documentation.openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template_2_x/impress/index.html |title=Impress Templates&amp;nbsp;â User/Template |publisher=Documentation.openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Image:OOoBase.png|48px]]
| '''[[OpenOffice.org Base|Base]]'''
| A [[database management program]] similar to [[Microsoft Access]]. Base allows the creation and manipulation of databases, and the building of forms and reports to provide easy access to data for end-users. As with MS Access, Base can function as a front-end to a number of different database systems, including Access databases (JET), [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]] data sources and [[MySQL]]/[[PostgreSQL]]. Base became part of the suite starting with version 2.0. Native to the OpenOffice.org suite is an adaptation of [[HSQL]]. While Base can be a front-end for any of the databases listed, there is no need to install any of them. Raw [[SQL]] code can be entered by those who prefer it, or graphical user interfaces can be used.
|-
| [[Image:OOoDraw.png|48px]]
| '''[[OpenOffice.org Draw|Draw]]'''
| A [[vector graphics editor]] comparable in features to early versions of [[CorelDRAW]] and [[Microsoft Visio]]. It features versatile &quot;connectors&quot; between shapes, which are available in a range of line styles and facilitate building drawings such as [[flowchart]]s. It has similar features to [[Desktop publishing|desktop-publishing]] software such as [[Scribus]] and [[Microsoft Publisher]]. Draw can also export its creations to the PDF format. (See ooWriter entry, above, for details of PDF).

*[[QuickStart]]er
:A small program for Windows and Linux that runs when the computer starts for the first time. It loads the core files and libraries for OpenOffice.org during computer startup and allows the suite applications to start more quickly when selected later. The amount of time it takes to open OpenOffice.org applications occasioned complaints at version 1.0 of the suite. Substantial improvements were made in this area for version 2.2.
*The [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] recorder
:Can record user actions and replay them later to help with automating tasks, using [[OpenOffice.org Basic]] (see [[OpenOffice.org Basic|below]]).

It is not possible to download these components individually for Apple OSX or Microsoft Windows platforms, though they can be installed separately. Most Linux distributions break the components into individual packages which may be downloaded and installed separately.

*[[Computer font|Fonts]]
:OpenOffice.org includes [[DejaVu fonts]] and OpenSymbol font in its installation packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://packages.debian.org/en/sid/ttf-opensymbol |title=Package: ttf-opensymbol |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;modules-fonts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/External/Modules#Fonts |title=OpenOffice.org Wiki - External/Modules |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Installation packages for different operating systems may also contain [[Liberation fonts]] (starting with OpenOffice.org 2.4) or [[Gentium]] fonts (since OpenOffice.org 3.2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=89682 |title=Include the Gentium open fonts |publisher=OpenOffice.org |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=77705 |title=OpenOffice.org - Issue 77705 - Liberation font and OOo |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=104723 |title=OpenOffice.org - Issue 104723 - Update Liberation fonts to v1.05.1.20090721 |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older versions of OpenOffice.org (up to versions 2.3.x) included [[Bitstream Vera]] fonts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ooo240&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;modules-fonts&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://packages.debian.org/en/sid/openoffice.org |title=Debian - Package: openoffice.org |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ooo-build/ooo-build/tree/patches/dev300/apply?h=ooo-build-3-1-1 |title=ooo-build - patches - dev300 (OpenOffice.org 3.xx patches) |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://download.go-oo.org/DEV300/ |title=go-oo development packages |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenOffice.org applications use the default fonts of the running operating system. For example, {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}}, recent versions of GNU/Linux distributions (Mandriva Linux, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE) use the Liberation fonts or DejaVu fonts as default fonts for new documents (when a new document is created).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Releases/Mandriva/2008.0/Tour#Liberation_font_set |title=Mandriva Linux 2008 Release Tour - Liberation font set |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Releases/Mandriva/2008.0/Notes#Liberation_fonts_included |title=Mandriva Linux 2008 Release Notes - Liberation fonts included  |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fonts/DejavuFeedbackCall |title=Archive:Fonts Dejavu Feedback Call |publisher=Fedora Project |year=2006 |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extensions ===
Since version 2.0.4, OpenOffice.org has supported extensions, in a similar manner to [[Mozilla Firefox]], including the unique extension .oxt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |last=Bergmann |first=Stephan |title=.oxt, .uno.pkg, .zip |mailinglist=dev@extensions.openoffice.org |date=7 July 2006 |url=http://extensions.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&amp;msgNo=142 |accessdate=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions make it possible to add new functionality to an existing OpenOffice.org installation. {{As of|2011|11}}, the OpenOffice.org Extension Repository lists more than 650 extensions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project OpenOffice.org repository for Extensions]&lt;/ref&gt; Developers can easily build new extensions for OpenOffice.org, for example by using the API Plugin for [[NetBeans]].

=== OpenOffice.org Basic ===
{{Main|StarOffice Basic}}

OpenOffice.org Basic is a [[programming language]] similar to Microsoft [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA) but based on [[StarOffice Basic]]. In addition to the macros, the Novell edition of OpenOffice.org has Microsoft VBA macros support from version 2.0,&lt;ref name=&quot;Novell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/features/ooo.html |title=Open Office Novell Edition &amp;#124; Microsoft Office Alternative |publisher=Novell.com |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feature partly incorporated into the mainstream version with version 3.0.

OpenOffice.org Basic is available in the Writer and Calc applications. It is written in functions called subroutines or macros, with each macro performing a different task, such as counting the words in a paragraph. OpenOffice.org Basic is especially useful in doing repetitive tasks that have not been integrated in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bain | first = Mark Alexander | work = NewsForge |title=An introduction to OpenOffice.org Basic | url = http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/09/20/1840248&amp;tid=152&amp;tid=93 | accessdate =3 March 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As the OpenOffice.org database, called &quot;Base&quot;, uses documents created under the Writer application for reports and forms, one could say that Base can also be programmed with OpenOffice.org Basic.

=== Connectivity ===

OOo can interact with databases (local or remote) using:

* ODBC: [[Open Database Connectivity]]
* JDBC: [[Java Database Connectivity]]
* SDBC: StarOffice Database Connectivity&lt;ref&gt;

== File formats ==
=== OpenDocument format ===
{{main|OpenDocument}}
OpenOffice.org pioneered the ISO/IEC standard [[OpenDocument]] file formats (ODF), which it uses natively and by default. Since version 3.0 the default format of OpenOffice.org is based on draft versions for OASIS ODF 1.2 (but this setting can be changed to ODF 1.0/1.1 in application settings). Versions 2.0â2.3.0 of OpenOffice.org default to the ODF 1.0 file format; OpenOffice.org versions 2.3.1â2.4.3 default to ODF 1.1.
The OpenDocument 1.0 specification was approved for release as an ISO and IEC International Standard under the name ISO/IEC 26300:2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/commcentre/pressreleases/2006/Ref1004.html

|date=8 May 2006
|accessdate=24 August 2006
|work=ISO Press Releases
|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenOffice.org used the [[OpenOffice.org XML]] file format in its 1.x versions as its native and default format for saving files. OpenOffice.org developers contributed the OpenOffice.org XML File Format to [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]. On the basis of that format OASIS developed the OpenDocument format, which became the native file format of OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xml.openoffice.org/general.html |title=OpenOffice.org XML File Format |accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.file-extensions.org/sxw-file-extension |title=File extension SXW - OpenOffice.org Writer document |accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenOffice.org XML file format is still supported in all later versions of OpenOffice.org.

=== PDF export ===
OpenOffice.org 1.1 introduced Export to PDF and can Export presentations to Flash (.SWF).&lt;ref name=&quot;ooo11&quot; /&gt; Since OpenOffice.org 2.4.0 it also supports export to [[PDF/A]]-1a format (ISO 19005-1).&lt;ref name=&quot;ooo240&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/API/Tutorials/PDF_export |title=API/Tutorials/PDF export |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other formats ===
OpenOffice.org also supports reading (and in some cases writing) many legacy and current proprietary file formats, e.g.:&lt;ref name=&quot;fileformats&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Getting_Started/File_formats |title=OpenOffice.org Wiki - File formats OOo can open |accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;started2x&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Getting_Started/File_formats |title=Getting Started Guide for OpenOffice.org 2.x - File formats |accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Development ==
=== Governance ===
The OpenOffice.org project is governed by the ''Community Council'', comprising members from the OpenOffice.org community, which created the charter establishing the Community Council. The Community Council suggests OpenOffice.org project goals, coordinate with Sun Microsystems or Oracle on StarOffice, with producers of other derivative commercial products and with Open Source projects on long-term development planning issues, represents the project, gathers and allocates funds, adjudicates conflicts, offers a forum for community members, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://council.openoffice.org/councilcharter12.html |title=OpenOffice.org - Community Council Charter - version 1.2 |date=25 March 2009 |accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://council.openoffice.org/ |title=OpenOffice.org Community Council |accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/guidelines.html |title=Guidelines for Participating in OpenOffice.org |accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council have no power over intellectual-property ownership of OpenOffice.org, licenses under which OpenOffice.org is released, resources controlled by Sun Microsystems or Oracle, sponsors or the contributing individuals. The Council also may not sign contracts or enter into binding legal agreements. The Council will not attempt to directly manage individual projects, except where strictly necessary in pursuing other Council's duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot; /&gt;

Since acquiring Sun Microsystems, Oracle has made many decisions without consulting the Council or in contravention to the council's recommendations. Disputes with the community over these actions led to the departure of a large portion of the independent developers to form [[The Document Foundation]] and work on [[LibreOffice]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ryan [http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/09/document-foundation-forks-openofficeorg-to-liberate-it-from-oracle.ars &quot;Document Foundation forks OpenOffice.org, liberates it from Oracle&quot;], Ars Technica, 28 September 2010, accessed 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Oracle announced that it would discontinue commercial development of OpenOffice.org, and that it would become a &quot;purely community based project&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;oracle comm proj&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.oracle.com/trond/2011/04/openofficeorg_to_become_a_pure.html |title=OpenOffice.org to become a purely community-based project |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ryan [http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/04/oracle-gives-up-on-ooo-after-community-forks-the-project.ars &quot;Oracle gives up on OpenOffice after community forks the project&quot;], Ars Technica, 17 April 2011, accessed 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview ===
The OpenOffice.org [[Application Programming Interface|API]] is based on a component technology known as [[Universal Network Objects]] (UNO). It consists of a wide range of interfaces defined in a [[CORBA]]-like [[interface description language]].

The [[document file format]] used is based on [[XML]] and several export and import filters. OpenOffice.org converts all external formats which it reads - back and forth from an internal XML representation. By using [[data compression|compression]] when saving [[XML]] to disk, files are generally smaller than the equivalent binary Microsoft Office documents. The native file format for storing documents in version 1.0 was used as the basis of the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] OpenDocument file format standard, which became the default file format in version 2.0.

Development versions of the suite are released every few weeks on the developer zone of the OpenOffice.org website. The releases are meant for those who wish to test new features or are simply curious about forthcoming changes; they are not suitable for production use.

=== Native desktop integration ===
OpenOffice.org 1.0 was criticized for not having the [[look and feel]] of applications developed natively for the platforms on which it runs. Starting with version 2.0, OpenOffice.org uses native [[widget toolkit]], icons, and font-rendering libraries across a variety of platforms, to better match native applications and to provide a smoother [[user experience|experience]] for the user. Projects have started to further improve this integration on both [[GNOME]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnome.org/projects/ooo/ |title=GNOME/OpenOffice.org integration |publisher=Gnome.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[KDE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kde.openoffice.org/ |title=KDE Integration Project |publisher=Kde.openoffice.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3983 |title=KDEdevelopers.org |publisher=KDEdevelopers.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; desktop environments.

This issue had been particularly pronounced on Mac OS X, whose standard user interface looks noticeably different from either Windows or [[X11]]-based desktop environments and required the use of programming toolkits that were initially unfamiliar to most OpenOffice.org developers. Early versions of OpenOffice.org required the installation of [[X11.app]] or [[XDarwin]].  Versions since version 3.0 run natively using Apple's [[Aqua (GUI)|Aqua GUI]].

=== Security ===
The OpenOffice.org project includes a security team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openoffice.org/security/ |title=OpenOffice.org Security Team |accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of October 2011 the security organization [[Secunia]] reports no known unpatched security flaws for the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://secunia.com/advisories/product/20130/ | title = Secunia entry for OpenOffice.org 3.x | accessdate =20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaspersky Lab]] has shown a [[proof of concept]] virus for OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.com.com/2100-7349_3-6078475.html | title = Stardust virus lands on OpenOffice|publisher = CNet|date = 31 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows OOo viruses are possible, but there is no known virus &quot;in the wild&quot;.

The lab director of the French Ministry of Defense, Lt. Col. Eric Filiol, demonstrated security weaknesses, in particular within macros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060718-7288.html | title = OpenOffice.org less secure than Microsoft Office? | accessdate =1 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenOffice.org developers have responded and noted that the supposed vulnerability had not been announced through &quot;well defined procedures&quot; for disclosure and that the Ministry had revealed nothing specific. However, the developers have had discussions with the researcher concerning the supposed vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&amp;msgNo=17386 | title = OO.oâs official response to Le ministÃ¨re de la DÃ©fense met OpenOffice Ã  l'index | accessdate =1 August 2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ownership ==
The project and software are informally referred to as ''OpenOffice'', but since this term is a [[trademark]] held by other parties,  ''OpenOffice.org'' is its formal name.&lt;ref name=&quot;openoffice1&quot;/&gt; Due to a similar trademark issue, the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version of the suite was distributed under the name ''BrOffice.org''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.broffice.org/sobre|title = Sobre o BrOffice.org|accessdate =17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewardship of the slightly re-branded BrOffice builds was moved to [[The Document Foundation]] in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LibreOffice Development Extends To Brazil|url=http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2010/12/06/libreoffice-development-extends-to-brazil/|publisher=The Document Foundation|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until May 2011, staff members of the Sun / Oracle StarOffice team managed the development of OpenOffice.org.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Developers who wished to contribute code were required to sign a Contributor Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/oca.pdf |title=Oracle Contributor Agreement |accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; granting joint ownership of any contributions to Oracle Corporation.  An alternative Public Documentation Licence (PDL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/pdl.pdf|title=Public Documentation License|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also offered for documentation not intended for inclusion or integration into the project code base. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://contributing.openoffice.org/programming.html |title=OpenOffice.org - Programming |accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/faq-licensing.html/copyright:OOo Copyright FAQ](revision as of 10:10, 22 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2011, Oracle announced that  the code base of OpenOffice had been proposed for submission to the [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache Software Foundation's]] as an [[Apache Incubator|Incubator project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MW01June&quot; /&gt; On 13 June, it was officially accepted as an incubator project.&lt;ref name=&quot;ApacheOOo&quot; /&gt;

==Partnerships==

On 4 October 2005, Sun and [[Google]] announced a [[strategic partnership]]. As part of this agreement, Sun added a Google search [[toolbar]] to OpenOffice.org, and Google agreed to help distribute OpenOffice.org. Sun and Google also agreed to engage in joint marketing activities, and joint research and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/FAQ+The+Sun-Google+partnership/2100-1012_3-5888783.html?tag=nl FAQ: The Sun-Google partnership] by Stephen Shankland, Staff Writer, CNET News.com, 4 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; StarOffice was formerly distributed with the [[Google Pack]].

On 23 May 2007, the OpenOffice.org community and Redflag Chinese 2000 Software Co, Ltd. announced a joint development effort focused on integrating the new features that have been added in the RedOffice localization of OpenOffice.org, as well as quality assurance and work on the core applications. Additionally, Redflag Chinese 2000 made public its commitment to the global OO.o community stating it would &quot;strengthen its support of the development of the world's leading free and open source productivity suite&quot;, adding around 50 engineers (who have been working on RedOffice since 2006) to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/date/20071003 |title=Sun and Red Flag press release |publisher=Blogs.sun.com |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2007, the OO.o community announced that [[IBM]] had joined to support the development of OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openoffice.org/press/ibm_press_release.html |title=Press Release: IBM Joins OpenOffice.org Community |publisher=Openoffice.org |date=10 September 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;IBM will be making initial code contributions that it has been developing as part of its Lotus Notes product, including accessibility enhancements, and will be making ongoing contributions to the feature richness and code quality of OpenOffice.org. Besides working with the community on the free productivity suite's software, IBM will also leverage OpenOffice.org technology in its products&quot; as seen with [[IBM Lotus Symphony|Lotus Symphony]]. Sean Poulley, the vice president of business and strategy in IBM's [[Lotus Software]] division, said that IBM plans to take a [[leadership]] role in the OpenOffice.org community together with other companies such as Sun Microsystems. IBM will work within the leadership structure that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9037499&amp;pageNumber=2 | title= Can IBM save OpenOffice.org from itself? | work=Computerworld | date= 19 September 2007 | accessdate=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM also announced 35 developers would be assigned to work on OpenOffice.org, and that it would join the OpenOffice.org foundation. Commentators noted parallels between IBM's 2000 support of Linux and this announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I.B.M. to Offer Office Software Free in Challenge to Microsoftâs Line I.B.M. to Offer Office Software Free in Challenge to Microsoftâs Line |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/technology/18blue.html |first=Steve |last=Lohr |work=Technology |publisher=New York Times |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007}}

{{quote|For personal use, there are even fewer reasons to choose Microsoft.

=== Market share ===
[[File:Office suite ja.png|thumb|Various OpenOffice.org applications running on GNOME in Japanese.]]
Problems arise in estimating the [[market share]] of OpenOffice.org because it can be freely distributed via download sites (including mirrors), peer-to-peer networks, CDs, Linux distributions and so forth. Nevertheless, the OpenOffice.org tries to capture key adoption data in a market-share analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Market_Share_Analysis |title=OpenOffice.org Market Share Analysis |publisher=Wiki.services.openoffice.org |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have shown that OpenOffice has reached a point where it has an &quot;irreversible&quot; installed user base and that it will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1656616 Casson and Ryan, Open Standards, Open Source Adoption in the Public Sector, and Their Relationship to Microsoftâs Market Dominance]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Valve Corporation]], 14.63% of [[Steam (software)|Steam]] users have OpenOffice.org installed on their machines as of July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey|url=http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined|work=Valve|accessdate=24 August 2010|month=August|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-share analysis conducted by a [[web analytics]] service in 2010, based on over 200,000 Internet users, showed a wide range of adoption in different countries:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmasterpro.de/portal/news/2010/02/05/international-openoffice-market-shares.html International OpenOffice market shares], Webmasterpro.de&lt;/ref&gt; between 0.2% in China, 9% in the US and the UK and over 20% in Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany.

=== Use of Java ===
In the past OpenOffice.org was criticized by the  [[Free Software Foundation]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Byfield&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Byfield |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Byfield |title=Free Software Foundation and OpenOffice.org team up to escape Java trap |publisher=[[linux.com]] |date=16 May 2005 |url=http://www.linux.com/feature/44959 |accessdate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an increasing dependency on the [[Java Virtual Machine|Java Runtime Environment]] which was not [[free software]]. Because Sun Microsystems was both the creator of Java and the chief supporter of OpenOffice.org, the software maker drew accusations of ulterior motives.

Version 1 depended on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) being present on the userâs computer for some auxiliary functions, but version 2 increased the suiteâs use of Java requiring a JRE. In response, [[Red Hat]] increased their efforts to improve [[free Java implementations]]. Red Hatâs [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]] 4 (released on 13 June 2005) included a beta version of OpenOffice.org version 2, running on [[GNU Compiler for Java|GCJ]] and [[GNU Classpath]].

The issue of OpenOffice.orgâs use of Java came to the fore in May 2005, when [[Richard Stallman]] appeared to call for a [[fork (software)|fork]] of the application in a posting on the Free Software Foundation website.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byfield&quot;/&gt; This led to discussions within the OpenOffice.org community and between Sun staff and developers involved in [[GNU Classpath]], a free replacement for Sunâs Java implementation. Later that year, the OpenOffice.org developers also placed into their development guidelines various requirements to ensure that future versions of OpenOffice.org could run on free implementations of Java and fixed the issues which previously prevented OpenOffice.org 2.0 from using free-software Java implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://tools.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=jdk&amp;msgNo=133 |title=Reoccuring &amp;#091;sic&amp;#093; discussions arounds &amp;#091;sic&amp;#093; OOos Java usage |date=11 May 2005 |accessdate=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2006, Sun [[OpenJDK|committed to release Java]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp |title=Sun Opens Java |accessdate =25 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061116045838/http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 16 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process would end OpenOffice.org's dependence on non-[[Free software|free]] software.

Between November 2006 and May 2007, Sun Microsystems made available most of their Java technologies under the GNU General Public License, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, thus making almost all of Sun's Java also free software.

The following areas of OpenOffice.org 2.0 depend on JRE installation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Java |title=Java and OpenOffice.org |accessdate =13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common point of confusion focuses on the need for the Java API [[JavaMail]] in [[mail merge]] to generate emails in [[StarOffice]]; however, as of version 2.0.1, OpenOffice.org uses a [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-component instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/word_processing/Email_mailmerge.pdf |title=How To Email Mailmerge using mailmerge.py |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retail ==
The [[free software license]] (under which Sun distributes OpenOffice.org) allows unlimited use of the software for both home and business use, including unlimited redistribution of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-is-what.com/what_is/open_office.html |title=What is Open Office? - The facts about Open Office, and some history behind it |publisher=What-is-what.com |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several businesses sell the OpenOffice.org suite on auction websites such as [[eBay]], offering value-added services such as [[24/7]] [[technical support]], download mirrors, and CD mailing. One retail site, Open Office Anywhere, also offers the ability to run the suite using just a web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ooanywhere.com |title=Open Office Anywhere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 Everex, a division of [[First International Computer]] and the 9th-largest PC supplier in the U.S., began shipping systems preloaded with OpenOffice.org 2.2 into [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Sam's Club]] outlets in North America.

==Derivative software==
A number of open source and proprietary products [[Fork (software development)|derive]] from OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/DerivedWorks |title=Openoffice.org |publisher=Wiki.services.openoffice.org |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OpenOffice.org site also lists a large variety of complementary products, including [[groupware]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org_Solutions |title=Openoffice.org |publisher=Wiki.services.openoffice.org |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===StarOffice / Oracle Open Office ===
{{Main|StarOffice}}
OpenOffice.org inherited many features from the original StarOffice upon which it was based, including the [[OpenOffice.org XML]] file format which it retained until version 2, when the ISO/IEC standard [[OpenDocument]] Format (ODF) replaced it.

Sun subsidized the development of OpenOffice.org in order to use it as a base for its commercial [[proprietary software|proprietary]] StarOffice application software. Releases of StarOffice from version 6.0 were based on the OpenOffice.org source code, with some additional proprietary components, including the following:

* additional bundled fonts (especially [[CJK|East Asian language]] fonts)
* [[Adabas D]] database (the [[OoBase|OpenOffice database module]] does not use Adabas)
* additional document [[Template (word processing)|templates]]
* [[clip art]]
* sorting functionality for Asian versions
* additional file filters
* migration assessment tool (Enterprise Edition)
* macro migration tool (Enterprise Edition)
* configuration management tool (Enterprise Edition)

Following the acquisition of Sun by Oracle, ''StarOffice'' and ''StarSuite'' became known as Oracle Open Office for the 3.3 release. In April 2011, Oracle announced the discontinuation of Oracle Open Office as part of the decision to turn OpenOffice.org into a &quot;purely community-based project&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;oracle comm proj&quot;/&gt;

=== Go-oo ===
{{Main|Go-oo}}
On 2 October 2007, [[Michael Meeks (software developer)|Michael Meeks]] announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2007-10-02.html |title=Michael Meeks Activity Blog |publisher=Gnome.org |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and generated an answer by Sun's [[Simon Phipps (programmer)|Simon Phipps]] and Mathias Bauer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/date/20071003 |title=SunMink Blog |publisher=Blogs.sun.com |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sun.com/GullFOSS/entry/the_parrot_sketch_is_not |title=GullFOSS |publisher=Blogs.sun.com |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a derived OpenOffice.org work, under the wing of his employer [[Novell]], with the purpose of including new features and fixes that do not get easily integrated in the OOo-build [[Upstream (software development)|up-stream]] core. The work was called Go-oo, a name under which a set of patches for OO.o software has been available for five years. The new features, shared with Novell's edition of OOo, include:
* Support for [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] macros
* Faster start-up time
* Improved GTK theme handling (especially dark-colored)
* &quot;A [[Linear programming|linear optimization]] solver to optimize a cell value based on arbitrary constraints built into Calc&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go-oo.org/discover/#calc-solver |title=Discover Go-OO! |publisher=Go-oo.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multimedia content support in documents, using the [[gstreamer]] multimedia framework
* Support for [[Microsoft Works]] formats, [[WordPerfect]] graphics (WPG format) and T602 files imports
* Export for Office Open XML files such as docx, xlsx, pptx by using Novell OpenXML Converter&lt;ref name=&quot;Novell&quot;/&gt;

[[File:LibreOffice startcentre.png|thumb|300px|Start Centre in [[LibreOffice]]]]
On 28 September 2010, key members of the OpenOffice.org Project formed a new group called [[The Document Foundation]], and made available a rebranded fork of OpenOffice.org, provisionally named ''LibreOffice''. The Foundation stated that it will coordinate and oversee the development of LibreOffice.

Oracle was invited to become a member of the Document Foundation, and was also asked to donate the ''OpenOffice.org'' brand to the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.documentfoundation.org/contact/tdf_release.html OpenOffice.org Community announces The Document Foundation] Retrieved 28 September 2010 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Oracle declined this invitation and demanded that all members of the OpenOffice.org board involved with the LibreOffice project step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ryan|title=Oracle wants LibreOffice members to leave OOo council|url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/10/oracle-wants-libreoffice-members-to-leave-ooo-council.ars|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[OpenGroupware.org]] is a set of extension programs to allow the sharing of OpenOffice.org documents, calendars, address books, e-mails, [[instant messenger|instant messaging]] and blackboards, and to provide access to other [[collaborative software|groupware]] applications.
* A set of [[Perl]] extensions (available through the [[CPAN]]) allows external programs to process OpenOffice.org documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.cpan.org/search?query=OpenOffice&amp;mode=all |title=CPAN OpenOffice Perl extensions |publisher=Search.cpan.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These libraries do not use the OpenOffice.org API. They directly read or write the OpenOffice.org files using Perl standard file [[codec|compression/decompression]], XML access and [[UTF-8]] encoding modules.
