'''Ampache''' is a [[free software]] Web-based Audio file manager / web [[Media server|Media Server]]. The name is a play on the two words Apache and Amplifier. It was originally written to take advantage of Apache's Mod_mp3 but has since been adapted to use its own streaming method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Streaming the Ampache Way - PHPSO Magazine Article|url=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://es.phpsolmag.org/products/articleInfo/86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ampache's Mascot is a squirrel called [http://ampache.org/images/ampache-logo.png Fraz], originally drawn by Kirsten Petersen, later digitized by Ben Shields, and redesigned by AgnÃ¨s Champavier in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Logo|url=http://ampache.org/blog/index.php?/archives/47-Ampache-3.4-Stable-Released-and-a-new-Logo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== History ==
Ampache was released in 2001. Its original author, [[Scott Kveton]] went on to create the [[Open Source Lab|OSUOSL]] at [[Oregon State University]] and passed off Developmental lead to [[Karl Vollmer]] who has been responsible for it since early 2003.

== Development Goals ==
Ampache's goal is to allow access to a person's music from anywhere in the world. It is written specifically for private / small group implementations, but does allow an admin to enable public registration.  Ampache's primary objective is to maintain a simple, secure and fast web front end that will run on almost any hardware and any platform that supports PHP. It is also written to accommodate music collections in excess of 2 Terabytes. The largest known Ampache instance was in excess of 3 Terabytes of music{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

== Extensions / APIs ==
Ampache also provides an API for pulling out meta data in the form of XML documents.  There are many methods supported in the API in which to access Ampache data.  This was originally created for use with [[Amarok (software)|Amarok2]], but can also be used to create other front-ends to Ampache.  Access to the API is controlled by internal Access Control Lists and currently all requests have a 5000 result limit for performance reasons. The following applications are known to have plug-ins that use [http://ampache.org/wiki/dev:xmlapi Ampache's XML API]

==Ampache and Education==
Ampache's features make it a powerful [[instructional technology|instructional]] and [[assistive technology]] for students with [[language based learning disability|language-based learning differences]]. At [[Chelsea School]], a group of advanced technology students recognized Ampache's potential for providing important [[special education#Accommodations|accommodations]] and [[special education#Modifications|modifications]] that serve their learning styles; they built and configured an Ampache server that was put to work to enhance teaching and learning in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chelsea School Uses Ubuntu to Create VMampache|url=http://ampache.wordpress.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By recording audio editions of instructional-level texts and assignments and adding them to an Ampache catalog, the instructor empowers students to individually and independently listen to a [[streaming media|streaming]] text while following along with the print edition; used in this way, Ampache gives students access to instructional-level texts and curriculum material that may otherwise be inaccessible to them. Ampache thus serves as a compromise between three common accommodations: [[text to speech|text-to-speech]] software, a human reader, and [[audiobook]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNU High School: Teaching Kids by Contributing to Open Source|url=http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/gnu-high-school/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ampache's video-streaming features have also been used to enhance teaching and learning at [[Chelsea School]]. Rather than watching instructional material as a large group, students [[streaming media|streamed]] the assigned instructional videos independently from their individual workstations; independent viewing reduces distractions  while at the same time empowering students to progress at their pace, pause to take notes without explicit prompting, and to repeat segments as necessary to increase comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Sound Series: Part 3 - Ampache|url=http://opensource.com/life/10/7/open-sound-series-part-3-ampache}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Ampache has been featured in numerous online blogs and technical articles. One of the more notable was the O'Reilly book [[Spidering Hacks]] which tested the security of online applications. Ampache was found to be immune to standard spidering hacks as described in the O'Reilly article, and it has continued that trend by focusing on security during its development. The [http://ampache.org/wiki/dev:philosophy Code Philosophy] listed on Ampache's wiki specifically lists security as one of those most important considerations during application development.
