'''Microsoft Internet Explorer 5''' (abbreviated as '''IE5''') was a graphical [[web browser]] released in March 1999 by [[Microsoft]], primarily for [[Microsoft Windows]], but initially with versions available for [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[HP-UX]]. (See also [[Internet Explorer for Mac#Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition|Internet Explorer for Mac]], [[Internet Explorer for UNIX]])

It was one of the main participants of the first [[browser war]]. Its distribution methods and Windows integration were involved in ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]''. It was superseded by Microsoft [[Internet Explorer 6]] in August 2001, although IE5.x remains the last version for [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Windows NT 3.x]], and [[Windows 95]]. Version 5.0 was included with [[Windows 98 SE|Windows 98 Second Edition]] (using the [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident II]] layout), and 5.5 with [[Windows Me]] (Trident III) when they were introduced. The Mac edition came out in 2000 and was included with [[Mac OS X]], and the [[Tasman (layout engine)|Tasman]] layout engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Jan00/MacWorldIE5.asp | title=Microsoft Unveils Faster, Simpler and More Reliable Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition | date=January 5, 2000 | work=Microsoft press release | accessdate=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IE5 presided over a large market share increase over [[Netscape Navigator]] between 1999 and 2001, and offered many advanced features for its day. In addition, it was compatible with largest range of OS of all the IE versions. However, support for many OS quickly dropped off with later patches, and [[Windows XP]] and later Windows versions are not supported, because of inclusion of later IE.

The 1999 review in ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' noted, ''&quot;Credit the never-ending game of browser one-upsmanship that Netscape and Microsoft play. The new IE 5 trumps Netscape Communicator with smarter searching and accelerated browsing.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,9813/article.html Internet Explorer 5.0 Review, ''PC World'', 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 5 attained over 50% market share by early 2000, taking the lead over other browser versions including IE4 and Netscape.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2000/March/browser.php The Counter, March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 5.x versions attained over 80% market share by the release of IE6 in August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2001/August/browser.php The Counter, August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 5.0x and 5.5 were surpassed by [[Internet Explorer 6.0]], dropping it to the second most popular browser, with market share dropping to 34 percent by mid 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2003/August/browser.php The Counter, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, by early 2005 [[Firefox 1.0]] had overtaken it in market share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=74 Netscape's Market Share, March 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  Version 5.x market share fell below 1% by the end of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=93 Netscape's Market Share, December 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft spent over 100 million dollars ([[USD]]) a year &lt;ref name=&quot;victor&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.com/2009-1032-995681.html?tag=toc Victor: Software empire pays high price | CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1990s, with over 1000 people working on IE by 1999 during the development of IE5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html Memoirs From the Browser Wars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 5.x rendering behavior lives on in other browsers' [[quirks mode]]s.&lt;ref name=ArsTech8&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/ie8-super-standards-mode.ars Unpacking Internet Explorer 8's multiple rendering modes], Ars Technica.com&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer 5 is no longer available for download from Microsoft. However, archived 16- and 32-bit versions are publicly available on the Evolt.org browser archive.

== History ==
[[Image:Internet-explorer-usage-data.svg|thumb|right|300px|Usage share of Internet Explorer rose rapidly between its release in early 1999 to being replaced by IE6 in mid 2001;Graph from 1994 to 2009 for all versions of IE&lt;ref&gt;[[Usage share of web browsers]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The actual release of Internet Explorer 5 happened in three stages. Firstly, a Developer Preview was released in June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98 Second Edition. '''Version 5.01''', a bug fix version, was released in December 1999. [[Windows 2000]] includes this version. Version 5.0 was the last one to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. '''Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition''' had been released a few months earlier on March 27, 2000, and was the last version of Internet Explorer to be released on a non-Windows platform. '''Version 5.5''' for Windows was released in July 2000, bundled with [[Windows Me]] and 128-bit encryption but had no support for several older Windows.

A 1999 review of IE5 by Paul Thurrott described IE5 in ways such as, ''&quot;Think of IE 5.0 as IE 4.0 done right: All of the rough areas have been smoothed out..&quot;, &quot;....comes optionally bundled with a full suite of Internet applications that many people are going to find irresistible.&quot;, &quot;IE 5.0 is a world-class suite of Internet applications.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/ie5_1.asp Paul Thurotts's Supersite for Windows Internet Explorer 5.0 Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft ended all support for Internet Explorer 5.5, including security updates, on December 31, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifesupsps/ |title=Lifecycle Supported Service Packs |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microsoft continued to support Internet Explorer 5.01 on Windows 2000 SP4, according to its Support Lifecycle Policy however as with Windows 2000 this support was removed on July 13, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?LN=en-us&amp;x=11&amp;y=10&amp;p1=3071 Microsoft Product Lifecycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Internet explorer 5 - windows 3.11.jpg|thumb| Internet Explorer 5.0 under Windows 3.11]] --&gt;

'''Version 5.0''', launched on March 18, 1999, and subsequently included with [[Windows 98|Windows 98 Second Edition]] and bundled with [[Microsoft Office|Office 2000]], was a significant release that supported [[bi-directional text]], [[ruby character]]s, [[XML]], [[XSLT]] and the ability to save web pages in [[MHTML]] format. There was enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The first release of Windows 98 in 1998 had included IE4. However, Internet Explorer&amp;nbsp;5 incorrectly includes the padding and borders within a specified width or height; this results in a narrower or shorter rendering of a box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250395.aspx#cssenhancements_topic3 | title=CSS Enhancements in Internet Explorer 6 | author=Lance Silver | month=March | year=2001 | publisher=Microsoft | work=MSDN Library | accessdate=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Explorer box model bug|The bug]] was fixed in [[Internet Explorer 6]] when running in standards-compliant mode.

With the release of Internet Explorer 5.0, Microsoft released the first version of [[XMLHttpRequest]] (XHR), giving birth to [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] (even though the term &quot;Ajax&quot; was not coined until years later.) XMLHttpRequest is an [[Application programming interface|API]] that can be used by [[JavaScript]], and other [[Web browser]] [[scripting language]]s to transfer [[XML]] and other text data between a page's [[client (computing)|client side]] and [[server (computing)|server side]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajax.phpmagazine.net/2006/04/synchronous_versus_asynchronou.html Synchronous vs. Asynchronous] April 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and was available since the introduction of Internet Explorer 5.0&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/23/516393.aspx |title=Native XMLHTTPRequest object |accessdate=November 30, 2006 |last=Dutta |first=Sunava |date=January 23, 2006 |work=IEBlog |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is accessible via JScript, VBScript and other scripting languages supported by IE browsers. [[Windows Script Host]] was also installed with IE5, although later on viruses and malware would attempt to use this ability as an exploit, which resulted pressure to disable it for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norman.com/Virus/Articles/Articles_previous_years/25780/en Windows Script Host - disabling]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smart Offline Favorites]] feature was added to the [[Active Desktop]] component introduced in IE4.

An &quot;[[HTML Application]]&quot; (HTA) is a [[Microsoft Windows]] application written with [[HTML]] and [[Dynamic HTML]] and introduced with IE5. Internet Explorer 5.0 also introduced [[favicon]] support&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|title=How to Add a Shortcut Icon to a Web Page|work=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Script Host]], which provides scripting capabilities comparable to [[batch file]]s, but with a greater range of supported features.

'''Version 5.5''' followed in July 2000.  First released to developers at the 2000 [[Professional Developers Conference]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], then made available for download, version 5.5 focused on improved print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with [[Windows Me]]. Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption.  Although it is no longer available for download from Microsoft directly it can also be installed with MSN Explorer 6.0 as msnsetup_full.exe.  The full version of MSN Explorer can be downloaded only if you use Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 if Internet Explorer 5.5 has not yet been installed.  The full version will work on also Windows ME and Windows XP but you will need to download it on Windows 2000 or earlier and transfer the setup file to the newer operating system.  If you still want to download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.

Although newer browsers have been released, IE5 rendering mode continues to have an impact, as a 2008 Ars Technica article notes:
:IE5.5 (and below) was decidedly nonstandard in its rendering behavior. Hundreds of millions of web pages were written to look &quot;right&quot; in IE5.5's broken rendering. The result was something of a quandary for Microsoft when it came to release IE6. They wanted to improve the standards conformance in IE6, but could not afford to break pages dependent on the older behavior.

:The solution was the &quot;doctype switch&quot;. The doctype switch allowed IE6 to support both the old IE5.5 behaviorâ&quot;quirks mode&quot;âand new, more standards-conforming behaviorâ&quot;standards mode.&quot;&lt;ref name=ArsTech8 /&gt;

===''United States v. Microsoft''===
{{Main|United States v. Microsoft}}

On April 3, 2000, Judge Jackson issued his ''findings of fact'' that Microsoft had abused its monopoly position by attempting to &quot;dissuade Netscape from developing [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]] as a platform&quot;, that it &quot;withheld crucial technical information&quot;, and attempted to reduce Navigator's usage share by &quot;giving Internet Explorer away and rewarding firms that helped build its [[Usage share of web browsers|usage share]]&quot; and &quot;excluding Navigator from important distribution channels&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm ''U.S. v. Microsoft'': Court's Findings of Fact], May 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson also released a ''remedy'' that suggested Microsoft should be broken up into two companies. This remedy was overturned on appeal, amidst charges that Jackson had revealed a bias against Microsoft in communication with reporters. The findings of fact that Microsoft had broken the law, however, were upheld. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] announced on September 6, 2001 that it was no longer seeking to break up Microsoft and would instead seek a lesser antitrust penalty. Several months later the Department of Justice agreed on a settlement agreement with Microsoft. {{As of|2004}}, although nineteen states have agreed to the settlement, [[Massachusetts]] was still holding out.

===Adoption capability overview ===
Internet Explorer 5.0 is the last version to support [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Windows NT 3.x]], [[Windows NT 4.0]] (Service Pack 3 or later). Support for NT 3.x was dropped after that, as well as support for HP-UX, Solaris, Mac OS, and Mac OS X. [[Windows 2000]] was the last to support IE 5.0 (with which it was released) well after support in other Windows systems was deprecated. IE 5.5 SP2 is the last for [[Windows 95]]. In addition, users of Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0 SP6a, and Windows 2000 could upgrade to IE 6.0 SP1. IE5 was not developed for [[68k]] Macs, support for which had been dropped in Internet Explorer 4.5.
