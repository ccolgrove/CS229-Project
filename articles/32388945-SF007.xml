The '''International Organization for Standardization''' ({{lang-fr|'''Organisation internationale de normalisation'''}}, {{lang-rus|ÐÐµÐ¶Ð´ÑÐ½Ð°ÑÐ¾Ð´Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ð·Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¿Ð¾ ÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð´Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ð·Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð¸|r=Mezhdunarodnaya organizaciya po standartizacii}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;general_vocabulary&quot; /&gt; widely known as '''ISO''', is an [[international standard]]-setting body composed of representatives from various national [[standards organizations]]. Founded on February 23, 1947, the organization promulgates worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial [[International standard|standards]]. It has its headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=About_ISO/&gt;

==Name and abbreviation==
The organization's [[logo]]s in two of its official languages, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], include the word ''ISO'', and it is usually referred to by this short-form name. The organization says that ''ISO'' is not an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym or initialism]] for the organization's full name in either official language; rather, recognizing that its initials would be different in different languages, it adopted ''ISO'', based on the Greek word ''isos'' ({{Polytonic|á¼´ÏÎ¿Ï}}, meaning ''equal''), as the universal short form of its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of the founding delegates, Willy Kuert, recollected the original naming question with the comment &quot;I recently read that the name ISO was chosen because 'iso' is a Greek term meaning 'equal'. There was no mention of that in London!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague]]
The organization which today is known as ISO began in 1926 as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization focused heavily on [[mechanical engineering]]. It was disbanded in 1942 during the [[second World War]] but was re-organized under the current name, ISO, in 1946.

ISO is a voluntary organization whose members are recognized standard authorities, each one representing one country. The bulk of the work of ISO is done by the 2700 technical committees, subcommittees and working groups. Each committee and subcommittee is headed by a Secretariat from one of the member organizations.

==Financing==
ISO is funded by a combination of:&lt;ref&gt;

==International Standards and other publications==
{{See also|List of International Organization for Standardization standards}}

ISO's main products are the International Standards. ISO also publishes Technical Reports, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Corrigenda, and Guides.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004&quot;&gt;The ISO directives are published in two distinct parts:&lt;br /&gt;*
{{cite web

|accessdate=7 September 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710135001/http://www.iec.ch/tiss/iec/Directives-Part1-Ed5.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iso-directives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/directives |title=ISO/IEC Directives and ISO supplement |author=ISO |accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''International Standards'' are designated with the format ''ISO[/IEC] [/ASTM] [IS] nnnnn[-p]:[yyyy] Title'', where ''nnnnn'' is the number of the standard, ''p'' is an optional part number, ''yyyy'' is the year published, and ''Title'' describes the subject. ''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. The date and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard, and may under some circumstances be left off the title of a published work.

''Technical Reports'' are issued when &quot;a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that which is normally published as an International Standard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004&quot;/&gt; such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except ''TR'' prepended instead of ''IS'' in the report's name. Examples:
* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management
* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation â Metadata for construction documentation

''Technical Specifications'' can be produced when &quot;the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard&quot;. ''Publicly Available Specifications'' may be &quot;an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004&quot; /&gt; Both are named by convention similar to Technical Reports, for example:
* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation â Reference designation system â Part 1: General application rules
* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles â Roof load carriers

ISO sometimes issues a ''Technical Corrigendum''. These are amendments to existing standards because of minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or to extend applicability in a limited way. Generally, these are issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004&quot;/&gt;

''ISO Guides'' are meta-standards covering &quot;matters related to international standardization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004&quot; /&gt; They are named in the format ''&quot;ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title&quot;'', for example:
* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities â General vocabulary
* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification

==Standardization process==
A standard published by ISO/IEC is the last stage of a long process that commonly starts with the proposal of new work within a committee. Here are some abbreviations used for marking a standard with its status:&lt;ref name=&quot;about-mpeg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/about_mpeg.htm |title=About MPEG |publisher=chiariglione.org |accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iso-stages-codes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/stages_description/stages_table.htm#s90 |title=International harmonized stage codes |author=ISO |accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iso-stages&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/processes_and_procedures/stages_description.htm |title=Stages of the development of International Standards |author=ISO |accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acronyms-committees&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso27001security.com/html/faq.html#Acronyms |title=The ISO27k FAQ - ISO/IEC acronyms and committees |publisher=IsecT Ltd. |accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iso-directives-procedures&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/1st_Supplement.pdf |format=PDF |title=ISO/IEC Directives Supplement â Procedures specific to ISO |year=2007 |author=ISO |accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abbr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_list_abbreviations.htm |title=List of abbreviations used throughout ISO Online |year=2007 |author=ISO |accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;us-tag-committee&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sae.org/exdomains/standardsdev/global_resources/US%20TAG%20Committe%20Handbook%206March2008.doc |format=DOC |title=US TAG COMMITTEE HANDBOOK |date=2008-03 |author= |accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to omit certain stages, if there is a document with a certain degree of maturity at the start of a standardization project - for example a standard developed by another organization. ISO/IEC Directives allow also the so-called &quot;Fast-track procedure&quot;. In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS) if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso-stages&quot; /&gt;

The first step - a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g., SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] - ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a Working Draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g., MPEG) usually make open request for proposals - known as &quot;Call for proposals&quot;. The first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a Verification Model (VM) (previously also called a Simulation and Test Model). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a Working Draft (WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a Working Draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes Committee Draft (CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (National Bodies) for ballot.

The CD becomes Final Committee Draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes is above the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When it is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). The text is then submitted to National Bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard (FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard (IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO Central Secretariat which publishes it as the International Standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-mpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iso-stages&quot; /&gt;

==ISO document copyright==
ISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for copies of most. ISO does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before it becomes finalized as a standard. Some standards by ISO and its official U.S. representative (and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'s via the U.S. National Committee) are made freely available.&lt;ref&gt;

==Members==
[[Image:ISO Members.svg|450px|thumb|right|A map of standards bodies who are ISO members&lt;br&gt;Key:&lt;br&gt;{{legend|#008000|members}} {{legend|#C0C000|correspondent members}} {{legend|#FF0000|subscriber members}} {{legend|#000000|other places with an ISO 3166-1 code who aren't members of ISO}}]]

ISO has [[Countries in International Organization for Standardization|162 national members]],&lt;ref name=About_ISO/&gt; out of the [[List of sovereign states|204]] total countries in the world.

ISO has three membership categories:
* ''Member bodies'' are national bodies that are considered to be the most representative standards body in each country. These are the only members of ISO that have voting rights.
* ''Correspondent members'' are countries that do not have their own standards organization. These members are informed about ISO's work, but do not participate in standards promulgation.
* ''Subscriber members'' are countries with small economies. They pay reduced membership fees, but can follow the development of standards.

Participating members are called &quot;P&quot; members as opposed to observing members which are called &quot;O&quot; members.

==Products named after ISO==
The fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous has led, on occasion, to common use of &quot;ISO&quot; to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:
* Many [[CD image]]s end in the [[file extension]] &quot;[[ISO image|ISO]]&quot; to signify that they are using the [[ISO 9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system - hence CD images are commonly referred to as &quot;ISOs&quot;. Virtually all computers with [[CD-ROM]] drives can read CDs that use this standard. Some DVD-ROMs also use ISO 9660 file systems.
* Photographic film's sensitivity to light, its &quot;[[film speed]]&quot;, is described by [[ISO 6]], [[ISO 2240]] and [[ISO 5800]]. Hence, the film's speed is often referred to as its &quot;ISO number&quot;.
* Often, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras is called &quot;ISO shoe&quot;, as it was originally defined in ISO 518.

==ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1{{anchor|JTC1}}==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Java (programming language)]] --&gt;
{{Main|ISO/IEC JTC1}}
To deal with the consequences of substantial overlap in areas of standardization and work related to information technology, ISO and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] formed a Joint Technical Committee known as the ISO/IEC JTC1. It was the first such joint committee. The second joint committee was created in 2009 - Joint Project Committee - Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources - Common terminology (ISO/IEC/JTC 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=585141 |title=ISO/IEC/JTC 2 - Joint Project Committee - Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources - Common terminology |accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (&quot;Fast-track&quot; as used by [[OOXML]] and &quot;PAS&quot; as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC 29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing Convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1âs outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting 'standardization by corporation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Computer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] investor, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and Shuttleworth alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process ... ISO is an engineering old boys club and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion â¦ then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results. The process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate lobbying and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
