On April 15, 2010, Office 2010 was released to manufacturing. The suite became available for retail and online purchase on June 15, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;retail&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microsoftoffice2010.us/download-office-2010|title=Announcement: Office 2010 Available for Consumers Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office 2010 is the first version to require [[product activation]] for volume license editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficeVolumeActivation&quot;&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee624358.aspx Plan volume activation of Office 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Office 2010 marks the debut of free online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, which work in the web browsers [[Internet Explorer]], [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], but not [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]. Office Starter 2010, a new edition of Office, replaced the low-end home productivity software, [[Microsoft Works]].

Microsoft's update to its mobile productivity suite, [[Microsoft Office Mobile|Office Mobile 2010]], will also be released for Windows Phones running [[Windows Mobile|Windows Mobile 6.5]] and [[Windows Phone 7]]. In Office 2010, every application features the [[ribbon (computing)|ribbon]], including [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]], [[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher]], [[Microsoft InfoPath|InfoPath]], [[Microsoft SharePoint Workspace|SharePoint Workspace]] (previously known as Groove), and the new [[Office Web Apps]].

As of July 2011, more than 100 million licenses to Office 2010 have been sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficeLicenses&quot;&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-400-million-windows-7-and-100-million-office-2010-licenses-sold-and-more-partner-conference-stats/9988]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
Development started in 2007 while [[Microsoft]] was finishing work on Office 12, released as [[Microsoft Office 2007]]. The version number 13 was skipped because of the [[triskaidekaphobia|fear of the number 13]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Office 2010 FAQ | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/office/office2010_faq.asp | work=Paul Thurrott | publisher=Penton Media, Inc. | date=May 14, 2009 | accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously thought that Office 2010 (then called Office 14) would ship in the first half of 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;foley&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Office 14: Think first half of 2009 | url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=259 | work=Mary Jo Foley | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | date=February 14, 2007 | accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2009, screenshots of an Office 2010 [[Alpha test|alpha]] build were leaked by a tester.

On April 15, 2009, Microsoft confirmed that Office 2010 would be released in the first half of 2010. They announced on May 12, 2009, at a Tech Ed event, a trial version of the 64-bit edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10236813-56.html| title=Office 2010 preview program coming in July|first=Ina| last=Fried| date=May 11, 2009| accessdate=2010-06-04| publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confirmed: Office 2010 will come in 32-bit, 64-bit flavors|url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/04/confirmed-office-2010-will-come-in-32-bit-and-64-bit.ars| first=Emil| last=Protalinski| publisher=Ars Technica| date=April 14, 2009| accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Technical Preview 1 (Version: 14.0.4006.1010) was leaked on May 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.neowin.net/news/software/09/05/11/sign-up-for-the-office-2010-technical-preview-due-in-july | title=Sign up for the Office 2010 Technical Preview, due in July | last=Symons | first=Sam | work=Neowin.net | date=May 11, 2009 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An internal post-beta build was leaked on July 12, 2009. This was newer than the official preview build and included a &quot;Limestone&quot; internal test application.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpleak&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Office 2010 Build 14.0.4302.1000 Leaked |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Office-2010-Build-14-0-4302-1000-Leaked-116694.shtml | notes=The EULA indicates Beta 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13 Microsoft announced Office 2010 at its Worldwide Partner Conference 2009.

On July 14, 2009, Microsoft started to send out invitations on [[Microsoft Connect]] to test an official preview build of Office 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;tpconnect&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Microsoft kicks off Office 2010 Technical Preview |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |url=http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/07/14/microsoft-kicks-off-office-2010-technical-preview}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2009, the beta build 4417 was leaked on the internet via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tp-leak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Office 2010 Build 4417 Leaks|url=http://thetechnopath.com/microsoft-office-2010-build-4417-beta-1-leaked-screenshots/|date=2009-08-30|accessdate=2009-08-30|publisher=The Technopath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public beta has been available to subscribers of [[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]], [[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] and Microsoft Connect users as of November 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geeksmack.net/microsoft/810-microsoft-office-2010-public-beta-bits-available-on-msdntechnet.html ]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2009, the beta was officially released to the general public at the [http://www.microsoft.com/office2010 Microsoft Office Beta website], which was originally launched by Microsoft on November 11, 2009 to provide screenshots of the new office suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://technologizer.com/2009/11/18/microsoft-opens-up-the-office-2010-beta/ | title=Microsoft Opens Up the Office 2010 Beta | date=November 18, 2009 | first=Harry | last=McCracken | work=Technologizer | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office 2010 Beta was a free, fully functional version and expired on October 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/en/faqs/default.aspx#16q |title=Office Products - Microsoft Office |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to help customers and partners with deployment of Office 2010, Microsoft launched an Office 2010 application compatibility program with tools and guidance available for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/gray_knowlton/archive/2009/10/22/announcing-the-office-2010-application-compatibility-program.aspx |title=Announcing the Office 2010 Application Compatibility Program - Gray Matter - Site Home - TechNet Blogs |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 5, 2010, the official release candidate build 4734.1000 was available to Connect and MSDN testers. It was leaked to torrent sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Office-2010-RC-Build-4734-1000-Released-134098.shtml|title=Office 2010 RC Build 4734.1000 Released - To testers - Softpedia|publisher=News.softpedia.com|date=2010-02-04|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after, the [[Software_release_life_cycle#RTM|RTM]] Escrow build was leaked.

Microsoft announced the RTM on April 15, 2010 and that the final version was to have speech technologies for use with [[text to speech]] in [[Microsoft OneNote]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Outlook]], and [[Microsoft Word]]. Office 2010 was to be originally released to business customers on May 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/office2010/archive/2010/04/15/office-2010-reaches-rtm.aspx|title=Office 2010 Reaches RTM! - Microsoft Office 2010 Engineering - Site Home - TechNet Blogs|publisher=Blogs.technet.com|date=2010-04-16|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business customers with [[Microsoft Software Assurance|Software Assurance]] were able to get it since April 27, 2010 and other Volume Licensing Customers were able to get it since May 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/194444/office_2010_clears_last_hurdle_to_release.html?tk=nl_dnx_h_crawl|title=Office 2010 Clears Last Hurdle to Release - PCWorld Business Center |publisher=Pcworld.com|date=2010-04-16|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSDN and TechNet subscribers have been able to download the RTM version since April 22, 2010. The RTM version number was 14.0.4760.1000.

On June 15, 2010, Office 2010 was released to retail customers.

On November 17, 2010, Microsoft sent out invitations to a select number of testers at the Microsoft Connect portal to test a beta build of Office 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2010/11/17/microsoft-office-2010-sp1-beta-is-out-for-early-testing/|title=Microsoft Office 2010 SP1 beta is out for early testing|publisher=thenextweb.com|date=2010-11-17|accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final version was released to the public on June 28, 2011 with a version number of 14.0.6023.1000.

Office 2010 is more &quot;role-based&quot; than previous versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoworld&quot;&gt;Krill, Paul. &quot;Microsoft eyes 'people-ready' software.&quot;&lt;cite&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/cite&gt;, 5 April 2006. Accessed at http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/04/05/77167_HNwittssoftware2006_1.html on February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There are features tailored to employees in &quot;roles such as research and development professionals, sales people, and human resources.&quot; In its [[Internet]] implementation, Office 2010 incorporates features of [[SharePoint Server]] and borrows from &quot;[[Web 2.0]]&quot; ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;foley2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=194  |title=Microsoftâs Office 2007 team wants in on Web 2.0 |author=Mary Jo Foley |date=January 10, 2007 |work=All about Microsoft |publisher= |accessdate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft Office 2010 includes updated support for ISO/IEC 29500:2008, the International Standard version of [[Office Open XML]] (OOXML) file format.&lt;ref name=&quot;docx&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office]&lt;/ref&gt; Office 2010 provides read support for ECMA-376, read/write support for ISO/IEC 29500 Transitional, and read support for ISO/IEC 29500 Strict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179190.aspx Overview of the XML file formats in Office 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In its pre-release (beta) form, however, Office 2010 only supported the Transitional variant, and not the Strict.&lt;ref name=&quot;docx23&quot;&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/04/iso-ooxml-convener-microsofts-format-heading-for-failure.ars ISO OOXML convener: Microsoft's format &quot;heading for failure&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;docx22&quot;&gt;[http://www.adjb.net/post/Microsoft-Fails-the-Standards-Test.aspx Microsoft Fails the Standards Test]&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the ISO/IEC is to allow the removal of the Transitional variant from the ISO/IEC compliant version of the OOXML standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;docx22&quot;/&gt; Microsoft Office 2010 supports [[OpenDocument|OpenDocument Format (ODF)]] 1.1, which is an [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;docx&quot;/&gt;

New features also include a built-in screen capture tool, a background removal tool, a protected document mode, new SmartArt templates and author permissions. The 2007 &quot;Office Button&quot; was replaced with a menu button that leads to a full-window file menu, known as Backstage View, giving easy access to task-centered functions such as printing and sharing. A notable [[assistive technology|accessibility]] regression from 2007 is that the menu button scores worse with the [[Fitts's law]] accessibility calculation than previous versions. A modified [[ribbon (computing)|Ribbon]] interface is present in all Office applications, including Office [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]], [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]], [[Microsoft Project|Project]], and [[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher]]. Office applications also have functional [[jumplist]]s in [[Windows 7]], which would allow easy access to recent items and tasks relevant to the application.&lt;ref name=&quot;ribbon&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/feb08/02-05visio.mspx Microsoft Visio Conference Previews Upcoming New Features for Visio Users]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beingmanan.com/wp/2009/05/office-2010-new-features/ Office 2010: New Features]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/exec/steve/2007/10-30OPConferenceBallmer.mspx Microsoft Office Project Conference 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new feature in Microsoft Office 2010 is Outlook Social Connector, which allows users to connect to and receive updates from their [[social network]] inside Microsoft Outlook. When users view their emails a name, picture, and title is available for the person they are contacting. Upcoming appointments can also be viewed with this new feature and users can request friends. Outlook Social Connector currently supports [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], [[MySpace]] and [[Windows Live Messenger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Volume edition can be activated using a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) which is limited by the number of times a machine can activate when connected to Microsoft's servers,&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficeVolumeActivation&quot;/&gt; or using a Key Management Server (KMS) which requires activation every 180 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficeVolumeActivation&quot;/&gt;

==Editions==
===Trial Version===
The Office 2010 Trial&lt;ref&gt;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/try/&lt;/ref&gt; has an option to download the local install, however the default trial installs an App-V image like Office Starter 2010. The Applicatons Virtualization installer will create a Launcher and Office 2010 will run from a virtual drive letter &quot;Q:&quot; rather than installed in &quot;drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14&quot;. This drive letter is not visible in Windows Explorer. Many programs that rely on Windows apppath variable or program location (like Outlook autodiscover using CNAME record) will fail. &lt;!-- Same issue updating (paying for) trial or starter. This probably needs incorporation with main article. From personal experience supporting Exchange Online.  --&gt;

===Starter Edition===
Office Starter 2010 is an ad-supported product which includes ''Microsoft Word Starter 2010'' and ''Microsoft Excel Starter 2010''. These are reduced-functionality versions for viewing, editing, and creating documents. Office Starter 2010 is only available to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEM) for preloading on Windows PCs and is intended to replace [[Microsoft Works]]. It is only compatible with Windows Vista and Windows 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://pctechwise.com/featured/whats-new-in-microsoft-office-2010&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisements are displayed in the lower right area of the task pane. It also includes ''PowerPoint Viewer 2010'', to view and print PowerPoint slides and shows. Users who have Office Starter preinstalled are allowed to load it on a USB drive and run it temporarily on any computer to which the USB drive is connected.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnet-starter-3-mjf&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Office Web Apps===
{{Main|Office Web Apps}}
Microsoft now offers a free web-based version of its Office productivity suite, known as Office Web Apps, that started shortly before Office 2010 was released to retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/hosted/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211800059 Microsoft Office 14 To Include Web Apps]&lt;/ref&gt; Office Web Apps include online versions of [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]]. The web apps allow sharing and collaboration of documents and files and also feature user interfaces similar to their desktop counterparts. Office Web Apps were released to [[Windows Live Skydrive]] and SharePoint Workspace on June 2010. You may use the free web-based version of Office to create documents, and can download Office Viewers to view the documents on your system.
