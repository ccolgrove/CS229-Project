'''Indiana University of Pennsylvania''' (or '''IUP''') is a public university in [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Indiana County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]]. The university is {{convert|55|mi|km}} northeast of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. It is the largest university in the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]] (PaSSHE) and is the commonwealth's fifth largest university. It is governed by a local Council of Trustees and the Board of Governors of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petersons.com/ugchannel/code/InstVC.asp?inunid=6737&amp;sponsor=1 Peterson's, &quot;Four-Year Colleges, 2008.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; IUP has branch campuses at [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania|Punxsutawney]], [[Freeport, Pennsylvania|Northpointe]], and [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania|Monroeville]].

==History==
[[Image:IUP-Breezedale.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Breezedale Hall]]
IUP was conceived as '''Indiana Normal School''', first chartered in 1871 by Indiana County investors. The school was created under the Normal School Act, which passed the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] on 20 May 1857.&lt;ref&gt;John Edward Merryman, &quot;The Indiana Story 1875-1975:  Pennsylvania's First State University...&quot; Indiana Printing and Publishing Co., Indiana, Pennsylvania (1976), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Normal schools established under the act were to be private corporations in no way dependent upon the state treasury. They were to be &quot;state&quot; normal schools only in the sense of being officially recognized by the commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Merryman, &quot;The Indiana Story,&quot; p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school opened its doors in 1875 following the mold of the French ''Ecole Normale.'' It enrolled just 225 students. All normal school events were held within a single building which also contained a laboratory school for model teaching. Control and ownership of the institution passed to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1920.  In 1927, by authority of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, it became '''State Teachers College at Indiana''', with the right to grant degrees.  As its mission expanded, the name was changed again in 1959 to '''Indiana State College'''.  In 1965, the institution achieved [[university]] status and became Indiana University of Pennsylvania, or IUP.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Long Tradition&quot; available at [http://old.www.iup.edu/about_iup/a_long_tradition.htm IUP.edu] (29 Mar 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

IUP maintains a total enrollment of over 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students making it the largest school in the system and the only one elevated to doctoral granting status in PaSSHE's enabling legislation ''Pennsylvania Act 188 of 1982''.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania General Assembly, &quot;Act 188 of 1982.&quot; Available at: [http://www.passhe.edu/content/?/about/act188 PaSSHE.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Today IUP is classified as a ''Carnegie Doctoral/Research-Intensive'' university and is accredited by Middle States Association of Colleges and Universities, [[NCATE]], and [[AACSB]].&lt;ref&gt;Middle States Association of Colleges and Universities, &quot;Statement of Accreditation Status.&quot; Available at: [http://www.msche.org/ MSCHE.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Eberly College of Business and Information Technology
*College of Education and Educational Technology 
*College of Fine Arts
*College of Health and Human Services 
*School of Graduate Studies and Research
*College of Humanities and Social Sciences 
*College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics

Robert E. Cook Honors College was founded to offer a seminar style, discourse-based liberal studies curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Selingo, Jeffrey. &quot;Mission Creep? More regional state colleges start honors programs to raise their profiles and attract better students.&quot; The Chronicle of Higher Education (31 May 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:suttonhall.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Postcard depicting [[John Sutton Hall]] at Indiana Normal School.]]
IUP's {{convert|374|acre|km2|adj=on}} main campus is a mix of 63 old and new red brick structures.  Its original building, a Victorian structure named [[John Sutton Hall]] once housed the entire school. Today Sutton Hall is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;&quot;National Register Listed and NHL Properties,&quot; Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission Bureau for Historic Preservation (2 Jan 2007), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands at the heart of campus&amp;mdash;there was a fight to preserve it in 1974 when the administration scheduled it for demolition.&lt;ref&gt;Himler, Jeff. &quot;IUP has grown from its 'Normal' roots.&quot; Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (28 Jan 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, today it houses many administrative offices and reception areas.  [[Breezedale|Breezedale Alumni Center]] is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The Victorian mansion was once home to a Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;arch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = &quot;National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania&quot;| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H000647_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Breezedale| accessdate = 2011-12-04| author = Robert C.

[[Image:IUP-OakGrove.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The Oak Grove looking towards Stapleton Library during summer.]]

The campus boasts a [[planetarium]], University Museum, black box theater, recently renovated Hadley Union Building (HUB), extensive music library, and a newly remodeled Cogswell Hall for the university's music community.  Stapleton Library boasts 900,000-plus bound volumes and over 2 million microform units.&lt;ref&gt;IUP Institutional Research, &quot;IUP Trendbook, 2005-06.&quot; Table F-3 Library Holdings. [http://www.iup.edu/planning-analysis/IR/trendbook/Table%20F%20-%203.pdf IUP.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of campus is the Oak Grove.  Many alumni recall this spot because of its centrality and the many events that occur there.  In January 2000 former President Lawrence K. Pettit established a board to create the Allegheny Arboretum at IUP.  This group works to furnish the Oak Grove with flora native to the region.&lt;ref&gt;Steback, Meredith Ann. &quot;IUP to be site of area arboretum,&quot; The Penn (25 June 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The university also operates an Academy of [[culinary art|Culinary Arts]] in Punxsutawney and a [[police academy]] at its main campus.

The university's Student Cooperative Association also owns College Lodge several miles from campus.  It provides skiing, biking, hiking, and [[disc golf]]ing opportunities.  Boat access is also made available through the Cooperative Association.

Over the last five years, IUP has demolished most of the 1970 era dormitories on campus.  Demolition began during summer 2006 and facilities are being replaced with modern suites. Construction is ongoing with at least seven new dormitories completed for the fall 2009 semester.  Two more suite style buildings were completed by the fall of 2010. That semester, the ribbon cutting ceremony at Stephenson Hall was considered to have finished the four-year long &quot;residence hall revival&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepenn.org/news/ribbon-cutting-declares-project-complete-1.1678663&lt;/ref&gt;These suite style rooms are similar to those being built at other universities in PaSSHE.&lt;ref&gt;Shackner, Bill. &quot;IUP betting on upscale housing for students,&quot; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (10 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alma mater==
To our noble Alma Mater's name, we, her children sing a joyful lay, &lt;br&gt;
and to her a new allegiance pledge, that lives beyond a day.

'''Chorus:'''

Sing, oh sing! Our Alma Mater's praise. Hail, oh hail! Her color's gleaming hue. &lt;br&gt;
Give to her our homage and our love, and to her name be true.

A pray'r for her who sheltr'd us, a hope no child her name will stain, &lt;br&gt;
a cheer thrice giv'n with hearty voice, and now the sweet refrain.

Of loyalty are symbols twain, her colors crimson and the gray, &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Dear Indiana Mother Fair,&quot; the burden of our lay.
