Developed by [[EA Canada]], it was published by Electronic Arts worldwide under the [[EA Sports]] label. It was released on 28 September 2010 in [[North America]], 30 September 2010 in [[Australia]], and 1 October 2010 in [[Europe]] for all platforms, except the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. The Wii version was released on 1 October 2010 in North America and Europe and the DS version on 8 October 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;releasedates&quot;&gt;[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/254712/fifa-11-release-date-confirmed/ FIFA 11 release date confirmed], computerandvideogames.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Personal computer|PC]] version of ''FIFA 11'' is the first in the series to use the same [[game engine]] as the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Commentary is provided by [[Martin Tyler]] and [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]]. The game generated largely positive reviews, and was awarded 'Sports Game of the Year' at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]] after a record-breaking 2.06 million votes.

== New features ==
* '''Next Gen Gameplay Engine (PC)''': The game engine that is used for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game will now be used also on the PC.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcnextgen&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100828084857/http://www.easportsfootball.co.uk/news/item/file/FIFA-11-PC-More-Details EA Football World], More PC Details Confirmed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcnextgen_2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.easportsfootball.co.uk/news/item/file/FIFA-11-PC-Announcement | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100821011046/http://www.easportsfootball.co.uk/news/item/file/FIFA-11-PC-Announcement | archivedate=2010-08-21 | title=FIFA 11 PC Goes Next-Gen! | date=8 July 2010 | accessdate=29 August 2010 | publisher=EA Sports Football World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the &quot;Two Button&quot; control system, introduced in the 2010 FIFA World Cup game has carried through to FIFA 11, making it ideal for novices and new players to the series.
* '''FIFA World (PC)''': This will allow the player to customize their online avatar, compete with players from all over the world and fight for positions on the leaderboard.
* '''PC Improvements''' : Next-gen menu presentation is used. Manager mode from console version of FIFA 10 has been imported with some improvements. Be a pro seasons have been completely revamped. There is a new practice arena which can be accessed when exiting a game mode. There is a new 5 v 5 online team play and Pro Club Championship. Further, there is the all new Virtual Pro game mode. Players can create their game face on the official web site then download it and apply it to their virtual pro in game. 360Â° dribbling is also featured along with LAN play. Players can also create tactics themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;pc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/intl/football/fifa/pc |title=EA SPORTS FIFA 12 PC &amp;#124; Details &amp;#124; EA SPORTS Football |publisher=Ea.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pro Passing (PS3, Xbox 360)''': is a new passing system where the gamer's own accuracy with the control pad, as well as the situation and skills of the players on the pitch, determines the accuracy of each pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;announcement&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100715145045/http://www.easportsfootball.co.uk/news/item/file/FIFA-11-Announced FIFA 11 Announced!], easportsfootball.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Creation Centre  (PS3, Xbox 360)''': is a new web-based application which allows the user to create material to download to their console and share with their friends. Created teams, names, kits, and players can be customised and players can be edited in a more in-depth way than before. Create a player by choosing his appearance, accessories and attributes. You may also create players and edit squads on the console itself, but to create a team you must use the Creation Centre web-based application.

[[File:FIFA 11 2010 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|An in-game screenshot highlighting the improved Career Mode.]]

*'''Career Mode  (PS3, Xbox 360, PS2, PSP, NDS)''': &quot;Be a Pro Mode&quot; and &quot;Manager Mode&quot; have been merged into the new &quot;Career Mode&quot;, where the player can choose to be a player, manager, or player-manager for over 15 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/FIFA-11/feature-15499.html |title=FIFA 11 - David Rutter Q&amp;A Feature |publisher=Totalvideogames.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many improvements have been made to Career Mode, one being that when signing new players, the user will have to agree to a transfer fee with the club, as well as other personal demands from the player; the club could also agree a fee with two teams for a player. The board of a club can decide to give the manager a contract extension or not; this will depend on certain objectives being met, or if they feel that the user has potential as a manager. The manager reputation rating is still in the game and will go up or down depending on your efforts. Regular emails will appear from the coach telling the user about player growth, and if a player is gaining or losing overall rating, the coach will also tell the user about players that are hitting form and will suggest the user include them in the starting line up for the next match, or give them a little more responsibility. On the player growth screen, the user will also get comments from the coach, such as &quot;has reached his potential,&quot; &quot;isn't going to grow anymore,&quot; or &quot;could develop quickly if given game time.&quot; A new budget allocator has also been implemented, where the player can adjust the slider to whatever they desire, whether it will be a 80/20 split with Â£50 million to spend and Â£200K wage budget, or a 60/40 split, where that may be Â£40 million to spend and Â£250K wage budget. This gives some flexibility if the user is trying to buy specific players but does not have the wages to cover it, or does not need the wages and wants more free cash. There is a limit, however; when doing this, the user will get the notification that this is only available three times per season, so the player must make their decisions wisely. It is also now possible to view results and standings from other leagues around the world, following a similar feature that was on the official 2010 FIFA World Cup game. It still is not possible to manage an international team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100819035827/http://fifa.easports.com/enGB/news.action?id=DiggingDeeperCareerMode |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Street Football (Wii, NDS)''': Players can now play 5 vs. 5 street football, as well as the traditional 11 vs. 11. Each street player has a distinctive style of play with unique abilities to match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/fifa-11-has-street-mode-on-wii FIFA 11 has Street mode on Wii], eurogamer.net&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Goalkeeper Intelligence (All Platforms)''': Goalkeepers now have more urgency and better perception of where to intercept loose balls, resulting in a more responsive and powerful rushing system. Goalkeepers are now more agile and can make more impressive saves. New animation warping technology provides game-realistic goalkeeper positioning and momentum, resulting in more varied scoring opportunities.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA 11&quot;&gt;[http://store.origin.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&amp;SiteID=eaemea&amp;Locale=en_GB&amp;ThemeID=850300&amp;Env=BASE&amp;productID=195181400 FIFA 11], eastore.ea.com&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Be a Goalkeeper (PS3, Xbox 360, PS2, PSP, NDS)''': EA Sports released a ''FIFA 11'' trailer with the slogan &quot;We Are 11.&quot; The trailer confirmed that it's possible to play as a goalkeeper in ''FIFA 11'', and it is also possible to play 11 vs. 11 online matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/260344/fifa-11-has-be-a-goalkeeper-mode/ FIFA 11 has Be A Goalkeeper mode], computerandvideogames.com&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Manual Leaderboard''': It has been confirmed that there will be a separate leaderboard this year for players that use the manual control setup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forums&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100908101847/http://forums.electronicarts.co.uk/17176757-post103.html EA Forums], Gary Paterson on EA Forums&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Improved Celebrations (PS3, Xbox 360)''': Celebrations will now use the in-game camera rather than separate cutscenes. It is also confirmed that teammates can now join in celebrations. Also, only more skilled or acrobatic players can perform the more acrobatic celebrations, such as a back flip. ''FIFA 11'' also includes players' signature celebrations, which they can perform with a simple push of a button.&lt;ref name=&quot;BackPage&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100818022452/http://www.ea.com/uk/news/the-backpage-fifa-11-update?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_content=Twitter Fifa 11 Update], The Backpage&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''360Â° Dribbling (PS3, Xbox 360, PC)''': True 360Â° dribbling system will provide finer dribbling control, enabling players to find space between defenders that previously was not possible.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ea.com/au/football/fifa/psp], The Backpage&lt;/ref&gt;

== iOS version ==
''FIFA 11'' for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices features improved graphics and compatibility with the [[iPhone 4]] and 4th generation [[iPod touch]]'s retina displays. The game is compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, 3rd and 4th generation iPod touch, and a recent version came out for the iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fifa-11-by-ea-sports-for-ipad/id408895052?mt=8 |title=FIFA 11 by EA SPORTSâ¢ for iPad for iPad on the iTunes App Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still plagued with crashes, particularly since the upgrade to iOS 5.0, which means it cannot run on current iPads.

''FIFA 11'' has been positively received with [[IGN]] UK rating it 9.5 out of 10&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Robinson&quot;/&gt; and [[PlayStation Official Magazine|''Official PlayStation Magazine'' (UK)]] rating it a 10/10, the first game in the series to be given a full score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=computerandvideogames.com Tom Pakinkis |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/265349/fifa-11-review-10/10-in-opm/ |title=PS3 News: FIFA 11 review - 10/10 in OPM |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=2010-09-19 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]] rated it 8/10 summing up, &quot;At its best FIFA 11 is enormous fun and brilliantly engineered, but in its battle to be more varied and realistic it has lost some of its momentum, and off the pitch returns are starting to diminish too&quot;.

As of October 2011, 16 million copies of the game have been sold across all platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/fifa-soccer-12/news/6342616/battlefield-3-ships-10-million|title=Battlefield 3 ships 10 million|author=Tom Magrino|date=2011-10-27|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ultimate Team ==
Following on from previous ''FIFA'' games, ''FIFA 11'' Ultimate Team was released on PS3 and Xbox 360 on 3 November 2010. It is available for free download from the [[PlayStation Store]] or [[Xbox Live Marketplace]]. In the game itself, players purchase packs of cards with in-game money. These packs contain random players and other items, such as balls and kits, and players have to win football matches in order to earn coins, to purchase new players. There are other ways to make money, such as buying players cheaply and selling them on for a higher price. Also, with Microsoft points on the Xbox 360 you can buy packs of bronze, silver or gold players, staff and items. Returning users to Ultimate Team receive two complimentary Gold packs. It has been praised for its creativity, and likeness to [[eBay]], in that it has live auctions, where player items needed from other players. This has also been likened to the real life Football market, where other managers are constantly trying to outbid each other for the best players and staff. Also, people could play their friends in this new friend mode. Players can be found in packs according to their real life transfers, for example the Fernando Torres Chelsea card appeared in packs after he was transferred from Liverpool or the Edin Dzeko transfer from Wolfsburg to Man City. These updates can be useful for the chemistry side of the game, allowing new partnerships, for example if you have a Dzeko card from before the transfer, when he was at German club Wolfsburg, then he would have no chemistry with Manchester City players such as Tevez or Yaya and Kolo Toure. However if you have a post-transfer card, with Man City as his club, then he will link up with the Man City players as well as other Premier League players. He will lose all Bundesliga connections as well, so he would not connect with his old teammate at Wolfsburg, Grafite, or anybody else at the Bundesliga. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/267181.page |title=EA Forums |publisher=Forum.ea.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
