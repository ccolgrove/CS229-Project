However, when she arrives at the Pub, she finds Sami's son there, and he confronts Ari with what she is doing to his mother. Arianna becomes upset and runs out of the Pub, and ends up getting hit by a car and being the victim of a hit-and-run accident. She is taken to the hospital and undergoes emergency surgery. After the surgery, EJ visits in order to share her findings. Unfortunately, she suffers cardiac arrest.

After Max and Chelsea break up, Stephanie and Max date for a short time. After a racing accident, Max breaks up with Stephanie and she leaves town for a job in Ohio.

Stephanie returns to Salem as a rebellious former race car driver with a new sexy wardrobe, on April 20, 2007, due to Steve's mental and medical conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephanie Johnson Bio&quot; /&gt; She becomes a flight attendant, along with Chelsea, for a private airline, ''Touch the Sky Airlines'', run by her boyfriend, [[Jeremy Horton]], and Jett Carver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephanie Johnson Bio&quot; /&gt; Jeremy shows his abusive side numerous times, including grabbing her by her arms, yelling at and degrading her, and holding her head under water in a hot tub, when she &quot;upsets&quot; him. [[Max Brady]] saves her on August 15, 2007, when a passenger on a plane threatens her.
She and Max Brady share a kiss on August 16, 2007, in a hot tub, which leads to them almost making love. After Max discovers that Jeremy's business involves smuggling girls into the country to be escorts, Stephanie tries to help him save the girls, but in a shocking twist, the girls want to stay. Max and Stephanie are held at gunpoint and forced to jump out of a plane. Luckily they both have parachutes, and land in a forest. Taking shelter in a nearby cave, the two have time to talk about how they feel about each other. In the heat of the moment, and possibly fearing they won't be found, the two give in to their passion and nearly make love, until Bo and Kayla find them and bring them home. Stephanie and Jeremy eventually break up, shortly before he leaves town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephanie Johnson Bio&quot; /&gt;

Stephanie decides to try to get over Jeremy and Max and decides to sign up for school with Chelsea, at Salem University. The two join a sorority, Alpha Chi Theta (ÐÐ¥Î), and make friends with the president, Morgan Hollingsworth, and a girl named Cordy. Stephanie and Chelsea come up with a plan to have an auction at the Cheatin' Heart, where they will auction off guys as dates to the girls in the sorority. Cordy wins a date with Ford Decker, and Morgan wins a date with Max, much to Stephanie's dismay. Max and Morgan begin to date.
Chelsea's mother, [[Billie Reed]], and Jett Carver are on-campus security. One night, during a party, Billie and Jett inform Chelsea, Stephanie, Max and Morgan that there has been a rape on campus. During this time Cordy becomes distant and decides to leave school. Stephanie and the girls try to help her and figure out what happened. Cordy's date, Ford Decker, becomes more and more obnoxious as he hits on every girl in front of him, and Cordy screams in fear when he touches her arm. This leads Chelsea to believe that something has happened to Cordy at Ford's hands. On another night, Stephanie sees more and more of how close Max and Morgan are getting. Unable to watch any longer, she leaves the party and goes to talk to her parents. Meanwhile, Chelsea is abducted by a man that wants the two boys that [[Nick Fallon]], Chelsea's boyfriend, is caring for. Luckily she is saved. On Halloween night, the sorority throws a party. Chelsea and Stephanie again try to talk to Cordy about what happened. Finally, she breaks down and admits that she had been raped by Ford Decker. Stephanie runs from the room in tears while Chelsea comforts Cordy. Max sees a girl at the party, named Ashley, who looks bruised and disheveled. She tells him that Ford had gotten &quot;rough&quot; with her. Morgan, meanwhile, offers to drive a drunk Ford home. Before leaving, Ford drugs Morgan's drink, and Morgan later passes out in Ford's room. Ford takes advantage of this and takes her to his bed, where he tries to rape her. Luckily, Max and Jett, who see a live feed from Ford's webcam, manage to get to his room in time and stop him from raping Morgan. It is also at the time that Stephanie begins having visions of being on a bed, and a man standing over her undressing. She believes that she may have been raped the night she left the party, though she isn't sure and doesn't know who her attacker is. Ford Decker threatens Stephanie on two occasions, once at The Cheatin' Heart, going so far as to shatter a glass bottle and threaten her with it; the second when he goes to her parents' hotel suite yelling at her and states not to tell anyone about their night together.

Stephanie confides in her mother about the rape but is insistent that Steve, her father, not find out because he would kill Ford Decker. Later on, the girls of the sorority come up with a plan to get Ford to confess and get it on tape. Things go badly when Chelsea ends up drugged. Ford, trying to go after Chelsea. falls down the stairs and dies. The girls, along with Max Brady, bury Ford in the basement. Ford's father finds out about this and tries to have everyone involved brought up on charges. They are subsequently dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephanie Johnson Bio&quot; /&gt;

After dealing with the Ford Decker issue, Stephanie moves on to get an internship with [[Anna DiMera]], and starts dating [[Max Brady]]. Her parents welcome their new son Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Johnson into the family, making her a big sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephanie Johnson Bio&quot; /&gt; Soon after Max goes to France to locate his half sister Melanie, Stephanie soon follows him. They are arrested after Melanie claims that they are harassing her but is soon let out. Max and Stephanie break up after Max's biological father is murdered, and Stephanie believes that his sister, Melanie was to blame. It turns out that [[Nick Fallon]], who is in love with Melanie, murdered him out of defense of Melanie. In November, Stephanie goes to work for [[Philip Kiriakis]] at Titan. The two become close, much to Melanie's dismay. But in February 2009 Stephanie ends her relationship with Philip after seeing him kissing Melanie. It is later revealed that Philip only kissed Melanie for business, but Stephanie still breaks up with Philip after seeing his competitive side. Philip tries to get her back and the two reconcile for a brief time. But, Stephanie breaks up with Philip for good when she learns that he had slept with Melanie during one of the periods when he and Stephanie were on a break.

Before arriving in Salem, Dr. Jonas worked at various hospitals around the world. He was also instrumental in getting one hospital in Switzerland to &quot;go green.&quot; While working at another hospital, he met and fell in love with a cancer patient, by the name of Rebecca. Though he knew her diagnoses was grim, Daniel married Rebecca and was determined to save her. However, her cancer proved to be too advanced and she died in Daniel's arms. Sometime in early 1990, Daniel had an affair with [[Carly Manning|Dr. Carly Manning]] and Carly would later introduce him to Rebecca.

Dr. Daniel Jonas is brought to town by his godfather, [[Victor Kiriakis]] to deal with his son [[Bo Brady|Bo]]'s illness. After performing a live donor transplant on Bo, with the donor being his daughter, [[Chelsea Brady|Chelsea]], chief of staff, [[Lexie Carver]] offers Daniel a permanent job at the hospital. Originally, Daniel isn't interested in being a relationship because he is still so hurt from losing Rebecca, Chelsea is very persistent. The two soon start dating, despite the age difference. When Daniel was serving as Chelsea's doctor, he had a one night stand with her grandmother, [[Kate Roberts]], and they decide that no one can find out. However, Chelsea soon learned the truth and ended her relationship with Daniel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC-Daniel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/bios/shawn-christian/|title=Dr. Daniel Jonas|publisher=NBC.com/Days of our Lives|date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, Kate learned that she had lung cancer which leads to her and Daniel getting close again. Daniel worked hard to cure Kate, and even performed surgery with [[Chloe Lane]] as the donor. Kate's surgery was a success and Daniel soon developed feeling for Chloe who at the time was dating engaged to [[Lucas Horton]], Kate's son. After one night of passion, Chloe pushes Daniel away hoping to work things out with Lucas. Kate witnesses their affair and poisons Chloe in an attempt to kill her; Kate also frames Daniel for the crime. Daniel saves Chloe's life and tapes Kate's confession. The near death experience brought Daniel and Chloe even closer together, and they decided to have a real relationship, after Chloe broke up with Lucas. The two would later become engaged and had dreams of starting a family.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC-Daniel&quot;/&gt; 

In the fall of 2009, Daniel is shocked to see his old friend Dr. Carly Manning in Salem. Daniel befriends [[Melanie Layton]] who doesn't really seem to like Carly.

They soon marry on October 14, 2010. A few weeks later, Chloe gives birth to a baby boy, and names him Parker in honor of Daniel's mother's maiden name. At Parker's christening, everyone is shocked when [[Caroline Brady]] reveals that she had changed the test results to keep Melanie from leaving Philip, and ruing her granddaughter [[Stephanie Johnson|Stephanie's]] relationship with [[Nathan Horton]]. Daniel is devastated and files for divorce in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/episode-guide/season-46/273058/wednesday-031611/episode-11546/332622/ |title=Wednesday-03/16/2011|author= |date=2011-03-16|work= |publisher=NBC-Days of our Lives|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She soon learns that he is Maggie's grandson and that he is moving in. They have a flirty relationship and the two agree to a date. However, Nathan soon realizes who Melanie is (he blames her for everything that happened to Nick) and he tells her he doesn't want anything to do with her. Nathan argues with Maggie over why Maggie would let Melanie stay there. Nathan feels guilty and reconciles with Melanie after he realizes that everything that happened with Nick wasn't her fault.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Melanie overhears the two making plans to hang out. Melanie then storms out. Nathan doesn't feel guilty about what happened, saying he and Stephanie did nothing wrong. Once again, Nathan and Melanie reconcile.

When Melanie tells Nathan she wants to be more than friends he says no because he believes he has too much on his plate and Melanie might be a distraction.

Soon, Stephanie takes Philip back and Melanie is heartbroken when he begs her not to tell Stephanie.

'''Claire Brady''' is a character on the [[United States|American]] [[soap opera]] [[Days of our Lives]]. She was previously portrayed by [[identical twins]] Olivia and Ava White from January 2006 to December 2007 and [[Alina Foley]] in 2008.

Claire is born in St. Luke's Catholic Church, delivered by her maternal grandmother [[Marlena Evans]] and [[Lexie Carver]]. She is the daughter of [[Shawn-Douglas Brady|Shawn]] and [[Belle Black|Belle Brady]] and the granddaughter of [[Bo Brady|Bo]] and [[Hope Williams|Hope Brady]] and [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John]] and [[Marlena Evans|Marlena Black]]. At the time of her birth, it is not known that Shawn was her father. A little after Thanksgiving, Claire becomes sick for an unknown reason. Belle and [[Philip Kiriakis|Philip]] rush baby Claire to the hospital where she is hospitalized and eventually her liver fails and she is given last rites. In a horrible twist of fate, Claire's biological uncle, Zack who was only 5 at the time, dies in a hit-and-run. Zack's liver is a perfect match for little Claire and she receives his liver when he dies. Near her first birthday, the truth about her paternity is revealed.

Philip leaves Salem, and Shawn is ready to spend time with his daughter, but Belle turns him down. She tells him that he needs to straighten up his life before he can spend time with Claire. Just as he is straightening out, Philip returns, demanding full custody of Claire. Belle and Shawn plan, (along with [[Max Brady|Max]] and [[Mimi Lockhart|Mimi]]), to kidnap little Claire from Philip. They do and Belle, Shawn, and Claire soon leave for Canada. Once in Canada, they stay in a shelter until [[Chelsea Brady|Chelsea]] and [[Nick Fallon|Nick]] come with more money for them. After the retrieval of the money, they soon stow away on a cruise ship that is heading for Australia. However, Philip is able to catch up with them on the cruise ship. They escape and jump ship with Claire in their arms. They soon land on a deserted island. They need to get off that island quickly, because Claire has cut her finger on Shawn's knife and has blood poisoning. Shawn build a raft and they soon land safely on an island called &quot;Tinda Lao.&quot;

Luckily, that island has inhabitants, including Gabby and her father Duck who owned a local hotel. Claire receives the medicine she needs and they stay. Philip catches up to them, but Gabby lies and finally convinces Philip that they are not there. Soon, Philip discovers that Belle, Shawn and Claire are still on the island and confronts them. Duck comes out while the group is talking and shoots Shawn in the arm. In the midst of the chaos Gabby hands Claire to Philip who makes a run to get off the island on a boat. Shawn isn't seriously injured and he tells Belle to take off after Philip before he gets to far. Belle is able to catch up with Philip and tries to talk some sense into him, that all four of them could be a family. Meanwhile, Shawn is back the hotel being bandaged when Bo and [[Steve Johnson (Days of our Lives)|Steve]] show up. Shawn runs off to track down Philip, Belle and Claire, but he is still shaky from the gun shot wound but he manages to find them. Shawn collapses from his wound and Philip tells Belle that she could stay, or leave with him on the boat. Belle reluctantly goes with Philip, but tells Shawn &quot;God Punishes Sinners&quot; leaving Shawn confused.

After Philip and Belledisappear from sight, Bo shows up and finds Shawn. Shawn tells Bo what Belle kept saying but he didn't understand why. The two head back to the hotel where Gabby puts together GPS out of God Punishes Sinners. Bo, Steve and Shawn all get on the helicopter Bo and Steve had flown to the island on and locate Philip's boat. Shawn is dropped on to the boat. Philip easily discovers Shawn and the two go down below since a typhoon is heading their way. During the storm the three adults talk again and Philip comes around to realize that all three could provide Claire with the home she needs. The storm is getting worse and eventually hits the boat tearing it to pieces. The rescue crew is able to save Philip, Belle and Shawn, but Claire is lost at sea.

The rescue squad search for Claire, but change the mission to recovery, devastating Belle who insists that her daughter is alive, especially when she is visited by her father, John, who is still in a coma. Soon after, Claire's life jacket is recovered, apparently cut with a knife. They relist Claire as missing, and soon track her to a baby beauty pageant called &quot;USADORABLE&quot;. It is revealed that a woman by the name Evelyn Quarry had found Claire and brought her back to the States and began entering her in beauty pageants as a boy. Evelynâs scam comes to a crashing halt when Belle is able to locate her daughter at the hotel the beauty pageant had been held at by singing her favorite song.

'''Grace Rafaela Brady''' is the biological daughter of a young teenage mother, Mia McCormick and her ex-boyfriend Chad Peterson Woods, born on-screen on January 27, 2009.

She is believed to be the biological daughter of [[E.J. DiMera]] and [[Sami Brady]] until her adoptive father, Rafe Hernandez, reveals the truth to her legal mother, Sami Brady on November 12, 2009.

[[Sami Brady]] and [[Nicole Walker]] are both pregnant with E.J. DiMera's babies. Nicole miscarries but pretends to still be pregnant. She plans to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J. Mia and Sami give birth on the same day. Nicole delivered Mia's baby and immediately falls in love with her, but she switches it with Sami's baby so that she and E.J. will be raising a child that is biologically his.

Sami, who is forced to enter the witness protection program during her pregnancy, decides to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she leaves Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brings Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her &quot;adopted&quot; daughter. The same day she makes Rafe, her former bodyguard and now lover, Grace's godfather. The baby is christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.

Grace dies on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. The people who saw themselves as her parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother Mia.

Lexie falls deeper and deeper in love with her newborn baby, and when she learns that Stefano had switched the babies at birth, it devastates her. Hope is her best friend, but Isaac is the child of her heart.

In her desperation to keep the child she craves, there was no limit to what Lexie would do. Everything comes to a head when the boys are almost two years old. Paternity tests prove that J.T., the baby Hope and Bo are raising, is actually the son of Glen Reiber and Marlo, which meana that someone else was Hope's baby.

They eventually discover that Isaac is their son. Bo and Hope decide to keep both babies, and after they win custody of J.T. against his biological father and stepmother, they fight all that much harder for Isaac. Abe is prepared to give the Bradys their son, but Lexie fights against it. Isaac has been with them for nearly two years and thinks of them as his parents; why disrupt his world now? Unfortunately, when Lexie attempts to flee with Hope's baby, Abe has a judge grant custody to Bo and Hope, and Hope is finally reunited with her son.

When Bo and Hope reclaim their child, they rename him Beauregard Isaac Theo Brady. Rather than put the child through any more trauma (switching parents mid-stream was bad enough), they opted to refer to him by the nickname Zack.

Zack dies on January 12, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to [[Abe Carver]]; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope â as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.

During the funeral of his &quot;cousin&quot; Grace, Hope tells Mia that she also knows the pain of losing a child when he was still so young and didn't grow up yet (she didn't know Mia was Grace's biological mother).

Zach has been involved in two of his father's visions since his death in 2006. He first leads his father to Theo when he went missing in December 2008 and the later, telling his father that if Ciara loses her tommy bear something bad will happen in June 2009.

The train derailed with them all aboard but there were no serious injuries. Ms. Faversham learned the truth about the real Princess Gina but befriended Hope and Greta anyways.

'''Eugene Bradford''' is a [[fictional]] [[Fictional character|character]] on the American [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of our Lives]]''. He was played by [[John de Lancie]] from 1981 to 1986 and again in 1989. Also known as '''Gene''' and '''Euge''', he went by the pseudonym ''Bettina Lovecraft'' while working as a ''Salem Today'' columnist.

Eugene was a distant relative of the DiMera family through a prior marriage, and referred to Tony DiMera as a cousin. Prior to marrying [[Calliope Jones]] on December 31, 1985, Eugene had been married four other times. Eugene's first two wives were murdered, while his third marriage to Marlena Evans Brady was actually a cover-up (Eugene pretended to be married to Marlena when she was pregnant with Roman Brady's twins; at this time Roman was believed to be dead) and not legal. He later served as the namesake for Roman and Marlena's daughter Samantha Gene.

Eugene's fourth marriage, to a dowdy heiress named Madeleine, was arranged by his mother in an attempt to regain the Bradford fortune, and was never consummated. Eugene stood to inherit millions upon marrying with his mother's approval, but Eugene's mother did not approve of the woman Eugene really loved, Calliope Jones.

In order to get Madeleine to divorce him, Eugene posed as advice columnist Bettina Lovecraft, knowing the Madeleine religiously followed advice columns, encouraging her to leave him. Bettina was outed at a charity function which Eugene attended in drag. He revealed the truth and announced he would leave his wife for Calliope. His wedding to Calliope almost didn't happen because Emma Donovan arranged for them to get lost on the way to their wedding venue in an attempt to get everyone to go to her wedding to Alex Marshall instead. At the last minute they tied the knot, with Marlena serving as Eugene's best woman.

Eugene would lose his inheritance to Linda Anderson, owner of ''Salem Today'', when she sued him for fraud. Later on, he regained his wealth through winning the lottery.

Throughout the show, Eugene was portrayed as having psychic premonitions, and on a number of occasions they were useful in helping Salem Police and the ISA.

In the last Days episode in which appeared, he created a time machine type device and used the device. Upon activiation, there was a big explosion and Eugene disappeared. He has not been seen on Days since. In 2006, Calliope returned as the fashion designer hired to make [[Mimi Lockhart]]'s wedding dress. She told all that she and Eugene remain happily married.

'''Calliope Jones Bradford''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[NBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of our Lives]]''. She was played by [[Arleen Sorkin]] from 1984 to 1990, 1992, 2001, 2006 and 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/video/special-may-preview/1223717/ |title=Days of our Lives - All Videos - Newest - Video |publisher=NBC.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sn.soapnet.go.com/news/article/arleen-sorkin-returns-to-days |title=Arleen Sorkin Returns to Days &amp;#124; SOAPnet |publisher=Sn.soapnet.go.com |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calliope came to Salem in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonypictures.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/daysofourlives/specials/specials_detail_1698.html |title=Days of our Lives : Behind the Scenes |publisher=Sonypictures.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was employed in Liz Curtis's clothing business and her first scenes featured her making a dress for Anna DiMera. One of her trademarks was her endless collections of hats, which were very creative and sometimes very outlandish. However, Calliope soon came to possess a diamond necklace which was originally owned by Daphne DiMera. She claimed it as her own, but didn't realize that Stefano DiMera was after it, for it contained one of three prisms he was after. Her white lie unknowingly thrust her into a major storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonypictures.com&quot; /&gt;

In November 1984 Alex, Anna, and Tony picked Haiti for a photo shot for their newly formed fashion company. In addition to Calliope and her partners, on board the plane to Haiti were Carlo, Daphne, Eugene Bradford, Bo Brady, Hope Williams, Liz Chandler, and, stowaway, Andre DiMera. In midflight, Andre surprisingly popped up but, when he threatened the pilot to change his course, the pilot died of a heart attack, and the plane crashed on a remote island.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonypictures.com&quot; /&gt;

As a result of the plane crash Daphne died in Andre's arms. When Tony learned about his motherâs fate, he attacked his cousin and Andre met his demise in a patch of quicksand. Tony gave the necklace with the prism to an island girl, but Stefano managed to get it back. Roman Brady showed up to rescue everyone, but ended up fighting with Stefano atop of a nearby cliff as Bo watched from below. Roman eventually fell and died on the beach in Bo's arms. However, when Bo left Roman to get help, Roman's body was gone when he returned. Eventually, the Coast Guard arrived to rescue everyone.

In 1985, Eugene and Calliope became engaged, but their engagement hit a roadblock.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonypictures.com&quot; /&gt; In order for Eugene to collect his inheritance he had to marry a rich and high class woman. Calliope faked the part well, and Eugene was allowed to marry her. However, most of Eugene's inheritance had already been spent by his extravagant mother, Vanessa Van Kessler.

But there was a bigger problem, if his mother was discovered she could face a jail sentence, so in order to help her, Eugene married the wealthy Madeline Rutherford, and also took a job at the paper Salem Today writing a &quot;Dear Abbey&quot; like column under the name Bettina Lovelorn.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonypictures.com&quot; /&gt; To pass as Bettina, Eugene often had to dress up in drag. Eventually, Bettina's true identity was revealed. Eugene was fired and sued for fraud. Madeline left him, and with what little money he had left, Eugene and Calliope married on Dec 31, 1985. Sadly, and quite amazingly, in early 1986, shortly after they were married, Eugene disappeared in a time machine he was working on.

Eugene returned in 1989 and hid in Kimberly Donovan's basement. Eugene had traveled into the future and built an android version of Calliope, which he brought back to the present. Eugene and the real Calliope were finally reunited, but men from the future came seeking Eugene's Calliope android and inadvertently took the real Calliope captive by mistake. Eugene managed to free Calliope and the two settled back down. Eugene hasn't been seen since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonypictures.com&quot; /&gt;

Calliope went on to co-host a daytime talk show with Jennifer Horton-Deveraux. The show was a success, but Calliope would eventually turn over the show over to Jennifer and leave town. However, since her departure in 1990, Calliope has visited Salem several times.

In 2006, Calliope returned to town as a successful wedding planner. Although hired to plan her good friend Marlenaâs wedding to Alex North, she was also able to help Shawn-Douglas Brady and Mimi Lockhart with theirs, despite normally being booked two years in advance. Still eccentric, Calliope butted head with Mimiâs mother Bonnie Lockhart, a fellow eccentric, but with different wild taste. During her trip, Calliope also commented Eugene was doing just fine and she was now living in New York City.

Calliope briefly returned in 2010, when she was hired by Rafe Hernandez to collect evidence to prove that Anna Dimera was hired by EJ to kidnapped Sami and EJ's daughter Sydney Dimera. She also briefly returned later that year as part of Days of Our Lives 45th anniversary week on November 5 through November 9.

'''Shane Donovan''' is a fictional character on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. He is an agent of the ISA and husband to Kimberly Brady Donovan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/shane.php |title=About DAYS: Who's Who in Salem &amp;#124; Shane Donovan &amp;#124; Days of our Lives @ |publisher=Soapcentral.com |date=1987-05-04 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Donovon and Brady were a [[supercouple]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1qwfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i9YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1164,2540767&amp;dq=shane+donovan+days+lives&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Shane came to Salem to keep an eye on Stefano DiMera's illegal dealings. He posed as Larry Welche's butler, and eventually learned of Stefano's acquisitions of two of three rare prisms designed by Larry's father. Shane teamed up with Bo, and the two intended on taking Stefano down. Later that year Shane learned that Stefano was about to acquire the third and final prism through a Russian ice skating troop that came to town. Hope and Bo got the prism from the troop, but after a long chase with Stefano's men the prism ended up embedded in the ice rink.

In 1985, Shane, along with Kimberly, Bo, and Hope, went to England to stop the Dragon, a terrorist who planned to kill Lady Joanna. Bo and Hope chased the Dragon, and managed to trap him in the Tower of London. Later the Dragon escaped, and made his way back to the US. Shane learned the Dragon was his old friend the Duke of Earl, and when he tried to kill Shane he fell to his death. Shane and Kim fell in love, and Kim began to experience attacks of temporary blindness. While in England they were shocked to find Shane's supposedly dead wife Emma alive. She had been brainwashed by the Dragon to kill Bo and Hope. Emma returned to Salem, and Kim backed away from a now married Shane. Later Shane and Emma divorced, and Kim and Shane reunited.

Shane bought what would become Donovan Manor, complete with the famous secret ISA room. Shane's ISA mentor and friend Levina &quot;Peachie&quot; Peach came to Salem and played the role of Shane's housekeeper. Shane and Peachie had been assigned a new case â to take Victor Kiriakis down. In 1985, Kimberly came into the possession of a roll of film that contained some prints to the location of a treasure that Victor, and Stefano where after, which would again come into play years down the road.

In Miami, Bo, Hope, Kim, and Shane were all out to destroy Victor's plan. Shane had been imprisoned by Victor, but Kimberly slept with Victor in order to spare his life. Shane escaped, and managed free Bo and Hope who were trapped with an explosive that was meant to end their lives. Later Victor, Savannah Wilder, and Steve &quot;Patch&quot; Johnson were arrested for their parts in the crime syndicate in Salem. They were all freed when Victor blackmailed Larry Welch into taking the fall for everything. Victor knew Larry killed Megan Hathaway, Stefanoâs daughter, and used it against him.

By the end of the year Shane and Kimberly became engaged, but Kimberly soon learned she was pregnant, and she feared Victor was the child's father. In 1986, Shane and Kimberly became engaged, but Kimberly hid the fact that she thought her child was Victor's. One day, Shane heard Kimberly talking her about her fears and quickly broke off the engagement. Later, when paternity tests were done to determine the father, Emma switched the results, and everyone believed Victor was the father.

During a trip to West Virginia, in hopes of reuniting, Kimberly went into labor in a remote cabin in the woods. Shane delivered the baby, and he pledged his love for Kimberly and the child, and they planned to marry even though they believed Victor was Andrew's father. This news infuriated Emma, who tricked Kimberly into signing adoption papers. Emma took little Andrew and planned to sell him on the black market, but was eventually caught, and pleaded insanity and said she was still in love with Shane. However, Andrew wasn't found, and Shane and Kimberly split up.

1986 ended even worse for Kimberly and Shane when Emma was found dead on New Yearâs Eve and Kimberly was arrested and charged for the crime. Kimberly was innocent, and Shane worked to free her. Eventually, Shane learned that Barbara Stewart had adopted Andrew from Emma. Barbara tried to flee town, but was killed when she crashed her car. Eventually Shane learned that his old partner Gillian Foster had killed Emma and set Kim up in hopes of ruining Shane and Kim's marriage. Andrew was returned to Kim and Shane, and the two reunited.

On May 4, 1987 Kim and Shane married. Later that year Andrew was hit by a car and rushed to the hospital. When a blood transplant was needed it was discovered that Victor could not possibly be Andrew's father, Shane was indeed his real father.

Shane's problems mounted when his old partner Gabrielle Pascal returned. Gabrielle pretended to be a Russian Spy who had an affair with Shane in exchange for secrets. When she let this evidence leak to the ISA Shane was fired. He was later reinstated after Gabrielle was exposed.

In 1987, Shane learned he had a daughter named Eve by Emma Donovan. Eve was a troubled young prostitute that Kimberly had befriended and eventually hired to watch over Andrew. However, Eve was out to break up her father's marriage because she blamed Kim for breaking up her parents, which she felt lead to her motherâs death. Shane took Eve into his house, but she continued to be a problem for Kim, who was pregnant for the second time.

Shane soon adopted Eve, but she was soon forced back into prostitution by her old pimp Nick Corelli. Eve called Kimberly for help, and as a result Kimberly was attacked and lost her baby. Eve was also assaulted and a slash to her face from a knife left her with a permanent scar. Shane soon learned that Eve's mother was Gabriel, not Emma. An upset Kimberly left Salem to sort through her life. Shane began to have mixed feelings for Gabriel while Kimberly was gone, and even filed for divorce from Kimberly, who eventually returned to Salem.

When Eve was attacked by the âRiverfront Knifer,â Kimberly decided to go undercover as a prostitute to catch him. Kimberly was attacked, and lost the child she was carrying. When Shane learned what Kim was doing he helped her, and as a result they reunited. They renewed their vows in 1988 and honeymooned in England.

While honeymooning, Kim ran into a man she thought was Shane, only it turned out to be Shane's twin brother, Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; Donovan, III. Shane thought Drew was dead, but he had only been on a secret ISA mission. Drew returned to Salem with Shane and Kim, but Shane was suspicious of his brother. In the end it turned out that Drew was actually a crooked agent who was working for Stefano all along.

In 1989, Shane accepted a dangerous ISA mission that sent him undercover. However Shane was double crossed by an old ISA friend, Colonel Jerico, who abducted Shane and help him prisoner while the ISA and his family believed him to be dead. Shane eventually escaped and he and Jericho duked it out atop a mountain cliff, but, when a bomb Jericho had planted went off, they both went over the cliff. Shane lost his memory from the fall, but both Shane and Jerico were presumed dead once and for all.

In the mountains, Shane, who had amnesia, stumbled on Rebecca Downey. Rebecca had been on the run from her controlling husband and was camping out in the mountains outside of Salem. Unfortunately Rebecca's husband Arthur showed up and Rebecca got into a fight, both Rebecca and Shane thought Arthur was killed. Shane and Rebecca went on the run and told people they were man at wife.

At a small Cabin they were staying at Rebecca found Shane's wallet which contained his real ISA badge, but she hid it from him. Rebecca wanted to use Shane to help her escape her husband, plus she had fallen in love with him. Shane eventually found out the truth about who he was, but he still couldn't remember anything. Shane and Rebecca returned to Salem, and when Shane went home he found Kimberly making love to Cal Winters in his bedroom. Shane quickly left and he and Rebecca went to Chicago to try to clear Rebecca's name, not knowing that Arthur was still alive. After Rebecca was cleared, and Arthur was dealt with, Shane and Rebecca returned to Salem.

Cal plotted to have Shane killed, and when Rebecca opposed him he shot and killed her. Shane came home, only to be shot by his wife Kimberly. She had thought Shane was an intruder because Cal had staged some phony break-ins and had given her a gun to protect herself with, but it was all part of his plan to have Kimberly kill Shane. Shane survived and in the hospital he learned that his wife had shot him.

Shane eventually forgave Kimberly, but another obstacle came in their way. Kimberly was pregnant, and she believed the baby was Cal's, not knowing Cal had blackmailed a doctor on staff to alter the baby's paternity tests. Kimberly tried to secretly have an abortion, but Shane learned about the baby and stopped her. The baby was too much, and Shane and Kimberly broke up. Kimberly left Salem and gave birth to baby Jeannie a few months later.

When Kimberly returned to Salem, Cal broke out of jail. Desperate to have Kimberly, he kidnapped her, and her sister Kayla. Shane managed to save them both and Cal was taken into custody. Kimberly became suspicious about Jeannie and concocted a story that Jeannie had been hurt and she needed a blood transplant from her closest blood relative. Kimberly told this to Cal, and said that her blood type was different from Jeannie's so she couldn't donate the blood. Cal broke down and told Kimberly that Shane was Jeannie's father. Shane bonded with Jeannie, but it wasn't enough to reunite Shane and Kimberly. Kimberly eventually left Salem and Shane plunged himself into his work.

After Steve Johnson was murdered, Shane asked Kayla and baby Stephanie to move in with him. They grew close and bonded as they worked to find out who murdered Steve, who they suspected was murdered by Lawrence Alamain. Shane and Kayla grew closer and fell in love in 1991.

Shane's old ISA partner, Peachie, returned to Salem to ask for Shane's help. Peachie had contracted a virus that was slowly killing ISA agents and she needed Shane's help. Once again, Lawrence was the prime suspect behind the deadly virus. Things got complicated when Kimberly returned to Salem and was partnered with Shane to investigate Lawrence.

At a museum party in 1992, Shane's attempt to disarm a bomb planted by the Torres failed and he was left paralyzed. Shane refused to have surgery that could restore the use of his legs. Shane put up a wall that only Kayla could penetrate. She helped Shane recover and the two realized that they had fallen in love. Shane eventually regained the use of his legs, but the tension between Kim and Kayla put a strain on his relationship with Kayla. Kayla eventually moved to Los Angeles to work in a clinic and Shane left Salem to return to England.

Shane returned to Salem briefly in the winter of 2002 when Hope was kidnapped by Larry Welch.

Shane later returned in 2010 and was revealed to have been held prisoner in a South American prison while on assignment with the ISA. Shane escaped with the help of Rafe and both returned to Salem in time for Alice Horton's funeral. Shane reconnected with Kimberly, who was in town for Alice's memorial service, and admitted that he wanted his future with her and the family and not with the ISA. Shane and Kimberly reunited and moved to LA to be together as a family.

=== Kristina Andropolous ===
Kristina is the sole daughter of Teodor Andropolous. The Andropolous were wealthy neighbors, business partners, and friends of the Kiriakis. Thus, She grew up in the Greek island of Naphleon along with Justin Kiriakis, and she even attended the same Swiss boarding school as he. Kristina and Justin had always been fierce rivals in everything they did, but at the same time kept a very close relationship that turned into a high school romance. After they graduated, they went their separate ways. Kristina eventually became a savvy business woman, as her father prepped her to take over the helm of the Andropolous business.

In August 1988, Kristina and her father were invited by Victor to spend a couple of days at his home in Salem while they took care of some business matters. When Kristina saw Justin, she wanted to restart their old relationship. However, one tidbit that Victor had forgotten to mention was the fact that Justin was married. Indeed, Kristina was fortunate to meet his wife, Adrienne. However, she noticed that there was tension between Adrienne and Justin, and decided to try to get Justin back. Kristina was invited by Victor to stay and live in the mansion while they continued their business together. This arrangement also benefited Victor, who found Kristina a much more suitable daughter-in-law for Justin and who wanted Adrienne out of the picture. But no matter how close Kristina came to seducing Justin, he always had only Adrienne in his mind. Before long, Kristina began to give up.

Just when she thought that she had no chance with Justin, Kristina discovered that there was something going on between Adrienne and one of the Kiriakis gardeners, Emilio RamÃ­rez. Justin also noticed, and he began drifting away from Adrienne. To Kristina's chagrin, he didn't drift to her. To soothe her bruised ego, Kristina seduced Emilio. But to make things worse, Kristina couldn't hold on to Emilio either; she lost him to none other than Adrienne.

Kristina's time in Salem was running out as the business with Victor concluded, and the last thing she wanted was to return to Greece and go back underneath her father's thumb. While working with Victor, Kristina state assemblyman Jack Deveraux. Jack's successful record and future career as governor attracted Kristina, not to mention his wealth. Soon, she began to carry on an affair with him even though he was engaged to be married to Melissa Anderson. After the affair was exposed, Kristina begged Jack to marry her, claiming that she loved him. They say that you can't con a conman. In this case, that saying was true. Jack saw right through Kristina and basically told her to take a hike. With no purpose left for her in Salem (she didn't have much to begin with), Kristina returned to Greece.

=== Petrov ===
'''Petrov''' was portrayed by Kai Wulff from 1983 to 1986 and for a few episodes in 1991. With the exception of Bart and Rolf, Petrov is the most well known henchman of [[Stefano DiMera|Stefano]]. In comparison to Bart, he mostly succeeded and completed his assignments. Petrov assisted Stefano in a few of his many schemes. When Stefano kidnapped [[Marlena Evans]] &amp; Liz Chandler in early 1983, Petrov was the one who kept an eye of them so they wouldn't escape. He then had small assignments in Stefano's devilish Salem Slasher plot. When Stefano had to escape after some failures of both himself and AndrÃ© DiMera, Petrov was already in the car. But Roman and Abe were ready as well and chased them. After struggling to shake off the police, and a drunk [[Alex Marshall (Quinn Redeker character)|Alex Marshall]] caused some problem, the car drove off a bridge and fell down into a river. Alex was found but neither Petrov or Stefano.

A few months later, Stefano was seen very much alive looking for the three prisms, and soon Petrov was seen taking orders from Stefano. He kidnapped [[Hope Williams]] for Stefano in an attempt to faster lure Roman into Stefano's trap. He also got instructions from Stefano on how to activate the volcano. After locking up a noisy [[Shane Donovan]], he fulfilled his orders and activated the volcano successfully.

=== Vern Scofield ===
'''Vern Scofield''', played by Wayne Heffley from 1988 to 1993 and again in 2002, 2003, and 2006 raised three children (Brian, Tanner, and Cassie) after the death of his wife. Vern's primary role was to be [[Jack Deveraux|Jack]]'s right-hand man at the Spectator and supported Jack's relationship with [[Jennifer Horton|Jennifer]]. Vern began dating Jo Johnson, Jack's mother, in 1999 when both characters left the canvas. In 2002, it was revealed that Vern and Jo had married and were still living in Salem. They returned for Jack's &quot;funeral&quot; in 2003 and later for Jack and Jennifer's wedding and farewell in 2006.

=== Larry Welch ===
'''Larry Welch''', played by Andrew Hyatt Masset from 1983 to 1985 and again from 2002 to 2003, was a constant obstacle in [[Bo Brady|Bo]] and [[Hope Brady|Hope]]'s supercouple love story. Larry blackmailed Hope into marrying him but on the day of the wedding Bo rode in on his motorcycle and kidnapped Hope from the wedding. In 1985, Larry killed [[Stefano Dimera|Stefano's]] daughter, [[Megan Hathaway|Megan]], and dumped her body in a hot tub; Hope was the prime suspect. [[Victor Kiriakis]] learned the truth and forced Larry to take the fall for the crime syndicate that he was running.

Larry returned in 2002 when he again kidnapped [[Hope Williams Brady|Hope]] in an attempt to get his revenge on her, Bo and Victor. He was presumed dead after a prison break, but in reality, was helping Nicole in her plans to murder Victor. Larry was hit and killed by a car in early 2003.
