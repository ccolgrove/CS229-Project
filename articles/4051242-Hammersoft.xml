'''GTE Southwest Incorporated''' is a [[Verizon]] operating company serving a former GTE region. GTE Southwest, at its peak,  originally served [[Arkansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and [[New Mexico]].

Its original name upon founding was '''State Telephone Company of Texas'''. It later changed its name to '''Southwestern Associated Telephone Company''', and '''General Telephone Company of the Southwest'''.

In 1996, Contel of New Mexico and Contel of Texas were merged into GTE Southwest.

In 2000, [[Bell Atlantic]] purchased [[GTE]] and renamed itself [[Verizon]]. Shortly thereafter, GTE Southwest's operations in several states were sold off. GTE's [[Arkansas]] operations were sold to [[CenturyTel]], becoming [[CenturyTel of Northwest Arkansas]]. GTE's operations in [[Oklahoma]] and [[New Mexico]] were sold to [[Valor Telecom]]. GTE Southwest retained its legal name but began [[doing business as]] '''Verizon Southwest'''.

GTE Southwest continues to serve former GTE and Contel regions in [[Texas]]. It is the only  former [[GTE]] operating company that has not changed its official legal name under Verizon ownership.
