The '''University of California, Berkeley''' (also referred to as '''UC Berkeley''', '''Berkeley''', '''California''' or simply '''Cal'''), is a teaching and research university established in 1868 and located in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]]. Berkeley is widely considered one of the most prestigious and selective universities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/9109/harvard-number-one-university-eyes-public.aspx Best Universities In The Eyes of the Public]&lt;/ref&gt; Among its honors and accomplishments, Berkeley faculty, alumni, and researchers have won 70 [[Nobel Prize]]s, 9 [[Wolf Prize]]s, 7 [[Fields Medal]]s, 15 [[Turing Award]]s, 45&lt;ref&gt;http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2010/09/28/macarthur/&lt;/ref&gt; [[MacArthur Fellowship]]s, 20 [[Academy Award]]s, and 11 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s. To date, UC Berkeley and its researchers are associated with 6 [[chemical elements]] of the [[periodic table]] ([[Californium]], [[Seaborgium]], [[Berkelium]], [[Einsteinium]], [[Fermium]], [[Lawrencium]]) and [[Berkeley Lab]] has discovered 16 chemical elements in total  â more than any other university in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/new-elements-here.html |title=Chemical Elements Discovered at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |publisher=Lbl.gov |date=June 7, 1999 |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkeley offers approximately 300 undergraduate and [[graduate degree]] programs in a wide range of disciplines. The oldest of the ten major campuses affiliated with the [[University of California]] (UC), Berkeley was the result of an 1868 merger of the private [[College of California]] and the public Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College in [[Oakland]]. Since its founding, Berkeley has been charged with providing both &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;practical&quot; education for the state's people.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkeley.edu/about/hist/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkeley co-manages three [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories]], including the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] for the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]. Berkeley was a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]]. Berkeley physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] was the scientific director of the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the first [[atomic bomb]] in the world, which he personally headquartered at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], during [[World War II]]. 

Berkeley student-athletes have won over 100 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medals. Known as the ''[[California Golden Bears]]'' (often abbreviated as &quot;Cal Bears&quot; or just &quot;Cal&quot;), the athletic teams are members of both the [[Pacific-12 Conference]] and the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Cal athletes have won national titles in many sports, including football, men's and women's swimming, men's basketball, baseball, men's gymnastics, softball, water polo, rugby, and crew. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are [[Yale Blue]] and California [[Gold (color)|Gold]].

{{Main|History of the University of California, Berkeley}}

In 1866, the land comprising the current Berkeley campus was purchased by the private College of California. Because it lacked sufficient funds to operate, it eventually merged with the state-run Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College to form the University of California, the first full-curriculum public university in the state. The university opened in September 1869. [[Frederick Billings]] was a trustee of the College of California and suggested that the college be named in honor of the [[Anglo-Irish]] philosopher [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkeley&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://berkeleypubliclibrary.org/system/Chapter2.html| work=Berkeley, A City in History| author=Wollenberg, Charles| year=2002| title=Chapter 2: Tale of Two Towns| publisher=Berkeley Public Library| accessdate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 [[Henry Durant]], the founder of the College of California, became the first president. With the completion of North and [[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Halls]] in 1873, the university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 222 female students and held its first classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucb/overview.html |title=University of California History Digital Archives |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1891, [[Phoebe Apperson Hearst]] made several large gifts to Berkeley, funding a number of programs and new buildings, and sponsoring, in 1898, an international competition in Antwerp, Belgium, where French architect Emile Bernard submitted the winning design for a campus master plan. In 1905, the University Farm was established near [[Sacramento]], ultimately becoming the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ucb_about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/about/history/ |publisher=UC Berkeley |title=About UC Berkeley â History |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the number of campus buildings had grown substantially, and included twenty structures designed by architect [[John Galen Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/multimedia/2003/03/jgh/index.shtml |title=John Galen Howard and the design of the ''City of Learning,'' the UC Berkeley campus |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=December 24, 2010|unused_data=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Gordon Sproul]] served as president from 1930 to 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidents&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/overview/presidents/index2.html |title=UC Presidents |publisher=University of California History Digital Archives |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942, the American Council on Education ranked UC Berkeley second only to [[Harvard University]] in the number of distinguished departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidents&quot;/&gt;

During World War II, following [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Glenn Seaborg]]'s then-secret discovery of plutonium, [[Ernest Lawrence|Ernest Orlando Lawrence]]'s [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] began to contract with the U.S. Army to develop the [[atomic bomb]]. UC Berkeley physics professor [[Robert Oppenheimer|J. Robert Oppenheimer]] was named scientific head of the [[Manhattan Project]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/chronology.shtml |title=Manhattan Project Chronology |publisher=atomicarchive.com |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=292&amp;Itemid=205 |title=Atomic History â Early Government Support |publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (formerly the Radiation Lab), Berkeley is now a partner in managing two other labs, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (1943) and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (1952).

Originally, military training was compulsory for male undergraduates, and Berkeley housed an armory for that purpose. In 1917, Berkeley's ROTC program was established, and its School of Military Aeronautics trained future pilots, including [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who graduated with a B.A. in 1922. Both [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Frederick C. Weyand]] graduated from UC Berkeley's ROTC program, earning B.A. degrees in 1937 and 1938, respectively. During World War II, the military increased its presence on campus to recruit more officers, and by 1944, the student body at Berkeley included more than 1,000 Navy personnel. The Board of Regents ended compulsory military training at Berkeley in 1962.

During the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]] in 1949, the [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] adopted an anti-[[communist]] [[loyalty oath]]. A number of faculty members objected and were dismissed;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/timelinesummary.html |title=The Loyalty Oath Controversy, University of California, 1949â1951 |publisher=University of California Archives |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ten years passed before they were reinstated with back pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/article.php?id=535 |date=January 8, 1999 |title=Former UC Presidents Recollect Loyalty Oath |last=Benjaminson |first=Anne |publisher=Daily Californian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the University of California became an entity separate from the Berkeley campus. Each campus was given relative autonomy and its own Chancellor. Then-president Sproul assumed presidency of the entire University of California system, and [[Clark Kerr]] became the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidents&quot; /&gt;

[[File:CampanileMtTamalpiasSunset-original.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Sather Tower (the Campanile) looking out over the [[San Francisco Bay]] and [[Mount Tamalpais]].]]Berkeley gained a reputation for student activism in the 1960s with the [[Free Speech Movement]] in 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkeley 60s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CalHistory/60s.html |title= Days of Cal â Berkeley in the 60s |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[opposition to the Vietnam War]]. In the highly publicized [[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]] protest in 1969, students and the school conflicted over use of a plot of land; the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] was called in and violence erupted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkeley 60s&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeffery |last=Kahn |title=Ronald Reagan launched political career using the Berkeley campus as a target |publisher=UC Berkeley News |date=June 8, 2004 |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/06/08_reagan.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern students at Berkeley are less politically active, with a greater percentage of moderates and conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Doty | first=Meriah | title=Examining Berkeley's liberal legacy | url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/09/elec04.berkeley/ | date=February 5, 2004 | newspaper=CNN | accessdate=February 20, 2008 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/01/24_freshmen.shtml|first= Bonnie Azab|last=Powell|date=January 24, 2005|accessdate=February 29, 2008|publisher=UC Berkeley News|title=Web Feature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of 9:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Tierney | first=John | title=Republicans Outnumbered in Academia, Studies Find | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/18/education/18faculty.html | date=November 18, 2004 | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | accessdate=January 16, 2008 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various human and animal rights groups have recently conflicted with Berkeley.

The original name ''University of California'' was frequently shortened to ''California'' or ''Cal''. UC Berkeley's athletic teams date to this time and so are referred to as the ''[[California Golden Bears]]'', ''Cal Bears'', or just ''Cal''. Today, ''University of California'' refers to a statewide school system. Referring to the University of California, Berkeley as ''UCB'' or ''University of California '''at''' Berkeley'' is discouraged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Editorial Style Guide | year = 2009 | pages = 20 | publisher = University of California, Berkeley | url = http://identity.berkeley.edu/guidelines/berkeley-editorial-style-09.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the domain name is &lt;tt&gt;berkeley.edu&lt;/tt&gt;. Moreover, the term &quot;Cal Berkeley&quot; is not a correct reference to the school, but is occasionally used. Berkeley is unaffiliated with the [[Berklee College of Music]] or [[Berkeley College]]. However, UC Berkeley does share academic ties with [[Yale University]]; not only were many original Berkeley founders Yale graduates (see below), but the names, University of California, Berkeley and [[Berkeley College (Yale)]], were inspired by the intellectual contributions of the western philosopher, [[George Berkeley]].

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of the University of California, Berkeley}}
The Berkeley campus encompasses approximately {{convert|1232|acre|ha}}, though the &quot;central campus&quot; occupies only the low-lying western {{convert|178|acre|ha}} of this area. Of the remaining {{convert|1000|acre|ha}}, approximately {{convert|200|acre|ha}} are occupied by the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]; other facilities above the main campus include the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]] and several research units, notably the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]], the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]], an undeveloped {{convert|800|acre|ha}} ecological preserve, the [[University of California Botanical Garden]] and a recreation center in Strawberry Canyon. Portions of the mostly undeveloped eastern area of the campus is actually within the [[Oakland, California|City of Oakland]]; the northernmost eastern corner of Oakland extends from the [[Claremont Resort]] north through the [[Panoramic Hill, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Panoramic Hill]] neighborhood to [[Tilden Regional Park|Tilden Park]].

To the west of the central campus is the [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown business district of Berkeley]]; to the northwest is the neighborhood of North Berkeley, including the so-called [[Gourmet ghetto|Gourmet Ghetto]], a commercial district known for high quality dining due to the presence of such world-renowned restaurants as [[Chez Panisse]]. Immediately to the north is a quiet residential neighborhood known as [[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]] with a large graduate student population{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}; situated north of that are the upscale residential neighborhoods of the [[Berkeley Hills]], where many faculty members live{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Immediately southeast of campus lies fraternity row, and beyond that the [[Clark Kerr Campus]] and an upscale residential area named [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont]]. The [[Southside, Berkeley, California|area south of the university]] includes student housing and [[Telegraph Avenue]], one of Berkeley's main shopping districts with stores, street vendors and restaurants catering to college students and tourists. In addition, the University also owns land to the northwest of the main campus, a {{convert|90|acre|ha|sing=on}} married student housing complex in the nearby town of Albany (&quot;Albany Village&quot; and the &quot;Gill Tract&quot;), and a field research station several miles to the north in [[Richmond, California]].

Outside of the Bay Area, the University owns various research laboratories and research forests in both northern and southern Sierra Nevada.

===Architecture===
What is considered the historic campus today was the result of the 1898 &quot;International Competition for the [[Phoebe Hearst]] Architectural Plan for the University of California,&quot; funded by [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s mother and initially held in the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]; eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/online_exhibits/romapacifica/index.html Online Exhibit on the Hearst Architectural Competition]&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was Frenchman [[Ãmile BÃ©nard]], however he refused to personally supervise the implementation of his plan and the task was subsequently given to architecture professor [[John Galen Howard]]. Howard designed over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and 1960s. The structures forming the âclassical coreâ of the campus were built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Classical style, and include [[Hearst Greek Theatre]], [[Hearst Memorial Mining Building]], [[Doe Memorial Library]], California Hall, [[Wheeler Hall]], (Old) Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall, [[Sather Gate]], and the {{convert|307|ft|m|0|sing=on}} [[Sather Tower]] (nicknamed &quot;the Campanile&quot; after its architectural inspiration, [[St Mark's Campanile]] in Venice). Buildings he regarded as temporary, nonacademic, or not particularly &quot;serious&quot; were designed in shingle or [[Gothic architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] styles; examples of these are North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall. Many of Howard's designs are recognized [[California Historical Landmark]]s and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

[[File:South Hall--UC Berkeley--Panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]] (1873), one of the two original buildings of the University of California, still stands on the Berkeley campus]]

Built in 1873 in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] Second-Empire-style, [[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]] is the oldest university building in California. It, and the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed [[Piedmont Avenue (Berkeley)|Piedmont Avenue]] east of the main campus, are the only remnants from the original University of California before John Galen Howard's buildings were constructed. Other architects whose work can be found in the campus and surrounding area are [[Bernard Maybeck]]&lt;ref name=mccoy&gt;{{cite book | first =Esther | authorlink =Esther McCoy | title =Five California Architects | publisher =Reinhold Publishing Corporation |year=1960 | location =New York | page =6 | id =ASIN B000I3Z52W | unused_data =HELLO PPL last =McCoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; (best known for the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco), Maybeck's student [[Julia Morgan]] (Hearst Women's Gymnasium), [[Charles Willard Moore]] ([[Haas School of Business]]) and [[Joseph Esherick]] (Wurster Hall).

===Natural features===
[[File:Strawberry Creek near Dwinelle Hall.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Strawberry Creek]], as seen between Dwinelle Hall and Lower Sproul Plaza.]]
Flowing into the main campus are two branches of [[Strawberry Creek]]. The south fork enters a culvert upstream of the recreational complex at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon and passes beneath [[California Memorial Stadium]] before appearing again in Faculty Glade. It then runs through the center of the campus before disappearing underground at the west end of campus. The north fork appears just east of [[University House, Berkeley|University House]] and runs through the glade north of the Valley Life Sciences Building, the original site of the Campus Arboretum.

Trees in the area date from the founding of the University in the 1870s. The campus, itself, contains numerous wooded areas; including: [[Founders' Rock]], Faculty Glade, Grinnell Natural Area, and the [[Eucalyptus]] Grove, which is both the tallest stand of such trees in the world and the tallest stand of hardwood trees in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strawberrycreek.berkeley.edu/tour/08eucalyptus.html UC Berkeley Strawberry Creek]&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus sits on the [[Hayward Fault]], which runs directly through [[California Memorial Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing construction to retrofit the stadium. The &quot;treesit&quot; protest revolved around the controversy of clearing away trees by the stadium to build the new Student Athlete High Performance Center. As the stadium sits directly on the fault, this raised campus concerns of the safety of student athletes in the event of an earthquake as they train in facilities under the stadium stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/08/29_stadium.shtml &quot;Campus provides updates on Memorial Stadium Project and Student-Athlete High Performance Center&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In 2009, UC Berkeley developed the Climate Action Plan, pledging to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by one-third, and eventually to achieve climate neutrality. The university tries to use as much post-consumer waste recycled copy paper as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;UC Berkeley Office of Sustainability&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Student housing==
Students at UC Berkeley live in a variety of housing that cater to personal and academic preferences and styles.  The university offers two years of guaranteed housing for entering freshmen, and one year for entering transfer students. The immediately surrounding community offers apartments, Greek (fraternity and sorority) housing and cooperative housing, twenty of which are houses that are members of the [[Berkeley Student Cooperative]].

===University Housing===
{{Main|Housing at the University of California, Berkeley}}

[[File:Cunningham-Towle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cunningham Hall and the newly built Towle Hall, part of the Unit 2 residence hall complex]] The university runs twelve different residence halls, ranging from undergraduate residence halls (both themed and non-themed) and family student housing, to re-entry student housing and optional international student housing at the [[International House Berkeley | International House]].  Undergraduate residence halls are located off-campus in the city of Berkeley.  Units 1, 2 and 3, located on the south side of campus, offer [[high-rise]] accommodations with common areas on every other floor. These three residential high-rises share a common dining hall, called Crossroads.  Further away and also on the south side of campus is Clark Kerr, an undergraduate residence hall complex that houses many student athletes and was once a school for the deaf and blind.  

[[File:Bowles.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Bowles Hall]] at the 2003 Homecoming and Parents Weekend]]In the foothills east of the central campus, there are three additional undergraduate residence hall complexes: Foothill, Stern, and Bowles. Foothill is a co-ed suite-style hall reminiscent of a Swiss chalet.  Just south of Foothill, overlooking the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]], is the all-women's traditional-style Stern Hall, which boasts an original mural by [[Diego Rivera]]. Because of their proximity to the [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and [[UC Berkeley College of Chemistry|College of Chemistry]], these residence halls often house science and engineering majors. They tend to be quieter than the [[Southside, Berkeley, California|southside]] complexes, but because of their location next to the theatre, often get free glimpses of concerts. [[Bowles Hall]], the oldest state-owned residence hall in California, is located immediately north of [[California Memorial Stadium]]. Dedicated in 1929 and on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], this all-men's residence hall has large quad-occupancy rooms and has the appearance of a castle.

The Channing-Bowditch and Ida Jackson apartments are intended for older students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/channing_bowditch.html housing.berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/jackson_house.html Jackson House]&lt;/ref&gt; Family student housing consists of two main groups of housing: [[UC Village|University Village]] and Smyth-Fernwald. University Village is located three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) north-west of campus in [[Albany, California]], and Smyth-Fernwald near the Clark Kerr campus.  

===Cooperative housing===
Students in Berkeley have a number of cooperative housing options.  The largest network of student housing cooperatives in the area is the [[Berkeley Student Cooperative]] (BSC).  

{{Main|Berkeley Student Cooperative}}

Students of UC Berkeley, as well as students of other universities and colleges in the area, have the option of living in one of the twenty cooperative houses of the [[Berkeley Student Cooperative]] (BSC), formerly the University Students' Cooperative Association (USCA), and member of the national cooperative federation, [[NASCO]].  The BSC is a [[nonprofit]] [[housing cooperative]] network consisting of 20 cooperative homes and 1250 member-owners. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.usca.org/about-bsc&lt;/ref&gt;  
The USCA (as the BSC was known by at that time) was founded in 1933 by then-director of the [[YWCA]], [[Harry Kingman]].  The birth of the USCA, as well as many other cooperative organizations around the country, coincided with the [[Great Depression]] precisely as a response to scant resources.  By living together in large houses and pooling together resources, members found that their monetary resources could go further to pay for their cost of living than living separately.  
In the 1960s, the USCA pioneered the first co-ed university housing in Berkeley, called The Ridge Project.  In 1975, the USCA founded its first and only vegetarian-themed house, Lothlorien.  In 1997, the USCA opened its African-American theme house, Afro House, and in 1999 its [[LGBT]]-themed house, named after queer Irish author and poet [[Oscar Wilde]].  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.usca.org/history BSC history&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable alumni of the BSC include [[Marion Nestle]], professor at [[New York University]] and author of Food Politics, and [[Beverly Cleary]].

==Organization and administration==
Berkeley is the oldest of the ten major campuses affiliated with the [[University of California]]. The University of California is governed by a 26-member [[Board of Regents]], 18 of which are appointed by the [[Governor of California]] to 12-year terms, 7 serving as ''[[ex officio]]'' members, and a single student regent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Governance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/aboutuc/governance.html |title=About UC â Shared Governance |publisher=The University of California |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Chancellor was created in 1952 to lead individual campuses. The Board appointed [[Robert J. Birgeneau]] to be the 9th Chancellor of the university in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/07/27_chancellor.shtml |title=Robert J.

UC Berkeley does not have a [[medical school]]; however, the [[University of California, San Francisco]] is a standalone medical school that is located nearby.

The 2006â2007 budget totaled $1.7 billion; 33% came from the State of California. In 2006â2007, 7,850 donors contributed $267.9 million and the endowment was valued at $2.89 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts&quot;/&gt;

UC Berkeley employs 24,700 people directly and employees are permitted to unionize and are represented by [[AFSCME]], [[California Nurses Association]] (CNA), Coalition of University Employees (CUE), [[UAW]], UC-AFT, and UPTE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/hrlabor.htm |title=Human Resources â Unions, bargaining agreements, and labor relations |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080804055815/http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/hrlabor.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial aid and scholarship programs===
The [[IDEAL Scholars Fund]] was established by four alumni to increase the number of underrepresented minorities at UC Berkeley. The Fund tries to counter the perceived effects of California [[Proposition 209]], which ended [[Affirmative Action]] in [[California]] and in the [[University of California]] system. Some claimed there was a reduction in the numbers of Latino, African American and Native American students and rekindled their activism on campus concerning issues of race. However, supporters of [[Proposition 209]] have noted that the number of Asian American students, a small minority group nationally but a large minority group in California, has dramatically increased following its passage. Racial preferences remain a controversial topic, with some students supporting them while others are opposed to what they see as reverse racism, especially against Asian American students.

===Library system===
{{Main| University of California, Berkeley Library System}}
Berkeley's 32 libraries tie together to make the fourth largest academic library in the United States surpassed only by [[Harvard University Library]], [[Yale University Library]] and [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/arlstat08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, considering the relative sizes and ages of these University libraries, Berkeley's collections have been growing about as fast as those at Harvard and Yale combined: specifically, 1.8 times faster than Harvard, and 1.9 times faster than Yale. In 2003, the [[Association of Research Libraries]] ranked it as the top public and third overall university library in North America based on various statistical measures of quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2002/06/20_libry.html 06.20.2002 â UC Berkeley library is top-ranked among North American public university research libraries]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, Berkeley's library system contains over 11 [[million]] volumes and maintains over 70,000 serial titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/news_events/whats-new.html What's New in the Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries together cover over {{convert|12|acre|ha}} of land and form one of the largest library complexes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/97legacy/gard.html 06.12.97 â New addition to UC Berkeley Main Library dedicated to former UC President David Gardner]&lt;/ref&gt; Doe Library serves as the library system's reference, periodical, and administrative center, while most of the main collections are housed in the subterranean Gardner Main Stacks and Moffitt Undergraduate Library. The [[Bancroft Library]], with holdings of over 400,000 printed volumes, maintains a collection that documents the history of the western part of North America, with an emphasis on California, Mexico and Central America.

==Student life and traditions==
[[File:UCBerkeleyCampanileSatherGate.jpg|thumb|Sather gate and Sather tower (the Campanile) from Sproul Plaza on the UC Berkeley campus]]
The official university mascot is [[Oski|Oski the Bear]], who debuted in 1941. Previously, live bear cubs were used as mascots at [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]]. It was decided in 1940 that a costumed mascot would be a better alternative to a live bear. Named after the [[The Oski Yell|Oski-wow-wow]] yell, he is cared for by the Oski Committee, whose members have exclusive knowledge of the identity of the costume-wearer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-mas.html California Golden Bears â Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of California Marching Band]], which has served the university since 1891, performs at every home football game and at select road games as well. A smaller subset of the Cal Band, the Straw Hat Band, performs at basketball games, volleyball games, and other campus and community events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calband.berkeley.edu/calband/about/ University of California Marching Band ~ About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UC Rally Committee]], formed in 1901, is the official guardian of California's Spirit and Traditions. Wearing their traditional blue and gold rugbies, Rally Committee members can be seen at all major sporting and spirit events. Committee members are charged with the maintenance of the five Cal flags, the large California banner overhanging the Memorial Stadium Student Section and [[Haas Pavilion]], the California Victory Cannon, Card Stunts and [[The Big &quot;C&quot;]] among other duties. The Rally Committee is also responsible for safekeeping of the [[Stanford Axe]] when it is in Cal's possession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucrc.berkeley.edu/ UC Rally Committee | Home]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chairman of the Rally Committee holds the title &quot;Custodian of the Axe&quot; while it is in the Committee's care.

Overlooking the main Berkeley campus from the foothills in the east, [[The Big &quot;C&quot;]] is an important symbol of California school spirit. The Big &quot;C&quot; has its roots in an early 20th century campus event called &quot;Rush,&quot; which pitted the freshman and sophomore classes against each other in a race up Charter Hill that often developed into a wrestling match. It was eventually decided to discontinue Rush and, in 1905, the freshman and sophomore classes banded together in a show of unity to build the Big &quot;C&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CalHistory/traditions.html Days of Cal | Bear Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its prominent position, the Big &quot;C&quot; is often the target of pranks by rival [[Stanford University]] students who paint the Big &quot;C&quot; red and also fraternities and sororities who paint it their organization's colors. One of the Rally Committee's functions is to repaint the Big &quot;C&quot; to its traditional color of King Alfred Yellow.

Cal students invented the college football tradition of [[card stunts]]. Then known as Bleacher Stunts, they were first performed during the 1910 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] and consisted of two stunts: a picture of the [[Stanford Axe]] and a large blue &quot;C&quot; on a white background. The tradition continues today in the Cal student section and incorporates complicated motions, for example tracing the Cal script logo on a blue background with an imaginary yellow pen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-tour.html California Golden Bears â Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Victory Cannon, placed on [[Tightwad Hill]] overlooking the stadium, is fired before every football home game, after every score, and after every Cal victory. First used in the 1963 Big Game, it was originally placed on the sidelines before moving to [[Tightwad Hill]] in 1971. The only time the cannon ran out of ammunition was during a game against [[University of the Pacific (United States)|Pacific]] in 1991, when Cal scored 12 touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/victory-cannon.html California Golden Bears â Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditions have included events that span only a few years. William (or Willie) the Polka Dot Man was a performance artist who frequented Sproul Plaza during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2002/08/15_foley.html 08.15.2002 â The quintessential campus cop]&lt;/ref&gt; The Naked Guy (now deceased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-05-21-naked-guy-dies_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Former Berkeley student known as 'Naked Guy' dies in jail | date=May 21, 2006 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Larry the Drummer, who performed Batman tunes, appeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

A few current traditions include streaking during finals week in the Main Stacks, the Happy Happy Man, and [[Stoney Burke]].

===Student-run organizations===
====Student government====
The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is the [[student government]] organization that controls funding for student groups and organizes on-campus student events. It is considered one of the most autonomous student governments at any [[public university]] in the U.S. The two main political parties are &quot;Student Action&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentaction.org Student Action Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;CalSERVE.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calserve.org CalSERVE Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was founded in 1887 and has a budget of $1.6 million. 

The ASUC's Student Union Program, Entertainment, and Recreation Board (SUPERB) is a student-run, non-profit branch dedicated to providing entertainment for the campus and community.  Founded in 1964, SUPERB's programming includes the Friday Film Series, free Noon Concerts on Lower Sproul Plaza, Comedy Competitions, Poker Tournaments, free Sneak Previews of upcoming movies, and more.

====Communications media====
UC Berkeley's student-run online television station, [[CalTV]], was formed in 2005 and broadcasts online. It is run by students with a variety of backgrounds and majors.

UC Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper is ''[[The Daily Californian]]''. Founded in 1871, ''The Daily Cal'' became independent in 1971 after the campus administration fired three senior editors for encouraging readers to take back [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]].

Berkeley's FM [[Student radio station]], [[KALX]], broadcasts on 90.7&amp;nbsp;MHz. It is run largely by volunteers, including both students and community members.

====Student groups====
[[File:Cal band.JPG|thumb|Cal Straw Hat Band (a smaller subset of the Cal Band) playing at [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] in [[San Diego, California]]]]
UC Berkeley has over 700 established student groups.

UC Berkeley has a reputation for [[student activism]], stemming from the 1960s and the [[Free Speech Movement]]. Today, Berkeley is known as a lively campus with activism in many forms, from email petitions, presentations on [[Sproul Plaza]] and volunteering, to the occasional protest. Political student groups on campus numbered 94 during the 2006â2007 school year, including Berkeley MEChA, Berkeley [[American Civil Liberties Union]], Berkeley Students for Life, Campus Greens, The Sustainability Team (STEAM), the [[Berkeley Student Food Collective]], Students for Sensible Drug Policy, Cal Berkeley Democrats, and the Berkeley College Republicans. Berkeley sends the most students to the [[Peace Corps]] of any university in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucop.edu/pathways/infoctr/introuc/ucb.html Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berkeley DM 2009.JPG|thumb|left|[[Berkeley Dance Marathon|Dance Marathon]], one of the campus's student-led fundraising events.]]

The Residence Hall Assembly (RHA) is the student-run residence hall organization that oversees all aspects of residence wide event planning, legislation, sponsorships and activities for over 6000 on-campus undergraduate residents. Founded in 1988 by the President's Council, it is now funded and supported by the Residential and Student Service Programs department on campus.

Berkeley Model United Nations [http://www.bmun.net], the oldest running high school Model United Nations program in the United States, hosts a major annual conference on campus with an average attendance of 1500 high school students each year.  BMUN is hosting its 60th Annual Conference in 2012. 

The Berkeley Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://theberkeleygroup.org/ The Berkeley Group]&lt;/ref&gt; is a student consulting organization affiliated with UC Berkeley and the [[Haas School of Business]]. Students of all majors are recruited and trained to work on pro-bono consulting engagements with real-life nonprofit clients.

ImagiCal has been the college chapter of the [[American Advertising Federation]] at Berkeley since the late 1980s. Every year, the team competes in the [[National Student Advertising Competition]]. Students from various backgrounds come together to work on a marketing case provided by the AAF and a corporate sponsor to college chapters across the nation. Most recently, the UC Berkeley team won in their respective regions in both 2005 and 2009, eventually going on to win 4th and 3rd in the nation, respectively.

Democratic Education at Cal, or DeCal, is a program that promotes the creation of professor-sponsored, student-facilitated classes through the Special Studies 98/198 program. DeCal arose out of the 1960s [[Free Speech movement]] and was officially established in 1981. The program offers around 150 courses on a vast range of subjects that appeal to the Berkeley student community, including classes on [[James Bond]], [[Batman]], the [[Iranian Revolution|The Iranian Revolution]], [[cooking]],  [[Israeli folk dancing]], [[nuclear weapons]], and [[meditation]].

There are many [[a cappella]] groups on campus; two groups include the [[UC Men's Octet]] and The [[California Golden Overtones]]. The [[UC Men's Octet]] is an eight-member a cappella group founded in 1948 featuring a repertoire of barbershop, doo-wop, contemporary pop, modern alternative, and fight songs. They are one of only two multiple time champions of the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|ICCA]], having won the championship in both 1998 and 2000. The [[California Golden Overtones]], founded in 1984, have a very similar repertoire to the Octet.  It is a tradition for every Berkeley a cappella group to perform under the campus' iconic [[Sather Gate]] each week at different times during the week; Artists in Resonance performs Mondays at Noon, Noteworthy performs Tuesdays at 12:30PM, DeCadence performs Wednesdays at Noon, The Men's Octet performs Wednesdays at 1pm, and the Golden Overtones performs Fridays at 1pm.  In addition to a Capella, Berkeley is host to a myriad of other performing arts groups in comedy, dance, acting and instrumental music. A few examples include Jericho! Improv &amp; Sketch Comedy, The Movement, Taiko drumming, BareStage student musical theater, the Remedy Music Project, and Main Stacks Competitive Hip Hop Dance Team.

Since 1967, students and staff jazz musicians have had an opportunity to perform and study with the [[University of California Jazz Ensembles]].  Under the direction of Dr. David W. Tucker, who was hired by the [[Cal Band]] as a composer, arranger, and associate director, but was later asked to direct the jazz ensembles as it grew in popularity and membership, the group grew rapidly from one big band to multiple big bands, numerous combos, and numerous instrumental classes with multiple instructors.  For several decades it hosted the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, part of the American Collegiate Jazz Festival, a competitive forum for student musicians.  PCCJF brought jazz luminaries such as [[Hubert Laws]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], and [[Ed Shaughnessy]] to the Berkeley campus as performers, clinicians, and adjudicators.  The festival later included high school musicians.  The jazz ensembles proved to be an effective recruitment tool, many high school musicians interested in both strong academics and jazz finding that the campus met both interests.  Numerous alumni have had successful careers in jazz performance and education including [[Michael Wolff]] and [[Andy Narell]].

UC Berkeley also hosts a large number of conferences, talks, and musical and theatrical performances. Many of these events, including the Annual UC Berkeley Sociological Research Symposium, are completely planned and organized by undergraduate students.

===Athletics===
{{Main|California Golden Bears}}
UC Berkeley's sports teams compete in intercollegiate athletics as the [[California Golden Bears]]. They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I-A as a member of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]]. The official school colors, established in 1873 by a committee of students, are Yale Blue and California Gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource Guide: Student history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/104history.html|title=Resource Guide: Student history|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale Blue was chosen because many of the university's founders were [[Yale University]] graduates (for example Henry Durant, the first university president), while California Gold was selected to represent the Golden State of California. The California Golden Bears have a long history of excellence in athletics, having won national titles in football, men's basketball, baseball, softball, men's and women's crew, men's gymnastics, men's tennis, men's and women's swimming, men's water polo, men's Judo, men's track, and men's rugby. In addition, Cal athletes have won numerous individual NCAA titles in track, gymnastics, swimming and tennis. On January 31, 2009, the school's [[Hurling]] club made athletic history by defeating [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in the first collegiate hurling match ever to be played on American soil.

California finished in first place&lt;ref&gt;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/Jan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2007â2008 Fall U.S. Sports Academy Directors' Cup standings (Formerly the Sears Cup), which measures the best overall collegiate athletic programs in the country, with points awarded for national finishes in NCAA sports. Cal finished with 370 points.
California finished in ninth place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/finald1standings.pdf |title=Div1CumulativeStandings.xls |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2006â07 U.S. Sports Academy Directors' Cup. With 1030.00 points, this is Cal's highest point value in the history of UC Berkeley.
California finished in sixth place&lt;ref&gt;http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/0506D1June22Stand.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the NACDA [[Director's Cup]] standings, with points awarded for national finishes in NCAA sports. With 865.5 points, Cal's seventh place finish is the highest in the school's history.

====California - Stanford rivalry====
{{Main|Big Game (football)}}

[[Image:2002 big game flags.jpg|thumb|right|UC Rally Committee running Cal flags across the Memorial Stadium field at the 2002 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]]. (Note the Stanford visitors section on the left and the UC Berkeley alumni section on the right.)]]The Golden Bears' traditional arch-rivalry is with the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Cardinal. The most anticipated sporting event between the two universities is the annual football game dubbed the [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]], and it is celebrated with spirit events on both campuses. Since 1933, the winner of the Big Game has been awarded custody of [[the Stanford Axe]].

One of the most famous moments in Big Game history occurred during the 85th Big Game on November 20, 1982. In what has become known as &quot;the band play&quot; or simply [[The Play]], Cal scored the winning touchdown in the final seconds with a kickoff return that involved a series of laterals and the Stanford marching band rushing onto the field.

====National championships====
Berkeley teams have won national championships in baseball (2), men's basketball (2), men's crew (15), women's crew (3), football (5), men's golf (1), men's gymnastics (4), men's lacrosse (1), men's rugby (24), softball (1), men's swimming (2), women's swimming (1), men's tennis (1), men's track &amp; field (1), and men's water polo (13).

[[Alumni]] have been involved in the field of [[politics]] and [[international relations]], one of whom is [[Nicholas A. Veliotes]] (1928-). Veliotes went on to become the [[United States|Ambassador]] to the [[countries]] of [[Jordan]] (1978-1981) and [[Egypt]] (1984-1986), among holding many other highly prestigious job titles and positions throughout his lengthy career.

Alumni have written novels and screenplays that have attracted Oscar-caliber talent. [[Irving Stone]] (BA 1923) wrote the novel ''[[Lust for Life (novel)|Lust for Life]]'', which was later made into an Academy Awardâwinning [[Lust for Life (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Kirk Douglas]] as [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Stone also wrote ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (novel)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'', which was later made into a [[The Agony and the Ecstasy (film)|film of the same name]] starring Oscar winner [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Michelangelo]].

Simonyi later became the first repeat [[space tourist]], blasting off on Russian [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]] rockets to work at the [[International Space Station]] orbiting the earth.

In 1977, a graduate student in the computer science department named [[Bill Joy]] (MS 1982) assembled &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/fsp/2000/05/16/chapter_2_part_one/print.html|title=BSD Unix: Power to the people, from the code|author=Andrew Leonard|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=May 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original [[Berkeley Software Distribution]], commonly known as [[BSD Unix]]. Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the [[Computer display|terminal]] console editor [[vi]], while [[Ken Arnold]] (BA 1985) created [[Curses (programming library)|Curses]], a [[Computer display|terminal]] control [[Library (computer science)|library]] for [[Unix-like]] systems that enables the construction of [[Text user interface|text user interface (TUI)]] applications. Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates [[William Jolitz]] (BS 1997) and his future wife [[Lynne Jolitz]] (BA 1989), who together created [[386BSD]], a version of BSD Unix that runs on [[Intel]] CPUs and which evolved into the [[Comparison of BSD operating systems|BSD family of free operating systems]] and the [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin operating system]] underlying [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/05/17/386bsd/print.html|title=The unknown hackers â Open-source pioneers Bill and Lynne Jolitz may be the most famous programmers you've never heard of|author=Rachel Chalmers|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=May 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Allman]] (BS 1977, MS 1980) created [[SendMail]], a Unix [[mail transfer agent]] that delivers 70% of the [[email]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/1121/1121sp1.html|publisher=Network Computing|title=Sendmail Multi Switch 2.1 Gives Powerful Features a Simple Face|date=October 30, 2000|author=Moshe Bar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of Open Source, he donated the code to Sun Microsystems, inspiring [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applets( [[Kim Polese]] (BS 1984) was the original product manager for Java at Sun Microsystems.) ViolaWWW also inspired researchers at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] to create the [[Mosaic web browser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Weaving the Web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|publisher=Collins Business|date=November 7, 2001|pages=68, 83| isbn=0062515861|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering [[web browser]] that became Microsoft [[Internet Explorer]].
