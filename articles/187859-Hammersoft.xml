== History ==
Missouri State University was founded as the '''Fourth District Normal School''', by legislative action on March 17, 1905. Like other [[normal school]]s of the day, the school's primary purpose was the preparation of teachers for the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system. 

[[Image:CarringtonHall.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Carrington Hall]]The first class, totaling 543 students, started classes on June 11, 1906, in an off-campus facility. The first permanent campus building was Academic Hall. Its cornerstone was laid on August 10, 1907 and construction was completed in January 1909. The building is now known as Carrington Hall, named after William T. Carrington, the first president of the State Normal School. It serves as the University's administrative center. 

The Fourth District Normal School became '''Southwest Missouri State Teacher's College''' in 1919 to reflect its regional and academic emphasis. Throughout the [[interwar period]], the College's programs expanded to include [[liberal arts]] and sciences in the curriculum, thus facilitating a name change to '''Southwest Missouri State College''' in 1945. A burgeoning student population throughout the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the establishment of [[residence hall]]s, accompanied by a growth in post-graduate studies. This led to a third name change in 1972, to '''Southwest Missouri State University'''. In 1973, enrollment surpassed 10,000 students for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouristate.edu/about/history.htm History of the University â About Missouri State â Missouri State University]. Missouristate.edu. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1985, SMSU had grown into the second-largest [[public university]] in the state, leading administrators to support a bill to change the name to Missouri State University, which eventually died in committee in the [[Missouri General Assembly]]. In 1990, enrollment surpassed 20,000 students for the first time, but further attempts to rename the school throughout the 1990s and early 2000s also failed. However, the state legislature did grant the university a statewide mission in [[Public administration|Public Affairs]] in 1995. 

In 2004, with the election of Springfield native [[Matt Blunt]] to the governorship and the approaching [[centennial]] of the university's founding, new support developed for the name change. It was opposed by the [[University of Missouri System]] (which operates the four campuses of the University of Missouri), which feared that the name change would lead to duplication of academic programs and ongoing battles for students and state funding. In addition, &quot;Missouri State University&quot; is also a historic name of the Columbia campus, used in the late 19th century. In 2005 the name-change bill was passed, following a late-night compromise between University of Missouri System President Elson Floyd and then-Southwest Missouri State President John Keiser, stating that Missouri State University would not duplicate certain professional programs offered by the University of Missouri. The bill to rename the University finally passed the Missouri Senate (25â7). On March 1, 2005, after more than seven hours of debate, the bill passed the Missouri House (120â35). Governor Blunt signed it into law on March 17, 2005âthe centennial anniversary of the Universityâat the Plaster Student Union where several student leaders and state leaders were present.

South of that area is Pummill Hall (1957), Karls Hall (1958) and Craig Hall (1967), which contains the Coger Theater and is the site of an annual outdoor summer tent theatre program.

In the center of campus is the [[Duane G. Meyer Library]], constructed in 1980 and named after a former president of the University. It contains over 877,000 books, subscriptions to over 3,500 periodicals and newspapers with back issues on microfilm, microfiche, and microcard, and full text electronic access to over 20,000 periodicals. In addition, the library contains over 934,000 state, federal and United Nations government documents. The Meyer Library was renovated and expanded in 2002, and included the addition of the Jane A. Meyer [[Carillon]], one of only 164 such instruments in the United States. In front of Meyer Library is the five-level, multi-jet [[John Q. Hammons]] Fountain (named for the MSU alumnus and hotel developer). 

Other major academic buildings are located south and west of the Meyer Library. These include Temple Hall (1971), Kemper Hall (1976), Glass Hall (1988) and Strong Hall (1998).  The majority of the north side of the campus is dedicated to student residences and recreational areas; however, Greenwood Laboratory School, a fully functioning K-12 school, is also located in this area.

===Jane A. Meyer Carillon===
[[File:MeyerCarillonandLibrarywithHammonsFountain.jpgâ|thumb|220px|right|Duane G. Meyer Library and Jane A. Meyer Carillon with the John Q. Hammons Fountain]]The Jane A. Meyer Carillon is located in the center of the Missouri State University campus, at the southeast corner of the Duane G. Meyer Library.  At {{convert|140|ft|m}} tall, it is the tallest carillon in the Midwest United States and serves as a campus icon and focal point. It was dedicated on April 13, 2002. The total weight of the 48 bronze bells and cast-iron clappers is 32,000 pounds, with the largest bell weighing 5,894 pounds, or nearly three tons. The complete carillon and its supporting tower structure weighs 2.5 million pounds. Funds for the purchase of the bells and keyboard and for the construction of the tower were provided by Ken and Jane Meyer, longtime friends of the University and supporters of the arts.  Jane Meyer was a former organ student of the MSU Department of Music. The carillonâs 48 bronze bells, cast-iron clappers and keyboard were purchased from and installed by [[Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry|Royal Eijsbouts]], a prestigious bell making firm from the [[Netherlands]]. The carillon plays the standard [[Westminster chime]] sequence every 15 minutes, with the first of the hourly bells marking the exact start of each hour. The department of music also coordinates and presents special concerts throughout the year.

===Juanita K. Hammons Hall===
Juanita K. Hammons Hall for the [[Performing Arts]] is a 2,220-seat center located in the northwest corner of the campus. Juanita K.

Plaster Sports Complex]]. Originally built in 1930, the athletic field became the stadium in 1941 and was known for many years as Briggs Stadium in honor of Coach A. W. Briggs, longtime head of Missouri State's athletic department.  The facility was renamed after a major expansion and renovation in the 1980s that included installation of an artificial playing surface, an all-weather track, a second level of seating, twelve racquetball courts, men's and women's locker rooms, five classrooms, and a fitness center. Immediately north of Plaster Sports Complex is McDonald Arena, built by [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] labor in 1940.  It served as the university's central indoor arena until construction of the John Q. Hammons Student Center on the campus' north-west edge in 1976.  That venue was in turn replaced as the primary indoor sporting venue by construction of the adjacent 11,000-seat [[JQH Arena]] in 2008.

===IDEA Commons===
IDEA Commons, which stands for Innovation, Design, Entrepreneurship, and Art, is an urban research park in Downtown Springfield that blends together residential, retail and entertainment facilities supported by various university programs. Currently the Jordan Valley Innovation Center (JVIC) and &quot;Brick City&quot; are located within the IDEA Commons.  The JVIC  is a Missouri State University research center providing &quot;hands-on&quot; learning and experience for students, as well as support and business opportunities for affiliated businesses.

==Traditions and insignia==

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; was officially adopted as the university's fight song in the 1960s. The Fight Song is sung after every home football touchdown. [http://gomaroon.missouristate.edu/downloads/ringtones/FightSong.mp3 Audio] The traditional alumni song of Missouri State is performed at every commencement ceremony and sometimes played at athletic events or other ceremonies. [http://gomaroon.missouristate.edu/downloads/ringtones/AlmaMater.mp3 Audio]

The traditions of school colors and the school mascot were established during the 1906 school year, before the first permanent building (Carrington Hall) was even constructed. A joint committee of faculty and students decided on the colors of maroon and white to represent the University. The same committee also selected the Bear as the official school mascot, basing their choice on the design of the state seal of Missouri. The colors and mascots are reflected on the school seal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missouristate.edu/identity/seal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
'''Chinese MBA program'''
Several of the Chinese backers have expressed a desire to withdraw their support after the university received negative press about it's academic rigor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/fb8755953d06479491a54ca1a4d35193/MO--Missouri-State-Chinese/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-discrimination on basis of sexual orientation''':
In 2006, the university modified its nondiscrimination policy to include [[sexual orientation]] as an officially protected status.  The addition reads: &quot;...the University does not discriminate on any basis (including, but not limited to, political affiliation and sexual orientation) not related to the applicable educational requirements for students or the applicable job requirements for employees.&quot; Former University president John Keiser had firmly opposed the change as did the Student Government Association during 2004 when Student Body President Chris Curtis moved to change the SGA constitution to mirror the university's. However, the policy was quietly changed on September 18, 2006 during a meeting held for the first time outside of Springfield in St. Louis. It is generally believed this move was to avoid the mostly conservative citizens of Springfield and add this policy &quot;under the radar&quot; of the critics of the change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060916/NEWS01/609160373/1007 ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri Governor Matt Blunt quickly released criticism of the policy change calling it &quot;unnecessary and bad;&quot; also saying the decision &quot;bows to the forces of political correctness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldnews-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060916/NEWS01/609160374/1007 News-Leader.com | Springfield News-Leader | Springfield news, community, entertainment, yellow pages and classifieds.

'''Grading policy''':
Missouri State University converted to a plus or minus grading system instead of the standard A,B,C,D, and F system starting with the Fall 2009 term. Individual professors can decide whether to use this grading system in their classes. Under the new grading scale, a C- will not qualify as a passing grade for courses requiring a C or better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msu-underground.com/archives/389 Students discuss new plus/minus grading scale].

'''Tobacco-free campus''':

Smoking is allowed only at designated smoking areas outside JQH Arena, Plaster Stadium, Hammons Student Center, and Juanita K.
