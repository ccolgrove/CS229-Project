'''Sarah Joy Brown''' (born February 18, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmbug.com/db/21444&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]].  She is perhaps best known for originating the role of [[Carly Corinthos]], which she portrayed on the American daytime drama ''[[General Hospital]]'' from 1996 to 2001, and which earned her three [[Daytime Emmy Awards]]. In 2008, she returned to ''General Hospital'' in a different role, [[Claudia Zacchara]]. She exited ''General Hospital'' once again in 2009 and began appearing on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' in
the newly created role of [[Aggie Jones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BB&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=General Hospital' star checking into another soap |author= |newspaper=Associated Press |date=September 30, 2009 |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090930/ap_en_tv/us_tv_bold_and_beautiful_brown }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Brown was born in [[Eureka, California]], to David and Pamela Brown. She attended the Los Angeles County High School for Performing Arts. Her acting career began at the age of 19, when she was cast as Kaitlin Star on the syndicated children's show, ''[[VR Troopers]]''. In 1996, she made a guest appearance in a 3-part episode of ''[[Power Rangers: Zeo]]'' playing Heather, a girl that sparks interest in [[Tommy Oliver]] (played by [[Jason David Frank]]). An article in FOX Kids Magazine claimed a member of the VR Troopers cast would be quitting the series to become a part of the Power Rangers cast, however the aforementioned Zeo three-parter is the closest anything like this ever came to happening.

In April 1996 Brown originated the role of [[Carly Corinthos]] on the [[United States|American]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[General Hospital]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com Carly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/generalhospital/cast/325/Carly_Corinthos_Jacks|title=''General Hospital'' Cast: Carly Corinthos Jacks|publisher=Soaps.com|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown &quot;quickly became an overnight sensation&quot; and received three [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s for her portrayal of Carly.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD Who Is&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/as-the-world-turns/interviews/sarahbrown/ |title=''As the World Turns'' Interview: Who Is Sarah Brown? |last=Lenhart |first=Jennifer |publisher=SoapOperaDigest.com |accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Younger Actress]] in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/Emmys/winners1997/index.html|title=Daytime Emmy Winners &amp; Nominees: 1997|publisher=SoapOperaDigest.com|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/Emmys/winners1998/index.html|title=Daytime Emmy Winners &amp; Nominees: 1998|publisher=SoapOperaDigest.com|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/Emmys/winners1999/index.html|title=Daytime Emmy Winners &amp; Nominees: 1999|publisher=SoapOperaDigest.com|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won again for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/Emmys/winners2000/index.html|title=Daytime Emmy Winners &amp; Nominees: 2000|publisher=SoapOperaDigest.com|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she received her first Daytime Emmy nomination in the Lead Actress category for her work as Claudia Zacchara.
