Harvard was named after its first benefactor, [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]]. Although it was never formally affiliated with a church, the college primarily trained [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] clergy. Harvard's curriculum and students became increasingly secular throughout the 18th century and by the 19th century had emerged as the central cultural establishment among [[Boston Brahmin|Boston elites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Harvard and the Boston Brahmins: A Study in Institutional and Class Development, 1800â1865 |last=Story |first=Ronald |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=8 |issue=3 |year=1975 |pages=94â121|doi=10.1353/jsh/8.3.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Farrell |first=Betty G. |title=Elite Families: Class and Power in Nineteenth-Century Boston |year=1993 |isbn=0791415937 |publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[American Civil War]], President [[Charles W.

The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with [[Radcliffe College]]. [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] was elected the 28th president in 2007 and is the first woman to lead the university. Harvard has the [[List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment|largest]] [[financial endowment]] of any academic institution in the world, standing at $32 billion as of September 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;NACUBO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2009_NCSE_Public_Tables_Endowment_Market_Values.pdf |title=U.S. and Canadian Institutions Listed by Fiscal Year 2009 Endowment Market Value |publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harvard Crimson]] competes in 41 intercollegiate sports in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Ivy League]]. Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with [[Yale University]] traditionally culminating in ''[[HarvardâYale football rivalry|The Game]]'', although the [[HarvardâYale Regatta]] predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale [[Track and Field]] teams come together to compete against a combined [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale and Harvard Defeat Oxford/Cambridge Team|url=http://www.yalebulldogs.com/sports/w-track/recaps/041009aac.html|publisher=Yale University Athletics|accessdate=9/13/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Harvard University}}

===Colonial===
[[File:A Westerly View of the Colledges in Cambridge New England by Paul Revere.jpeg|thumb|Engraving of [[Harvard College]] by [[Paul Revere]], 1767]]
Harvard was founded in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Initially called &quot;New College&quot; or &quot;the college at New Towne&quot;, the institution was renamed ''[[Harvard College]]'' on March 13, 1639. It was named after [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], a young English [[clergyman]] from [[Southwark]], [[London]], an alumnus of the [[University of Cambridge]] (after which Cambridge, Massachusetts is named), who bequeathed the College his library of four hundred books and [[Pound sign|Â£]]779 [[pounds sterling]], which was half of his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;JH facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| quote = He bequeathed Â£780 (half his estate) and his library of 320 volumes to the new established college at Cambridge, Mass., which was named in his honor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter creating the corporation of Harvard College came in 1650. In the early years, the College trained many Puritan ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/guide/intro/index.html |title=The Harvard Guide: The Early History of Harvard University |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college offered a classic academic course based on the English university modelâmany leaders in the colony had attended [[Cambridge University]]âbut one consistent with the prevailing [[Puritan]] philosophy. The college was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches throughout New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harvard Office of News and Public Affairs |url=http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/intro/index.html |title=Harvard guide intro |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070726133429/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/intro/index.html |archivedate = 2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early brochure, published in 1643, described the founding of the college as a response to the desire &quot;to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Louis B. |last=Wright |title=The Cultural Life of the American Colonies |year=2002 |page=116|isbn=978-0-486-42223-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading Boston divine [[Increase Mather]] served as president from 1685 to 1701. In 1708, [[John Leverett the Younger|John Leverett]] became the first president who was not also a clergyman, which marked a turning of the College toward intellectual independence from Puritanism.

===19th century===
====Religion and philosophy====
The takeover of Harvard by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] in 1805 resulted in the [[secularization]] of the American college. By 1850 Harvard was the &quot;Unitarian Vatican.&quot; The &quot;liberals&quot; (Unitarians) allied themselves with [[Federalist Party|high Federalists]] and began to create a set of private societies and institutions meant to shore up their cultural and political authority, a movement that prefigured the emergence of the [[Boston Brahmin]] class. On the other hand, the theological conservatives used print media to argue for the maintenance of open debate and democratic governance through a diverse public sphere, seeing the liberals' movement as an attempt to create a cultural oligarchy in opposition to Congregationalist tradition and republican political principles.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Brody Miller, &quot;'Proper Subjects for Public Inquiry': the First Unitarian Controversy and the Transformation of Federalist Print Culture&quot;, ''Early American Literature'' 2008 43(1): 101â135&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, the natural history lectures of [[Louis Agassiz]] were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' 'participation in the Divine Nature' and the possibility of understanding 'intellectual existences.' Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that one can grasp the 'divine plan' in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to 'soar with Plato' probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norris, and, in a Romantic vein, [[Samuel Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the 'official philosophy' of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.&lt;ref&gt;David K. Nartonis, &quot;Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795â1846&quot;, ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 2005 66(3): 437-449, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3654189 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles W. Eliot]], president 1869â1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] convictions. Derived from [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Shoemaker, &quot;The Theological Roots of Charles W. Eliot's Educational Reforms&quot;, ''Journal of Unitarian Universalist History'' 2006â2007 31: 30-45,&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Rummell, Richard_Harvard University.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor landscape view, facing northeast. &lt;ref name=&quot;http://grahamarader.blogspot.com/2011/07/iconic-college-view-harvard-university.html&quot;&gt;[http://grahamarader.blogspot.com/2011/07/iconic-college-view-harvard-university.html &quot;Arader Galleries Iconic College Views&quot;],  ''Rummell, Richard'', Littig &amp; Co. 1915&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the 20th century, Harvard's international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Explosive growth in the student population continued with the addition of new graduate schools and the expansion of the undergraduate program. [[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States.

====Meritocracy====
[[James Bryant Conant]] (president, 1933â1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting ''Report'', published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Fay Kravitz, &quot;The Harvard Report of 1945: An historical ethnography&quot;, Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1994, 367 pages; AAT 9427558&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945â1960 admissions policies were opened up to bring in students from a more diverse applicant pool. No longer drawing mostly from rich alumni of select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college was now open to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics or Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Malka A. Older. (1996). [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=217911 Preparatory schools and the admissions process]. [[The Harvard Crimson]], January 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women====
Women remained segregated at Radcliffe, though more and more took Harvard classes. Nonetheless, Harvard's undergraduate population remained predominantly male, with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe. Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977, the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased, mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States. Harvard's graduate schools, which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college, also became more diverse in the post-World War II period.

In 1999, [[Radcliffe College]], founded in 1879 as the &quot;Harvard Annex for Women&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sally |last=Schwager |chapter=Taking up the Challenge: The Origins of Radcliffe |title=Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History |editor=Laurel Thatcher Ulrich (ed.) |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2004 |isbn=1403960984 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; merged formally with Harvard University, becoming the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].

[[Drew Gilpin Faust]], the Dean at Radcliffe, became the first woman president of Harvard in 2007.

President [[Lawrence Summers]] resigned his presidency in 2006. His resignation came just one week before a second planned vote of no confidence by the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Former president [[Derek Bok]] served as interim president. Members of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which instructs graduate students in GSAS and undergraduates in Harvard College, had passed an earlier motion of &quot;lack of confidence&quot; in Summers' leadership on March 15, 2005 by a 218â185 vote, with 18 abstentions.

The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to [[magenta]]) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when [[Charles William Eliot]], a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869â1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.

Harvard has a friendly rivalry with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], which dates back to 1900 when a merger of the two schools was frequently discussed and at one point officially agreed upon (ultimately canceled by Massachusetts courts). Today, the two schools cooperate as much as they compete, with many joint conferences and programs, including the [[Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology]], the Broad Institute, the Harvard-MIT Data Center and formerly the [[Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology]]. In addition, students at the two schools can [[cross-registration|cross-register]] in undergraduate or graduate classes without any additional fees, for credits toward their own school's degrees.

===Organization===
Harvard is governed by a combination{{clarify|date=October 2011}} of its [[Harvard Board of Overseers|Board of Overseers]] and the [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]] (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the [[President of Harvard University]]. There are 16,000 staff and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Burlington Free Press, June 24, 2009, page 11B, &quot;&quot;Harvard to cut 275 jobs&quot; Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endowment===
Harvard has the largest [[List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment|university endowment]] in the world. At the end of June 2009, it was worth $25.7 billion, about 30% less than at the same time in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;NACUBO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.boston.com/business/markets/articles/2010/01/28/harvard_endowment_leads_others_down/ |title= Harvard endowment leads others down |author= Beth Healy |date= January 28, 2010 |newspaper= The Boston Globe |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Wall Street Journal|first=John|last=Hechinger|title=Harvard Hit by Loss as Crisis Spreads to Colleges|page=A1|date=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reports&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Munk |first=Nina |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/harvard200908?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all |title=Nina Munk on Hard Times at Harvard |publisher=Vanityfair.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure,  a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone.

==Campus==
[[File:Harvard architects.png|thumb|upright|Map showing the architects and dates of construction for the buildings of the main campus near Harvard square, as of 2005. Information on other notable nearby buildings is also included.]]
Harvard's {{convert|210|acre|ha|adj=on}} main campus is centered on [[Harvard Yard]] in Cambridge, approximately {{convert|3.4|mi|km}} northwest of downtown [[Boston]] and extends into the surrounding [[Harvard Square]] neighborhood. Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and [[Harvard University Library|main libraries of the university]], academic buildings including [[Sever Hall]] and [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]], Memorial Church, and the majority of the [[List of Harvard dormitories|freshman dormitories]]. Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve [[Harvard College#House system|residential Houses]], nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the [[Charles River]]. The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quadrangle]] (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed [[Radcliffe College]] students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. The [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard MBTA station]] provides public transportation via bus service and the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line subway]].

The Harvard Business School and many of the university's athletics facilities, including [[Harvard Stadium]], are located on a {{convert|359|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus opposite the Cambridge campus in [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]. The [[John W. Weeks Bridge]] is a pedestrian bridge over the [[Charles River]] connecting both campuses. The [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]], and the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] are located on a {{convert|22|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]] approximately {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} southwest of downtown Boston and {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} south of the Cambridge campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus&quot;/&gt; A private shuttle bus connects the Longwood campus to the Cambridge campus via [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] making stops in the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] and at [[MIT]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masco.org/transit/ptsM2.htm |title=M2 Cambridge Shuttle |publisher=MASCO |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall, library, and various other student facilities. The facilities were made possible by a gift from [[Yale University]] alumnus [[Edward Harkness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exeter.edu./documents/Exeter_Bulletin/FA06_Men_Behind_the_Plan.pdf Biography] in the [http://www.exeter.edu/news_and_events/news_events_2086.aspx Exeter Bulletin]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:harvard memorial church winter 2009.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial Church in the winter]]
Radcliffe Yard, formerly the center of the campus of Radcliffe College (and now home of the Radcliffe Institute), is adjacent to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and the [[Cambridge Common]].

From 2006 - 2008, Harvard University reported on-campus crime statistics that included 48 forcible sex offenses, 10 robberies, 15 aggravated assaults, 750 burglaries, and 12 cases of motor vehicle theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-school-search.com/safety/harvard-university |title=Harvard University - Safety Report |publisher=American School Search |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite facilities===
Apart from its major Cambridge/Allston and Longwood campuses, Harvard owns and operates
[[Arnold Arboretum]], in the [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]] area of Boston;
the [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection]], in [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Harvard Forest]] in [[Petersham, Massachusetts]]; and the Villa I Tatti research center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itatti.it/ |title=Villa I Tatti: The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies |publisher=Itatti.it |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Florence]] and the Harvard Shanghai Center in China.

===Major campus expansion===
Throughout the past several years, Harvard has purchased large tracts of land in [[Allston, Boston, Massachusetts|Allston]], a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge, with the intent of major expansion southward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allston.harvard.edu/ |title=Harvard University Allston Initiative Home Page |publisher=Allston.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge. Various proposals to connect the traditional Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a [[tram]]. Ambitious plans also call for sinking part of [[Storrow Drive]] (at Harvard's expense) for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the [[Charles River]], as well as the construction of bike paths, and an intently planned fabric of buildings throughout the Allston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible.

One of the foremost driving forces for Harvard's pending expansion is its goal of substantially increasing the scope and strength of its science and technology programs. The university plans to construct two 500,000 square foot (50,000 mÂ²) research complexes in Allston, which would be home to several interdisciplinary programs, including the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and an enlarged [[Engineering]] department.

In addition, Harvard intends to relocate the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] and the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] to Allston. The university also plans to construct several new undergraduate and graduate student housing centers in Allston, and it is considering large-scale museums and performing arts complexes as well. Unfortunately the large drop in endowment has halted these plans for now.

===Sustainability===
In 2000, Harvard hired a full-time campus [[sustainability]] professional and launched the Harvard Green Campus Initiative,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard Green Campus Initiative&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Athletics==
{{Main|Harvard Crimson}}
[[File:Harvard stadium 2009h.JPG|thumb|left|[[Harvard Stadium]], home of [[Harvard Crimson]] and the [[Boston Cannons]]]]
Harvard's athletic rivalry with [[Yale University|Yale]] is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in their annual [[football (American)|football]] meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply &quot;[[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|The Game]]&quot;. While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, the Father of Football, [[Walter Camp]] (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the state-of-the-art Harvard Stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html |title=History of American Football |publisher=Newsdial.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127â128&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard has several athletic facilities, such as the [[Lavietes Pavilion]], a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the &quot;MAC&quot;, serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five story building includes two cardio rooms, an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held at all hours of the day, and an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC also offers personal trainers and specialty classes. The MAC is also home to Harvard volleyball, fencing, and wrestling. The offices of several of the school's varsity coaches are also in the MAC.

[[Weld Boathouse]] and Newell Boathouse house the women's and men's rowing teams, respectively. The men's crew also uses the Red Top complex in Ledyard, Connecticut, as their training camp for the annual [[Harvard-Yale Regatta]]. The Bright Hockey Center hosts the Harvard hockey teams, and the Murr Center serves both as a home for Harvard's squash and tennis teams as well as a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports.

As of 2006, there were 41 Division I intercollegiate [[varsity team|varsity]] sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more than at any other NCAA Division I college in the country. As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer [[athletic scholarships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harvard Office of News and Public Affairs |url=http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/students/stu6.html |title=The Harvard Guide: Financial Aid at Harvard |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-09-02 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060902182731/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/students/stu6.html |archivedate = 2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:harvard crimsons v brown 2009.JPG|thumb|Harvard v [[Brown Bears|Brown]], September 25, 2009]]
Older than ''The Game'' by 23 years, the [[Harvard-Yale Regatta]] was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the Thames river in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey]] team (with a strong rivalry against [[Cornell University|Cornell]]), [[squash (sport)|squash]], and even recently won NCAA titles in Men's and Women's [[Fencing]]. Harvard also won the [[Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships]] in 2003.

Harvard's men's ice hockey team won the school's first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989. Harvard was also the first Ivy League institution to win a NCAA championship title in a women's sport when its women's lacrosse team won the NCAA Championship in 1990.

''[[Harvard Undergraduate Television]]'' has footage from historical games and athletic events including the 2005 pep-rally before the Harvard-Yale Game. Harvard's official athletics website has more comprehensive information about Harvard's athletic facilities.

===Song===
Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are &quot;[[Ten Thousand Men of Harvard]]&quot; and &quot;[[Harvardiana]].&quot; While &quot;[[Fair Harvard]]&quot; is actually the [[alma mater]], &quot;Ten Thousand Men&quot; is better known outside the university. The [[Harvard University Band]] performs these fight songs, and other cheers, at football and hockey games. These were parodied by Harvard alumnus [[Tom Lehrer]] in his song &quot;[[Fight Fiercely, Harvard]],&quot; which he composed while an undergraduate.

Professors Dr. Richard Alpert, later known as [[Ram Dass]], and Dr. [[Timothy Leary]] were fired from Harvard in May 1963. Popular opinion attributes their discharge to their activism involving psychedelics, and the popularization and dispensation of [[psilocybin]] to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russin|first=J.

==In fiction and popular culture==
The perception of Harvard as a center of either elite achievement, or elitist privilege,{{cn|date=November 2011}}&lt;!-- cn for both aspects, possibly separate but better one discussing both --&gt;
has made it a frequent literary backdrop.
