'''Elections in Greece''' gives information on [[election]] and election results in [[politics of Greece|Greece]]. 

==Election of the legislature==

The [[Parliament of Greece|Greek Parliament]] (''Vouli ton Ellinon'') has 300 members, elected for a four-year term by a system of 'reinforced' [[proportional representation]] in 56 [[List of parliamentary constituencies of Greece|constituencies]], 48 of which are multi-seat and 8 single-seat. Seats are determined by constituency voting, and voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking their name on the party ballot. However, the party receiving the largest number of votes receives a 50-seat premium, which is filled by candidates of that party not declared elected on the lower rungs (the constituencies). 

Greek citizens aged 18 and over on the date of the election are eligible to vote, and at the age of 25 and over are also eligible to be elected to Parliament.

===Constituencies===
[[List of parliamentary constituencies of Greece|Constituencies in Greece]] have traditionally been multi-seat, and they mostly coincide with prefectures. The number of seats is adjusted once every ten years, following the decennial population census. Prefecture constituencies may not be deprived of representation, nor may they be merged with another prefecture; they may however be split into smaller constituencies if their population increases disproportionately: nevertheless this has not been done since 1967. Population changes have left eight ([[Kefalonia (constituency)|Kefalonia]], [[Lefkas]], [[Eurytania]], [[Grevena]], [[Samos Prefecture|Samos]], [[Thesprotia]], [[Phocis]] and [[Zakynthos]]) prefectures with a single parliamentary seat each, whereas some urban or suburban constituencies have seen large increases in their seat allotment over the years.  

For example the &quot;Athens B&quot; constituency (which includes the major part of the [[Athens#Athens Prefecture|Athens metropolitan area]] but excludes the [[Athens#Athens Municipality|Municipality of Athens]] itself, which forms the &quot;Athens A&quot; constituency) encompasses almost 15% of the country's electorate and consequently elects 42 members of parliament. The &quot;Athens A&quot; constituency elects 17 MPs, &quot;[[Thessaloniki]] A&quot; elects 16, [[Attica]] (excluding the four Athens and Piraeus A and B constituencies) elects 12, and the remaining constituencies elect single-digit numbers of MPs.
===Voting===
Polling takes place in school buildings on a Sunday, a festive occasion for students who are then given a four-day weekend off. The procedure is run by a presiding judge or attorney-at-law appointed by the local [[Bar association]], and secretarially assisted by local citizens selected by lot in a process resembling [[jury duty]]. Local police are available too. Local party representatives are allowed to monitor tallying; their theoretical role is to ensure transparency but in practice they are delegated the roles of ordering food for the exhausted crew.   

Traditionally, voting takes place &quot;from sunrise to sunset&quot; but times are usually rounded to the nearest &quot;top of the hour&quot; (e.g. 7 AM to 8 PM). Individual precincts may prolong voting time at the judge's discretion, if there are still voters queueing up to vote. Voters identify themselves by their [[ID card#Greece|ID card]]s and are given the full number of ballot papers for the constituency plus a blank ballot paper and an empty envelope. Then they withdraw to a secluded cubicle equipped with a lectern, pen and waste basket, where they select the ballot paper of their choice, if any, and mark the candidate(s) of their choice, if any; they cast the sealed envelope with the ballot paper in the ballot box and are given their ID card back.

Voters may select specific candidates within the party list of their choice by marking a cross next to  the candidate name or names. The maximum allowable number of crosses on the ballot paper depends on the number of seats contested. Signs other than crosses next to a candidate name may mark the ballot as invalid during tallying, as such findings may be construed to violate voting secrecy. Ballot papers with more crosses that the maximum number allowed, or without any cross, are counted in the total party tally but are disqualified during the second part of tallying, ''i.e.'' the determination of which individual candidate is elected to a seat already won by the candidate's party.  

Once on-the-spot tallying is over and the tallies reported officially, the ballots are sealed and transported to the Central Election Service of the Interior Ministry. There ballots are recounted, mainly in order to ascertain the validity or invalidity of the few ambiguously marked ballot papers.   Any unresolved matters following this recount are referred to the specially convened ''Eklogodikeion'' (Court of Election), which adjudicates and then officially publishes the names of elected MPs, so that the new Parliament may convene. The Court of Election may reconvene at any time in order to discuss appeals by candidates who failed to be elected, and also to fill seats that become vacant in the case of death or abdication of an MP. Such seats are filled by going down the preference tally of the party list that won the seat in the first place (there are no [[by-election]]s in Greece).

A peculiarity of the Greek Parliament is the suffrage given to Greek citizens permanently living abroad (about 7 million people).

===Electoral law===

Under the current electoral law of &quot;reinforced proportionality&quot;, any single party must receive at least a 3% nationwide vote tally in order to elect Members of Parliament (the so-called &quot;3% threshold&quot;). The law in its current form favours the [[first past the post]] party to achieve an absolute (151 out of 300 parliamentary seats) majority, provided it tallies about 41.5% of the total vote. This is touted to enhance governmental stability. The previous law (applied in the 2004 legislative elections) was even more favorable for the first party.  The current electoral law reserves 40 parliamentary seats for the &quot;first past the post&quot; party or coalition of parties, and apportions the remaining 260 seats proportionally according to each party's total ''valid'' vote percentage. This is slightly higher than the raw percentage reported, as there is always a small number of invalidated or &quot;blank&quot; votes (usually less than 1%), as well as the percentage of smaller parties that fail to surpass the 3% threshold, all of which are disregarded for the purpose of seat allotment.  

A rather complicated set of rules deals with rounding decimal results up or down, and ensures that the smaller a constituency is, the more strictly proportional its parliamentary representation will be. Another set of rules apportions the 40 seat premium for the largest-tallying party among constituencies.  Individual seats are apportioned by &quot;''cross of preference''&quot;.  Voters mark a cross next to the name of the candidate or candidates they prefer, the number of crosses varying from one to five depending on constituency size.  Ballots with no crosses or more crosses than allowed, count for only the party but not the individual candidates.  Tallying is done manually in the presence of representatives of all contesting parties.  Party tallying, which is easier, is done first so that returns may be announced quickly.  Individual candidate tallying is done next and can take several days.  Once the number of seats per party and constituency is determined, the seats are filled on a top-down basis from the individual cross-of-preference tallies.  Party heads and acting or past Prime Ministers are exempt from cross-of-preference voting: they are automatically placed at the top of their party list and are elected, provided their party achieves at least one seat in the particular constituency.

By constitutional provision, the electoral law can be changed by simple parliamentary majority, but a law so changed becomes enforced only in the election following the upcoming one, unless a 2/3 parliamentary supermajority (200 or more votes) is achieved. Only in the latter case is the new electoral law effective immediately.  A case in point is the current electoral law, which is roughly similar to the previous one, except it allocates a premium of ''50'' seats, instead of 40, to the first-past-the-post party.  Since this law was passed by simple majority, it will not be used for the upcoming election, but for the one after that.

===Electorate===

All Greek citizens who are 18 or over on the date of the election are eligible to vote, provided they are on the [[electoral register]], unless:
*they are imprisoned for a criminal offence '''''and''''' they have been expressly deprived of the right to vote by judicial decision (this happens only in the rare cases of [[high treason]] or [[mutiny]]).  Incarcerated persons vote in polling stations specially set up inside prisons
*they are mentally incapable of making a reasoned judgement, according to a judicial decision. In practice, this applies only to a percentage of institutionalised mental patients

In the past, citizens who reached adulthood had to register and were issued an &quot;election booklet&quot; with which they voted.  Nowadays, registration for voters is not needed: it is done automatically as each citizen comes of age.  Proof of identity is done by state-issued ID cards or passport.  Special registration is necessary only for absentee voting, which is done at the place of a voter's temporary residence on election day.  Many Greeks choose to retain their voting rights in their family's original home, sometimes by reason of tradition, sometimes by reason of patronage.  The [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] provides, following the amendment of [[2001]], for the right of Greek citizens living abroad to vote for the legislative elections. Nevertheless, no law implementing the constitutional provision has yet been passed.

[[Compulsory voting]] is the law in Greece however it is not enforced.  In the past, a citizen had to present an up-to-date election booklet in order to be issued a driver's license or a passport, or else justify why they did not vote (e.g. because of absence, infirmity, or advanced old age).  Nowadays the civic duty of voting is still considered &quot;mandatory&quot;, but there are no sanctions for failing to vote.  Turnout is usually high, typically between 70 and 80% for legislative elections and slightly lower for local administrative and European Parliament ones.

===Party system===

Before 1910, Greece lacked a coherent [[party system]] in accordance with the traits of the modern [[representative democracy]]. The political formations of the 19th century lacked a steady organizational structure and a clear ideological orientation. Sometimes, they constituted just the incoherent and ephemeral escort of a prominent politician.

The first Greek parties with an ideological background, conforming to the modern conception of a [[political party]], appeared after 1910, when [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] rose to predominance in [[politics of Greece|Greek political life]] and founded his [[Komma Fileleftheron|Liberal Party]]. The liberal wave of [[Venizelism]] resulted soon in the reaction of the &quot;old-system&quot; political leaders, who formed the core of an opposing conservative movement, which used the monarchy as its main rallying banner. Thereby, the two biggest ideological movements, the republican centrist-liberal and the monarchist conservative, emerged and formed massive political organizations. The centrist and the conservative parties bitterly confronted each other in the ensuing legislative elections for many decades, until [[metapolitefsi]]. After the ''[[metapolitefsi]]'' of 1974, the leftist-socialist movement supplanted the centrists and took the main part of their electorate. A smaller part of erstwhile centrists, along with most conservatives, affiliated themselves with the centre-right [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, which self-defined as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] party and drafted the [[republic]]an [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution of 1975]]. 

Nowadays, Greece has a [[two-party system]], which means that there are two dominant [[List of political parties in Greece|political parties]], the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy (ND)]] and the socialist [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]], with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. 

The left is mainly represented by the [[Communist Party of Greece]] and the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]]. Recent years have seen the gradual emergence of a staunchly conservative, populist party, the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]], with a platform based on nationalistic, religious and immigration issues.

==Election of the President of the Republic==
[[File:Standard of the President of Greece.svg|thumb|right|175px|The Presidential Standard of Greece]]
The [[head of state]] - the [[President]] of the Hellenic Republic -  is elected by Parliament for a five-year term, and a maximum of two terms in office. Eligible for President is any person who:
* has the Greek [[citizenship]] for at least 5 years,
* has a father or a mother of Greek origin,
* is 40 years old or more,  
* is eligible to vote. 
When a presidential term expires, Parliament votes to elect the new President. In the first two votes, a 2/3 majority (200 votes) is necessary. The third and final vote requires a 3/5 (180 votes) majority. If the third vote is fruitless, Parliament is dissolved and elections are proclaimed by the outgoing President within the next 30 days. In the new Parliament, the election for President is repeated immediately with a 3/5 majority required for the initial vote, an absolute majority (151 votes) for the second one and a simple majority for the third and final one. The system is so designed as to promote consensus Presidential candidates among the main political parties.

==European Parliament elections==

Greece has had a Delegation of [[Members of the European Parliament]] in the [[European Parliament]] since Greek accession to the EU in 1984.  Originally, the Greek delegation numbered 25, but after 2004 that was reduced to 24 (due to the increase of the EU member countries). In 2009, it was further reduced to 22. These MEPs are elected every 5 years on the basis of a [[Party-list proportional representation]] electoral system. In the [[European elections]], the whole country forms a single electoral area (constituency).

Presently, there are six Greek parties represented in the European Parliament: [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]], [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party of Greece (KKE)]], [[Coalition of the Radical Left|Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza)]], [[Popular Orthodox Rally|Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS)]] and [[Ecologist Greens]].

==Local elections==
Local administration in Greece recently underwent extensive reform in two phases: the first phase, implemented in 1997 and commonly called the &quot;[[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]] Project&quot;, consolidated the country's numerous municipalities and communities down to approximately 1000.  The second phase, initially called &quot;Kapodistrias II&quot; but eventually named the &quot;[[Callicrates]] Project&quot;, was implemented in 2010; it further consolidated municipalities down to 370, and merged the country's 54 prefectures into 13 peripheries.  The Callicratean municipalities were designed according to several guidelines; for example each island (except [[Crete]]) was formed into a single municipality, while the majority of small towns were incorporated so as to have an average municipal population of 25,000.

The first prefectural elections took place in 1994; previously, prefects were executive appointees.  Municipal elections were held since the formation of the modern Greek state, in the early 19th century.

Local administrators elected in 2010, following the Callicrates reform, are to serve a &quot;rump&quot; 3.5 year term.  Starting in 2014, peripheral and municipal elections are to be held every five years, concurrently with [[Elections_in_the_European_Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].  In all local elections, the winning candidacy list is guaranteed a minimum three-fifths majority in the respective councils.

==Plebiscites==
All the plebiscites conducted in [[Greece]] from 1920 to 1974 have had to do with the [[form of government]], namely retention/reestablishment or abolition of the [[List of Kings of Greece|monarchy]].  The last plebiscite of 1974 is deemed final and conclusive with regards to the matter of the head of the Greek state and the choice of the constitutional model of the [[parliamentary republic]], because of the overwhelming majority favoring abolition of the monarchy and the free and fair manner in which the plebiscite was conducted:

The ''current'' [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] provides for two kinds of referenda:
* a referendum concerning a &quot;passed law&quot;
* a referendum concerning a matter of &quot;national interest&quot;.
Nonetheless, these constitutional provisions have not yet been enacted into law and therefore there is no procedure for a referendum to be held.
