'''Willem Hendrik (Wim) Crouwel''' ([[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], [[1928]]) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[graphic design]]er and [[Typography|typographer]].
Between 1947 and 1949 he studied Fine Arts at [[Academie Minerva]] in Groningen, The Netherlands. In addition to that, he studied typography at what is now the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]] in [[Amsterdam]].

In 1963, he was one of the founders of the design studio [[Total Design]] (currently named Total Identity). From 1964 onwards, Crouwel was responsible for the design of the posters, catalogues and exhibitions of the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam. In 1967 he designed the [[typeface]] [[New Alphabet (typeface)|New Alphabet]], a design that embraces the limitations of the cathode ray tube technology used by early data display screens and phototypesetting equipment and thus only contains horizontal and vertical strokes. Other typefaces from his hand are [[Fodor (typeface)|Fodor]] and [[Gridnik (typeface)|Gridnik]]. In 1970 he designed the Dutch pavilion for [[Expo '70]] (Osaka, Japan). A design of Crouwel that is well known in the Netherlands is that of the Number Postage Stamps for the Dutch [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|PTT]] (in circulation from 1976â2002).

In the years Crouwel was working for Total Design, he designed many geometric [[wordmark (graphic identity)|wordmarks]],&lt;ref&gt;'Broos, K, ''Wim Crouwel: Alphabets'', BIS Publishers, Amsterdam (2003), (ISBN 90-6369-037-1)&lt;/ref&gt; one of which is the wordmark for the [[Rabobank]], designed in 1973. The lettershapes have been influenced by the fact that the wordmark had to be used as a 3D light box. After the 3D application was finalized, the 2D design for print was adapted from it.

According to Wim Crouwel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.design.nl/item/wim_crouwel_on_his_80th_birthday Wim Crouwel on his 80th birthday (www.design.nl)]&lt;/ref&gt; New Alphabet was ''âover-the-top and never meant to be really usedâ''. However, as unreadable as it was, it made a comeback in 1988 when designer [[Brett Wickens]] used a version of the font on the sleeve of [[Substance (Joy Division album)|Substance]] by [[Joy Division]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.typophile.com/node/4549 Brett Wickens on Saville Associates]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work as graphic designer, he was also active in the educational field. In the 1950s he worked as a teacher at the [[AKV St. Joost|Royal Academy for Art and Design]] in [['s-Hertogenbosch]] (currently called Akademie Voor Kunst en Vormgeving St. Joost or AKV|St. Joost) and at the predecessor of what is now the Gerrit Rietveld Academie. Between 1965 and 1985 he was connected to the department of [[industrial design]] of the [[Delft University of Technology]]. From 1987 to 1993 he was [[Professor#Netherlands|extraordinary professor]] in the fields of History, Arts and Culture Studies at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. In the years 1985â1993 he was director of the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]].

Crouwel's graphic work is especially well known for the use of [[Grid (typography)|grid]]-based layouts and typography that is rooted in the [[International Typographic Style]].
