'''''Tintin and the Picaros''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Tintin et les Picaros'''}}) is one of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', a series of classic comic-strip graphic novels, written and illustrated by Belgian writer and illustrator [[HergÃ©]], featuring young reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] as a hero.  

''Tintin et les Picaros'' is the twenty-third and final completed book in the series. Notably, several characters have undergone changes: Tintin no longer enjoys adventuring and has abandoned his trademark [[plus fours]]; [[Captain Haddock]] can no longer drink alcohol; and [[General Alcazar]]'s [[masculinity]] is ridiculed by his new dominant wife.

==Plot==
[[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] hears in the news that [[Bianca Castafiore]], her maid Irma, pianist Igor Wagner, and [[Thomson and Thompson]] have been imprisoned in [[San Theodoros]] for allegedly attempting to overthrow the military [[dictatorship]] of [[General Tapioca]], who has yet again deposed Tintin's old friend, [[General Alcazar]]. Tintin, [[Professor Calculus|Calculus]], and [[Captain Haddock|Haddock]] soon are accused themselves and, travelling to San Theodoros to clear their names (though Tintin at first refuses, only to change his mind and follow a couple of days later), find themselves caught in a trap laid by their old enemy, [[Colonel Sponsz]], who has been sent by the [[East Bloc]] nation of [[Borduria]] to assist Tapioca. Sponsz has concocted the conspiracy of which Tintin and his friends are accused in a plot to wreak revenge upon them for humiliating him in ''[[The Calculus Affair]]''. Escaping, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus join Alcazar and his small band of guerrillas, the Picaros, in the jungle near a village of the Arumbaya people.

Meanwhile, in a [[show trial]] orchestrated by Sponsz, Castafiore is sentenced to life in prison and the [[Thomson and Thompson|Thompsons]] are ordered to be executed by a [[firing squad]]. All three show great contempt at the injustice of the proceedings. Tintin enlists Alcazar's help in freeing his friends, but upon arrival at his jungle headquarters, finds that Alcazar's men have become corrupt drunkards since Tapioca started dropping copious quantities of alcohol near their camp. Additionally, Alcazar is continually henpecked by his shrewish wife, Peggy, who nags him constantly about his failure to achieve a successful revolution. Fortunately, Calculus has invented a pill that makes alcohol disgusting to anyone who ingests it (which he proves to have tested on Haddock, much to the latter's annoyance). Tintin offers to use the pill to cure the Picaros of their [[alcoholism]] if Alcazar agrees to refrain from killing Tapioca and his men. Alcazar reluctantly agrees. Moments after his men are cured, [[Jolyon Wagg]] arrives with his musical troupe the Jolly Follies, who intend to perform at the upcoming carnival in San Theodoros. Alcazar, with a little advice from Tintin, launches an assault on Tapioca's palace during the carnival by 'borrowing' the troupe's costumes and sneaking his men into the capital. He topples Tapioca, but on Tintin's urging, does not execute him, as is the tradition. Tapioca is instead forced to publicly surrender his powers to Alcazar, and is banished, while a disappointed Sponsz is sent back to Borduria.

Meanwhile, Thomson and Thompson are due to be shot on the same day as the carnival. Although as naive as ever in their observations, the detectives show courage by refusing to be blindfolded. Tintin and Haddock reach the state prison in time to prevent the executions from occurring. Castafiore, her maid, and her pianist are also released, and Alcazar can finally give his wife the palace he has promised. With all matters resolved, Tintin and his friends leave. As they fly home, Tintin and Haddock express gratitude about being able to go home.

The second-to-last panel shows a final, skeptical political message: as under Tapioca, the city slums are filled with wretched, starving people and patrolled by apathetic police. Nothing has changed, except the police uniforms and a ''Viva Tapioca'' sign that has been changed to read ''Viva Alcazar''.

==Changes from earlier books==

''Tintin and the Picaros'' features changes in the representation of Tintin. The most visible change is that his [[trousers]] have been modernized, as he wears [[bell bottoms]] rather than the [[plus fours]] that he had always worn previously. In addition, the book introduces some new hobbies that Tintin had not previously engaged in: he is shown practicing [[yoga]] in his spare time, and riding a motorbike; his helmet is marked with the [[Peace symbol]].

==Wordplay==
As in ''[[The Broken Ear]]'', the original French text of ''Tintin and the Picaros'' features an invented language for the Arumbaya Indians that is based on [[Marols]], the [[Brussels]] dialect spoken by HergÃ©'s grandmother. The English translation replaces this with a language that is a phonetic rendering of [[Cockney]] English. When offering food, Chief Avakuki (&quot;'ave a cookie&quot;) says &quot;Owzah g'rubai&quot; (&quot;'Ow's the grub, eh?&quot;), &quot;Oozfah sek 'unds&quot; (who's for seconds), &quot;Ava'n ip&quot; ('Ave a nip) and &quot;goh blimeh! Wa'samma ta, li li li va? Lem eshoya!&quot; (&quot;Cor blimey! What's the matter, lily liver? Let me show ya!&quot;) Similarly the ancient pyramid featured on the front cover is called Hotwattabotl in the translation ([[hot water bottle]]).

==Allusions to other works==
During the Carnival, masks and [[costumes]] of different cartoon and film characters are seen, such as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Asterix (character)| Asterix]], [[Snoopy]], [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Zorro]].

==Deleted Page==
[[Image:Colonel Sponz 5 and Colonel Alvarez.jpg|thumb|Colonels Sponsz and Alvarez in a scene drawn for ''Tintin and the Picaros'', but not included in the final book.]]
In the course of illustrating the story, HergÃ© found that he had gone beyond the 62-page limit required by his publishers. Therefore, he took out a page that follows the one in which Tintin has shown Haddock all the [[Covert listening device|bug]]s and hidden cameras in their villa, and Sponsz has told Alvarez how it was he who framed Castafiore.

The deleted scene has Sponsz announcing how he will break his enemies and throws his glass to the floor, but it is of the unbreakable variety and bounces back and breaks the moustache of a bust of KÃ»rvi-Tasch. Alvarez bursts into laughter, before being put in his place and asked to bring in &quot;you-know-who&quot; (most likely [[Pablo (Tintin character)|Pablo]] who appears in the following page). Sponsz suspects that Alvarez will claim that he broke the bust deliberately. He thus warns the young officer about his prospects for advancement. Alvarez gets the message and Sponsz tells him to &quot;sack that clumsy cleaning lady who broke [[KÃ»rvi-Tasch]]'s [[moustache]].&quot; The scene was deleted because it was similar to the scene in [[Flight 714]], where [[Rastapopoulos]] claims he will crush Tintin like a spider, but then fails to trample the animal. 

This deleted scene was later used in an article in which HergÃ© demonstrated how a single page in a comic book was developed from rough sketches to a fully drawn and colourised page.
