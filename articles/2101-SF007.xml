'''''Asterix''''' or '''''The Adventures of Asterix''''' ({{lang-fr|'''AstÃ©rix'''''   or '''''AstÃ©rix le Gaulois'''}}, {{IPA-fr|asteÊiks lÉ É¡olwa|IPA}}) is a [[List of Asterix volumes|series]] of [[French language|French]] [[comic book]]s written by [[RenÃ© Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Albert Uderzo]] (Uderzo also took over the job of writing the series after the death of Goscinny in 1977). The series first appeared in French in the magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' on October 29, 1959. As of 2009, 34 comic books in the series have been released.

The series follows the exploits of a village of indomitable [[Gaul]]s as they resist [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their [[druid]], which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], along with his friend [[Obelix]] have various adventures. The &quot;ix&quot; suffix of both names echoes the name of [[Vercingetorix]], a historical Gaul chieftain. In many cases, the stories have them travel to various countries around the world, though other books are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.

The Asterix series is one of the most popular [[Franco-Belgian comics]] in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most [[Europe]]an countries. Asterix is less well known in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].

The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into [[List of Asterix films|13 films]]: eight animated, and five with live actors. There have also been a number of [[List of Asterix games|games]] based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, [[Parc AstÃ©rix]], is themed around the series. To date, 325&amp;nbsp;million copies of 34 Asterix books have been sold worldwide, making co-creators RenÃ© Goscinny and Albert Uderzo France's bestselling authors abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volumes-sold&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last= volumes-sold | title = Asterix the Gaul rises sky high | url= http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-43015020091008 | work=Reuters | date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Buzz.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-3-2004-54995.asp |title=Goscinny and Uderzo |author=Sonal Panse |date= |work= |publisher=Buzzle.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to creating the Asterix series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', which was published in the [[Tintin (magazine)|''Tintin'']] magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comic creator&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lambiek.net/home.htm|title=RenÃ© Goscinny|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Comic creator |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''AstÃ©rix'' was originally serialised in the magazine ''[[Pilote]]'', in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pilote-1959&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =BDoubliÃ©es | title =Pilote annÃ©e 1959 | url =http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the first book was put together entitled ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]''. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis.

Uderzo's first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kessler |first1= Peter |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Asterix Complete Guide |trans_title= |url= |accessdate= 11 March 2010 |type= |edition= First |series= |volume= |date=2 |year=1995 |month=Nov |origyear= |publisher=Hodder Children's Books;  |location= |isbn=0340653469 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing popularity of Asterix with the readers, the financial backing for Pilote ceased. Pilote was taken over by [[Dargaud|Georges Dargaud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;/&gt;

When Goscinny died, Uderzo continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He continued the series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny's albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions [[Albert-RenÃ©]], which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler Peter&quot;/&gt; However, [[Dargaud]], the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-RenÃ©, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).

Although Uderzo declared he did not want anyone to continue the series after his death, which is similar to the request [[HergÃ©]] made regarding his ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', his attitude changed and in December 2008 he sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company and now own the rights. This has provoked a family row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techland.com/2009/01/21/an-open-letter-to-albert-uderzo/ |title=An Open Letter to Albert Uderzo |author=Matt Selman|date=21 January 2009|work= |publisher=Techland.com |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, has attacked her father's decision for selling the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new ''AstÃ©rix'' adventures after his death. She is reported as saying &quot;...the co-creator of ''AstÃ©rix'', Franceâs comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans - the men of industry and financeâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shirbon | first=Estelle | work=[[Reuters]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | title=Asterix battles new Romans in publishing dispute| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE50D46K20090114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm | title=Divisions emerge in Asterix camp | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | work=[[BBC News Online]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Goscinny also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodoi.info/magazine/2009-01-20/anne-goscinny-%C2%ABasterix-a-eu-deja-eu-deux-vies-du-vivant-de-mon-pere-et-apres-pourquoi-pas-une-troisieme%C2%BB/10581|title=Anne Goscinny: Â«AstÃ©rix a eu dÃ©jÃ  eu deux vies, du vivant de mon pÃ¨re et aprÃ¨s.

''[[Asterix Conquers Rome]]'' is a comic book adaptation of the animated film ''[[The Twelve Tasks of Asterix]]''. It was released in 1976, making it technically the 23rd ''Asterix'' volume to be published. But it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to the series. The only English translation ever to be published were in the ''Asterix Annual 1980'' and as a standalone volume in 1984.

In 2007, Les Editions Albert RenÃ© released a tribute volume titled ''[[AstÃ©rix et ses Amis]]'', a 60 pages comic book made up of various short stories (from one to four pages). It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on the occasion of his 80th birthday by 34 renowned European comics artists. The volume was translated into nine languages, but has not yet been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asterix.com/edition/albums-hors-collection/asterix-et-ses-amis.html |title=Les albums hors collection - AstÃ©rix et ses Amis - Hommage Ã  Albert Uderzo |publisher=Asterix.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis and characters==
{{Main|Characters in Asterix}}
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village in [[Armorica]], a province of [[Gaul]] (modern [[France]]), in the year 50 BC. [[Julius Caesar]] has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the [[Roman Empire]]. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village [[druid]], [[Getafix]].

The main protagonist and hero of the village is [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and unintelligent friend, [[Obelix]], who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength. Obelix is usually accompanied by [[Dogmatix]], his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language.  For example, Obelix's dog's name is &quot;Dogmatix&quot; in English, but &quot;IdÃ©fix&quot; in the original French edition.)

Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul ([[Lutetia]], [[Corsica]] etc.), neighbouring nations ([[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Germany]] etc.), and far away lands ([[North America]], [[Middle East]], [[India]] etc.).

The series employs [[science-fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of [[extraterrestrials]] in ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]'' and the city of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]''.

==Humour==

The humour encountered in the ''Asterix'' comics is typically French{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, often centering on puns, caricatures, and [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[stereotype]]s of contemporary European nations and [[List of regions in France|French regions]]. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the [[Italian language|Italian]] translation, the Roman legionnaires are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous &quot;''Ils sont fous ces romains''&quot; (&quot;These Romans are crazy&quot;) is translated as &quot;Sono pazzi questi romani&quot;, alluding to the Roman abbreviation ''[[SPQR]]''. In another example: [[Hiccups]] are written [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] in French as &quot;hips,&quot; but in English as &quot;hic,&quot; allowing Roman legionnaries in at least one of the English translations to [[declension|decline]] their hiccups in Latin (&quot;hic, haec, hoc&quot;). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm |title=The vital statistics of Asterix |author= |date=18 October 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this [[stereotyping]], and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French [[chauvinism]], the humour has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world.

==Translations==
The 34 books or albums (one of which is a compendium of short stories) in the series have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects. Besides the original [[French language|French]], most albums are available in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[English language|English]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (and [[Brazilian Portuguese]]), [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|modern Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Asterix around the World&quot;/&gt; as well as [[Latin]]. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.asterix.com/encyclopedia/translations/asterix-in-latin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[Finland]], [[Poland]] and especially in [[Germany]], several volumes were translated into a variety of regional [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s, such as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Breton language|Breton]], Chtimi ([[Picard language|Picard]]) and [[Corsican language|Corsican]] in France, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]], [[Swabian German|Swabian]] and [[Low German]] in Germany, [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] and [[Silesian language|Silesian]] in Poland, and [[Savonian dialects|Savo]], [[Karelia]], [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] and [[Helsinki slang]] dialects in Finland. Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, [[Asterix the Gaul]], was translated into local language [[Mirandese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Asterix.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asterix.com/encyclopedia/translations/ |title=Translations |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Asterix.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the [[Cretan Greek]], [[Cypriot Greek]] and [[Pontic Greek]] dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = List of Asterix comics published in Greece by Mamouth Comix | url =http://www.mamouthcomix.gr/asterix/index.html | language = Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the [[Romanesco|Romanesque]] dialect. In former Yugoslavia, &quot;Forum&quot; publishing house translated Corsican in &quot;[[Asterix in Corsica]]&quot; into Montenegrin dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]] (today called [[Montenegrin language]]).

In the [[Netherlands]] several volumes were translated into [[West Frisian language|Frisian]], a language related to [[Old English language|Old English]] spoken in the province of [[Friesland]]. Also in the Netherlands two volumes were translated into [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], a regional language spoken not only in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]] but also in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany]]. [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]-language books have been issued in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] for the [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority living in [[Serbia]]. Although not a fully autonomic dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in [[Hungary]]. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] (''Singhalese'') as Sura Pappa, the only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asterix.com&quot;/&gt;

Most volumes have been translated into [[Latin]] and [[Attic Greek|Ancient Greek]] with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.

*The first [[France|French]] satellite, which was launched in 1965, was named ''[[AstÃ©rix (satellite)|AstÃ©rix-1]]'' in honour of Asterix. Asteroid [[29401 Asterix]] was also named in honor of the character. Coincidentally, the word Asterix/Asterisk originates from the Greek for ''Little Star''.
*During the campaign for [[Paris]] to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] Asterix appeared in many posters over the [[Eiffel Tower]].
*The French company [[Kraft Foods|Belin]] introduced a series of &quot;Asterix&quot; [[potato chips]] shaped in the forms of [[scutum (shield)|Roman shields]], [[gourd]]s, [[wild boar]], and [[bone]]s.
* In the UK in 1995, Asterix coins were presented free in every [[Nutella]] jar.
* Asterix and Obelix appeared on the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' for a special edition about [[France]].

* ''[[Action Comics]]'' Number 579, published by [[DC Comics]] in 1986, written by [[Jean-Marc Lofficier|Lofficier]] and Illustrated by [[Keith Giffen]], featured an homage to Asterix where [[Superman]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] are drawn back in time to a small village of indomitable Gauls.
* [[Lisa Simpson]] is delighted at the sight of a rack with [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]] and Asterix comics in a comic book store, depicted in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Husbands and Knives]]&quot;.
* In the episode &quot;Goodnight Mr. Bean&quot;, Mr. Bean and Teddy are reading an Asterix comic book.

* On 29 October 2009, the Google homepage of a great number of countries displayed a logo commemorating 50 years of Asterix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com.tw/logos/asterix09.gif |title= Asterix's anniversary|author= Google |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
