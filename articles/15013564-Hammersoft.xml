The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Baltimore Ravens]]''' season was the 13th season for the team in the [[NFL]].  Despite having one of the toughest schedules in the NFL, the Ravens completed a major turnaround from the 2007 season, finishing the season with an 11â5 record and a [[playoff]] berth.  They defeated the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the Wild Card round of the playoffs, and then in the divisional round they defeated the [[Tennessee Titans]], who had compiled the best record in the AFC over the regular season.  However, in the [[AFC championship]] game, the Ravens' season came to an end as they were defeated by eventual [[Super Bowl XLIII]] champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

==Offseason==
===Coaching staff===
====Head Coach====
On December 31, 2007, [[Brian Billick]] was fired after coaching the team to a 5â11 record, finishing last overall in the AFC North Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/sports/football/brian-billick-PESPT008384.topic Brian Billick fired as Ravens Head Coach following 9 seasons]&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, on January 18, 2008, [[John Harbaugh]] was hired to replace Brian Billick as the third head coach in the franchise's young history. Harbaugh was the defensive secondary coach for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], coaching such players as [[Pro Bowl]] [[cornerback]] [[Lito Sheppard]] and [[Safety (American football position)|free safety]] [[Brian Dawkins]]. As the Baltimore Ravens Head Coach, he is scheduled to serve in that capacity until at least the end of the 2011 season, after signing a four year contract with the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3203489 Go.com], John Harbaugh becomes third Head Coach in Ravens history&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coordinators====
After not having a true [[offensive coordinator]] during the 2007 season (Billick had assumed those duties early in the 2006 season after firing [[Jim Fassel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/ravens/2006-10-17-fassel-fired_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Ravens fire offensive coordinator Jim Fassel | date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although [[Rick Neuheisel]] had been listed on the coaching staff in that capacity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/15/AR2007011500798.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Ravens Promote Neuheisel To Offensive Coordinator | first=David | last=Ginsburg | date=January 15, 2007 | accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) addressing this position was as much of a priority for new Head Coach John Harbaugh as it was for owner [[Steve Bisciotti]] to find a new Head Coach for his team, at the time. Recently dismissed as head coach from the Miami Dolphins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/dolphins/2008-01-03-cameron-fired_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Dolphins fire Cam Cameron after 1â15 season | date=January 4, 2008 | accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cam Cameron|Malcolm 'Cam' Cameron]] was highly sought after for his offensive expertise from his time in San Diego with the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]]. After some deliberation amongst offers he received from around the league, Cameron chose to come to the Ravens, and John Harbaugh announced him as the offensive coordinator on January 23, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3210229 ESPN â Cameron joins Ravens as offensive coordinator â NFL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rex Ryan]] was 'released from duty' as the team's [[defensive coordinator]], but was still under contract to the Ravens as a defensive coordinator in name for one more year, should new Head Coach John Harbaugh decide to hire him onto his staff, thus making him ineligible to accept the same position with any other NFL football team. Ryan, at the time was applying for a head coaching position himself, but got no offers for any of the four head coaching vacancies in [[Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta]], his own team in Baltimore, Miami, or in [[Washington Redskins|Washington]]. On January 28, 2008, Ryan was re-hired as the Ravens' Defensive Coordinator and was subsequently promoted to Assistant Head Coach/Defensive Coordinator after rumors of potential Redskins Head Coach Jim Zorn circulated that he wanted Ryan to coach the Redskins as its defensive coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoreravens.com/News/Articles/2008/01/Rex_Ryan_Named_Assistant_Head_Coach_Defensive_Coordinator.aspx Baltimore Ravens | News | Rex Ryan Named Assistant Head Coach / Defensive Coordinator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/blog/2008/01/report_redskins_pursuing_ryan.html baltimoresun.com â Moving the Chains: Report: Redskins pursuing Ryan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/23/AR2008012302806.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Redskins, Zorn Talk Offense | date=January 24, 2008 | accessdate=April 22, 2010 | first=Jason | last=La Canfora}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Offseason / Free agency====
During the 2008 [[Free Agency]] period, the Ravens acquired [[linebacker]] [[Brendan Ayanbadejo]] from the [[Chicago Bears]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbal.com/stories/templates/ravens.aspx?articleid=3098&amp;zoneid=23 Brendan Ayanbadejo Talks Ravens With Steve â Baltimore Ravens on WBAL Radio â wbal.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and cornerback [[Frank Walker (American football)|Frank Walker]] from the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoreravens.com/News/Articles/2008/03/Ravens_Sign_CB_Frank_Walker.aspx Baltimore Ravens | News | Ravens Sign Cornerback Frank Walker; Kicker E.J. Cochrane Added&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both were added to the Ravens roster primarily for their special teams ability, but also to fulfill a pressing need for depth at two positions which were diminished by injuries as the [[2007 Baltimore Ravens season|2007 season]] wore on. On February 28, 2008, [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Mike Flynn (offensive lineman)|Mike Flynn]] was released after failing his annual physical. Flynn was one of the few players remaining from the team's [[Super Bowl]] championship season in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoreravens.com/News/Articles/2008/02/Ravens_Release_Flynn.aspx Ravens Release Flynn]&lt;/ref&gt; 
After suffering multiple injuries and having to be placed on [[injured reserve]] during the [[2007 Baltimore Ravens season|2007 season]], veteran quarterback [[Steve McNair]] announced his retirement from the NFL after 13 combined seasons with the Ravens and [[Houston Oilers|Titans]] on April 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3351086 ESPN â McNair retires: 'Physically, I couldn't do it anymore' â NFL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Until McNair actually files his retirement papers, please leave this last statement AS IS.

Thank You. --&gt;

====2008 NFL Draft====
The Baltimore Ravens had nine selections going into in the [[2008 NFL Draft]], including four [[NFL Draft#Compensatory picks|compensatory selections]]. The Ravens traded the eighth overall pick to the Jaguars for Jacksonville's first-round choice (26th overall) as well as two third-round selections (71st and 89th) and a fourth-round (125th) pick. The Ravens then traded the 26th overall pick as well as their third-round (89th) and sixth-round (173) picks to Houston for its first-round (18th) pick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/draft/tracker#tab:dt-by-team NFL Events: Draft Tracker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ravens traded their 38th overall pick to the Seattle Seahawks for their second-round pick and gained another selection in the third-round, which were at 55 and 86, respectively. The Ravens then traded their second fourth-round pick (125th overall) to the Oakland Raiders for cornerback [[Fabian Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidebayarea.com/raiders/ci_9074381 Raiders trade Fabian Washington to Ravens]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule==
===Strength of schedule===
The Ravens, in addition to facing its [[AFC North]] counterparts, faced opponents from the [[AFC South]] Division and the [[NFC East]] Division. They also faced the [[Oakland Raiders]] from the [[AFC West]] Division and the [[Miami Dolphins]] from the [[AFC East]] Division based on the 2002â2009 NFL scheduling formula because of their fourth place finish in the AFC North Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballinjuries.com/rotation.htm Explanation of 2002 â 2009 scheduling formula]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ravens and [[Minnesota Vikings]] had the fourth toughest strength of schedule in the NFL based on its aforementioned opponents' win to loss ratio from the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], with its opponents winning 55.1% of their scheduled games in 2007. The only three teams with tougher strength of schedules are the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] (3rd) with a 55.9% opponents' winning percentage, the [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2nd) with a 59.4% opponents' winning percentage, and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] have the toughest strength of schedule in the 2008 season with an opponents' winning percentage of 59.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08160/888352-66.stm?cmpid=sports.xml. | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Ed Bouchette on the Steelers: Penguins will learn success has a price | date=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming off an unexpected bye week, the Ravens looked to improve their division standing in the AFC North, playing host to the 0â2 Cleveland Browns. Joe Flacco threw his first career interception in the first quarter, which was scoreless for both teams. The Browns, however, capitalized on the turnover by driving 52 yards for a touchdown, finishing the drive with [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] completing a 19 yard pass to [[Jerome Harrison]]. Baltimore would respond with [[Willis McGahee]] scoring on a 5 yard touchdown run, his first of the season.

Strong Safety [[Dawan Landry]] suffered a mild spinal injury and was taken to the hospital, where X-rays were negative for damage. In the second half, Baltimore won the turnover battle and their defense proved to be the deciding factor in this contest. After [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] delivered a big hit on Browns' Tight End [[Kellen Winslow]] while deflecting a pass, [[Chris McAlister]] intercepted the tipped ball and returned the interception to the Browns 10 yard line. Four plays later, Fullback [[Le'Ron McClain]] would score on a 1 yard run. On the next possession, [[Ed Reed]] intercepted a Derek Anderson pass intended for Tight End [[Steve Heiden]] and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown. After forcing another 3-and-out, Baltimore would capitalize on a Browns personal foul from the 50 yard line, driving 35 yards for a touchdown, finishing the drive with a 1 yard run from Le'Ron McClain. The Browns tried to rally late in the game, but [[Samari Rolle]] intercepted Derek Anderson with less than two minutes to play, ensuring no chance of a comeback.

With the win, and the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] losing 15 â 6 to the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], the Ravens not only improve to 2â0; they now lead the AFC North after 3 weeks.

Coming off their season-sweep over the Browns, the Ravens flew to [[Reliant Stadium]] for a Week 10 duel with the [[Houston Texans]]. Both Baltimore and Houston were originally scheduled to play each other during Week 2 of the 2008 NFL season, but the game was rescheduled to Week 10 due to structural damage to Reliant Stadium, which was caused by [[Hurricane Ike]].

On the next play, Texans OT [[Duane Brown]] committed a holding penalty while in his own endzone, giving the Ravens a safety.  Baltimore would increase their lead as rookie kicker [[Steven Hauschka]] got a 54-yard field goal.  The Texans would close out the half as Brown nailed a 48-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Ravens increased their lead as RB [[Willis McGahee]] got a 1-yard TD run.  Houston would answer as QB [[Sage Rosenfels]] completed a 60-yard TD pass to WR [[Kevin Walter]].

The Ravens wore their alternate uniforms in the game, hosting cross-conference rivals The [[Washington Redskins]] at [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]]. The Ravens scored early following an [[Ed Reed]] interception that set up a short touchdown pass from [[Joe Flacco]] to [[Le'Ron McClain]]. With just under ten minutes to go, Washington ran [[Clinton Portis]] up the middle for a first down, but Portis fumbled. Raven Ed Reed recovered the ball and advanced it for a touchdown; the Redskins unsuccessfully challenged, contending Portis was down by contact. Those would be the only points on the board for either team in the first half.

In the second half, a long Ravens drive beginning at just under eleven minutes to go in the third quarter set up a 32-yard [[Matt Stover]] field goal. The Redskins answered with a drive starting late in the third quarter and ending in the early fourth quarter that set up a 43-yard [[Shaun Suisham]] field goal. Receiving the kickoff, Baltimore ran just two plays before surrendering the ball to Washington on a [[Willis McGahee]] fumble that led to a short drive capped by a touchdown pass from [[Jason Campbell]] to [[Antwaan Randle El]]. Another kickoff led to a very long Baltimore drive that consumed most of the remaining time. Ten of twelve plays were runs by Le'Ron McClain. A 28-yard touchdown pass to [[Derrick Mason]] capped this drive. With three and a half minutes left, the Redskins next drive ended in an Ed Reed interception that enabled Baltimore to burn most of the remaining time. The Redskins took possession for their final series with 0:16 remaining but could not score.

With the win, Baltimore improved to 9â4.

Coming off their wild card road win over the Dolphins, the Ravens flew to [[LP Field]] for their AFC Divisional showdown with the top-seeded [[Tennessee Titans]], in an attempt to avenge their Week 5 loss.

The Titans struck first with 4:45 remaining in the 1st quarter, with running back [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]] capping off a 65-yard drive with an 8-yard touchdown run.  The Ravens responded with an 80-yard drive, ending with a 48-yard touchdown pass from rookie quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] to wide receiver [[Derrick Mason]]. Both teams' defense dominated the 2nd and 3rd quarters with neither team scoring. Early in the 4th quarter, Baltimore kicker [[Matt Stover]] got a 21-yard field goal, which gave the Ravens a 3-point lead.  Tennessee would try to respond, by going 10 plays and using up 5 minutes of clock to drive down inside the Ravens 10 yard line, but Collin's pass to Crumpler was fumbled and recovered by Ravens' cornerback [[Fabian Washington]] at the Ravens' 1.  Unable to move the ball, the Ravens punted the ball back to the Titans. From the Ravens 42, Tennessee drove down inside the 10 yard line again, but settled for a 27-yard field goal from kicker [[Rob Bironas]] to tie the game at 10â10.  With 4:17 left in the game, the Ravens started a drive from their own 26-yard line. On a crucial 3rd and 2, Flacco completed a 23-yard pass to tight end [[Todd Heap]].  The drive ended with Stover kicking a 43-yard field goal to give the Ravens the lead with :57 remaining in the game. The Ravens' defense then held, preserving the victory.

With the win, not only did Baltimore improve their overall record to 13â5, but they also advanced to the [[AFC Championship Game]] against their AFC North Rival, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Joe Flacco became the first quarterback in NFL history to win two playoff games in his rookie year.

Coming off their road win over the top-seeded Titans, the Ravens flew to [[Heinz Field]] for the [[AFC Championship Game]] against their hated divisional rival, the #2 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (in Round 3 of their 2008 series).

Baltimore would trail early in the first quarter as Steelers kicker [[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] kicked a 34-yard and a 42-yard field goal.  Pittsburgh would add onto their lead in the second quarter as quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] completed a 65-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Santonio Holmes]].  The Ravens would close out the half as running back [[Willis McGahee]] scored a touchdown on a 3-yard run.

In the third quarter, the Steelers would respond to Baltimore's score with Reed nailing a 46-yard field goal.  The Ravens would creep closer as McGahee rushed for a 1-yard touchdown.  However, in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh pulled away as safety [[Troy Polamalu]] returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown.  Baltimore tried to mount a comeback, but the Steelers' defense was too much to overcome.

With the loss, the Ravens' season ended with an overall record of 13â6.

McGahee, near the end of the fourth quarter, was in a vicious collision with Pittsburgh safety [[Ryan Clark (American football)|Ryan Clark]].  He was conscious, yet had to be carted off the field, due to some neck pains. On January 19, 2009, the Ravens released news that McGahee is expected to make a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoreravens.com/News/Articles/2009/01/McGahee_Statement.aspx Willis McGahee Injury Update]&lt;/ref&gt;
