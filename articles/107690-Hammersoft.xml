'''Torrance''' is a [[city]] incorporated in 1921 and located in the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] (southwestern) region of [[Los Angeles County, California]], [[United States]].  Torrance has {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of shore-front beaches on the [[Pacific Ocean]], quieter and less well-known by tourists than others on the [[Santa Monica Bay]], such as those of neighboring [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] and [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]]. Torrance enjoys a moderate year-round climate with warm temperatures, sea breezes, low humidity and an average rainfall of 12.55&amp;nbsp;inches per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;[http://www.ci.torrance.ca.us/889.htm City of Torrance Website: About Torrance] Retrieved 2009-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torrance population was 145,438 at the 2010 census. This residential and light-high-tech industries city has 90,000 street trees and 30 city parks.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt; Torrance is the birthplace of the [[American Youth Soccer Organization|AYSO â ''American Youth Soccer Organization'']].

==History==
Torrance was originally part of the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] homeland for thousands of years. In 1784 the Spanish [[Ranchos of California|land grant]] for [[Rancho San Pedro]], in the upper [[Las Californias]] Province of [[New Spain]] and encompassing present day Torrance, was issued to [[Juan Jose Dominguez]] by [[King Carlos III]]âthe [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.csudh.edu:2006/cdm4/RanchoSanPedro.php The Rancho San Pedro Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cameron Gillingham, 1961, ''The Rancho San Pedro'', Cole Holinquist&lt;/ref&gt; It was later divided in 1846 with Governor [[PÃ­o Pico]] granting [[Rancho de los Palos Verdes]] to JosÃ© Loreto and Juan Capistrano Sepulveda, in the [[Alta California]] territory of independent [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogden Hoffman, 1862, ''Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California'', Numa Hubert, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb9489p1s9/?&amp;brand=oac DiseÃ±o del Rancho de los Palos Verdes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, real estate developer [[Jared Sidney Torrance]] and other investors saw the value of creating a mixed [[Industry|industrial]]-[[residential]] community south of [[Los Angeles]]. They purchased part of an old Spanish land grant and hired landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] to design a new planned community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellotorrance.com/History.Cfm http://www.hellotorrance.com/History.Cfm] ''hellotorrance.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting town was founded in October 1912 and named after Torrance. The city of Torrance was formally incorporated in May 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.torrance.ca.us/8762.htm http://www.ci.torrance.ca.us/8762.htm] ''ci.torrance.ca.us''&lt;/ref&gt; The first residential avenue created in Torrance was Gramercy and the second avenue was Andreo. Many of the house on these avenues turn 100 years of age in 2012. Both avenues are located in the area referred to as [[Old Town Torrance]]. This section of Torrance is under review to be classified as a [[historical district]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.torrance.ca.us http://www.ci.torrance.ca.us] ''ci.torrance.ca.us''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the early civic and residential buildings were designed by the renowned and innovative [[Southern California]] [[architect]] [[Irving Gill]], in his distinctive combining of [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] and early [[Modern architecture|Modernist architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://torrancehistoricalsociety.org/ . accessed 8/28/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the [[El Nido, Los Angeles County, California|El Nido]] neighborhood was home to many European immigrants, such as originally [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Germans|German]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] people; soon joined by [[Mexican-American]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] immigrants; employed in the growing early 20th century agriculture, petroleum, and manufacturing industries, such as the fish canneries. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Rapid new growth in Torrance began after [[World War II]] as wartime industries transformed into [[Post-war]] [[Aerospace manufacturer]]s and related technology industries. Large housing developments were built in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate the new population. Torrance moved on after the closure of some aerospace development and oil refinery plants in the 1990s statewide recession. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Torrance survived the deindustrialization, regional economic slowdowns and national recessions in the 1970s to 2000s. Large-scale [[Asian American|Asian]] immigration in the past couple of decades has transformed Torrance into a diverse and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] city.

The [[Del Amo Fashion Center]], at 2.5 million square feet (232,000 mÂ²), is one of the largest [[shopping mall|malls]] in the [[United States]]. Estimates vary between the second largest (after the [[Mall of America]]) and the fourth largest, depending on the measurements used.  The current mall was created when Del Amo Center, built in 1958, merged with Del Amo Fashion Square, built in 1970.  Once located on opposite sides of Carson Street, a gigantic expansion of the mall spanning Carson Street joined the two centers by 1982, making it the longest mall in the world at the time.  In 2005, the east end of the original mall north of Carson Street was demolished to make way for a new open-air shopping center, opened in mid-September, 2006. The new center features upscale clothiers [[Anthropologie]], [[Coach, Inc.|Coach]], [[H&amp;M]] and [[Urban Outfitters]] as well as the restaurant [[P. F. Chang's China Bistro|P.F. Chang's]]. The housewares retail giant [[Crate and Barrel|Crate &amp; Barrel]] opened in what was once a section of the mall parking lot in Spring 2007. Torrance also borders the [[South Bay Galleria]], which resides in Redondo Beach.

The [[Armed Forces Day]] Parade in Torrance, which was first produced in 1960, is the longest running military parade sponsored by a city. It is held annually on Armed Forces Day, and runs down Torrance Boulevard.

In 1986 the [[United States men's national soccer team]] was in the last game of the qualifying tournament, the U.S. needed only a draw against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], whom the U.S. had beaten 3â0 in the Olympics the year before, in order to reach the final qualification group against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played at [[El Camino College]], an area with many [[Costa Rican American|Costa Rican]] expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community, even providing Costa Rican folk dances as halftime entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_lewis/news/2000/11/10/lewis_history/ |title=CNNSI.com â Inside Game â Michael Lewis â Offside Remarks â CNNSI.com's Lewis: Learning from history â Friday November 10, 2000 07:29 PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 35th minute goal by [[Evaristo Coronado]] won the match for Costa Rica and kept the United States from reaching its fourth World Cup finals.&lt;ref&gt;http://us-soccer.com/secured/articles/viewArticle.jsp_3063.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[N.W.A.]] recorded ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' at Audio Achievements studio in Torrance.

Torrance is also known for its [[multicultural]] [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] of [[East Asian]] and European ethnic groups, and even many [[Polynesians]], [[Indian American]]s, [[Arab American]]s and [[Persian American]]s. Some of the city's sections like El Nido, Moneta, Clifton along with [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] and Hollywood Riviera are examples of the [[ethnoburb]] phenomenon.

Historically, local whites tolerated the presence of [[Japanese American]], [[Portuguese American]] and Mexican residents, but not much support for [[African American]]s to relocate in their neighborhoods until the 1980s, which is the common racial consciousness in majority white neighborhoods even at present. Several members of the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] were active in local politics in the 1920s and 1930s, which was also the case in nearby [[Inglewood, California]] and [[Anaheim, California]] as well.
