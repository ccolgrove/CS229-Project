'''Heathcote Williams''' (born 15 November 1941) is an [[England|English]] [[poet]], [[actor]] and award-winning [[playwright]]. He is also an intermittent painter, sculptor and long-time [[conjuror]]. He is perhaps best known for the book-length polemical poem ''Whale Nation'', which in 1988 became &quot;the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on whaling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/troubled-waters-did-we-really-save-the-whale-935193.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, his agitational [[graffiti]] were a feature on the walls of the then low-rent end of London's [[Notting Hill]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portobellofilmfestival.com/talkpics/talk-vague06.html |title=PFF 2005 |publisher=Portobellofilmfestival.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
John Henley Jasper Heathcote-Williams was born in [[Helsby]], [[Cheshire]]. After his schooldays at [[Eton College|Eton]], he changed his name to Heathcote Williams. His father, also named Heathcote Williams, was a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/93/Heathcote-Williams.html |title=Heathcote Williams Biography (1941-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date=1941-11-15 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his early twenties, Williams has enjoyed a minor cult following. His first book was ''The Speakers'' (1964), an account of life at [[Speakers' Corner]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. In 1974, it was adapted for the stage by the [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]].

His first full-length play, ''[[AC/DC (play)|AC/DC]]'' (1970), a critique of the burgeoning mental health industry, includes a thinly veiled attack on his fellow denizen of 1960s [[Counterculture|alternative society]], and doyen of the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, [[R. D. Laing]]. Its production at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], did not, however, appear to impede cordial relations between the two in later years. ''AC/DC'' won the London ''Evening Standard'''s Most Promising Play Award. It also received the 1972 [[John Whiting Award]] for being &quot;a new and distinctive development in dramatic writing with particular relevance to contemporary society.&quot;  It was described in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' in a front-page review by [[Charles Marowitz]] as 'the first play of the twenty-first century.' ''AC/DC'' was produced in New York in 1971 at the Chelsea Theater Center at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Other plays include the one-act monologue ''[[Hancock's Last Half Hour]]'', ''[[The Local Stigmatic]]'', ''[[The Immortalist]]'', and the impossible to categorise ''[[Remember The Truth Dentist]]'' &amp;mdash; an early effort, again at the Royal Court, directed by fellow-contrarian [[Ken Campbell]].

The inaugural issue of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' included an effusive profile by fellow Etonian Francis Wyndham titled ''The Magic of Heathcote Williams''. His foremost fans among the famous are the late [[Harold Pinter]] and [[Al Pacino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BFI synopsis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/486380?view=synopsis |title=BFI &amp;#124; Film &amp; TV Database &amp;#124; EVERY TIME I CROSS THE TAMAR I GET INTO TROUBLE (1993) |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==
Williams himself is said to regard fame as 'the first disgrace,'{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} a phrase Pacino from time to time quotes in private. He has been notoriously reluctant to cooperate in the promotion of his work on a commercial level, refusing, for example, to go to the US to promote ''AC/DC''. He has been the despair of his publishers. The only book-signing tours he has ever done{{ndash}}'enough,' he complained, 'to cripple a rock-star'{{ndash}}were merely the result of relentless pressure from [[Jonathan Cape]]'s PR department. This episode, though having undeniably fortunate consequences for the poet's bank balance, was to have{{ndash}}almost as though to confirm his own worst assumptions{{ndash}}agonizingly unfortunate consequences for his private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Great journeys |url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/samsons-delight-514677.html |title=Samson's delight - Features, Unsorted |publisher=Independent.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not that this was Williams's debut [[15 minutes]], exactly. An affair some years earlier with the model [[Jean Shrimpton]], an icon of 60s [[Swinging London]], had resulted in the writer setting himself alight on her doorstep. Whether intentional or the upshot of a magical stunt gone wrong{{ndash}}Williams at the time being an ardent fire-eater{{ndash}}was never entirely clear. It was not unreasonably supposed to be a case of the supermodel dumping the scrivener. Somewhat astonishingly, however, in her autobiography published in the early 1990s, Shrimpton asserted that it was Williams who had in fact walked out on her.

[[Image:Autogeddon cover.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of ''Autogeddon'''s UK edition, 1991]]

Energetic publicity efforts on Williams's behalf, spearheaded by Cape's [[Polly Samson]] assisted him to achieve the mass audience he'd sought for his trilogy of book-length polemical poems on environmental themes.

Each was packed with detailed research and scores of photographs. Written some years earlier as visionary propaganda, they were probably the most lavishly illustrated English poetry since [[William Blake]]. They had otherwise been gathering dust in a corner of his then agent's office. The North American rights for the poem ''Whale Nation'' (1988) alone were sold at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] for $100,000. A more recent writer on the subject has described it as an &quot;epic plea for the future of the whale, a hymn to the beauty, majesty and intelligence of the largest mammals on earth, as well as a prayer for their protection... ''Whale Nation'' became the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on whaling, and for a moment, back in 1988, it seemed as if a shameful chapter in human history might finally be drawing to a close.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

''Whale Nation'' was followed by ''Sacred Elephant'' (1989) and ''Autogeddon'' (1991). The latter still ranks as the most vigorous sustained flow of invective against car culture to date. It characterizes the motor car's global death toll as, &quot;A humdrum holocaust, the third world war nobody bothered to declare.&quot; Each poem was made into a film by [[BBC Television]], ''Autogeddon'' performed by [[Jeremy Irons]] who, somewhat to the chagrin of its author, turned out in promotional interviews to be an unabashed car-lover.

Williams is a consummate reader of his own poems, as well as of the literary classics. His performance of his Buckley-esque&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=om een reactie te plaatsen! |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE-__Fi9NTM&amp;feature=related |title=Lord Buckley's &quot;The Nazz&quot; |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jumping Jesus'' was characterised by an eminent London literary critic as 'like [[Alexander Pope]] on speed.' His public readings of ''Whale Nation'' have been known to reduce some members of the audience to tears.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.recrea.org/rrf/whale_nation-at_the_hands_of_man.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; His recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/artistinfo/bio3745.htm |title=Heathcote Williams- Bio, Albums, Pictures â Naxos Classical Music |publisher=Naxos.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Naxos Records]], which include readings from the [[Buddhist scriptures]], [[Dante]] and the [[Bible]], have won awards.

In 2011, Williams began a new collaboration with Roy Hutchins, who had performed Whale Nation, Autogeddon and Falling For A Dolphin in the 1980s. The result was [http://www.zanzibarcats.co.uk/ Zanzibar Cats], a performance of recent short poems. In ''What's on Stage'', the reviewer Michael Coveney wrote, 'These wonderful poems seize on political absurdity, planetary destruction and social injustice with relish and delight, as well as great erudition and verbal dexterity.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/reviews/theatre/edinburgh/E8831313236414/Zanzibar+Cats.html |title=Zanzibar Cats by Heathcote Williams Reviews at Gilded Balloon Teviot - Edinburgh |publisher=Whatsonstage.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painting and sculpture ==
Williams's second bout of fame caused him to cease writing in effect, and turn to painting and sculpture full-time. Leading the life of a would-be recluse, he received prolonged tuition from the 'New Ruralist'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruralists.com/ |title=The Brotherhood of Ruralists Information Website - Homepage |publisher=Ruralists.com |date=2011-09-18 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; artist [[Graham Ovenden]], at the latter's home on the edge of [[Bodmin Moor]]. The result was an out-pouring of hundreds of canvases, including satirical pastiches of the works of [[Van Gogh]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Lucian Freud]] and others. He also produced a number of sculptures of great piles of books, tottering and damp-swollen, elaborately hand-carved in wood.

== Song-writing ==
Williams's occasional but typically anarchistic forays into the realm of lyric-writing include ''Wrinkly Bonk,'' yet to be unleashed upon an unsuspecting world, and ''Why D'Ya Do It?'', a sexually explicit exploration of carnal jealousy, for [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s 1979 classic album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH6bAMKA5fU YouTube - Marianne Faithfull &amp;ndash; Why d'ya do it (live)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams's words were enough to cause a walk-out by the female workers on [[EMI|EMI's]] production line.

== Magazines ==
Williams was for a time associate editor of the literary journal ''[[Transatlantic Review (1959)|Transatlantic Review]]'', as well as being one of those responsible for the notorious alternative sex paper ''Suck.'' He was a frequent contributor to the London underground paper ''[[International Times]]'' during the 1970s, to the radical vegetarian magazine ''Seed'' and to ''The Fanatic'', issues of which would appear sporadically and provocatively in different formats and various countries of Western Europe. In 1974, he launched his own mimeographed underground newspaper, ''The Sunday Head''. It was published from his home in Notting Hill Gate, London at the time when he was also the impresario for Albion Free Stateâs Meat Roxy, a series of music, dance and poetry events held in a squatted, redundant bingo hall near the Portobello market.

An anthology of his tracts and manifestos from this period, ''Severe Joy'', was announced by his then publisher but, to the disappointment of his fans, for some reason never actually appeared. A sampling did appear in a bi-lingual, limited edition titled ''Manifestoes'' from the Rotterdam-based [[Cold Turkey Press]] as well as in the Manchester literary magazine ''Wordworks'' in 1975.

== Film ==
The theme of Williams's early one-act play ''The Local Stigmatic'' is fame and its adverse consequences, possibly a reason why [[Al Pacino]], with financial assistance from [[Jon Voight]], would perform it off-[[off Broadway]] before he himself achieved what the play pillories. In later years the film version became known as 'Pacino's secret project,' representing the actor's debut as a director. It was released as part of the ''Pacino: An Actor's Vision''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesunlimited.com/musite/product.asp?sku=D74951 |title=Buy Movies at Movies Unlimited - The Movie Collectorï¿½s Site |publisher=Moviesunlimited.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; box-set in 2007.

Williams's own film performances include [[Prospero]] in [[Derek Jarman]]'s version of ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1979), ''[[Wish You Were Here (1987 movie)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1987) and Sally Potter's ''[[Orlando (movie)|Orlando]]'' (1992). His portrayal of the central character's psychiatrist in ''Wish You Were Here'' became something of a YouTube favourite. Williams has more recently enjoyed a steady stream of bit-parts in big-budget Hollywood productions, such as ''[[The City of Ember]]'' and the ill-fated ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]''.

== Television ==
[[Image:Peoples Hall Frestonia.JPG|thumb|right|The National Theatre of [[Frestonia]]: by day it was the People's Hall, focal point for the independence movement. It staged Williams's one-act play ''The Immortalist'', in which [[David Rappaport]] interviewed a 278-year-old man. In a later [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] production the TV personality [[Joan Bakewell]] played the incredulous interviewer]]

His first brush with TV overlapped with community politics. It came courtesy of a 1970s experiment by the BBC in what became known as &quot;public access television&quot;. Williams, in the dubious if [[green politics|green]] guise of a tree somehow blessed with oratorical powers, regaled the watching millions for a full fifteen minutes on the virtues of life without [[Houses of Parliament|Westminster]].  Albion Free State was his name for a [[utopian]] vision of an England free from government and bosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=om een reactie te plaatsen! |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPmkFKRWgtA |title=The A-Z of TV Hell Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was one of 120 or so [[squatters]] who had commandeered a small chunk of West London, just about visible from [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]] itself. [[Frestonia]], as the extensive squat was known, had declared itself independent of Great Britain. The actor [[David Rappaport]] was proclaimed Foreign Minister and Williams served as ambassador to the UK. Postage stamps were issued bearing the face of [[Guy the Gorilla]] instead of the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]; they made no mention of currency, but simply carried the legend, ''God Will Provide''. The whole rebellion, which exasperated the authorities for years, entailed much litigation before the bulldozers were finally able to move in.

Williams later applied his abilities as a conjurer{{ndash}}he has long been a member of [[The Magic Circle]]{{ndash}}to come up with a [[Christmas]] play based on the little-known fact that [[Charles Dickens]] used to revel in performing magic shows for his friends and extended family. ''What the Dickens!'' depicted the novelist, with the likes of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[William Thackeray|Thackeray]] standing by to assist, as he manipulated &quot;airy nothings&quot; and assorted props to the delighted squeals of [[orphan|foundling]] children from the Thomas Coram Home. The production featured a young [[Ben Cross]] as Dickens, with a supporting cast that included [[Dinsdale Landen]] and [[Kenneth Haigh]]. It was broadcast by [[Channel 4]] in Christmas 1983, with a repeat screening the following Christmas.

In March 1993, Williams was the not entirely enthusiastic subject of a spoof arts documentary titled ''Every Time I Cross the Tamar I Get Into Trouble''. Screened by Channel Four in its ''Without Walls'' slot, it implicitly sparred yet again with the recurring theme of the fatality of fame, its hollow allurements and the nature of fandom. In this instance, just for a change, a twinkling Pacino appeared happy to cast himself in the role of fan, implying his own supposed discomfiture with the whole grisly business of showbiz renown. The [[British Film Institute|BFI]] movie database characterizes the film thus: &quot;An account of Heathcote William's work, and Al Pacino's obsession with his writing. Includes an interview with Harold Pinter and footage from Pacino's film ''The Local Stigmatic''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BFI synopsis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/19139 |title=BFI &amp;#124; Film &amp; TV Database &amp;#124; WITHOUT WALLS |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The half-hour film was presented by the comedian and musician [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]], amply cut out for the part by dint of his own declared anorakish urge to collect all available Williams memorabilia. The fruits of his scouring the auction lists and the second-hand bookshops, he revealed, he kept in a special large wooden box. The element of spoof revolved around the conceit that the film's subject didn't turn up until the very last minute, and then only to decline to take part. In fact, he had appeared earlier, but in a variety of ludicrous disguises. The title alluded to the fact that Williams, living at the time in [[Cornwall]] just the other side of the [[River Tamar]], seemed twice over the years{{ndash}}first after'' AC/DC'', and then in the wake of ''Whale Nation''{{ndash}}to have come to grief as a consequence of having succumbed to the temptations arising out of not just one, but from a second 15 minutes of fame.

In 1998, he appeared in an episode of the US TV sitcom ''[[Friends]]''.

== Private life ==
Williams lives in [[Oxford]] with his wife Diana Senior.The couple have two daughters together, China and Lily, now both adults. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2015679/Charlie-Gilmour-blames-student-riot-rampage-rejection-natural-father.html |title=Charlie Gilmour blames student riot rampage on rejection by his natural father &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2011-10-31 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;Lily is a literary agent at Curtis Brown. 

His son, [[Charlie Gilmour|Charlie]], was adopted by the Pink Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and given the surname Gilmour after the latter married Charlie's mother, the writer and journalist [[Polly Samson]], in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13309662 |title=BBC News - Charlie Gilmour admits student fees protest violence |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Charlie Gilmour was sentenced to 16 months in prison for his behaviour during the [[2010 UK student protests|2010 student protests]]. He admitted the offence of [[violent disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Bates |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/15/charlie-gilmour-jailed-david-son-pink-floyd |title=Charlie Gilmour, son of Pink Floyd guitarist, jailed for protest violence &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2011-07-15|accessdate=2011-10-31 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also been photographed swinging from a [[Union flag]] on the [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|cenotaph]] war memorial in [[Whitehall]]. In court Gilmour said he'd been on [[LSD]] and [[valium]] at the time. He claimed that his drug use had been precipitated by an &quot;emotionally painful&quot; meeting with Heathcote Williams a few months earlier. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14150800 |title=BBC News - Charlie Gilmour jailed for student fees demo violence |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
