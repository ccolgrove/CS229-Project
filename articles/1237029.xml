The '''quarter''' is a Canadian [[coin]], valued at 25 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s or one-fourth of a [[Canadian dollar]]. It is a small, circular coin of silver colour. According to the [[Royal Canadian Mint]], the official name for the coin is the ''25-cent piece'', but in practice it is simply called a ''quarter''.

==Commemorative reverses==

Ordinarily featuring a [[caribou]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RCM-history&quot; /&gt; the quarter has the most commonly altered reverse in Canada, and is the usual venue for commemorative issues.

In 2004, a quarter was issued in honour of [[Remembrance Day]], featuring a [[corn poppy]] on the reverse, a traditional symbol in Canada of that day. This resulted in a bizarre international incident, in which American contractors unfamiliar with the coin's design believed these coins were outfitted with [[nanotechnology]] designed for [[espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/05/07/tech-poppy-quarter.html CBC.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

===125th Anniversary of Confederation===

In 1992, to celebrate the 125th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the [[Royal Canadian Mint|Mint]] released twelve commemorative coins, one for each Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] at the time. These were the inspiration {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} for the US [[50 State Quarters]] program of 1999-2008.  Note: [[Nunavut]], which separated from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1999, was honoured with a special [[Toonie|$2 coin]].

===Millennium quarters===

In April 1998, the [[Royal Canadian Mint|Mint]] announced the Millennium Coin Design Contest, a contest open to all Canadians to submit designs for twenty-four millennium quarters, one for each month of 1999 and 2000. The 1999 designs were meant to look back on Canada's past, while the 2000 designs looked to the future. While the 1999 coins were labeled with their month of issue, the 2000 coins were labeled with the relevant theme (see below).

===Alberta and Saskatchewan Centennial===
In 2005, to celebrate the centennials of the provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], two commemorative quarters were issued. The public was given the opportunity to vote on the coin design through two toll-free phone numbers.

There were four candidate designs for the Alberta quarter: ''[[Big Sky Country]]'', ''Albertaâs Natural Beauty'', ''A Dynamic Century'', and ''[[Rocky Mountain]] [[Bighorn Sheep]]''. The winning design was ''Big Sky Country'', by [[Michelle Grant]], and depicted an [[oil derrick]] with [[cattle]] grazing at its base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.albertacentennial.ca/news/viewpost.aspx~id=476.html |title=Alberta's Centennial Coin |accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coin had a mintage of 20,640,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005 RCM report&quot;&gt;Royal Canadian Mint {{PDFlink|1=[http://www.mint.ca/royalcanadianmintpublic/RcmImageLibrary.aspx?filename=RCM_2005AR_EN.pdf 2005 Annual Report]}}, page 38. Retrieved May 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three candidate designs for the Saskatchewan quarter: ''The [[Western Meadowlark]]'', ''[[Canada Geese]] over [[Wascana Lake]]'', and ''[[The Round Dance Celebration]]''.  The winning design was ''Western Meadowlark'', designed by [[Paulette Sapergia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.sk.ca/news?newsId=926aac3d-4646-4e32-b59c-78e1fe1197c1&amp;newsPN Saskatchewan Residents Invited to Vote on 2005 Centennial Quarter - Government of Saskatchewan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The coin's mintage was 19,290,000.

===2010 Vancouver Olympics===

The Olympic coins do not have the inscription 'D.G. Regina' (Latin for 'By the Grace of God, Queen') making the coins &quot;godless circulating coins&quot;. There have been a couple of circulation strike [[mule (coin)|mule]] coins in this series, including 2007 Paralympic wheelchair curling and 2009 Olympic Alpine Skiing coins.  With the medalist coins now called the Olympic moments coins, a very small percentage will be a colorized version.

==Other notable dates==
[[Image:2007 Curling.jpg|right|thunb|100px|2007 Curling Quarter]]

* The 1906 Small Crown is valued in the thousands of dollars for even very poor conditions.
* 1936 marked two valuable variations, the Bar and the Dot, both trend for over $1000 in uncirculated condition.
* The 1947 Dot is highly desired, and only 3 are known in existence. One can fetch a price of $100,000.00.
* The 1951 Low Relief was predominantly only made available in proof-like sets and have a mintage of around 500.
* The 1973 Large Bust is among the most desired Canadian Quarter.  They sell for around $300 in Proof Like or Specimen condition, and can sell in the thousands for high end circulation strikes.
* The 1991 quarter had a low mintage, of 459,000
* The 1992 New Brunswick quarter has several rotated die versions, with the 180 degree rotation selling for between $100 and $200 in uncirculated condition.
* 1999 featured mule versions of the September and November quarters. These coins do not have the 25 CENTS mark on them, making them, ironically, legal tender without face value. Either usually sells for over $10 depending on the condition of the coin. The Royal Canadian Mint estimates a combined mintage of 10,000 to 50,000 of the September and November mules.
* The 2000 Millennium Map Mule. Highly sought after by collectors, this is a modern rarity with about 100 known examples, as referenced in population reports of coin certification services (ICCS, CCCS, PCGS, NGC). Values range between $2000 and $5000.
* 2000P Caribou: two examples are known to exist. They fetch $50,000 or more (ICCS has graded both in MS-64: ICCS 2010 Population report). Both are in private collections.
* 2000P Creativity: two are known to exist. They fetch $15,000 to $20,000 (ICCS has graded one in MS-62 and the other in MS-66: ICCS 2010 Population report).
* 2000P Community: five are known to exist. They fetch $12,000 to $15,000 (ICCS has graded one in MS-60, two in MS-62, and two in MS-63: ICCS 2010 Population report).

==Facts==
{{Facts|date=January 2008}}
* The first commemorative coins were planned for 1927 to celebrate Canada's 60th anniversary. A contest was held and the winner for the twenty-five cent coin was J.A.H. MacDonald; however, the [[Royal Canadian Mint|Mint]] decided to not turn the design into coinage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Striking Impressions 1983&quot;&gt;Striking Impressions, James A. Haxby, 1983, ISBN 0-660-91234-1&lt;/ref&gt;
*When coinage was changed in 1937, the caribou (currently on the quarter) was originally planned for the five cent coin, the beaver (nickel) was planned for the ten cent coin, and the [[Bluenose]] (dime) was planned for the twenty-five cent coin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Striking Impressions 1983&quot;/&gt;
*The lowest mintage of any circulated quarter post-[[World War II]] was in 1991; low mintage was attributed to a work stoppage and using up stock in preparation for the release of the commemorative quarters the following year.  The total mintage was a mere 459,000 including collector sets and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton Standard of Canadian Coins, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;
*Canadian quarters were not issued into circulation in 1997 and 1998. In 1997, only 525,257 quarters were produced. In 1998, only 395,617 quarters were produced; even less than in 1991.  All of them were issued in collector sets or proofs and none were issued into circulation.
*The caribou on the 25-cent piece dates back to 1936 when a change in the sovereign's image on circulation currency prompted the Canadian government to modify the designs on the reverse side of coins as well. The caribou design was created by Canadian artist Emanuel Hahn, initially used in 1937. It has been temporarily replaced in some years; in 1967 for the Canadian centennial (with a [[Canada Lynx]]), in 1973 to celebrate the centennial of the [[North-West Mounted Police]], in 1992 for Canada's 125th anniversary, and in 1999 and 2000 by the winning designs of the Millennium coin program.
