==Early years==
Astin was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], to Margaret Linnie (nÃ©e Mackenzie) and Dr. Allen Varley Astin, who was the director of the National Bureau of Standards (now the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/93/John-Astin.html |title=John Astin Biography |work=filmreference |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1952, after transferring from [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]]. He initially studied [[mathematics]] at Washington &amp; Jefferson then became a drama major at Johns Hopkins; he was a member of the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity at Johns Hopkins.

==Career==
Astin started in theater, making his first Broadway appearance as an understudy in &quot;[[Major Barbara]],&quot; and also did voice-over work for commercials. His first big break in film came with a small part in ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;(http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=knZPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GAUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6499,6053148&amp;dq=john+astin&amp;hl=en)&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, his talent for also playing comedy was spotted by actor [[Tony Randall]], leading to a guest starring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[Harrigan and Son]]'', starring [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. In 1962â1963, he then starred with [[Marty Ingels]] in the sitcom ''[[I'm Dickens, He's Fenster]]'', which aired thirty-one episodes in a single season. From 1964â1966, he starred in ''[[The Addams Family (TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' as [[Gomez Addams]], the head of the macabre family.  He appeared in the TV show ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' as Grandpapa Addams in 1998, with the role of Gomez Addams played by [[Glenn Taranto]].

Astin joined the retooled ''[[The Pruitts of Southampton]]'' (re-titled ''The Phyllis Diller Show'') for the second half of the 1966-1967 season, playing Diller's brother-in-law, Angus Pruitt.  He also  played the [[Riddler]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' during [[Frank Gorshin]]'s second season departure. (Gorshin came back for the third and final season.) He played submarine commander Matthew Sherman in the 1970s TV series ''[[Operation Petticoat]]''. He also made a notable appearance in popular mystery show ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', as the villainous [[Sheriff]] Harry Pierce. He had a recurring role on the sitcom ''[[Night Court]]'' as Buddy, eccentric former mental patient and the stepfather of lead character Harry Stone. He also played the regular role of Ed LaSalle in the short-lived [[Mary Tyler Moore]] sitcom ''[[Mary (TV series)|Mary]]'' during the 1985â86 television season. He guest starred on numerous television series too, including a ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' appearance in 1967 as [[Festus Haggen|Festus's]] cousin Henry, [[Jack Palance]]'s ABC circus drama, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' and ''[[Duckman]]''.

Astin received an Academy Award nomination for ''Prelude'', a short film that he wrote, produced, and directed. He was nominated for an Ace Award for his work on ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', and received an Emmy nomination for the cartoon voice of Gomez on ABC-TV's ''The Addams Family''. He also voiced the character Bull Gator on the animated series ''[[Taz-Mania]]''. Astin served for four years on the Board of Directors of the [[Writers Guild of America]], and has been active in community affairs in Los Angeles and Santa Monica.

He has continued to work in acting, appearing in a string of ''Killer Tomatoes'' films as Professor Gangreen and as Professor Wickwire in ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County Jr]]''. He also has toured the one-man play ''[[Edgar Allan Poe: Once Upon a Midnight]]'', written by [[Paul Day Clemens]] and [[Ron Magid]]. In a December 2007, ''[[The Baltimore Examiner|Baltimore Examiner]]'' interview, Astin said of his acting experience: 
{{cquote|We all struggle, and I had plenty of that, but I've had a great time. I've done hundreds of TV shows and 30 to 40 movies, and I love acting. I'm very happy having done the Poe. That's been really terrific.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHU&quot; /&gt;}}

==Teaching==
Astin currently teaches [[method acting]] and directing in the Theater Arts and Studies Department at [[Johns Hopkins University]], his [[alma mater]]. Commenting on his dual career, he said in 2007, &quot;I don't know one major university that has a known actor teaching every day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JHU&quot; /&gt; He hopes to re-establish a drama major at the university, noting that he is one of only a handful to earn a drama degree from Hopkins. Astin can be seen singing and playing cowbell in a [http://thankyou.jhu.edu music video from JHU] released in December 2009.

==Personal life==
He has five sons, three (David, Allen, and Tom) by his first wife, Suzanne Hahn, and another ([[Mackenzie Astin]]) by his second wife, actress [[Patty Duke]]. John also legally adopted [[Sean Astin]], Duke's son from a previous marriage. John Astin is currently married to Valerie Ann Sandobal and lives in Baltimore. He is a practicing Buddhist.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHU&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Jessica Novak |title=Johns Hopkins' leading man |work=The Baltimore Examiner |date=28December 2007 |url=&lt;!-- http://www.examiner.com/a-1126509~Johns_Hopkins__leading_man.html --&gt; |accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
