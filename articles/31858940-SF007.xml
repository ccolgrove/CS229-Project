==Background==
The song was written and produced by Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Wanted unveil 'Glad You Came' video|publisher=Digital Spy|date=10 June 2011|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a324258/the-wanted-unveil-glad-you-came-video.html|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will serve as the second single from The Wanted's second album due out in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Copsey|first=Robert|title=The Wanted &quot;nervous&quot; about 'Glad You Came' release: Video|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a329286/the-wanted-nervous-about-glad-you-came-release-video.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=11 July 2011|date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Band member Tom Parker said of the song, &quot;We all felt it was a new, refreshing sound and a perfect song for the summer which really gets you in the mood for a party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Hot Video Alert: The Wanted - Glad You Came|publisher=Music Is My Kingsize Bed|date=21 June 2011|url=http://musicallyinclinedfool.blogspot.com/2011/06/hot-video-alert-wanted-glad-you-came.html|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song premiered on the radio on 24 May 2011.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt; The song was also remixed by Alex Gaudino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=news: The Wanted - Glad You Came|publisher=4 Music|date=24 June 2011|url=http://www.4music.com/news/news/63/The-Wanted-Glad-You-Came|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Critical reception==
Robert Copsey of [[Digital Spy]] gave the song four out of five stars writing, &quot;I decided you look well on me/ So let's go somewhere no-one else can see/ You and me,&quot; they continue over a cantering beat and featherlight [[Trance music|trance]] hook before launching into a carnival-inspired chorus fizzier than a frozen Daiquiri. &quot;My universe will never be the same/ I'm glad you came,&quot; they croon on the outro. The result is their catchiest effort since 'All Time Low', though on repeated listens we're not buying this innocent act they're sporting one bit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Copsey|first=Robert|title=The Wanted: 'Glad You Came' - Music Singles Review - Digital Spy|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a326440/the-wanted-glad-you-came.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=11 July 2011|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Griffiths wrote for [[4Music]] that the song is &quot;definitely their most danceable effort to date.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=News: The Wanted - Glad You Came|url=http://www.4music.com/news/news/63/The-Wanted-Glad-You-Came|accessdate=12 October 2011|newspaper=[[4Music]]|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The music video was created by [[Director X]] and was filmed in [[Ibiza, Spain]]. It sees the band on the beach, in a club and at a houseparty each with an individual woman. It was uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 10 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiEEJds8JFE The Wanted - Glad You Came (Official) YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; Jay revealed to [[MTV UK]]: &quot;The theory of the video was take The Wanted to Ibiza and just film everything and then just cut bits that were useable. But the girls were models, they weren't just girls we picked.&quot; However Max admitted: &quot;Actually no, the girl I had to spend time with was just literally picked up off the street after a night out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Glad You Came by The Wanted|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=23255|accessdate=12 October 2011|newspaper=Songfacts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video has achieved over 22 million views on YouTube becoming their most watched video on the site.
