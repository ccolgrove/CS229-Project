[[File:Gray1154.png|thumb|Penile enlargement procedures are designed to increase the size of the cavernous cylinders of the penis or to stimulate blood flow to increase hardness.]]
'''Penis enlargement''' procedures (sometimes [[euphemism|euphemistically]]  referred to as '''male enhancement''' procedures in [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] email and television advertisements) are techniques alleged to make the [[human penis]] increase in girth, length, or hardness. Often, in the course of advertising fraudulent products, the distinction between temporary enlargement, i.e. erection, and permanent enlargement, is [[quackery|deliberately muddied]].

Procedures range from manual exercises to stretching devices and surgical procedures, with reports of successes and failures around the world. While some of these are known to be outright hoaxes, other techniques have some measure of success.

Very little legitimate scientific research has been done specifically on penile enlargement, so any claims of significant and permanent enlargement can be biased or anecdotal. That said, much general research has been done regarding the efficacy (or rather the lack of) of the contents of the pills; otherwise, one assumes, that main-stream medicine would have made use of them if they indeed worked in any setting.   There is also an element of risk with some of the more invasive procedures, with negative outcomes ranging from the tearing of skin and scarring, to permanent loss of sexual function. Due to the speculative nature of any hope for &quot;improvement&quot; and the many known cases of permanent injury involved in this endeavor, many medical professionals are skeptical of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://men.webmd.com/guide/penis-enlargement-does-it-work | title=Penis Enlargement: Does It Work? | accessdate=July 28, 2011 | quote=Not really. âItâs pretty much bunk,â OâLeary says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present there is no proof in the scientific community of any non-surgical technique that permanently increases either the thickness or length of the erect penis that already falls into the normal range (4 to 6&amp;nbsp;inches).

Much of the marketing of pills and potions appears based on the unproven (perhaps false) premise that women require men to have large penises for any kind of sexual relationship. It may be concluded that a worry about the size of ones penis may be (in extreme cases) a psychological/psychiatric condition best dealt with by qualified medical practitioners. 

Increasing the size of the &quot;normal size&quot; penis must be distinguished from the seeking of a remedy for a the recognised condition known as [[Micropenis]] where surgery somehow to increase the size is sometimes needed for the organ to function at all for urinary or sexual purposes.

==Surgical methods==
The surgical method of penis lengthening is controversial in the medical community. It involves the cutting of 2 tendons that hold the penis up. By doing this, the penis is allowed to drop down and out lengthening it by 1-2 inches. Sometimes this method is combined with the clamping off of some blood vessels making for increased blood retention allowing for a harder and thus larger erection.

==Self-applied methods==
===Cosmetic===
Rather than attempt to change the actual size of the penis, one may make it appear bigger, by trimming the [[pubic hair]] or by losing weight.

===Pills and supplements===
&quot;Penis enlargement pills&quot;, &quot;penis patches&quot; and ointments are commonly offered over the Internet. This is one of the most common topics for [[e-mail spam]] messages. &quot;Penis enlargement pills&quot; contain natural ingredients, which, it is claimed, expand the capacity of the [[Corpus cavernosum penis]], the two cylindrical tissues inside the penis that fill with blood during arousal, creating the hardness of the erection. Quite how the pills &quot;know&quot; which part of the body to &quot;target&quot; is not explained. 

===Penis pump===
A '''penis pump''' is a cylinder that is fitted over the penis, with a manual or motorized pump to create suction.  As the apparatus creates a partial [[vacuum]] around the penis, blood is drawn into the penis, helping it to become engorged. As vacuum increases, the difference between the inner blood pressure and the pump pressure increases as well; excessive pressure causes vascular damage rather than a harder penis.

Penis pumps, usually described in this context as vacuum pumps, have use in conventional alleviation of [[impotence]]. The pump itself is essentially as described above, although often made to higher standards of quality with a much higher price, and arrangements for distribution by suppliers of medical equipment. The purpose is not to cure the condition, but to attain an erection by mechanical and hydrodynamical means even if there is nerve and vascular damage preventing a full natural erection; once the penis is erect, a  compression ring is slid on to maintain the erection which will otherwise subside immediately.

A flexible compression ring (or sometimes more than one), commonly called [[cock ring]]s when used recreationally, must be used. It is fitted on the open end of the cylinder, then an erection is created by pumping. Then the ring is pushed by hand onto the base of the erect penis before releasing the vacuum. This restricts blood flow out of the now erect penis, enabling the erection to be held even in the presence of problems of the vascular or nervous system which would otherwise lead to immediate loss of erection. In the best circumstances erections can be maintained for a considerable time, but manufacturers' literature recommends that, for safety, rings should be removed after no more than 30 minutes. Very prolonged use (hours) will cause permanent harm.

A [[personal lubricant]] of a type not harmful to the ring material is used, primarily to make a good seal at the base of the pump to prevent air leakage, in the same way that [[vacuum grease]] is used with a laboratory [[vacuum pump]]. It also makes it easier to slide the ring off the cylinder, and later to remove the ring.

Pumping must be done very carefully to avoid serious injury: over-enthusiastic pumping can burst blood vessels and form blisters. In some cases the testicles can be unexpectedly pulled into the cylinder, causing discomfort, pain, and possibly injury.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} It is also believed that the rim of the cylinder can cut into the skin and over time cause damage to the ligaments surrounding the penis. Impatiently pumping without reading explanatory material can produce too much suction (any pressure lower than 10 [[torr]]/1,333 Pa){{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and cause permanent and irreparable injury. Attempts at using vacuum cleaner units for this purpose have resulted in extremely severe injuries because the suction is far too powerful.

Pumps used with rings are virtually always effective, as they operate by a simple mechanical  process, in cases of ED, even when pharmaceutical methods fail. They may nonetheless be found unsatisfactory due to the inconvenience and similar factors.

The effectiveness of penis pumps for permanent penis enlargement was examined by Kazem, Hosseini and Alizadeh. They studied 37 men with penis length less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm and found no significant change in penile length after using pumps for six months, although the follow-up have found 30% satisfaction with the method. The conclusion of the paper stated that vacuum treatment of the penis is not an effective method for penile elongation, but provides psychological satisfaction for some men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A vacuum device for penile elongation: fact or ï¬ction?|year=2005|journal=BJU International|volume=97|pages=777â778|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.05992.x|author=Kazem, M., Hosseini, R. and Alizadeh, F.|pmid=16536772|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 31-patient study conducted by the Department of Urology at St Peter's Hospitals and the Institute of Urology in [[London]] investigating the usefulness of pumps to correct the penile curvature associated with [[Peyronie's disease]] found that &quot;''There was a clinically and statistically significant improvement in penile length, angle of curvature and pain after 12 weeks of using the vacuum pump''&quot;. In this study, subjects with Peyronie's undertook two ten-minute pumping sessions per day for twelve weeks. The additional penis length was an unexpected side effect and not an intended aim of the study, but large enough to be statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The role of vacuum pump therapy to mechanically straighten the penis in Peyronie's disease|year=2010|journal=US National Library of Medicine|author=Raheem AA, Garaffa G, Raheem TA, Dixon M, Kayes A, Christopher N, Ralph D.|pmid=}}http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20438558&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stretching===
Stretching consists of attaching a penis stretcher or &quot;extender&quot; device to the penis for set periods of time.  The device exerts a constant traction on the penis, which, in theory, lengthens and widens the penis. The traction supposedly causes the cells in the penis to divide and expand.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Jelqing===
Jelqing and &quot;jikok&quot; is a penis enlargement method intended to make the [[penis]] larger by &quot;exercising&quot;  tissues in the penis, with the goal of permanently increasing the maximum erect size of the penis. This technique, also called &quot;milking&quot;, involves wrapping the thumb and index finger around the penis while semi-erect and repeatedly drawing them away from one's body to force blood into the [[glans penis|glans]], thus encouraging more vascularity in the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] and associated tissues.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Clamping===
Clamping is a risky and dangerous technique. The goal of clamping is to increase the girth of the penis. This enlargement technique uses a constricting device, such as a shoe string, cable clamp, or a tight [[cock ring]]. The device is firmly tied, clamped, or put, respectively, on the base of the erect penis while &quot;[[orgasm control|edging]]&quot; (extended masturbation) with a firmly erect penis. Use of a metal cock ring is not advised because trapped blood engorging the penis can make it impossible to remove without amputation or emergency intervention such as sawing the ring off. Clamping is considered extremely dangerous by both practitioners and the medical community as it can cause permanent catastrophic damage to the penis.

===Hanging===
Weight hanging consists of attaching a device (usually a rope or a strap) that grips the [[glans]] or just behind the glans and allows a weight to be suspended for a specific amount of time. Then a conscious effort is made to exercise the penis by raising the weight in repetitions (lasting no more than 5 to 10 minutes at a time) starting with the smallest and lightest weight 1/16&amp;nbsp;pound to the heaviest usually 1/4&amp;nbsp;pound or more.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Weight hanging, however, can also carry serious risks, which include nerve damage, chronic pain, scarring and impotence. The idea behind weight hanging is to stretch the [[tunica albuginea (penis)|tunica albuginea]] and other various tissues of the penis.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Hanging carries additional health risks due to the restriction of blood flow to the glans, including testicular cancer.
