|portrayer=[[Judi Shekoni]]

|last=19 July 2002
|husband= [[Angel Hudson]]
|mother=[[Estella Hulton]]
}}
'''Marjorie &quot;Precious&quot; Hudson''' (nÃ©e '''Hulton''') was the glamorous wife of [[gangster]] [[Angel Hudson]] and she was first seen in [[Walford]] in June 2002 when Angel forced his old associate, [[Paul Trueman]], to keep a watchful eye over her. It turned out that Precious was Angel's fake [[alibi]] in a [[murder]] [[trial]] and fearing that she might skip town or be harmed before she could testify, he arranged for Precious to move in with the Trueman's and instructed Paul not to let her out of his sight.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,7-2002301165,00.html A punchy chat with Judi]&quot;, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. URL last accessed 2007-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Paul was unaware of the fact that Precious was Angel's wife, and so when she made her amorous intentions towards him clear, he had no qualms whatsoever about sharing a bed with her. When she finally told him the truth, he was horrified, and petrified of what Angel would do should he discover what had occurred between them. Precious reassured him that their marriage was a sham and promised not to divulge the affair. However later that night, whilst Paul went to get a take-away for a cosy night in together, Precious packed her bags and left. Paul was frantic, particularly when Angel showed up looking for her. Paul fed Angel a story and he along with his brother, [[Anthony Trueman|Anthony]], went in search of Precious, leaving Angel home alone with their father, [[Patrick Trueman|Patrick]]. Paul eventually tracked Precious to her mother's hair salon, and desperately tried to persuade her to return, but she refused and sped off in a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. Paul returned home to discover his father bound and gagged by Angel, who was also holding Anthony's girlfriend, [[Zoe Slater|Zoe]], hostage. Angel attacked Paul, just as Precious walked in the door. She had changed her mind about returning because she loved Paul.

A few days later some shady characters were seen placing a bomb underneath Precious' car - timed to go off half an hour before she was due to be at the [[solicitor]] with Angel. However Precious had put her car into the local mechanics for a service and when it exploded only [[Garry Hobbs]] was hurt but the injuries where fortunately not serious. Precious was furious that her life was under threat and she told Angel she would lie for him in the trial but only if he gave her a divorce. Soon after Precious was [[kidnap]]ped by the father of the man Angel murdered. He convinced Precious that the only way to get rid of Angel was to get him locked up. Precious realised that Angel would never divorce her and would rather see her dead, so she decided to tell the truth in the trial the following day, but to her horror Angel was found not guilty anyway. 

Paul and Precious then decided to flee Walford for [[Spain]]. However an altercation in [[The Queen Vic]] between the Truemans and the Slaters stalled their departure and after Paul got into a fight with [[Garry Hobbs]] he was carted away by the police. Meanwhile, Precious, who was waiting for Paul was caught by Angel.

Precious told Angel she was in love with Paul and wanted a divorce. Surprisingly Angel wasn't bothered and he told Precious that he didn't care enough about her betrayal to kill her and that she could have her divorce. Paul was a different matter however. He promised that if he ever found out that she and Paul were together, he would kill him. In order to protect Paul, Precious was forced to lie. She told him she wasn't in love with him and said she was just using him as an escape from Angel. After which she left Walford, leaving Paul with a broken heart. Her last appearance was July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001330006-2002311236,00.html Guide to soaps]&quot;, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

'''Julius &quot;Juley&quot; Smith''', played by [[Joseph Kpobie]], first appeared in July 2002 as [[Gus Smith]]'s brother. He proved to be a problem for Gus, as he got involved in crime, including firearm possession and the theft of charity money, which led to his departure in April 2005. In September 2005 he returned and went to France with Gus, [[Rick 'Minty' Peterson|Minty]], [[Garry Hobbs]] and [[Mickey Miller]]. Mickey and [[Dawn Swann|Dawn]]'s dad, [[Mike Swann]], saw straight through him and exposed him as a con-man. He returned to Walford and promised to change, then had a romance with [[Ruby Allen]].

Their crush started on 21 November 2005; however, they really pushed the limits on 12 December 2005 when they slept together, despite Johnny's watchful eye. Ruby and Juley did not seem to care about Johnny.

Juley had a near-fatal encounter with Johnny on 15 December 2005 when Johnny ambushed him with a pair of kitchen scissors, with the intent to harm him. Juley was only saved when [[Dennis Rickman]] intervened.

It was subsequently revealed that Juley was working for [[Phil Mitchell]], who was paying him to be with Ruby to antagonise Johnny. Ruby later moved in with Juley.

Juley started to fall in love with Ruby and decided to call it off with Phil, who ordered Juley to give back all the money he had been paid. Juley had put some of the money into his brother Gus's fund to see his dog, [[Wellard]], who had been arrested for biting [[Ian Beale]]. Gus caught Juley with the money, and forced Juley into confessing about his working for Phil. In January 2006, Phil wanted Juley to end his relationship with Ruby, saying if Juley didn't end it, Phil would tell Johnny the truth and Johnny would most likely kill Juley. Juley broke up with Ruby in the harshest way he could, despite his true feelings. Johnny was released from hospital and found out about Phil paying Juley. Johnny threatened to kill Juley if he ever went near Ruby again.

When Ruby returned to Walford after her father's arrest, Juley talked to her in the market to see if she was okay, but was badly beaten by [[Jake Moon]], still guilty for killing his brother [[Danny Moon|Danny]], who was over-protective towards Ruby.

Juley left Walford on July 27, 2006 due to his criminal activity. Juley mugged Ruby and hit her, leaving her with a minor injury. He then stole Â£2000 from her which she was going to use for her holiday with her best friend, [[Stacey Slater]]. Ruby entered Scarlet to put the Â£2000 in a safe but when she was leaving the office, Juley crept into the nightclub. Ruby was about to leave the club when she heard a noise coming from the office. This was where Juley was, retrieving the Â£2000. When she walked into the office, she found him and he ran away, pushing her onto the floor. The next day, Juley's brother Gus discovered the Â£2000 in Juley's bedroom. He alerted Juley that he knew what was going on and then tried to deliver the money through the postbox of Scarlet, but [[Jake Moon]] was watching. He called Gus inside the club to discuss what was going on. Gus lied, but then confessed to Jake that it was Juley who stole the money. Jake then ordered Gus to find Juley and bring him to the club, otherwise he would report Juley to the police. Gus returned to the flat and told Juley what Jake was planning to do to him. Jake closely followed Gus and demanded Juley to open the door. Juley and Gus then hugged and squeezed hands, which was followed by Juley leaving Walford through the back door of their flat.
