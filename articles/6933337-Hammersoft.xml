==== Game summary ====
The Packers played at Lambeau Field for the second time in five days, a Thursday night game versus their divisional rivals, the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The game was played on the third-year anniversary of the passing of Irv Favre, Brett Favre's father. In the first quarter, the Packers entered the red zone on each of their drives, but only scored once on a 38-yard field goal from kicker Dave Rayner. Rayner would miss his next two field goals. The Packers defence forced the Vikings to punt on all their possessions in the first half. The Packers scored on the final play of the half with a 44-yard field goal from Dave Rayner. In the third quarter cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Vikings quarterback Tarvaris Jackson, marking his seventh interception of the season extending a career high. Later in the third quarter, Brett Favre was intercepted by cornerback Fred Smoot. Smoot returned the interception into the end zone, gaining the first lead of the game for the Vikings. In the fourth quarter the Packers drove the ball into Vikings territory, but tight end [[Bubba Franks]] fumbled the ball at the two yard line, turning possession over to the Vikings. The Packers drove the ball 41&amp;nbsp;yards on their next possession to set Dave Rayner in position to attempt a field goal. Rayner made a 44&amp;nbsp;yard field goal with 1:34 left in the game to give the packers a 9-7 lead.

==== Game summary ====
On New Year's Eve, the Packers traveled to Chicago to face the Bears at Soldier Field. With the new [[NFL on television#Flexible scheduling|NFL flexible-scheduling]] intact, the game was moved to the Sunday night because of playoff implications and the possibility of it being Brett Favre's last game. However, the Packers became ineligible for a playoff bid when the [[New York Giants]] clinched a tie-breaker earlier in the day. On the first drive of the game, the Packers drove the ball 75&amp;nbsp;yards, resulting in a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brett Favre to receiver Donald Driver. Later in the first quarter, Packers defensive back [[Nick Collins]] intercepted quarterback [[Rex Grossman]], returning the ball 55&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter Rex Grossman threw his third interception of the game. [[Patrick Dendy]] returned the interception 33&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. The Packers finished the half winning 23-0, with their defense forcing four turnovers.

Starting the second half, [[Brian Griese]] replaced Rex Grossman at quarterback. The Bears scored their first and only points of the game with a 75-yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Mark Bradley]] from Brian Griese in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Packers increased their lead with a 46-yard field goal by Dave Rayner. The Bears had the ball only once in the fourth quarter. The drive ended in an interception by Nick Collins, recording his second of the game. Late in the game, Favre was replaced by quarterback [[Ingle Martin]]. Favre was carried off the field by Donald Driver, receiving many hugs by players and coaches. In an interview after the game, Favre broke down in tears. It was still at the time unclear whether Favre will retire or return to the Packers,&lt;ref name=&quot;retiring&quot;&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/GB/9900894 Favre gets a win, but is he retiring?] Taken from NFL.com news.

The Packers offense recorded 373&amp;nbsp;yards of offense. Brett Favre completed 21 of 42 passes with one touchdown and one interception. On defense, the Packers forced six turnovers. Five of the turnovers were interceptions. The Bears starting quarterback Rex Grossman recorded only a 0.0 quarterback rating in one half of play. With the win, the Packers moved to 8-8, improving on their record of 4-12 from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs.sportsline.com/nfl/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20061231_GB@CHI Favre shows he still has it in victory over Bears] from AP, posted 31 December, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
