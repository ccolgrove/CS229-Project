'''Azusa''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]].  The population was 46,361 at the 2010 census, up from 44,712 at the 2000 census.  Though sometimes assumed to be a compaction of the phrase &quot;everything from '''A''' to '''Z''' in the '''USA'''&quot; from an old [[Jack Benny]] joke, the place name &quot;Azusa&quot; traces back to at least the 18th century.  ''Azusa'' originally referred to the [[San Gabriel Valley]] and [[San Gabriel River (California)|river]], and likely derives from the [[Tongva language|Tongva]] place name ''Asuksagna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Rasmussen | first=Cecilia | date=June 3, 2007 | title=What's in a name?

Azusa was once home to the [[Lucky Lager]] brewery. Built in 1949, the facility was purchased by Miller Brewery in the early 1970s. A decade later, Miller relocated its operations to the nearby city of [[Irwindale]] and the Azusa facility was eventually torn down.

Azusa was also home to a plant for rocket developer, [[Aerojet]]. In 1980, it was announced that there was [[Trichloroethylene|TCE]] contamination in the [[groundwater]] at Aerojet's facility in Azusa. The area was declared a [[Superfund Site]] in 1985. In 1997, additional chemical contamination, mostly [[NDMA]] and [[ammonium perchlorate]], was found in the site's groundwater.  Aerojet was named as a Potentially Responsible Party for the groundwater contamination. Aerojet sold this facility in 2001 to Northrop Grumman Corporation.

== Education ==

Azusa is home to [[Azusa Pacific University]], a private Christian university and [[Dhammakaya Open University]], a private Buddhist university.

Azusa is home to St. Frances of Rome Elementary School, serving grades k-8, which is part of St. Frances of Rome Catholic Church, under the Los Angeles Archdiocese.

Azusa is served by the Azusa Unified School District. Its schools include:

* Azusa High School
* Gladstone High School
* Sierra (Continuation) High School A model continuation school
* Azusa Adult School
* Eleven traditional elementary schools - Dalton, Ellington, Gladstone Street, Hodge, Lee, Magnolia, Mountain View, Murray, Paramount, Powell, and Valleydale
* Three intermediate schools - Center, Foothill, and Slauson
* One Kindergarten-only elementary school - Longfellow
* One elementary-intermediate combo school (grades K-8) to be constructed by approximately 2010

== Transportation ==

Azusa lies mostly along the [[Foothill Freeway]] (I-210) between the [[San Gabriel River Freeway]] (I-605) and the [[Orange Freeway]] (State Route 57).

Azusa is to be the eastern terminus of the first phase of a planned extension, the &quot;Foothill Extension,&quot; of the [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Gold Line]] [[light rail]] service, which currently operates between Los Angeles [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] and eastern [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].  Like the current Gold Line, it would operate along former [[Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway]] right-of-way purchased by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] in 1993. MTA plans to extend the line to the end of its reserved right-of-way in [[Montclair, California|Montclair]], just across the [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] line.

In October 2009, the MTA Board unanimously voted to include the Foothill Extension in its long-range plan, and approved funding for the construction and operation of the Foothill Extension's first phase to Azusa. The terminus of this extension will be at the second of two stops in Azusa. The first stop will be the Alamada Station, just west of Alameda Avenue and east of Azusa Avenue, a main thoroughfare. The second stop will be at the planned northern extension of Citrus Avenue at Azusa's eastern border. This phase of the extension is scheduled to break ground in June 2010, and is expected to be completed and opened in 2013.

There is no passenger rail service to Azusa, although [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink's]]  [[San Bernardino Line (Metrolink)|San Bernardino Line]] stops in nearby [[Covina, California|Covina]] and [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]] several times each day.  The Jack Benny Program which aired from the 1930's to 1950's had a running joke where a train announcer (Mel Blanc) would announce the next train for Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga, all three then small towns without rail service.

== Public safety ==

The City of Azusa has its own Police Department, and maintained its own fire department until 1982.  The city fire department merged with [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] after a city election where the citizens approved an advisory measure to merge the fire department with the County in order to obtain [[paramedic]] and [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] services for the city.  The LA County Consolidated Fire Department services Azusa from Fire Station 32 (605 N Alameda) and Fire Station 97 (Sierra Madre Blvd along the foothills), with backup assistance from Fire Station 152, 153, and 154 ([[Covina, California|Covina]]), Fire Station 29 ([[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]]), Station 44 ([[Duarte, California|Duarte]]), and Station 48 ([[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]]).
Fire Station 32, which was Azusa's own fire station, houses 1 front line paramedic squad with an average of 12.29 calls per 24 hour shift, and 1 front line engine with an average of 7.05 calls per 24 hour shift. Fire Station 32 also houses a reserve engine (E-532), a [[urban search and rescue]] trailer, and MA-32.

Fire Station 97 houses 1 front line engine, and 1 front line patrol.
Fire Station 32 is also home to [[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Explorer]] Post 16, a youth program for 15-21 year olds that are interested in a career in the fire service. The Post meets on the 1st and 3rd Saturday of every month. The program is a joint with the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Once becoming certified, the Explorer is then allowed to &quot;Ride-Along,&quot; with different fire stations throughout the county.

The Azusa Police Department was home to the very first [[Chevrolet Camaro]] police car ever built.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Originally produced at the now-closed GM Assembly Plant in [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]] (with a custom turbocharging system donated by race-car legend [[Gale Banks]]), it inspired the [[California Highway Patrol]] and the [[Michigan State Police]] to order a few Camaro police specials for their fleets.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The Camaro was finally retired from active service in 2000. At that time it was the only Camaro police car of the original mid-1980s design to remain in service in any California police force.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The city has been home to the [[Azusa 13]] gang since the 1960s. Over 50 gang members were indicted in 2011 for harassing and intimidating blacks. The gang taxes drug sales in the area and funnels money to the [[Mexican Mafia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/06/street-gang-charged-with-terrorizing-african-americans-in-azusa-51-indicted.html|title=Street gang charged with terrorizing blacks in Azusa; 51 indicted - latimes.com|last=Quinones|first=Sam|date=7 June 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
