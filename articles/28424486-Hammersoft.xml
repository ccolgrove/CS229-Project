'''''Water''''' is the second release from Traverse City/Chicago based band, [[Salem (Michigan band)|Salem]]. The EP was pressed on clear red 7&quot; vinyl. The release was limited to 500 copies, like the bands' previous EP, [[Yes I Smoke Crack]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myspace.com/s4lem&lt;/ref&gt; A video for the song, Skullcrush, was presented to promote the EP, nearly 9 months after the release, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/6024976&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Yes I Smoke Crack]], the EP was available for digital download on popular music websites such as [[iTunes]] and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]. The EP also gathered attention because the lead track was once again Redlights, just like the previous EP. The track also appears on the band's album, [[King Night]].
