'''Scott Philip Brown''' (born September 12, 1959) is an American politician and the junior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]]. Brown previously served as a member of the [[Massachusetts General Court]], first in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|State House of Representatives]] (1998â2004) and then in the [[Massachusetts Senate|State Senate]] (2004â2010).

Brown is a member of the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]], and faced the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General [[Martha Coakley]], in the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|2010 special election]] to succeed U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown won the election and in January 2010 became the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since [[Edward Brooke]] in 1972.

Prior to entering the state legislature, he had experience as a town [[Board of Selectmen|selectman]] and assessor. He is a practicing [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]], concentrating in [[Property law|real estate law]] and serving as defense counsel in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Judge Advocate General's Corps]] of the [[Massachusetts Army National Guard]]. Brown is a graduate of [[Wakefield High School (Wakefield, Massachusetts)|Wakefield High School]] (1977), [[Tufts University]] (1981), and [[Boston College Law School]] (1985).

==Early life and education==
Brown was born on September 12, 1959 in [[Kittery, Maine]]&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 Public Officers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/publicofficersof20072008bost#page/46/mode/2up|title= 2007-2008 Public Officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|first=William F.|last=Welch|coauthors= James, Steven T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dog&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Mooney|first=Brian C.|date=November 20, 2009|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/11/20/being_the_underdog_never_deters_a_driven_brown/?page=full|title=Being the underdog never deters a driven Brown |work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often spent his summers in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], where his father served as a [[city council]]or for 18 years.

==Early career==
===Army National Guard service===
Brown has said the rescue efforts of [[Army National Guard]] during the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] impressed him. He joined the [[Massachusetts Army National Guard]] when he was 19, receiving his basic training at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dog&quot; /&gt; and attending [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) classes at the campus of [[Northeastern University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;key&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/07/guard_service_a_key_to_candidate_brown/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=January 16, 2010|title=Guard service a key to candidate Brown|first=Brian C.|last=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was trained in [[Infantry Branch (United States)|infantry]], [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|quartermaster]], and [[airborne forces|airborne]] duties, and in 1994 he joined the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] (JAG).&lt;ref name=&quot;key&quot; /&gt; He has been active in the Guard for about 30 years and has risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]. As the Army Guard's head [[defense attorney]] in [[New England]], Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive [[drug tests]],&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt; and provided [[estate planning]] and [[real estate]] advice to those who are about to deploy to war zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;key&quot; /&gt; Brown has not served in [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]], but said in 2009 that he was prepared to go if called. &quot;I go where they order me to go... I'm just proud to serve and be part of the team.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt; He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in [[Kazakhstan]] and a week in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt;

He was awarded the Army [[Commendation Medal]] for meritorious service in [[homeland security]] shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt; He credits his military experience with causing him to focus on [[veteran]]'s issues as well as issues of war and peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt; He has served on the Veterans and Federal Affairs Committee, the Hidden Wounds of War Commission, and the Governor's Task Force on Returning Veterans during his career as a legislator.&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt;

On May 2, 2011, Brown announced that he would soon go to [[Afghanistan]] for training as part of his Army National Guard service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/scott-brown-headed-to-afghanistan-for-national-guard-duty/ | work=The New York Times | first=Michael D. | last=Shear | title=Scott Brown Headed to Afghanistan for National Guard Training | date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling===
In June 1982, Brown, then a 22-year-old law student at Boston College, won ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine's &quot;America's Sexiest Man&quot; contest. After two weeks on a [[crash diet]] of &quot;three cans of tuna a day&quot; and intensive workouts&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenault20110217&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/02/17/brown_describes_childhood_of_beatings_sexual_abuse/?page=full|title=Brown describes beatings, sexual abuse in childhood|date=2011-02-17|first=Mark and Christopher Rowland|last=Arsenault|work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was featured in the magazine's [[centerfold]], posing [[nude]] but strategically positioned so that according to Brown, &quot;You don't see anything&quot;. In the accompanying interview, he referred to himself as &quot;a bit of a patriot&quot; and stated that he had political ambitions.

==State political career==
Brown &quot;caught the political bug&quot; in 1992 when he was elected property [[assessor (property)|assessor]] of [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt; In 1995, he was elected to the Wrentham [[Board of Selectmen]].

He successfully ran for the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in 1998, representing the 9th Norfolk District for three terms. Brown again moved up the ladder of state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat [[Cheryl Jacques]]. Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004, and again in November 2006, running without opposition the second time. He won re-election in November 2008, defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59â41 percent margin. Following his re-election, Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40-seat Massachusetts senate. In the Massachusetts Senate, Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection, professional licensing, education, election laws, public safety, and veterans' affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;glance&quot; /&gt;

In February 2007, a controversy arose after Brown's appearance at [[King Philip Regional High School]] in [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]] as part of a debate on [[gay marriage]]. The high school students had launched a [[Facebook]] group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, [[Ayla Brown|Ayla]]. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/homepage/8998943093096972286|title=Brown on hot seat after quoting 'F' word at school appearance|author=Heather McCarron|work=[[The MetroWest Daily News]] |date=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that during six terms in the Legislature, three each in the House and Senate, Brown had a modest record of legislative initiatives, but he had carved out a niche as a leading advocate for [[veterans]]. [[Richard R. Tisei]] of [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]], the leader of the Republican minority in the state Senate, called Brown &quot;the acknowledged expert on veterans' issues.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.boston.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/07/guard_service_a_key_to_candidate_brown/ &quot;Guard Service a Key to Candidate Brown&quot;] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' January 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; State Senator [[Jack Hart (state senator)|Jack Hart]], a Democrat of [[South Boston]], said: &quot;He does his homework, he's comprehensive in his approach, and on veterans' issues, he's one of them and has done a very good job on their behalf.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.boston.com&quot; /&gt;

Brown lists among his achievements as a legislator his authorship of a 2007 law that created a check-off box on state income tax forms for veterans to indicate whether they served in Iraq or Afghanistan. The state uses the information to notify veterans of available services and benefits, including the Welcome Home Bonus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=veteransterminal&amp;L=2&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Returning+Veterans&amp;sid=Eveterans&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=bonuses_gwot&amp;csid=Eveterans |title=Welcome Home Bonus |publisher=Mass.gov |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides $1,000 for those returning from active duty in Afghanistan or Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.boston.com&quot; /&gt;

Brown won a landslide victory in the Republican primary on December 8, 2009, defeating late entrant and [[perennial candidate]] [[Jack E. Robinson III|Jack E.

Brown's opponents in the general election were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and [[independent (politician)|independent]] [[Joseph L. Kennedy]] (no relation to the [[Kennedy family]]). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Globe 12-08-09&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/12/scott_brown_win.html|title=Scott Brown wins GOP primary, readies for race against Coakley|first=Michael|last=Levenson|date=December 8, 2009|work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since [[Edward Brooke]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;elec1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/senate/scott-brown-wins-massachusetts-senate-race.html|title=Scott Brown wins Massachusetts Senate special election race|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.&lt;ref name=&quot;myfox 1-18-10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/politics/local_politics/poll-scott-brown-surges-to-double-digit-lead-over-martha-coakley|date=January 18, 2010|title=Poll: Scott Brown surges to double-digit lead over Martha Coakley|publisher=My Fox Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_MA_45398436.pdf|title=Senate Race Competitive|date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2010|publisher=[[Public Policy Polling]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidemedford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ma-senate-poll-results.pdf|title=Senate poll results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;parker&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/08/AR2010010803591.html|title=A Republican Senate upset in Massachusetts?|date=January 10, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2010|authorlink=Kathleen Parker|first=Kathleen|last=Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Senator Scott Brown 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Brown driving what during the campaign became his famous truck]]
One week before the January special election, a controversy arose over a Coakley approved television ad.  The ad referenced the [[conscientious objector]] amendment Brown had sponsored for inclusion in a 2005 proposed state measure on patients' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/02/15/state_orders_wal_mart_to_sell_morning_after_pill/ |title=State orders Wal-Mart to sell morning-after pill, Retailer says it will consider stocking drug at all US stores|first=Bruce|last= Mohl|date=February 15, 2006|work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This amendment would have allowed individual healthcare workers and hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraceptive care to rape victims if they objected due to a [[religious belief]]. After the amendment failed, Brown did vote for the main bill which, along with other patient rights, requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care.&lt;ref name=&quot;daughters&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/01/coakley_campaig_1.html |title=Brown's daughters call for Coakley to take down ad |date=January 12, 2010 |first=Matt|last=Viser |work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coakley's ad featured a male voice that said, &quot;Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims,&quot; over the ad's graphic which had the words, &quot;Deny care to rape victims.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;daughters&quot; /&gt; Brown's daughter [[Ayla Brown|Ayla]] called the Coakley ad &quot;completely inaccurate and misleading&quot;, and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim.  Brown criticized Coakley for running what he described as attack ads.&lt;ref name=&quot;daughters&quot; /&gt;

In the 2010 Senate race, although Brown was not endorsed by the Greater Boston Tea Party group,&lt;ref&gt;The GBTP website states: &quot;Please note that while a few Tea Party groups across the nation have endorsed either Brown or Kennedy, the Greater Boston Tea Party has not endorsed either.

On election night, after Coakley conceded, Brown gave a victory speech that stated, &quot;It all started with me, my truck, and a few dedicated volunteers. It ended with Air Force One making an emergency run to Logan. I didn't mind when President Obama came here and criticized me - that happens in campaigns. But when he criticized my truck, that's where I draw the line.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott Brown's Victory Speech|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/us/politics/20text-brown.html?pagewanted=all|first=Scott|last=Brown|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2012
{{Main|United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2012}}

In late June 2010, Brown was ranked as &quot;the most popular officeholder in Massachusetts&quot; according to a poll conducted by the ''Boston Globe''.  55% of those polled had favorable opinions of Brown nearly five months after his January 19, 2010, special election victory to finish the term of the late Senator Edward Kennedy.  50% of respondents generally approved of how Brown had handled his new position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/articles/2010/06/29/news/7617880.txt/ |title=Sen.

On March 30, 2011, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee released a poll showing that Brown remained the &quot;most popular politician in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with an approval rating of 73 percent.&quot;  Brown's &quot;'re-elect' score was comfortably above 50 percent, which is unusual for a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/senator-scott-brown-in-good-shape-for-re-election-2011-3/ |title=Senator Scott Brown in Good Shape For Re-Election |first=John|last=Ellis|publisher=''Business Insider'', New York, NY |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

October 2011 polling showed Brown's approvals had fallen and he faced a competitive re-election if matched against Democrat [[Elizabeth Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_MA_0920424.pdf One poll showed Warren at +2; [http://bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2011_1003poll_warren_on_par_with_brown_joe_k_deval_would_do_better another] showed Brown at +3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
Brown was sworn in to office on February 4, 2010, by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], in his capacity as [[President of the Senate]], on the floor of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/02/04/Brown-sworn-in-to-fill-Kennedy-Senate-seat/UPI-82741265303270/ &quot;Brown sworn in to fill Kennedy Senate seat&quot;], UPI. February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Classes of United States Senators#Class_I|Class I]] Senator, his term will last until January 3, 2013.

Brown was among the speakers at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in [[Washington, D.C.]], introducing former Massachusetts [[governor of Massachusetts|governor]] [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Scott-Brown-surprise-at-CPAC-84720617.html &quot;Sen.

February 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his appearance at CPAC, where he alluded to his election as making &quot;big government spenders...[not] feel good at all&quot;, Brown refused to rule out a vote for a Democratic &quot;jobs bill&quot; proposal, and has praised both [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] of [[Nevada]] and [[seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] Senator [[John Kerry]] of [[Massachusetts]] for indicating their willingness to work with him across party lines.&lt;ref&gt;

Brown's views on the 2011 budget cuts have been at odds with some of his fellow Republicans and Tea Party conservatives. His reluctance to go along with some of the more drastic budget cuts has placed him at odds with Glenn Beck and other prominent conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/abraham/detail?entry_id=57868 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Scott Brown upsets Glenn Beck, Michelle Malkin, as Senate passes Jobs Bill | date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he opposed these measures because he believed that they would have a negative impact on low income families and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;politico.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/52391.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
[[File:Barack Obama with Scott Brown.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Brown meets [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in the [[Oval Office]], June 2010.]]
Brown has positioned himself as a [[American conservative|conservative]] counterweight to Massachusetts' previously all-Democratic, 12-member congressional delegation.&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dog&quot; /&gt; He describes himself as socially moderate and fiscally conservative. He identifies himself as a &quot;[[Reagan Republican]]&quot;. He has said, &quot;I'm going to be the only person down there who is going to be the independent voter and thinker... I've always been the underdog in one shape or form.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dog&quot; /&gt;

===Fiscal policy===
Brown is a signer of [[Americans_for_Tax_Reform#Taxpayer_Protection_Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]âs [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].&lt;ref name =&quot;ATR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown opposes a proposed multi-billion dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation. Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, said that he is &quot;opposed to higher taxes, especially in the midst of a [[recession of 2008|severe recession]]&quot;. He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/01/brown_criticize.html|title=Mass.

The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]], stating: &quot;Banks making lending decisions with government funds is not the way to get our economy moving again.ââ&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/09/15/senate_oks_tax_breaks_for_small_businesses/ Small-business tax breaks clear a hurdle in the Senate 'Brown decries plan, calling it a new bailout; End of filibuster a win for Obama']. September 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2010, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that &quot;[c]ampaign contributions to [Brown] from the financial industry spiked sharply during a critical three-week period last summer as the fate of the [[DoddâFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Wall Street regulatory overhaul]] hung in the balance and Brown used the leverage of his swing vote to win key concessions sought by firms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Globe&quot;&gt;Slack, Donovan (2010-12-12) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/12/12/banks_donations_soared_as_brown_negotiated/?page=full Donations poured in as Brownâs role grew], ''[[Boston Globe]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Brown received more than ten times the amount of contributions from the [[financial services industry]] as [[House Financial Services Committee]] chairman (and author of the legislation) [[Barney Frank]] during the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Globe&quot; /&gt; According to the ''[[Boston Globe|Globe]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Brownâs efforts benefited large Massachusetts companies such as [[MassMutual Financial Group]], [[Liberty Mutual Insurance]], [[Fidelity Investments]], and [[State Street Corporation|State Street Corp.]], whose executives and [[political action committee]]s contributed $29,000 to Brown during the three-week period he was extracting the concessions from Democrats.

They also benefited major out-of-state institutions such as [[Goldman Sachs]], [[UBS]], and [[JPMorgan Chase]]. Those and other out-of-state financial interests gave Brown a total of $50,000 during the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Globe&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Brown supports President Barack Obama's decision to send 30,000 more troops to [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|fight in Afghanistan]]. He cited [[Stanley McChrystal]]'s recommendations as a reason for his support.&lt;ref name=&quot;live&quot; /&gt; He also advocates that suspected [[terrorist]]s be tried in [[military tribunal]]s and not civilian courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;key&quot; /&gt; He also supports the limited use of &quot;[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]&quot;, including [[waterboarding]] against non-citizen terrorist suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brown and Coakley clash over terror suspects' rights|date=January 5, 2010|accessdate=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/05/brown_coakley_clash_over_suspected_terrorists_rights/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] | first=Brian C. | last=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports a [[two-state solution]] for the [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]] in which Israel and a new, independent [[Palestinian state]] would co-exist side by side.&lt;ref name=&quot;caller&quot; /&gt;

===Veteran services===
In 2007, Brown wrote a law establishing a check off box on State income tax forms to allow a filer to indicate if he or she is a veteran of the [[Iraq War|Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]] wars. The measure's purpose is to locate and inform returning veterans of benefits they qualify for.  Known as the &quot;Welcome Home&quot; bonus, it was passed with [[bipartisan]] support.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt;  Brown also amended the [[DoddâFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], with Senator [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]] ([[Rhode Island|RI]]), to create a dedicated military liaison office within the newly formed [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], which aside from defending against unscrupulous lenders, also ensures protection of military families against fraudulent life insurance policies.  The measure passed the [[U.S. Senate]] 99 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf |title=H.R. 4173 (111th Congress) |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Brown supported the 2006 [[Massachusetts health care reform]], which requires all residents to have [[health insurance]], with a state-subsidized plan created for those who cannot afford to insure themselves. Brown does not support President Obama's health care reform plan in its current form as approved by the Democratic-led House and Senate.  He has stated this plan is fiscally unsound, and during his campaign notably pledged to be the 41st vote to [[filibuster]] the bill in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Brown voted for a state measure on patients' rights that, among other provisions, requires emergency rooms to provide what is known as the [[emergency contraception|morning-after pill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/morning-pill-spurs-abortion-controversy/story?id=9700748 |title=Pregnancy Prevention or Abortion?

In consideration of health care workers who might have a religious objection to administering this medication, Brown attached what became known as the Conscientious Objector amendment which would have exempted these workers, as well as religious hospitals, from being required to provide this medication.

==Organizational associations and honors==
{{Rquote|right|Scott Brown had a profound impact on national politics in the last year. His surprise victory upended conventional wisdom, inspired a legion of long-shot challenges, and energized Republicans and Democrats alike. Brownâs election showed the country that anything is possible, that no seat or incumbent is safe from challenge. And his maneuvering once in office produced the tiniest rays of bipartisanship in a Senate dark with dysfunction. For all of these reasons, he is our 2010 Bostonian of the Year.|Neil Swidey, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'&lt;ref name=&quot;Bostonian of the Year&quot; /&gt;}}
