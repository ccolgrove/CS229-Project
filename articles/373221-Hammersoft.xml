'''William Anthony Kirsopp Lake''', best known as '''Tony Lake''', (born April 2, 1939) is the Executive Director of the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)]], author, [[Academia|academic]], and former [[United States|American]] [[Diplomacy|diplomat]], [[Foreign Service Officer]], and [[Politics of the United States|political advisor]]. He has been a foreign policy advisor to many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] and presidential candidates, and served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] under U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] from 1993 to 1997. Lake is credited as being one of the individuals who developed the policy that led to the resolution of the [[Bosnian War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/116232?tid=relatedcl Newsweek, Feb 22, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; He also held the [[Professor#Named professorships|chair]] of Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/lakea Georgetown University Faculty Bio.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lake is the grandson of [[Kirsopp Lake]], a member of the [[Church of England]] clergy who came from [[Oxford]], England, to America in order to teach [[New Testament]] studies at Harvard. Lake's father, Gerard Kirsopp Lake, was a [[New Deal]] Democrat and his mother Eleanor (nÃ©e Eleanor van Someren Hard), a Republican.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moment&quot;&gt;[http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2008/06/200805-Lake.html &quot;The Conversions of Anthony Lake,&quot; ''Moment Magazine,'' May-June 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742450,00.html ''Time'', Oct. 19, 1931, marriage announcement for Lake's parents.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake himself was born in [[New York City]]. He attended [[Middlesex School]] and [[Harvard College]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1961. Lake studied [[international economics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and later received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] from the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]] in 1974.

==Career==
Lake joined the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in 1962, serving until 1970 as a Foreign Service Officer. Lake was an assistant to [[Ambassador]] [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. His State Department career included assignments as [[Consul (representative)|consul]] at the [[US Embassy, Saigon]], [[South Vietnam]] (1963), vice consul in [[Huáº¿]] (1964â1965) and special assistant to the assistant to the president for [[national security]] affairs (1969â1970) in the [[Nixon administration]]. In 1969, he accompanied National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] on his first secret meeting with [[North Vietnam]]ese negotiators in [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris]]. In 1970, he had a falling-out with Kissinger over the Nixon administration's [[Cambodian Campaign]] and left the State Department as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E6D8163BF934A25752C0A961958260 |title=The Dossier on Anthony Lake |format= |work= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-11-12 | date=1997-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote a book critical of Kissinger's approach to [[Africa]].

Lake worked for Democratic [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Edmund Muskie]] of [[Maine]] in his [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential campaign]]. After Muskie lost the nomination to [[George McGovern]], Lake served briefly at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Endowment]] and [[International Voluntary Services]] before returning to serve as [[Director of Policy Planning]] under [[Jimmy Carter]] (1977â1981).

After Carter lost the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 election]] to [[Ronald Reagan]], Lake became a [[professor]], holding the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five College]] Professor of [[International relations|International Relations]] chair in [[Massachusetts]] (1981â1992). Lake taught at [[Amherst College]]. In 1984, he moved to [[Mount Holyoke College]], where he taught courses on the Vietnam War, [[Third World]] [[revolution]]s, and [[Foreign relations of the United States|American foreign policy]]. (He left Mount Holyoke College in 1993 to become [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] from 1993 to 1997.) Among his protegees at Mount Holyoke was his student research assistant [[Mona Sutphen]] who would later serve in the [[Barack Obama]] White House as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/13/AR2009041302968.html] Retrieved 14 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he began to teach diplomacy at [[Georgetown University]], serving as Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy until accepting his position with UNICEF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/lakea/?action=viewgeneral Anthony Lake, Georgetown University faculty profile]. [http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2008/2008-05/200805-Lake.html ''Moment'' magazine (May/June 2008) notes that he has been at Georgetown since withdrawing his nomination.] Retrieved 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential campaign]], he was one of Clinton's chief foreign policy advisers. Lake later served as National Security Advisor (1993â1997). Told by the White House to sell his [[stock]]s in [[energy]] companies when he took the office in 1993, Lake did not do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; When Clinton decided in 1994 to allow [[Iran]] to arm the [[Bosnia]]n army, Lake admitted he made a mistake when he didn't push to inform [[United States Congress|Congress]] of the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt;

Following Clinton's [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 re-election]], Lake was nominated to become the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]], but his nomination was withdrawn due to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It has also been reported that the failure of his nomination was related to his decision to withdraw support at the last minute for an Iraqi coup that might have removed [[Saddam Hussein]] without U.S. intervention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} However, others have speculated that Lake's nomination &quot;failed, in part, because Lake stated in a television interview that he was not sure if [[Alger Hiss]] was guilty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Mystery of ALES â Central Intelligence Agency&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no4/the-mystery-of-ales.html |title=The Mystery of &quot;ALES&quot; â Central Intelligence Agency |work= |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2203909/ |title=The Uncabinet |format= |work= Slate.com|accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the withdrawal of his CIA nomination, Lake became White House Special Envoy (1998â2000). As special envoy Lake mediated the drafting of the [[Algiers Agreement (2000)|Algiers Agreement]], ending the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]].

Lake co-founded [[Intellibridge|Intellibridge Corporation]] in 2000 with [[David Rothkopf]]. In 2005 the assets of Intellibridge were acquired by the [[Eurasia Group]].

Lake was a foreign policy adviser for [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], having endorsed him over Senator [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], whom he had worked alongside during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlCNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time - Obama outlines foreign policy vision&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/27/obama-outlines-foreign-policy-vision/ |title=CNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time - Obama outlines foreign policy vision |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/us/politics/18advisers.html?pagewanted=print |title=A Cast of 300 Advises Obama on Foreign Policy |last=Bumiller |first=Elisabeth |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake was considered a potential Secretary of State until Sen. Clinton was named to the position.

Lake was an advisory board member for the [[Partnership for a Secure America]], a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He has also served as chair on the boards of the [[United States Fund for UNICEF]] and the [http://www.marshall-legacy.org Marshall Legacy Institute]. He also is serving a term from 2005-2010 on the [[Mount Holyoke College]] [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]].

On March 16, 2010, Lake was named by [[United Nations]] [[Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] as the next Executive Director of the United Nations Childrenâs Fund ([[UNICEF]]), following his nomination by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usun.state.gov/briefing/statements/2010/138429.htm March 16, 2010, Statement by President Barack Obama on the appointment of Anthony Lake as Executive Director of UNICEF.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Press Centre. &quot;UNICEF welcomes announcement of next Executive Director&quot;. http://www.unicef.org/media/media_53044.html. Retrieved on March 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2010, he officially entered the post, succeeding [[Ann Veneman]], a former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.

==Spiritual journey==

Lake was raised in the [[Congregational Church]], but recounts that he &quot;embarked on his spiritual journey as a young man,&quot; first converting to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. However, since then he had &quot;long been drawn to Judaism,&quot; and &quot;began to feel strongly that I wanted to be part of that community.&quot; He ultimately converted to [[Judaism]] in 2005, before marrying [http://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/biographies,1347.html?bioID=34 Julie Katzman], currently the General Manager of the [[Multilateral Investment Fund]] (MIF). He credits Katzman's religious faith as the impetus responsible for his decision to investigate his attraction to Judaism more fully, and began studying with former Navy Chaplain [[Arnold Resnicoff|Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff]] (who was serving with him on the Board of Trustees of the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]]) for a full year before his conversion. Later, Resnicoff officiated at his marriage to Katzman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moment&quot;/&gt;

However, Lake jokes that he was Jewish in the eyes of others well before his formal conversion. First, in 1997, when news broke that Secretary of State [[Madeline Albright]] had discovered that she had Jewish ancestors, and a story about other Jews in the Administration mistakenly reported that Clinton's &quot;entire national security team was Jewish.&quot; Based on that news story, Lake recounts, his name was added to the list used by the White House Liaison to the Jewish community, and Lake began to receive invitations to special events, such as the [[White House Hanukkah Party]] -- and he says he was delighted to accept those invitations. The second time was two years later, when a 1999 Washington Post story described a new release of Watergate-era tapes of conversations between President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[H.R. Haldeman]], his Chief of Staff. Those tapes included a conversation where Nixon asks if Lake is Jewish, and Haldeman responds, &quot;Well, I'm not so sure, but he looks Jewish.&quot; Based on these tapes, Lake claims that, &quot;Now I can trace my [Jewish] heritage all the way back to Nixon!&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Moment&quot;/&gt;

==Family==

Lake has three children, from his marriage to his first wife, Antonia, which ended in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moment&quot;/&gt; His second child is a godson of his former colleague, [[Richard Holbrooke]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cohen. &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/opinion/10cohen.html &quot;The Mother of Friendships Lost.&quot; The New York Times online, 10 July 2008.
