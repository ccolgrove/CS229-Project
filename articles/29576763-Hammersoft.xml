The '''Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library''' is the campus library for students at the [[University of Montana]] in [[Missoula, Montana]]. The five-story library, which is located on the east side of the UM campus,  was finished in 1978, funded by the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]. In 1979, it was dedicated to Ambassador [[Mike Mansfield]] and his wife Maureen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.umt.edu/history&lt;/ref&gt; The library is home to the earliest authorized edition of the [[Lewis and Clark]] journals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umt.edu/urelations/mainhall/1102/journals.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of Montana library was established in 1895, two years after the establishment of the [[University of Montana]].  The library was temporarily housed in the old Willard School on Sixth Street in Missoula before a permanent structure was built on the UM campus. After one year at the old Willard School, library holdings totaled at 1,369 volumes, 19 periodicals, and 20 newspapers.  

Today, the library features state-of-the-art electronic access to information. It is a Federal Government Depository Collection and has an extensive Maps Collection.

==Mansfield Center==

The Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center of the Mansfield Library is dedicated to improving understanding of Asia, U.S. foreign relations, and ethics and public affairs.

&quot;The Center houses programs that embody the core interests and characteristics of Senator Mansfield's career, namely, Modern Asian Affairs and Ethics in Public Affairs. The Center has broadened its original focus on East and Northeast Asia to include South and Southeast Asia, an evolution that reflects growing American interests in these sub-regions of a dynamic continent with ever-growing links to the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.edu/mansfield/ Mansfield Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mansfield Center also works closely with The [[Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation]] (est. 1983) to &quot;promote understanding and cooperation among the nations and peoples of Asia and the United States.&quot;  The Foundation maintains offices in Washington, D.C.; Tokyo, Japan; Missoula, Montana; and a joint office in Beijing, China, with The Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center at The University of Montana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansfieldfdn.org/ Mansfield Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;
