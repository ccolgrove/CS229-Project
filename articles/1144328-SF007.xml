'''Internet Explorer for Mac''' (also referred to as '''Internet Explorer for Macintosh''', '''Internet Explorer Macintosh Edition''', '''Internet Explorer:mac''' or '''IE:mac''') was a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[web browser]] developed by [[Microsoft]] for the [[Macintosh]] platform. Initial versions were developed from the same code base as [[Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer for Windows]]. Later versions diverged, particularly with the release of version 5 which included the [[Tasman (layout engine)|Tasman]] [[layout engine]].

As a result of the five-year agreement between [[Apple Computer|Apple]] and Microsoft in 1997, it was the default browser on [[Mac OS]] and [[Mac OS X]] from 1998 until it was replaced by Apple's own [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser in 2003. 

On JuneÂ 13,Â 2003, Microsoft announced that it was ceasing further development of Internet Explorer for Mac and the final update was released on JulyÂ 11,Â 2003. The browser was not included in the default installation of [[Mac OS X v10.4]] &quot;Tiger&quot; which was released on AprilÂ 29,Â 2005. Microsoft discontinued support for the product on DecemberÂ 31,Â 2005 and removed the application from their Macintosh downloads site on January 31, 2006. Microsoft recommends &quot;that users migrate to more recent web browsing technologies such as Apple's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/internetexplorer/internetexplorer.aspx?pid=internetexplorer |title=INTERNET EXPLORER 5 FOR MAC |date=OctoberÂ 25,Â 2006|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2009-03-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080106181017/http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/internetexplorer/internetexplorer.aspx?pid=internetexplorer |archivedate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Versions of Internet Explorer for Macintosh were released starting with version 2 in 1996, to version 5 which received its last patch in 2003. IE versions for Mac typically lagged several months to a year behind Windows versions, but included some unique developments including its own layout engine [[Tasman (layout engine)|Tasman]].

===Internet Explorer 2.0 for Macintosh===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ie2 sytem7.jpg|thumb|A screenshot of IE 2 for Mac running in [[System 7]]]] --&gt;
The first version of Internet Explorer for the Macintosh operating system was a beta version of ''Internet Explorer 2.0 for Macintosh'', released on January 23, 1996 as a free download from Microsoft's website. This first version was based on the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Spyglass Mosaic]] web browser licensed from [[Spyglass, Inc.|Spyglass]]. Available for both [[Motorola 68000|68k]] and [[PowerPC|PPC]] based Macs running [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7.0.1]] or later, it supported the embedding of a number of multimedia formats into web pages, including [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] and [[QuickTime]] formatted video and [[AIFF]] and [[WAV]] formatted audio. The final version was released three months later on April 23. Version 2.1 released in August of the same year, was mostly aimed at fixed bugs and improving stability, but also added a few features such as support for the [[NPAPI]] (the first version of Internet Explorer on any platform to do so) and support for [[QuickTime VR]]. [[AOL]] 3.0 for Macintosh used the IE 2.1 rendering engine in its built-in web browser.

===Internet Explorer 3.0 for Macintosh===
On November 5, 1996 Microsoft announced the release of a beta version of ''Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Macintosh''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release added support for [[HTML]] version 3.2, [[Cascading Style Sheets]], [[Java applet]]s and [[Component Object Model|ActiveX]] controls. The final version, made available on January 8, 1997, also added support for the [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] and [[NTLM]] security protocols and the [[Platform for Internet Content Selection|PICS]] and [[Recreational Software Advisory Council internet|RSACi]] rating systems that can be used to control access to websites based on content ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A problem with an operating system extension used in the Mac OS, called CFM68K Runtime Enabler, led to a delay in the release of the version 3.0 for Macs based on the [[68k]] line of processors. Four months later on May 14, Microsoft released version 3.01 which included a version for 68k-based machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version also included features from the Windows version of Internet Explorer 4.0 such as [[AutoComplete]] and Monitoring Favorites that notified users when sites in their Favorites list have been updated. It also included support for [[JavaScript]] and introduced a Download Manager and a [[HTTP cookie|Cookie]] Manager.

===Internet Explorer 4.0 for Macintosh===
At the 1997 [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|Macworld Expo]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], on August 6, [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Bill Gates]] announced a partnership between Microsoft and Apple. Amongst other things, Apple agreed to bundle Internet Explorer with future versions of the Mac OS and make it the default browser instead of [[Netscape Navigator]].

Five months later on January 6, 1998, at the Macworld Expo in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], Microsoft announced the release of the final version of ''Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Macintosh''. Version 4 included support for [[offline browsing]], [[Dynamic HTML]], a new faster [[Java virtual machine]] and Security Zones that allow users or administrators to limit access to certain types of web content depending on which zone (for example Intranet or Internet) the content was coming from. The most publicized feature of Internet Explorer 4.0 was support for Microsoft's [[Active Channel]] technology, which was intended to deliver regularly updated content that users could personally tailor to their interests. However Active Channel failed to reach a wide audience.

At the same event, Apple announced the release of [[Mac OS 8|Mac OS 8.1]]. This was the first version of the Macintosh operating system to bundle Internet Explorer as its default browser per the agreement with Microsoft; however, version 4.0 was not ready in time to be included so version 3.01 was bundled on the CDs.

At the following year's San Francisco Macworld Expo on January 9, 1999, Microsoft announced the release of ''Internet Explorer 4.5 Macintosh Edition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=2008-12-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new version, which dropped 68K processor support, introduced Form AutoFill, Print Preview, the Page Holder pane which let a user hold a page of links on one side of the screen that opened pages in the right hand and support for Mac OS technology like [[Sherlock (software)|Sherlock]].

===Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition===
Again a year later on JanuaryÂ 5,Â 2000, Microsoft announced a new version of Internet Explorer at the San Francisco Macworld Expo, ''Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition'' which was released two months later on MarchÂ 27,Â 2000. The [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of [[Internet Explorer 5]] had been released a year earlier, but used the Trident layout engine. The Macintosh Edition introduced a new rendering engine called Tasman that was designed to be more compliant with emerging [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] standards such as HTML 4.0, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS LevelÂ 1]], [[Document Object Model|DOM LevelÂ 1]], and [[ECMAScript]]. It also introduced a number of features that were later added to other browsers such as complete support for the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image standard (which previous versions did not support at all), [[Document Type Declaration|DOCTYPE]] switching, Text Zoom and [[XML]] source view. It also included an Auction Manager for tracking auctions in sites like [[eBay]] and an Internet Scrapbook to allow users to quickly and easily store and organize web content (for example an image or a piece of selected text). Preview releases of the browser included a feature called the MediaBar which integrated MP3 and [[internet radio]] playback, but this feature was dropped from the final version. The initial release was just for Mac OS 8 and [[Mac OS 9]], however two months after that release on MayÂ 15 a [[Mac OS X]] version was released, bundled with the Mac OS X DP4 release handed out to developers at the 2000 [[Worldwide Developers Conference]]. The [[Mac OS X Public Beta]] included another preview of the Mac OS X version of IE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=2008-12-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of [[Mac OS X v10.0]] on MarchÂ 24,Â 2001 included yet another preview of the Mac OS X version of IE 5. This was updated later, and the release of [[Mac OS X v10.1]] on SeptemberÂ 25,Â 2001 included the final version of Internet Explorer 5.1 for Mac OS X. IE 5.1 for Mac OS 8 and 9 was released on DecemberÂ 18,Â 2001.

According to Jorg Brown, one of the IE for Mac developers at Microsoft, after version 5 most of the team that produced IE for Mac were moved to another project. IE for Mac was relegated to something they were expected to work on in their &quot;spare time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=171546&amp;cid=14288661|title=Microsoft Ends IE for Mac|date=2005-12-18|publisher=[[Slashdot]]|accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On JuneÂ 17,Â 2002, Microsoft announced the release of version 5.2 (the first Mac OS X-only release) which included a few performance and security fixes and support for Mac OS X features likes [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] text smoothing.

During 2002, Microsoft reassigned developers to develop version 6 of Internet Explorer for Mac, intended to be used as the base for a new product. [[MSN for Mac OS X]] would be a subscription-only browser that worked with the online [[MSN]] service, incorporate features like an address book, junk mail filters and an [[MSN Messenger]] client. However after hearing that Apple had started development of their own browser, they canceled the standalone browser development and concentrated on the MSN browser, which was released on MayÂ 15,Â 2003.

On JuneÂ 13,Â 2003, [[PC Pro]] reported that [[Macintosh Business Unit]] general manager [[Roz Ho]] had confirmed that aside from updates to fix security problems, there would be no new versions of Internet Explorer from Microsoft. Three days later on JuneÂ 16, Microsoft released the final version for Mac OS X, version 5.2.3 and a month later on JulyÂ 11, they released the final version for Mac OS 8 and 9, version 5.1.7.  The last versions of Internet Explorer for Mac had a distinguishing blue logo that was the base for the logo used in Internet Explorer 6 for Windows (the Windows one just had a lighter blue, and it was less 3-D).

====Internet Explorer 5 for Mac distinguishing features====

These are features found in Internet Explorer for Mac, which were not found in common contemporary browsers (with the possible exception of Internet Explorer for Windows). Some are still not features in many browsers.

* Support for annotative glosses to Japanese [[kanji]] and Chinese characters (see [[ruby character|furigana]]).
* Scrapbook feature lets the user archive any page in its current state.
* Auction Manager feature automatically tracks [[eBay]] auctions.
* Although Internet Explorer for Mac did not have any [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] support at all until version 5.0 (a year or two after other major browsers), the PNG support added in that version was unusually robust, including transparency and color correction.
* An option to change the browser color, to match the colors of the [[iMac G3]]. The first builds had a choice of 9Â colors, but later builds had 15.
* Print Preview functionality allowing for adjustment of the font-size from within the preview pane.
* Page Holder sidebar functionality allowing users to hold a page in the sidebar (links-only view available too) and load clicked links in the main browser window. Much of this functionality was replaced with tabbed browsing in later browsers, but not the links-only view.
* As with previous IE Mac versions, and in common with many other Macintosh internet software, the URL from which content was downloaded is added to the [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]]'s Comment field (visible through Get Info).

====Other features ====

These are features found in Internet Explorer for Mac and some other of its contemporaries.
* Auto-complete in the address bar responds to typing partial URLs or page titles, searches favorites and history
* Go menu allows access to the persistent global browser history
* Tasman rendering engine offers superior CSS support compared to [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] in other [[Internet Explorer 5]] versions, and was not affected by the [[Internet Explorer box model bug]] (not fixed in Trident until [[Internet Explorer 6|IE 6]])
* Text zoom allows the user to resize text on any page, regardless of how text size is specified

====Easter egg====

[[Image:About Tasman IE5 Mac OS X.png|250px|thumb|right|[[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in IE for Mac 5]]
[[Acid1]] is included as an offline [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]], accessible by typing '[[about: URI scheme|about:]][[tasman (layout engine)|tasman]]', in Internet Explorer 5 for Mac OS with the text replaced by the names of the developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/14448.html|title=Internet Explorer Easter Egg - IE5 Mac Team|publisher=The Easter Egg Archive |date=2000-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
