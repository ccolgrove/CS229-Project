''' Maurice Young''' (born September 27, 1973), better known by his stage name '''Trick Daddy''', is a certified platinum American [[rapper]] and [[Record producer|producer]] from Miami, Florida.

==Music career==
Trick appeared on the track &quot;Scarred&quot; by former [[2 Live Crew]] member, [[Luther Campbell|Luther &quot;Luke&quot; Campbell]], Produced by Darren &quot;DJ Spin&quot; Rudnick, from Luke's 1996 album ''[[Uncle Luke]]''. The song became a hit and immediately caught the attention of fans and record producers alike. Ted Lucas, a former concert promoter and then-CEO of Slip-n-Slide Records, signed the rapper to the newly formed record label. Slip-n-Slide released Trick Daddy Dollars's debut album ''[[Based on a True Story (Trick Daddy album)|Based on a True Story]]'' in 1997; the album was popular in the Miami area.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title=Trick Daddy &gt; Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p413655|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|date=2006-12-19|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, when his next album ''[[www.thug.com]]'' came out, Trick removed &quot;Dollars&quot; from his stage name. Club-oriented track &quot;[[Nann Nigga]]&quot;, featuring [[Trina]], became a national hit, peaking at the third spot of the ''Billboard'' Hot Rap Singles chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singles charts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Trick Daddy - Billboard Singles|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p413655|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atlantic Records]] signed Trick Daddy to the label in 2000 and released ''[[Book of Thugs|Book of Thugs: Chapter AK Verse 47]]'' that year. &quot;Shut Up&quot;, which Jason Birchmeier of [[allmusic]] considered &quot;a rowdy club hit similar to 'Nann Nigga'&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; followed &quot;Nann&quot; as the next single; featured guests on &quot;Shut Up&quot; were Deuce Poppito, Trina, and Co.

''[[Thugs Are Us]]'', released in 2001, featured the hit single &quot;I'm a Thug&quot;, which reached #17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singles charts&quot;/&gt; His fifth album ''[[Thug Holiday]]'' boasted &quot;In da Wind&quot;, which Birchmeier believed was Trick Daddy's most creative single.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; In 2004, ''[[Thug Matrimony: Married To The Streets]]'' was released, with hit single &quot;[[Let's Go (Trick Daddy song)|Let's Go]]&quot;, produced by [[Lil Jon]], featuring [[Twista]], and sampling the guitar riffs from the [[Ozzy Osbourne]] hit &quot;[[Crazy Train]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; That year, Trick Daddy guest-performed on the [[Ying Yang Twins]]' &quot;What's Happnin!&quot;, which reached #30 on the Hot 100, #7 on the Rhythmic Top 40, and #9 on the Hot Rap Singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ying Yang Twins - Billboard Singles|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p392373|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Let's Go&quot; peaked on #7 on the Hot 100, #4 on the Rhythmic Top 40, and #4 on Hot Rap Tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singles charts&quot;/&gt; ''[[Back By Thug Demand]]'' followed in 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; with singles &quot;Bet That&quot; and &quot;Tuck Ya Ice&quot; charting at the bottom of the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singles charts&quot;/&gt;

In late 2010 Trick Daddy formed a new label Trick Daddy Music Group, signing fellow rappers Kasino, A-Dot, Dutch Dirty and 2T to the roster. Trick Daddy is currently working on a new album to be released in 2012 under his new label. Recently he has released a single featuring [[Young Jeezy]], called &quot;I Can't Leave These Streets Alone&quot;, a very deep and much felt track from both the rappers, that talks about street life and their growth as men in it.
