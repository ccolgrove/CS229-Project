'''ABC Western Plains''' is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station based in [[Dubbo]], [[New South Wales]]. The broadcast region stretches from Wellington north to Goodooga and west from Coonabarabran to Wilcannia. The station covers the top half of the [[Far West (New South Wales)|Far West]] region and part of the [[Orana (New South Wales)|Orana]] region of [[New South Wales]].  This includes Dubbo City and the towns of [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]], [[Cobar, New South Wales|Cobar]], [[Nyngan, New South Wales|Nyngan]], [[Walgett, New South Wales|Walgett]], [[Mudgee]], [[Lightning Ridge, New South Wales|Lightning Ridge]], [[Gilgandra, New South Wales|Gilgandra]], [[Coonamble, New South Wales|Coonamble]] and [[Warren, New South Wales|Warren]]

The station also provides services to isolated communities via satellite such as Ivanhoe, Menindee, Talbingo, Khancoban and even Norfolk Island.

ABC Western Plains began operating in [[1993]] taking over the western and [[outback]] region previously covered from [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] by [[ABC Central West]].

In 2008 the station gained full regional status and is now self managed. This saw the establishment of a local morning show.
