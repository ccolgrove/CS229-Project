'''WORO-DT''' is a full-power, educational/religious television station located in San Juan, Puerto Rico transmitting over digital channel 13. The station is owned by Puerto Rico's Roman Catholic Church and is branded as TeleOro.

==History==
This station was formerly '''WPRV-TV'''. During part of the 1980s, the station was affiliated with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and in the late 80's and early 90's with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. 

Since 2002, WORO leased its prime time hours to local producer [[Angelo Medina]] for his sport programming block branded as  '''Deportes 13'''. During these hours, ''Deportes 13'' transmit sport related programming and events such as [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), ''[[Liga de Voleibol Superior Masculino]]'' among others. Currently the station is trasmiting all the home games of the Maratonistas de Coamo (Double A Baseball Club).

It was in lengthy discussion with [[Dish Network]]. When the station changed format, Dish gave up and dropped talks.

Singer, writer, producer Silverio Perez currently have a variety show called Buenas Noches con Silverio (Good Night with Silverio). 

In August 2008, TeleOro announced that the station would develop a news program titled &quot;Hora Informativa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hora informativa&quot;/&gt; The production's goal is to cover local news as well as material that other channels consider &quot;soft&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hora informativa&quot;/&gt; Segments are led by Luis Penchi and JosÃ© Ãngel Cordero, and covers controversial themes that might not be covered otherwise due to the station's religious focus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hora informativa&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/tv/espectaculos_asi/con_nuevo_noticiario/217133| title=Con nuevo noticiario| author=Karol Joselyn SepÃºlveda | publisher=''Primera Hora''| language=Spanish| date=2008-08-06| accessdate=2008-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
