==Biography==
Jones was born on February 11, 1974 in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Alex. ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''. January 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in the suburb of [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]]. His father is a dentist, and his mother is a homemaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeetAJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|title=Meet Alex Jones, the Talk Radio Host Behind Charlie Sheen's Crazy Rants|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchik|date=2011-03-02|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Anderson High School (Austin, Texas)|Anderson High School]] in northwest [[Austin, Texas]]. Jones was a linemen on his high school's football team.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeetAJ&quot;/&gt; After graduating high school he briefly attended [[Austin Community College]].

He began his career in Austin with a live, call-in format [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] program. In 1996, Jones switched format to KJFK, hosting a show named ''The Final Edition''.&lt;ref name=&quot;KJFK&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Nichols| first = Lee| url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:75039| title = Psst, It's a Conspiracy: KJFK Gives Alex Jones the Boot Media Clips| publisher = [[The Austin Chronicle]]| date = December 10, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he released his first film, ''America Destroyed By Design''.

In 1998, Jones organized a successful effort to build a new [[Branch Davidian]] church as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the government's [[Waco Siege|siege]] of the original Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/branch-davidians-hope-a-new-church-can-close-wounds-719121.html | title =Branch Davidians hope a new church can close wounds | author =Connie Mabin| date =April 19, 2000 | work = | publisher =Associated Press/The Independent (UK) | accessdate = January 29, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He often featured the project on his Public-access television program and claimed that [[David Koresh|Koresh]] and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] and the ATF during the siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;KJFK&quot; /&gt;

In 1999, he tied with Shannon Burke for that year's &quot;Best Austin Talk Radio Host&quot; poll as voted by ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Best of Austin 1999 Readers Poll | year=1999 | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/BestOfAustin/?BOACategory=Media&amp;Year=1999&amp;Poll=Readers&amp;Display=Long | accessdate=2007-08-14 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM. According to the station's operations manager, Jones was fired because his viewpoints made the show hard to sell to advertisers and he refused to broaden his topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;KJFK&quot;/&gt; Jones argued: &quot;It was purely political, and it came down from on high,&quot; and, &quot;I was told 11 weeks ago to lay off Clinton, to lay off all these politicians, to not talk about rebuilding the church, to stop bashing the Marines, A to Z.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KJFK&quot; /&gt;

In early 2000, Jones was one of seven [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for [[Texas House of Representatives|state representative]] in Texas House District 48, an open seat swing district based in [[Austin, Texas]]. Jones stated that he was running, &quot;to be a watchdog on the inside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott S. Greenberger 10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no&quot; /&gt; He aborted his campaign and withdrew before the March primary when polls indicated he had little chance of winning.

==Legal issues==
[[File:AlexJonesBB2007.jpg|thumb|Jones at Ottawa Bilderberg 2006]]
In July 2000, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) programmers claimed that Jones used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or get their shows thrown off the air. The programmers made their views known via radio broadcast and websites.&lt;ref name=&quot;victim-mastermind&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first = Lee| last = Nichols| title = Alex Jones: Conspiracy Victim or Evil Mastermind?| url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=77932| work = Media Clips| newspaper = [[Austin Chronicle]]| date = 2000-07-14| accessdate = 2008-05-20| quote = Alex Jones is no stranger to conspiracy theories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, Jones and assistant Mike Hanson infiltrated [[Bohemian Grove]] and filmed the opening weekend ceremony, known as the ''[[Cremation of Care]]'', claiming it to be mock child sacrifice in front of a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} stone owl of [[Moloch]].

On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the [[Bilderberg group]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], Jones was stopped and detained at the Ottawa airport by Canadian authorities who confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada lawfully. Jones said regarding the reason for his immigration hold, &quot;I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Payton| first = Laura| title = Bilderberg-bound filmmaker held at airport| newspaper = [[The Ottawa Citizen]]| date = 2006-06-08| url = http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&amp;k=12919| accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2007, he was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in New York City. He was charged with operating a [[bullhorn]] without a permit. Two others were also cited for disorderly conduct when his group crashed a live television show featuring [[Geraldo Rivera]]. In an article, one of Jones's fellow protesters said &quot;It was ... guerilla information warfare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Grace| first = Melissa| coauthors = Xana O'Neill| title = Filmmaker arrested during city protest| date = 2007-09-09| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_filmmaker_arrested_during_city_protest.html| accessdate = 2007-09-10|newspaper = [[Daily News (New York)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Jones has directed and produced a number of videos detailing his theories of a &quot;[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]&quot; and his concerns that U.S. national [[sovereignty]] and [[constitutional rights]] have both been eroded as a result.
