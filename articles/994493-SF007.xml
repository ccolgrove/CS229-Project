'''IrfanView''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|ÉªÉr|f|Ã¦|n|v|juË}}) is a freeware/shareware [[image viewer]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] that can view, edit, and convert image files and play video/audio files. It is  noted for its small size, speed, ease of use, and ability to handle a wide variety of graphic file formats, and has some image creation and painting capabilities. The software was first released in 1996.  IrfanView is free for non-commercial use; commercial use requires paid registration.

The program is named for its creator, Irfan Å kiljan from [[Jajce]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], living in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irfanview.com/main_about.htm |title=About the author |first=Irfan |last=Skiljan |publisher=Irfanview.com |accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; IrfanView works under [[Windows 95]] through [[Windows 7]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MStest&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=IrfanView&amp;v=irfan%20skiljan&amp;uid=4&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;c=Graphics%20%26%20Printing&amp;sc=Image%20Editing&amp;os=32-bit  |title=Irfanview 4.25: Compatible |work=Windows 7 Compatibility Center |publisher=[[Microsoft]]| accessdate=2010-06-23}} ''(For Vista, Microsoft tested [http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=IrfanView&amp;v=irfan%20skiljan&amp;uid=4&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;c=Utilities&amp;sc=PC%20Management&amp;os=32-bit Irfanview 4.1])''&lt;/ref&gt;, and can also be run in [[Linux]] under [[Wine (software)|Wine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;iId=163 |title=IrfanView 3.x, 4.x (test results)|publisher=WineHQ.org |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Mac OS X]] using [[WineBottler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2524633?threadID=2524633 |title=Irfanview for Mac: Apple Support Communities |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- specific file formats detailed later--&gt;

==Features==
The program is compact: the basic installation of version 4.30 occupies 1.6&amp;nbsp;MB, and a full install with all plugins occupies about 10&amp;nbsp;MB. The program can be downloaded directly to a [[U3]] compatible device.

It supports viewing and saving of numerous file types including image formats such as [[Windows bitmap|BMP]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[JPEG]], [[JPEG 2000|JP2 &amp; JPM]] (JPEG2000), [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] (includes the optimizer [[PNGOUT]]), [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], [[camera RAW]], [[ECW (file format)|ECW]] (Enhanced Compressed Wavelet), [[Windows Metafile|EMF]] (Enhanced Windows Metafile), FSH (EA Sports format), [[ICO (file format)|ICO]] (Windows icon), LDF (LuraDocument format), LWF (LuraWave format), [[PCX]] (Zsoft Paintbrush), [[Netpbm|PBM]] (Portable bitmap), [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (Portable Document Format), [[Portable graymap|PGM]] (Portable graymap), [[Netpbm format|PPM]] (Portable Pixelmap), [[Truevision TGA|TGA]] (Truevision Targa), and viewing of media files such as [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]], [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]], [[MPEG]], [[MP3]], [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]], and [[text file]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irfanview.com/main_formats.htm &quot;List of supported formats&quot;].  Irfanview.com.  Retrieved 2010-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title=HTML, XHTML, and CSS All-in-One For Dummies |author=Harris, Andy| publisher=[[For Dummies]] |edition=2nd |page=107| isbn=978-0470537558 |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-09-09 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-LdlRI0fT_UC&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=irfanview&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=irfanview&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While viewing images, there are several fit-to-screen scaling options and an automatic slideshow function.  The viewer can open in sequence all the image-files and video clips (of most formats, including AVCHD) contained in a folder. Slideshows can contain still images and video clips; useful with current digital cameras.{{citation needed|date =July 2011}} 

IrfanView can create [[screensavers]] and slide shows from collections of images with optional accompanying [[MP3]] audio. These can be saved as stand-alone executables which run on Windows computers without IrfanView installed.

For slideshow creation, screensaver creation and batch image translations, preset image processing steps can be applied to selected sets of images.

IrfanView can create icons by converting common graphic files into [[ICO (icon image file format)|.ico]] format. It supports Adobe-compatible [[8BF]] image processing filters, including many freely downloadable ones, primarily for application to whole images.

The program has [[TWAIN]] support for retrieving images from [[scanner (computing)|scanners]], and extended support for taking [[screenshot]]s.

Image editing includes crop, resize, and rotate. Images can be adjusted by modifying their brightness, contrast, tint, and gamma level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EKblq5NS4AAC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=irfanview#v=onepage&amp;q=irfanview&amp;f=false |title=Google Earth for Dummies |pages=289â290|last=Crowder |first=David A.| publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]] |work=For Dummies |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-470-09528-7 |year=2007| accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; manually or automatically, and by converting them between file formats. Many of these changes can be applied to multiple images in one operation using [[batch processing]].  Resize can be applied towards the display of animated GIF images to make them larger in either windowed or full-screen modes.  Lossless functions can be applied to JPG images in order to optimize the files without change to the displayed image.

IrfanView can direct the active image to open in an external graphics editor ([[Adobe Photoshop]], for example) if it is installed.

In [[English language|English]] by default, the program is [[Internationalization and localization|internationalized]] in over twenty [[language]]s.

===Plugins===
IrfanView uses plugins to handle a variety of image formats and to add optional functionality such as filter processing or other program features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irfanview.com/plugins.htm Available Plugins] Irfanview.com. Retrieved 2010-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; With the variety of format plugins, the program has been recommended for viewing obscure image formats, or corrupted files, which commercial photo editing software cannot read.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brundage&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Photoshop Elements 8 for Windows: The Missing Manual| author=Brundage, Barbara |page=73 |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] / Pogue Press| year=2009|accessdate=2010-06-23 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uB5H3R_VvFwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Photoshop%20Elements%208%20for%20Windows%3A%20The%20Missing%20Manual&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=irfanview&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title=The 2009 Solo and Small Firm Legal Technology Guide |page=104 |author =Nelson, Sharon D., Esq; Simek,  John W. and Maschke, Michael |year=2009 |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |isbn= 978-1604423211 |http://books.google.com/books?id=1VX3G8lasuwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=.%20The%202009%20Solo%20and%20Small%20Firm%20Legal%20Technology%20Guide&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thumbnails===
This function displays [[thumbnail]] file previews, allowing picture organization and management, at sizes from 50 Ã 50 to 600 Ã 600 pixels. The user can select a number of thumbnails to perform Copy/Move/Delete operations on them, or send them to IrfanView's Batch Processing module or an external program such as [[Adobe Photoshop]].

===Search Engine Toolbar===
As of Version 3.92, installation of the [[eBay]] [[browser toolbar]] was included in order to support the developer.  At that time, installing the toolbar was selected by default, which was criticized as [[spyware]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In version 3.97, installation was unselected by default, and in 3.98, this was replaced by [[Google Desktop Search]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET&quot;&gt;Rosenblatt, Seth (November 08, 2008) [http://download.cnet.com/IrfanView/3000-2192_4-10021962.html Irfanview 4.27 review] CNET.com.  Retrieved 2010-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  A no-toolbar version containing the program and its default plugins is available in a [[ZIP (file format)|.ZIP]] archive rather than a [[.exe]] installer package.

==Reception==
Irfanview has been positively reviewed as &quot;a longtime favorite&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET&quot;/&gt; and &quot;really good&quot; for easily and rapidly viewing and manipulating images, with its editing and drawing tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title=HTML, XHTML, and CSS All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies |author=Harris, Andy; McCulloh, Chris| publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]] |page=97| isbn=978-0-470-18627-5 |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w9kLLI-0exgC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;f=false}} Features extensive introduction and opinion.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other writers have focused on its ability to open a wide variety of image formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brundage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt; In a series of image quality tests conducted in 2004, compared with commercial image compressors and [[Adobe Photoshop]] 7, Irfanview 3.91 produced &quot;consistently better images than the Adobe Photoshop JPEG encoder at the same data rate&quot;, and its JPEG2000 compression quality &quot;closely followed&quot; the best codec, [[JasPer]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Author==
Irfan Å kiljan graduated from the [[Vienna University of Technology]]. In a 2006 interview, 32-year-old Bosnian-born Å kiljan said that he was able to more or less live off the software, generating income with the sale of licenses for commercial users and of special versions for different customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://wolf-hosbach.de/computer/irfan.html |author=Hosbach, Wolf|title= Hat es sich gelohnt?  |number=6| year=2006 |publisher=PC Magazin |language=German |accessdate=2008-10-28}} [http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://wolf-hosbach.de/computer/irfan.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8 (English tr.)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this is the EN WP --&gt;

===Logo/mascot===
According to Skiljan, the IrfanView [[logo]] and [[mascot]] is a &quot;[[roadkill|road]] [[cat]]&quot;
(there is a tire track across the smallest icon)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irfanview.com/faq.htm#Q59 |title=IrfanView Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Irfanview.com |accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that he &quot;likes cats&quot;, and the icon is &quot;a joke.&quot; The IrfanView website pictures him holding &lt;!-- awkwardly --&gt; a &lt;!--longcat--&gt;[[cat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- this section deemed harmless, unnecessary to delete. -Lexein --&gt;
