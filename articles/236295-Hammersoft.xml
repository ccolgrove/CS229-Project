'''Ioannis Metaxas''' ({{lang-el|ÎÏÎ¬Î½Î½Î·Ï ÎÎµÏÎ±Î¾Î¬Ï}}) (April 12, 1871 â January 29, 1941) was a [[Greece|Greek]] general, politician, and dictator, serving as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 1936 until his death in 1941. He governed constitutionally for the first four months of his tenure, and thereafter as a [[military dictatorship|military dictator]] at the helm of the [[4th of August Regime]].

== Military career ==
Born in [[Ithaca]], Metaxas was a career military officer, first seeing action in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. Following studies in the [[German Empire]], he returned to join the General Staff and was part of the modernizing process of the Greek Army before the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912&amp;ndash;1913), in which he actively participated. He was appointed as Chief of the Greek General Staff in 1913 and was promoted to [[Lieutenant General]] in 1916.  He prepared the military attack plans and conducted the diplomacy in the First and Second Balkan Wars that led to the liberation of what today forms the northern provinces of Greece of Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace.

A staunch monarchist, he supported [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] and opposed Greek entry into [[World War I]]. [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], the [[prime minister]], resigned over the refusal of Metaxas to aid the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]' unsuccessful [[Dardanelles campaign]] and used the war as the major issue in the elections. When Venizelos won the [[Greek legislative election, May 1915|May 1915 elections]], he mobilised the army to aid [[Serbia]], but was dismissed by the king. This dismissal solidified the rift between monarchists and Venizelists, creating the &quot;[[National Schism]]&quot; that would plague Greek politics for decades. In August 1916, Venizelist officers launched a revolt in Greece's northern city of  [[Thessaloniki]], which resulted in the establishment of a separate &quot;[[Movement of National Defence|Government of National Defence]]&quot; under Venizelos. The new government, with the Allies' support, expanded its control over half the country, and entered the war on the Allies' side. In June 1917, with Allied support, King Constantine was deposed and Venizelos came to power, declaring war on behalf of the whole country on 29 June 1917.

== Exile and interwar political career ==
Metaxas followed the king into exile in [[Corsica]], neither returning until 1920 and the [[Greek legislative election, 1920|electoral defeat]] of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. Metaxas was one of the few who publicly opposed the ongoing [[Asia Minor Campaign]], citing military considerations, and refused to assume any military office in the war. Following the defeat of Greek forces in Asia Minor, King Constantine was again forced into exile by a revolution led by Colonel [[Nikolaos Plastiras]]. Metaxas moved into politics and founded the [[Freethinkers' Party (Greece)|Freethinkers' Party]] on 12 October 1922. However, his association with the failed royalist [[Leonardopoulos-Gargalidis coup attempt]] in October 1923, forced him to flee the country. Soon after, King [[George II of Greece|George II]] (son of Constantine I) was also forced into exile. The monarchy was abolished, and the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] proclaimed, in March 1924. 

Metaxas returned to Greece soon after, publicly stating his acceptance of the regime change. Despite his being one of the most prominent royalist politicians, and a promising start, Metaxas' foray into politics was not very successful. In the [[Greek legislative election, 1926|1926 elections]], his Freethinkers' Party claimed 15.78% of the vote and 52 seats in Parliament, putting it almost on a par with the other main royalist party, the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]]. As a result, he became Communications Minister in the &quot;[[ecumenical government]]&quot; formed under [[Alexandros Zaimis]].

However, infighting within the party and the departure of many members plunged the party to 5.3% and a single seat in the [[Greek legislative election, 1928|1928 elections]]. The [[Greek legislative election, 1932|1932]] and [[Greek legislative election, 1933|1933 elections]] saw the percentage drop to 1.59%, although the party still returned three MPs, and Metaxas became Interior Minister in the [[Panagis Tsaldaris]] cabinet. In the [[Greek legislative election, 1935|1935 elections]], he cooperated in a union with other small royalist parties, returning 7 MPs, repeating the performance in the [[Greek legislative election, 1936|1936 elections]].

== Prime Minister and the 4th of August Regime==
After a disputed plebiscite, George II returned to take the throne in 1935. The elections of 1936 produced a deadlock between [[Panagis Tsaldaris]] and [[Themistoklis Sophoulis]]. The political situation was further polarized by the gains made by the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE). Disliking the Communists and fearing a coup, George II appointed Metaxas, then minister of war, to be interim prime minister on 13 April 1936, and the appointment was confirmed by the Greek parliament.

Widespread industrial unrest gave Metaxas justification to declare a [[state of emergency]] on August 4, 1936.  With the king's support, he suspended the parliament indefinitely and suspended various articles of the constitution.  In a national radio address, Metaxas declared that for the duration of the state of emergency, he would hold &quot;all the power I need for saving Greece from the catastrophes which threaten her.&quot;  The regime created as a result of this [[self-coup]] became known as &quot;the 4th of August&quot; after the date of its proclamation.

The regime's propaganda presented Metaxas as &quot;the First Peasant&quot;, &quot;the First Worker&quot; and &quot;the National Father&quot; of the Greeks. Metaxas adopted the title of ''Arkhigos'', Greek for &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;chieftain&quot;, and claimed a &quot;Third Hellenic Civilization&quot;, following [[ancient Greece]] and the Greek [[Byzantine Empire]] of the Middle Ages. State propaganda portrayed Metaxas as a &quot;Saviour of the Nation&quot; bringing unity to a divided nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;petrakis39&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Petrakis|first=Marina|title=The Metaxas myth: dictatorship and propaganda in Greece|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|page=39|isbn=1845110374|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal policies ===

Patterning his regime on other authoritarian European governments (most notably [[Fascist Italy]]), Metaxas banned political parties, prohibited strikes and introduced widespread censorship of the media. National unity was to be achieved by the abolition of the previous political parliamentary system, which was seen as having left the country in chaos (see [[National Schism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;petrakis32&quot;&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Metaxas disliked the old parties of the political landscape, including traditional conservatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;petrakis32&quot;/&gt; Along with [[anti-parliamentarism]], [[anti-communism]] formed the second major political agenda of the 4th of August regime.&lt;ref&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Security Konstantinos Maniadakis quickly infiltrated and practically dissolved the Communist Party of Greece by seizing its archives and arresting Communist leader [[Nikos Zachariadis]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing Communism was followed by a campaign against 'Anti-Greek' literature viewed as dangerous to the national interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;petrakis37&quot;&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Book burnings targeted authors such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], and several Greek writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;petrakis37&quot;/&gt; Metaxas himself became Minister of Education in 1938, and had all school texts re-written to fit the regime's ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;petrakis37&quot;/&gt;  

Trying to build a [[corporatism|corporatist]] state and secure popular support, Metaxas adopted or adapted many of Fascist Italy's institutions: a National Labour Service, the eight-hour workday, mandatory improvements to working conditions, and the [[Social Insurance Institute]] ({{lang-el|ÎÎ´ÏÏÎ¼Î± ÎÎ¿Î¹Î½ÏÎ½Î¹ÎºÏÎ½ ÎÏÏÎ±Î»Î¯ÏÎµÏÎ½}}, '''IKA'''), still the biggest social security institution in Greece. In terms of symbolism, the [[Roman salute]] and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] double-axe, the ''[[labrys]]'' were introduced. Unlike Mussolini and other authoritarian regimes, however, Metaxas lacked the support provided by a political mass party. The regime's only mass organization was the [[National Organisation of Youth]] (EON), whose literature and magazines were promoted in schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;petrakis37&quot;/&gt; Throughout his rule, Metaxas' power rested primarily upon the army and the support of King George II.

=== Foreign policy and the war with Italy ===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Metaxasalexandrospapagospaulgeorge.jpg|250px|right|thumb|From left to right: Ioannis Metaxas, crown prince [[Paul of Greece|Paul]], King [[George II of Greece|George II]], and Commander-in-Chief General [[Alexander Papagos]], during the Greco-Italian War.]] --&gt;
In foreign policy Metaxas followed a neutral stance, trying to balance between  the UK and Germany. In the late 1930s, as with the other Balkan countries, Germany became Greece's largest trading partner. Metaxas himself had a reputation as a [[Germanophile]] dating back to his studies in Germany and his role in the National Schism; King George however and most of the country's elites were staunchly [[anglophile]], and the predominance of the British [[Royal Navy]] in the Mediterranean could not be ignored by a maritime country like Greece. Furthermore, the expansionist goals of Mussolini's Italy drove Greece to lean towards the Franco-British alliance. The regime's literature gave praise to fellow European authoritarian states, especially those of Franco, Mussolini and Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  

The policy of Metaxas to keep Greece out of World War II was decisively broken when Mussolini demanded occupation rights to strategic Greek sites.  When the Italian envoy presented these demands on 28 October 1940, he was met with a curt reply by Metaxas: &quot;''Alors, c'est la guerre''&quot; (&quot;then it is war&quot;). However, according to popular legend, Metaxas simply told the Italian envoy, &quot;''Ohi!''&quot; (&quot;No!&quot;)--an incident that has become encapsulated in Greek popular feeling. &quot;[[Ohi Day]]&quot; is still celebrated in Greece each year. A few hours later, Italy invaded Greece from [[Albania]] and started the [[Greco-Italian War]].

Thanks to preparations and an inspired defence the Greeks were able to mount a successful defense and counter offensive, forcing the Italians back into Albania and occupying large parts of Northern [[Epirus]] (Southern Albania). Metaxas never saw the German invasion of Greece during the [[Battle of Greece]] because he died in [[Athens]] on January 29, 1941. Metaxas died of a [[phlegmon]] of the pharynx which subsequently led to incurable [[toxaemia]].  He was succeeded by [[Alexandros Koryzis]]. After the death of Metaxas, the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of Greece]] had to take into account the fortifications constructed by Metaxas in Northern Greece. These fortifications were constructed along the Bulgarian border and were known as the [[Metaxas Line]].

To this day, Metaxas remains a highly controversial figure in Greek history. He is reviled by some for his dictatorial state, and admired by others for his popular policies, [[patriotism]], defiance to aggression, and his [[Greco-Italian War|military victory against Italy]].
