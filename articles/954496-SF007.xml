'''K12LTSP''' is a modification to the [[Centos]] [[operating system]] with the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP) packages integrated into it. It's designed to be easy to install and configure. K12LTSP is an off-shoot of the Linux in School Project (K12Linux).

[[K-12]] is often used in the [[USA]] to refer to grade school from [[kindergarten]] through [[high school]] (12th grade).
