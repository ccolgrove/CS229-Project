'''Guy-Concordia''' is a [[metro station|station]] on the [[Line 1 Green (Montreal Metro)|Green Line]] of the [[Montreal Metro]] [[Rapid transit|rapid transit system]] operated by the [[SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al]] (STM). It is downtown in the borough of [[Ville-Marie (Montreal)|Ville-Marie]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stm.info/English/metro/a-m34.htm Guy-Concordia Station]&lt;/ref&gt; The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the metro. It has consistently been one of the network's busiest stations, ranking 4th in 2006 and 3rd since 2008.

== Overview ==
Before the station underwent renovations, the walls on the platform where covered in an orange-brown glazed tile pattern that still covers some of the walls in the access areas. These tile were replaced with a more modern style glazed ceramic white tiles, multicolored tile mosaics over the seats, and white stone floors.

Designed by J.A. Chicoine, it is a normal [[side platform]] station, built in [[tunnel]] with a [[Transept#Other senses of the word|transept]], [[ticket hall]], and access at each end. The eastern access contains shops and services, and an [[Underground City, Montreal|underground city]] connection to five [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] buildings: EV, MB, GM, LB and H buildings.

There are several shops and services directly in the station, including a [[Tim Hortons]], [[Uniprix]], a &quot;Belle Pizza&quot;, a Harmony pastry shop, a Hair salon, a cyber cafe, shoe store and another small cafe. The station is equipped with the MÃ©troVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the amount of time left until the next train arrives. This was the third station after Berri-UQAM and McGill to have the screens installed.

==Origin of the name==
[[File:Montreal Metro flickr 3.jpg|thumb|left||The interior of the Guy-Concordia Metro station.]]
The station was originally called '''Guy''' after the street where it is located: [[Guy Street]].  On January 1, 1988, it was renamed '''Guy-Concordia''' to reflect the fact that it serves the Sir George Williams campus of [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]].

(Note that in [[French language|French]] the name ''Guy'' is pronounced to rhyme with ''he'', whereas in [[English language|English]] the name is usually pronounced to rhyme with ''hi''. The station is still sometimes referred to simply as ''Guy''.)

Guy Street, in turn, takes its name from [[Ãtienne Guy]] who represented [[Montreal]] in the [[Legislative Assembly]] of [[Lower Canada]] and was the owner of the land through which the street runs.

Concordia University was created in August 1974 from the fusion of Sir George Williams University and Loyola College. It takes its name from the motto of Montreal: ''concordia salus'', &quot;prosperity through concord.&quot;

== Underground Connections ==

On April 7, 2010, all of Concordia University's main buildings are connected through a system of underground passages leading to the Guy-Concordia metro station. A new tunnel was added to the already-existing tunnel that connects the Hall building with the LB building and leads to the station, exiting near the [[Uniprix]] store located near the turnstiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;cjournal.concordia.ca&quot;&gt;http://cjournal.concordia.ca/archives/20081106/quartier_goes_underground.php&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new JMSB building, which opened to students in September 2009 features a tunnel stretching under Guy street that connects it with the EV building, opposite the location of the Le Gym. This major tunnel is 396&amp;nbsp;feet long and lined with ceramic tiles, with display panels for added visual interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;cjournal.concordia.ca&quot;/&gt;
