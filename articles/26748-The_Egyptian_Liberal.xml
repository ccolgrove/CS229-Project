'''Switzerland''' ({{lang-de|Schweiz}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[Swiss German]] name is also sometimes spelled as ''Schwyz'' or ''Schwiiz''. ''[[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]'' is also the standard German (and international) name of one of the Swiss cantons.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ËÊvaÉªts|}}; {{lang-fr|Suisse}} {{IPA-fr|sÉ¥is(É)|}}; {{lang-it|Svizzera}} {{IPA-it|ËzviËtËsÉra|}}; {{lang-rm|Svizra}} {{IPA-rm|ËÊviËtsrÉ|}} or {{IPA-rm|ËÊviËtsÊËÉ|}}), in its full name the '''Swiss Confederation''' ({{lang-la|Confoederatio Helvetica}}, hence its abbreviation [[Data codes for Switzerland#Country|CH]]), is a [[federal republic]] consisting of [[cantons of Switzerland|26&amp;nbsp;cantons]], with [[Bern]] as the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in [[Western Europe]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;Or [[Central Europe]] depending on the definition. See [[Geography of Switzerland]].&lt;/ref&gt; where it is bordered by [[Germany]] to the north, [[France]] to the west, [[Italy]] to the south, and [[Austria]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the east.

Switzerland is a [[landlocked country]] geographically divided between the [[Swiss Alps|Alps]], the [[Swiss Plateau|Central Plateau]] and the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]], spanning an area of {{convert|41285|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 7.9 million people is concentrated mostly on the Plateau, where the largest cities are to be found. Among them are the two [[global city|global cities]] and economic centres of [[Zurich]] and [[Geneva]].

The Swiss Confederation has a long history of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]âit has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815âand did not join the [[United Nations]] until 2002. It pursues, however, an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fleiner, Alexander Misic, Nicole TÃ¶pperwien, ''Swiss Constitutional Law'', p. 28, Kluwer Law International&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland is also the birthplace of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] and home to a large number of international organizations, including the [[United Nations Office at Geneva|second largest UN office]]. On the European level, it is a founding member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] and is part of the [[Schengen Area]] â although it is notably not a member of the [[European Union]], nor the [[European Economic Area]].

In [[nominal]] terms, Switzerland is one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|richest countries]] in the world by [[per capita]] [[gross domestic product]], with a nominal per capita GDP of $75,835.&lt;ref name=imf2/&gt; In 2010, Switzerland had the highest [[wealth]] per adult of any country in the world (with $372,692 for each person).&lt;ref name=&quot;Digitaljournal.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/298716 |title=US is still by far the richest country, China fastest growing |publisher=Digitaljournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland also has one of the world's largest [[List of countries by current account balance as a percentage of GDP|account balances as a percentage of GDP]].

Switzerland comprises three main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, and Italian, to which the [[Romansh language|Romansh]]-speaking valleys are added. The [[Swiss people|Swiss]] therefore do not form a [[nation]] in the sense of a common ethnic or linguistic identity.

== Etymology ==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The English name ''Switzerland'' is a compound containing ''Switzer'', an obsolete term for the [[Swiss people|Swiss]],  which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Swiss Online Etymology Dictionary] etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-25&lt;/ref&gt; The English adjective ''Swiss'' is a loan from French ''{{lang|fr|Suisse}}'', also in use since the 16th century. The name ''Switzer'' is from the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] ''{{lang|gsx|Schwiizer}}'', in origin an inhabitant of ''[[Schwyz]]'' and its [[Canton of Schwyz|associated territory]], one of the WaldstÃ¤tten cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The toponym itself is first attested in [[972]], as [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|Suittes}}'', ultimately perhaps related to ''{{lang|goh|suedan}}'' &quot;to burn&quot;, referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build.&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian. ''Placenames of the World''. London: MacFarland and Co., Inc., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was extended to the area dominated by the canton, and after the [[Swabian War]] of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14358a.htm Switzerland, the Catholic Encyclopedia] newadvent.org.

Retrieved on 2010-01-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss German]] name of the country, ''{{lang|gsx|Schwiiz}}'', is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement, but distinguished by the use of the definite article (''{{lang|gsx|d'Schwiiz}}'' for the Confederation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweizer-deutsch.ch/uploads/media/einige_Beispielseiten_2007-07-05_01.pdf ZÃ¼ritÃ¼Ã¼tsch, Schweizerdeutsch (p. 2)] schweizerdeutsch.ch. Retrieved on 20010-01-26&lt;/ref&gt; but simply ''{{lang|gsx|Schwiiz}}'' for the canton and the town).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sz.ch/xml_1/internet/de/application/d2/d56/d756/f759.cfm Kanton Schwyz: Kurzer historischer Ãberblick] sz.ch. Retrieved on 2010-01-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] name ''Confoederatio Helvetica'' was introduced gradually after the [[Switzerland as a federal state|formation of the federal state]] in 1848, harking back to the Napoleonic [[Helvetic Republic]], appearing on coins from 1879, inscribed on the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland|Federal Palace]] in 1902 and after 1948 used in the official seal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9827.php Marco Marcacci, Confoederatio helvetica (2002)], Historical Lexicon of Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is derived from the name of the ''[[Helvetii]]'', a [[Gaulish tribe]] living on the [[Swiss plateau]] before the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]].
''[[Helvetia]]'' appears as a [[national personification]] of the Swiss confederacy in the 17th century, with a 1672 play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach.&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|16440|Helvetia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Switzerland}}
Switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. The precursors of modern Switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century (1291), forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries.

=== Early history ===
{{Main|Early history of Switzerland|Switzerland in the Roman era}}
The oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date back about 150,000 years.&lt;ref name = Early&gt;[http://www.swissworld.org/en/history/prehistory_to_romans/prehistoric_times/ History] swissworld.org. Retrieved on 2009-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland, which were found at [[GÃ¤chlingen]], have been dated to around 5300 BC.&lt;ref name = Early/&gt;

[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|left|Founded in 44 BC, [[Augusta Raurica]] was the first Roman settlement on the Rhine and is now the most important archaeological site in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?siteSect=108&amp;sid=6054935&amp;cKey=1126454871000 Switzerland's Roman heritage comes to life] swissinfo.ch&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La TÃ¨ne culture]]s, named after the archaeological site of La TÃ¨ne on the north side of [[Lake NeuchÃ¢tel]]. La TÃ¨ne culture developed and flourished during the late [[Iron Age]] from around [[450 BC]],&lt;ref name = Early/&gt; possibly under some influence from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the [[Helvetii]]. In 58 BC, at the [[Battle of Bibracte]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s armies defeated the Helvetii.&lt;ref name = Early/&gt; In 15 BC, [[Tiberius]], who was destined to be the second Roman emperor and his brother, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], conquered the Alps, integrating them into the [[Roman Empire]]. The area occupied by the [[Helvetii]]âthe namesakes of the later ''Confoederatio Helvetica''âfirst became part of Rome's [[Gallia Belgica]] province and then of its [[Germania Superior]] province, while the eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]].

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], from the 4th century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Kings of the Burgundians]]. The [[Alemanni]] settled the [[Swiss plateau]] in the 5th century and the [[valleys of the Alps]] in the 8th century, forming Alemannia. Modern-day Switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]].&lt;ref name = Early/&gt; The entire region became part of the expanding [[Frankish Empire]] in the 6th century, following [[Clovis I]]'s victory over the Alemanni at [[Tolbiac]] in 504 AD, and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians.&lt;ref name = Nationsencyclopedia&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Switzerland-HISTORY.html Switzerland history] Nationsencyclopedia.com.

Retrieved on 2009-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the rest of the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries the Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony ([[Merovingians|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] dynasties). But after its extension under [[Charlemagne]], the Frankish empire was divided by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843.&lt;ref name = Early/&gt; The territories of present day Switzerland became divided into [[Middle Francia]] and [[East Francia]] until they were reunified under the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around 1000 AD.&lt;ref name = Early/&gt;

By 1200, the Swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[ZÃ¤hringer]], [[Habsburg]] and [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]].&lt;ref name = Early/&gt; Some regions ([[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], later known as ''WaldstÃ¤tten'') were accorded the [[Imperial immediacy]] to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264 AD, the Habsburgs under [[Rudolph I of Habsburg|King Rudolph I]] (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) extended their territory to the eastern Swiss plateau.&lt;ref name = Nationsencyclopedia/&gt;

=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===
{{Main|Old Swiss Confederacy}}
{{See|Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|Reformation in Switzerland|Early Modern Switzerland}}
[[File:Bundesbrief.jpg|thumb|Federal charter of 1291]]

The [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps. The Confederacy facilitated management of common interests ([[free trade]]) and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes. The [[Federal Charter of 1291]] agreed between the [[Medieval commune|rural communes]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], and [[Unterwalden]] is considered the confederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;schwabe&quot;&gt;Schwabe &amp; Co.: ''Geschichte der Schweiz und der Schweizer'', Schwabe &amp; Co 1986/2004.

[[File:Old Swiss Confederation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|The Old Swiss Confederacy from 1291 (dark grey) to the sixteenth century (light grey) and its associates (blue)]]
By 1353, the three original [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] had joined with the cantons of [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and the [[Lucerne]], [[Zurich]] and [[Bern]] city states to form the &quot;Old Confederacy&quot; of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the federation.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs ([[Battle of Sempach]], [[Battle of NÃ¤fels]]), over [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] during the 1470s, and the success of the [[Swiss mercenaries]]. The Swiss victory in the [[Swabian War]] against the [[Swabian League]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1499 amounted to ''de facto'' independence within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt;

The Old Swiss Confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars, but [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|expansion of the federation]] suffered a setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. This ended the so-called &quot;heroic&quot; epoch of Swiss history.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; The success of [[Zwingli]]'s [[Reformation in Switzerland|Reformation]] in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 ([[Wars of Kappel]]). It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], European countries recognized Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its [[neutral country|neutrality]].&lt;ref name = Nationsencyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name = Nationsonline/&gt;

During the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Early Modern]] period of Swiss history, the growing [[authoritarianism]] of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]] led to the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]]. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the [[Battles of Villmergen]] in 1656 and 1712.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt;

=== Napoleonic era ===
{{Main|Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|Helvetic Republic|Act of Mediation}}

[[File:Acte de MÃ©diation mg 0643.jpg|right|thumb|The Act of Mediation was Napoleon's attempt at a compromise between the [[Ancien RÃ©gime]] and a Republic.]]

In 1798, the [[French Revolution|revolutionary French]] government conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; This centralised the government of the country and effectively abolished the cantons and [[Mulhouse|MÃ¼lhausen]] and [[Valtellina]] valley separated from Switzerland. The new [[regime]], known as the [[Helvetic Republic]], was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French [[satellite state]]. The fierce French suppression of the [[Nidwalden|Nidwalden Revolt]] in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the [[French Army]] and the local population's resistance to the occupation.

When war broke out between France and its rivals, Russian and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the name of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the [[Act of Mediation]] which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; Henceforth much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.

In 1815 the [[Congress of Vienna]] fully re-established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality.&lt;ref name = Nationsencyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name = Nationsonline/&gt;&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|Siege of Gaeta]]. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of [[Valais]], [[Canton of NeuchÃ¢tel|NeuchÃ¢tel]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]]. Switzerland's borders have not changed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|7841|Swiss border}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Federal state ===
{{Main|Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland)|Switzerland as a federal state}}
[[File:Bern, Federal Palace, 1857.jpg|thumb|The first [[Federal Palace]] in Bern (1857). One of the three cantons presiding over the [[Tagsatzung]] (former legislative and executive council), Bern was chosen as the federal capital in 1848, mainly because of its closeness to the French speaking area.&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|10102|Bundesstadt}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The restoration of the power to the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the [[ZÃ¼riputsch]] of 1839, civil war broke out in 1847 when some of the Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the ''[[Sonderbundskrieg]]'').&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through [[friendly fire]]. However minor the Sonderbundskrieg seems to be when compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland.

The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its European neighbours. Swiss people from all strata of society, whether Catholic, Protestant, or from the liberal or conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged.

Thus, while the rest of Europe was [[revolutions of 1848|plagued by revolutionary uprisings]], the Swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a [[Swiss Federal Constitution|federal layout]], much of it inspired by the [[United States Constitution|American example]]. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an [[upper house]] (the [[Swiss Council of States]], 2 representatives per canton) and a [[lower house]] (the [[National Council of Switzerland]], representatives elected from across the country). [[Referenda]] were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution.&lt;ref name = Nationsonline/&gt;

Retrieved on 2010-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A system of single weights and measures was introduced and in 1850 the [[Swiss franc]] became the Swiss [[single currency]]. Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, though the Swiss were still obliged to serve [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]] with Swiss Guards present at the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|Siege of Gaeta in 1860]], marking the end of foreign service.

An important clause of the constitution was that it could be re-written completely if this was deemed necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.&lt;ref name=HistoiredelaSuisse&gt;''Histoire de la Suisse'', Ãditions FragniÃ¨re, Fribourg, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly. An early draft was rejected by the population in 1872 but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; It introduced the [[Referendum#Switzerland|facultative referendum]] for laws at the federal level. It also established federal responsibility for defense, trade, and legal matters.

In 1891, the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of [[direct democracy]], which remain unique even today.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt;

[[File:Ulrich Wille.jpg|thumb|General [[Ulrich Wille]], Commander-in-Chief of the Swiss Army during [[World War I]]]]
Switzerland was not invaded during either of the [[world war]]s. During World War I, Switzerland was home to Vladimir Illych Ulyanov ([[Lenin]]) and he remained there until 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/extraordinary_exiles/index/Lenin_and_the_Swiss_non-revolution.html?cid=12812 Lenin and the Swiss non-revolution] swissinfo.ch. Retrieved on 2010-01-25&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the [[Grimm-Hoffmann Affair]] in 1917, but it was short-lived. In 1920, Switzerland joined the [[League of Nations]], which was based in [[Geneva]], on the condition that it was exempt from any military requirements.

[[Switzerland during World War II|During World War II]], detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the Germans,&lt;ref&gt;''Let's Swallow Switzerland'' by Klaus Urner (Lexington Books, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; but Switzerland was never attacked.&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; Switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion.&lt;ref name = Nationsonline/&gt;&lt;ref name = Stonebooks&gt;[http://stonebooks.com/archives/981111.shtml Book review: Target Switzerland: Swiss Armed Neutrality in World War II, Halbrook, Stephen P.] stonebooks.com. Retrieved on 2009-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; Under General [[Henri Guisan]], a massive mobilisation of militia forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the [[Reduit]]. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.&lt;ref name = Stonebooks/&gt;

Switzerland's trade was blockaded by both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and by the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the [[Third Reich]] varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through [[Vichy France]] was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|10374|Asylum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Red Cross]], based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict. Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy but not until the end of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uek.ch/en/schlussbericht/synthesis/ueke.pdf The Bergier Commission Final Report], page 498.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying on to this day with some Swiss banks and entities still refusing to surrender the assets obtained from victims of Nazi persecution.

During the war, the Swiss Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides, shooting down 11 intruding [[Luftwaffe]] planes in May and June 1940, then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from Germany. Over 100 Allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war. During 1944â45, Allied bombers mistakenly bombed a few places in Switzerland, among which were the cities of [[Schaffhausen]], [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name = Stonebooks/&gt;

After the war, the Swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the Schweizerspende and also donated to the [[Marshall Plan]] to help Europe's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefit the Swiss economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uek.ch/en/schlussbericht/synthesis/ueke.pdf The Bergier Commission Final Report], page 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Switzerland became a full member of the [[United Nations]], leaving the [[Holy See|Vatican City]] as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership. Switzerland is a founding member of the [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]], but is not a member of the [[European Economic Area]]. An application for membership in the [[European Union]] was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992&lt;ref name = Brief/&gt; when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referenda on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of [[bilateralism|bilateral agreements]] with the European Union. Switzerland, together with [[Liechtenstein]], has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's membership in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the [[Schengen treaty]], a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.&lt;ref name = Nationsonline/&gt;

Switzerland lies between latitudes [[45th parallel north|45Â°]] and [[48th parallel north|48Â° N]], and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5Â°]] and [[11th meridian east|11Â° E]]. It contains three basic topographical areas: the [[Swiss Alps]] on the south, the [[Swiss plateau|Central Plateau]] or middleland, and the [[Jura mountains]] on the north. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found, totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres. From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the [[Rhine]], [[Inn River|Inn]], [[Ticino River|Ticino]] and [[Rhone]], which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe. The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe, among which are included [[Lake Geneva]], [[Lake Constance]] and [[Lake Maggiore]]. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes, and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water. Lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory.&lt;ref name = Geo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/regionen/thematische_karten/maps/raum_und_umwelt/naturraum_schweiz.html Physical Geography of Switzerland] bfs.admin.ch.

In the southeast the long [[Engadin]] Valley, encompassing the [[St. Moritz]] area in canton [[GraubÃ¼nden]], is also well known; the highest peak in the neighbouring [[Bernina Alps]] is [[Piz Bernina]] ({{convert|4049|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;geography&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Herbermann | first = Charles George | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = Encyclopedia Press |year=1913 | location = | page = 358 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more populous northern part of the country, comprising about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Middle Land. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly. There are large lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;geography&quot;/&gt; The largest lake is [[Lake Geneva]] (also called Lac LÃ©man in French), in western Switzerland. The [[Rhone River]] is both the main input and output of Lake Geneva.

The Swiss [[climate]] is generally [[temperate climate|temperate]], but can vary greatly between the localities,&lt;ref name = Climate&gt;[http://www.about.ch/geography/climate/index.html Climate in Switzerland] about.ch, Retrieved on 2009-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BBCclimate&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT005790 Country guide, Switzerland] bbc.co.uk, Retrieved on 2009-11-20&lt;/ref&gt; from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near [[Mediterranean climate]] at Switzerland's southern tip. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from [[Swiss plateau#Climate|inversion]], during this periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.

A weather phenomenon known as the [[foehn wind|fÃ¶hn]] (with an identical effect to the [[chinook wind]]) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.
The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as [[GraubÃ¼nden]] remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the [[Valais]] wine grapes are grown there.&lt;ref name = FederalClimate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/web/en/climate/climate_today/swiss_climate_maps.html |title=Climate data sunshine/temperature/rainfall choosable on federal weather bureau |publisher=Meteoschweiz.admin.ch |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wettest conditions persist in the high Alps and in the [[Ticino]] canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time.&lt;ref name = FederalClimate/&gt; Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation than summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods.

=== Environment ===
Switzerland's ecosystems can be particularly fragile, because of the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains, often forming unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.image-switzerland.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/e/Image_der_Schweiz/Switzerland_s_strengths_people.pdf The strengths of Switzerland and its people, p.3]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}} Federal Department of Foreign Affairs FDFA.

The [[Federal constitution of Switzerland|Federal Constitution]] adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of the modern federal state. It is among the oldest constitutions in the world.&lt;ref name = Politics&gt;[http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/ocea/vaus/infoch/chpoli.html Political System] admin.ch, Retrieved on 2009-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/eur/vgbr/infoch/chpoli.html |title=Political System |publisher=Federal Department of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament (legislative), the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] (executive) and the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Court]] (judicial).

[[File:Bern 104.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Federal Palace]] in [[Bern]] is the building in which the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland]] (federal parliament) and the [[Swiss Federal Council]] (executive) are housed.]]

The [[Swiss Parliament]] consists of two houses: the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]] which has 46 representatives (two from each canton and one from each half-canton) who are elected under a system determined by each canton, and the [[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]], which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of [[proportional representation]], depending on the population of each canton. Members of both houses serve for 4 years. When both houses are in joint session, they are known collectively as the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]]. Through [[referendum]]s, citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through [[initiative]]s, introduce amendments to the federal constitution, thus making Switzerland a [[direct democracy]].&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt;

The [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] constitutes the federal [[government]], directs the [[Federal administration of Switzerland|federal administration]] and serves as collective [[Head of State]]. It is a collegial body of seven members, elected for a four-year mandate by the Federal Assembly which also exercises [[Regulation|oversight]] over the Council. The [[President of the Swiss Confederation|President of the Confederation]] is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members, traditionally in rotation and for a one-year term; the President chairs the government and assumes representative functions. However, the president is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'' with no additional powers, and remains the head of a department within the administration.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt;

The Swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959, each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament.
The classic distribution of 2 CVP/PDC, 2 SPS/PSS, 2 FDP/PRD and 1 SVP/UDC as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the &quot;[[Zauberformel|magic formula]]&quot;.
In the [[Swiss Federal Council election, 2007|2007 Federal Council elections]] the seven seats in the Federal Council were distributed as follows:
: 2 [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats (SPS/PSS)]],
: 2 [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Liberal Democrats (FDP/PRD)]],
: 2 [[Swiss People's Party|Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC)]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;The SVP/UDC has suffered a split since the election, with both their councillors defecting to the [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland]] (BDP/PBD). As of 2009, with the election of [[Ueli Maurer]], the SVP/UDC and the BDP/PBD hold one seat each.&lt;/ref&gt;
: 1 [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democrats (CVP/PDC)]].

The function of the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]] is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts. The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ch.ch/behoerden/00215/00329/00353/index.html?lang=en The Judiciary: The Federal Supreme Court] ch.ch.

=== Direct democracy ===
{{Main|Voting in Switzerland}}
[[File:Landsgemeinde Glarus 2006.jpg|thumb|The [[Landsgemeinde]] is an old form of [[direct democracy]]. It is still practised in two cantons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantons&quot;&gt;[http://www.ch.ch/behoerden/00215/00330/index.html?lang=en Cantons] ch.ch. Retrieved on 2009-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions: the commune, canton and federal levels. The 1848 federal constitution defines a system of [[direct democracy]] (sometimes called ''half-direct'' or representative direct democracy since it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a [[parliamentary democracy]]). The instruments of Swiss direct democracy at the federal level, known as civic rights (''Volksrechte'', ''droits civiques''), include the right to submit a ''constitutional initiative'' and a ''referendum'', both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435383/How-direct-democracy-makes-Switzerland-a-better-place.html How direct democracy makes Switzerland a better place] telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved on 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt;

By calling a federal ''referendum'' a group of citizens may challenge a law that has been passed by Parliament, if they can gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a [[majority|simple majority]] whether to accept or reject the law. Eight cantons together can also call a referendum on a federal law.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt;

Similarly, the federal ''constitutional initiative'' allows citizens to put a [[constitutional amendment]] to a national vote, if they can get 100,000 voters to sign the proposed amendment within 18 months.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Since 1999, an initiative can also be in the form of a general proposal to be elaborated by Parliament, but because it is considered less attractive for various reasons, this form of initiative has yet to find any use.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, with voters having to indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in Parliament, must be accepted by a [[double majority]] of both the national popular vote and a majority of the cantonal popular votes.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is a majority of 23 cantonal votes, because the result of the popular vote in the six traditional [[half-canton]]s each counts as half the vote of one of the other cantons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tremblay; Lecours; et al.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt;These [[half-canton]]s are represented by one councillor (instead of two) in the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]].&lt;/small&gt;

The cantons have a permanent constitutional status and, in comparison with the situation in other countries, a high degree of independence. Under the Federal Constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status. Each canton has its own constitution, and its own parliament, government and courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantons&quot;/&gt; However, there are considerable differences between the individual cantons, most particularly in terms of population and geographical area. Their populations vary between 15,000 (Appenzell Innerrhoden) and 1,253,500 (Zurich), and their area between {{convert|37|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} (Basel-Stadt) and {{convert|7105|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} (GraubÃ¼nden). The Cantons comprise a total of 2,889 [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipalities]]. Within Switzerland there are two [[enclave]]s: [[BÃ¼singen]] belongs to Germany, [[Campione d'Italia]] belongs to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enclaves.webs.com/westerneurope.htm Enclaves of the world] enclaves.webs.com.

Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action and had been neutral since the end of its [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|expansion]] in 1515. Its policy of neutrality has been internationally recognised at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.&lt;ref name = Neutrality&gt;[http://www.swissworld.org/en/politics/foreign_policy/neutrality_and_isolationism/ Neutrality and isolationism] swissworld.org, Retrieved on 2009-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Switzerland-COUNTRY-HISTORY-AND-ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT.html|title=Switzerland â Country history and economic development|work=nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name = Neutrality/&gt; and it was the first state to join it by referendum.

An unusual number of international institutions have their seats in Switzerland, in part because of its policy of neutrality. [[Geneva]] is the birth place of the [[Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]] and, since 2006, hosts the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. Even though Switzerland is one of the most recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the [[Palace of Nations]] in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the [[United Nations]] after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the [[League of Nations]].

Apart from the United Nations headquarters, the Swiss Confederation is host to many UN agencies, like the World Health Organization ([[WHO]]), the International Labour Organization ([[International Labour Organization|ILO]]), the International Telecommunication Union ([[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ([[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]) and about 200 other international organisations, including the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref name = Neutrality/&gt; The annual meetings of the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]] bring together top international business and political leaders from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world, including health and the environment.

Furthermore, many sport federations and organisations are located throughout the country, such as the [[International Basketball Federation]], in Geneva, the [[UEFA]] (Union of European Football Associations), in [[Nyon]], the [[FIFA]] (International Federation of Association Football) and the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], in [[Zurich]], the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|International Cycling Union]], in [[Aigle]], and the [[International Olympic Committee]], in [[Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifsports-guide.ch/english/navigation/annuaire_en.html Sports directory] if-sportsguide.ch.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Military of Switzerland}}
[[File:Axalp FA-18C 5.jpg|thumb|A Swiss Air Force [[F/A-18 Hornet]] in flight over the Alps]]
The [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Armed Forces]], including the Land Forces and the [[Swiss Air Force|Air Force]], are [[Conscription in Switzerland|composed of conscripts]]: professional soldiers constitute only about 5 percent of the military personnel, and all the rest are conscript male citizens aged from 20 to 34 (in special cases up to 50) years. Being a [[landlocked]] country, Switzerland has no navy; however on lakes bordering neighbouring countries armed military patrol boats are used. Swiss citizens are prohibited from serving in foreign armies, with the exception of the [[Swiss Guard]]s of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].

The structure of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their Army issued equipment, including all personal weapons, at home. Some organizations and political parties find this practice controversial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schutz-vor-waffengewalt.ch/ An initiative to abandon this practice]{{dead link|date=May 2011}} has been launched on 4 September 2007, and supported by [[Group for a Switzerland without an Army|GSoA]], the [[Green Party of Switzerland]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland]] as well as other organisations which are listed at [http://www.schutz-vor-waffengewalt.ch/organisationen.html schutz-vor-waffengewalt.ch]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mainstream Swiss opinion is in favour of the system. [[Conscription|Compulsory military service]] is no longer required but concerns all male Swiss citizens; women can serve voluntarily. Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 19. About two thirds of the young Swiss are found suited for service; for those found unsuited, various forms of alternative service exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/zwei_drittel_der_rekruten_diensttauglich_1.687233.html |title=Zwei Drittel der Rekruten diensttauglich (Schweiz, NZZ Online) |work= |accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit centres for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks. The reform &quot;Army XXI&quot; was adopted by popular vote in 2003, it replaced the previous model &quot;Army 95&quot;, reducing the effectives from 400,000 to about 200,000. Of those, 120,000 are active in periodic Army training and 80,000 are non-training reserves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbs.admin.ch/internet/vbs/de/home/documentation/armeezahlen/eff.html Armeezahlen www.vbs.admin.ch]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, three general mobilisations have been declared to ensure the integrity and neutrality of Switzerland. The first one was held on the occasion of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870â71. The second one was decided in response to the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The third mobilisation of the army took place on September 1939 in response to the German attack on Poland; [[Henri Guisan]] was elected as the General-in-Chief.

Because of its neutrality policy, the Swiss army does not currently take part in armed conflicts in other countries, but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world. Since 2000 the armed forces department has also maintained the [[Onyx (interception system)|Onyx]] intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications.&lt;ref&gt;As context, according to [[Edwin Reischauer]], &quot;To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden.&quot; â ''see'' Chapin, Emerson.

September 2, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the [[Cold War]] there have been a number of attempts to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an [[Group for a Switzerland without an Army|anti-militarist group]], was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d//pore/va//19891126/index.html Volksabstimmung vom 26. November 1989] admin.ch.

=== Switzerland and the European Union ===
{{Main|Switzerland â European Union relations}}
Switzerland voted against membership in the [[European Economic Area]] in a referendum in December 1992 and has since maintained and developed its relationships with the European Union (EU) and European countries through bilateral agreements. In March 2001, the Swiss people refused in a popular vote to start accession negotiations with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The economy has been growing most recently at around 3% per year. [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Switzerland|Full EU membership]] is a long-term objective of some in the Swiss government, but there is considerable popular sentiment against this supported by the conservative [[Swiss People's Party|SVP]] party.

The government has established an Integration Office under the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs|Department of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Federal Department of Economic Affairs|Department of Economic Affairs]]. To minimise the negative consequences of Switzerland's isolation from the rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons. A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified. The second series includes the [[Schengen Treaty]] and the [[Dublin Convention]]. They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.

In 2006, Switzerland approved a billion francs supportive investment in the poorer Southern and [[Central Europe]]an countries in support of cooperation and positive ties to the EU as a whole. A further referendum will be needed to approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission. The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas: opening up the electricity market, participation in the European GNSS project [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]], cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising certificates of origin for food products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europa.admin.ch/themen/00499/00503/index.html?lang=en Switzerland and the European Union] europa.admin.ch.

[[Electricity]] generated in Switzerland is 56% from [[hydroelectricity]] and 39% from [[nuclear power]], with 5% of the electricity generated from conventional power sources resulting in a nearly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two [[anti-nuclear]] initiatives were turned down: ''Moratorium Plus'', aimed at forbidding the building of new [[nuclear power plants]] (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/20030518/det502.html |title=Vote No. 502 â Summary |date=18 May 2003 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/20030518/det501.html |title=Vote No. 501 â Summary |date=18 May 2003 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants was the result of a [[initiative|citizens' initiative]] voted on in 1990 which had passed with 54.5% Yes vs. 45.5% No votes. A new nuclear plant in the [[Canton of Bern]] is presently planned. The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for all questions relating to energy supply and energy use within the [[Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications]] (DETEC). The agency is supporting the [[2000-watt society]] initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/forschungnetze/01223/index.html?lang=en |title=Federal government energy research|date=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 25 May 2011 the Swiss government announced that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. &quot;The government has voted for a phaseout because we want to ensure a secure and autonomous supply of energy,&quot; Energy Minister Doris Leuthard said that day at a press conference in Bern. &quot;Fukushima showed that the risk of nuclear power is too high, which in turn has also increased the costs of this energy form.&quot; The first reactor would reportedly be taken offline in 2019 and the last one in 2034.

Switzerland lies at the crossroads of several major European cultures that have heavily influenced the country's languages and culture. Switzerland has four [[official language]]s: German (63.7% total population share, with foreign residents; 72.5% of residents with [[Swiss nationality law|Swiss citizenship]], in 2000) in the north, east and centre of the country; French (20.4%; 21.0%) to the west; Italian (6.5%; 4.3%) in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;federalstatistics&quot; /&gt; [[Romansh language|Romansh]] (0.5%; 0.6%), a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken locally in the southeastern trilingual canton of [[GraubÃ¼nden]], is designated by the Federal Constitution as a national language along with German, French and Italian (Article 4 of the Constitution), and as official language if the authorities communicate with persons of Romansh language (Article 70), but federal laws and other official acts do not need to be decreed in this language. The federal government is obliged to communicate in the official languages, and in the federal parliament simultaneous translation is provided from and into German, French and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.ch/e/service-presse/parlamentsdienste/aufgaben/Pages/default.aspx The Parliamentary Services] parlament.ch.

The German spoken in Switzerland is predominantly a group of [[Alemannic dialects]] collectively known as [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]], but written communication typically use [[Swiss Standard German]], whilst the majority of radio and TV broadcast is now in Swiss German as well. Similarly, there are some dialects of [[Franco-ProvenÃ§al language|Franco-ProvenÃ§al]] in rural communities in the French speaking part, known as &quot;Suisse romande&quot;, called Vaudois, GruÃ©rien, Jurassien, Empro, Fribourgeois, NeuchÃ¢telois, and in the Italian speaking area, [[Ticinese]] (a dialect of [[Lombard language|Lombard]]). Moreover, the official languages (German, French and Italian) borrow some terms not understood outside of Switzerland, i.e. terms from other languages (German ''Billette''&lt;ref name=&quot;billete&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mct.sbb.ch/mct/reisemarkt/billette/online-ticket.htm |title=SBB: Billette â OnlineTicket |publisher=Mct.sbb.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from French), from similar term in another language (Italian ''azione'' used not as ''act'' but as ''discount'' from German ''Aktion'').

The country is historically about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reclus | first = ÃlisÃ©e | authorlink = ÃlisÃ©e Reclus | coauthors = | title = The Earth and Its Inhabitants | publisher = D.

[[Central Switzerland]], as well as Ticino, is traditionally Catholic. The [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the [[Sonderbundskrieg]], consciously defines a [[consociational state]], allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete [[separation of church and state]] was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/19800302/index.html Volksabstimmung vom 2.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Literature of Switzerland}}
[[File:Rousseau Geneve.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was not only a writer but also an influential philosopher of the eighteenth-century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/switzerland/ Art in literature] cp-pc.ca. Retrieved on 2009-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; (his statue in [[Geneva]]).]]
As the Confederation, from its foundation in 1291, was almost exclusively composed of German-speaking regions, the earliest forms of literature are in German. In the 18th century French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while the influence of the French-speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before.&lt;ref&gt;From [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], [[Wikisource:1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica/Switzerland/Literature|Swiss literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the classics of Swiss German literature are [[Jeremias Gotthelf]] (1797â1854) and [[Gottfried Keller]] (1819â1890). The undisputed giants of 20th century Swiss literature are [[Max Frisch]] (1911â91) and [[Friedrich DÃ¼rrenmatt]] (1921â90), whose repertoire includes Die Physiker ([[The Physicists]]) and Das Versprechen ([[The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel|The Pledge]]), released in 2001 as a Hollywood film.&lt;ref name = Literature&gt;[http://www.swissworld.org/en/culture/literature/german_speaking_authors/ Literature] swissworld.org, Retrieved on 2009-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent French-speaking writers were [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712â1778) and [[Germaine de StaÃ«l]] (1766â1817). More recent authors include [[Charles Ferdinand Ramuz]] (1878â1947), whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment and [[Blaise Cendrars]] (born FrÃ©dÃ©ric Sauser, 1887â1961).&lt;ref name = Literature/&gt; Also Italian and Romansh-speaking authors contributed but in more modest way given their small number.

The probably most famous Swiss literary creation, ''[[Heidi]]'', the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Alps, was one of the most popular children's books ever and has come to be a symbol of Switzerland. Her creator, [[Johanna Spyri]] (1827â1901), wrote a number of other books around similar themes.&lt;ref name = Literature/&gt;

=== Media ===
{{Main|Media of Switzerland}}
The freedom of the press and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the federal constitution of Switzerland.&lt;ref name = Media&gt;[http://www.ch.ch/private/00085/00090/00479/00480/index.html?lang=en Press and the media] ch.ch.

Switzerland has historically boasted the greatest number of newspaper titles published in proportion to its population and size.&lt;ref name = Press&gt;[http://www.pressreference.com/Sw-Ur/Switzerland.html Press in Switzerland] pressreference.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-25&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential newspapers are the German-language [[Tages-Anzeiger]] and [[Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung]] NZZ, and the French-language [[Le Temps]], but almost every city has at least one local newspaper. The cultural diversity accounts for a large number of newspapers.&lt;ref name = Press/&gt;

In contrast to the print media, the broadcast media has always been under greater control of the government.&lt;ref name = Press/&gt; The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, whose name was recently changed to [[SRG SSR idÃ©e suisse]], is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programs. SRG SSR studios are distributed throughout the various language regions.

The largest, [[Lake Geneva]], is the home of the sailing team [[Alinghi]] which was the first European team to win the [[America's Cup]] in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007.

[[Swiss chocolate|Chocolate]] had been made in Switzerland since the 18th century but it gained its reputation at the end of the 19th century with the invention of modern techniques such as [[conching]] and [[Chocolate#Tempering|tempering]] which enabled its production on a high quality level.

The most popular alcoholic drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for the variety of grapes grown because of the large variations in [[terroir]]s, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. [[Swiss wine]] is produced mainly in [[Valais (wine region)|Valais]], [[Vaud]] ([[Lavaux]]), [[Geneva (wine region)|Geneva]] and [[Ticino (wine region)|Ticino]], with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the [[Chasselas]] (called [[Fendant]] in Valais) and [[Pinot Noir]]. The [[Merlot]] is the main variety produced in Ticino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisswine.ch/english/bienv/main.asp Wine-producing Switzerland in short] swisswine.ch.
