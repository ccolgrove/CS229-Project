==Plot==
{{Plot|date=August 2010}}
The film opens with Brad ([[Rory Cochrane]]), an out of work musician, making a cup of [[lattÃ©]] for his wife Lexi ([[Mary McCormack]]) who is still in bed. She soon leaves for work and Brad is left at home alone. Over the radio he hears that several suspected dirty bombs have been detonated across Los Angeles. He exits his house and sees large amounts of smoke rising from the city center and gets into his car to drive towards the city center in order to find her. Brad tries to contact her through her cell phone, but only receives a busy signal. He soon finds that most roads now have [[blockade|police blockades]].

An ash covered car is stopped by the police. One policeman notices Brad watching from inside his car and goes over to him to tell him to go back home. The police officers aim their weapons at the driver as he gets out and demand that he get back into his car. He ignores their warning and is shot down by the police. Brad decides to leave and go back home when he encounters a small boy called Timmy (Scotty Noyd Jr.) who is watching the rising smoke from the city center. Brad tells him to run home to his parents as fast as he can as it is not safe where he is.

Once home Alvaro ([[Tony Perez]])enters the house and asks Brad if he can stay with him as there is no one at the neighbor's house where he was working. They hear that survivors of the blasts are being [[quarantine|quarantined]] as the weapons were dirty bombs and the authorities advise people to seal up their homes before the contaminated dust cloud reaches them. Brad and Alvaro then proceed to seal up the house with [[duct tape]] and plastic. As it becomes increasingly more obvious that Lexi might not come home, he takes some of Lexi's clothes and leaves them outside the back door with some food and water. Brad and Alvaro then proceed to seal off the front door. Radio newscasts claim that the bombs contained several toxins and an unknown viral strain.

Lexi has been involved in a car crash but is still alive. She walks home still covered in the dust and Brad realizes she could infect both himself and Alvaro so does not let her in. Lexi becomes desperate believing that Brad had planned to lock her out of the house. She loses her temper and throws her cell phone at one of the door panes, breaking it. Brad and Alvaro both rush to cover up the breakage and seal it off. Together they manage to calm down Lexi.

Brad then seals off the main bedroom from the rest of the house so that Lexi can get into it. Lexi receives a call from her mother, who realizes that she was near the explosion and is probably infected. Her pleas for Lexi to go to a hospital fall on deaf ears, as Lexi tells her that the rest of the country is seeing news that is not reflecting the reality of the situation. A car alarm goes off revealing Timmy standing next to it. Lexi calls him over and Brad seals off another part of the house in order for Lexi and Timmy to clean off the ash up in the bathroom. Alvaro soon decides to leave the house as he &quot;needs to be with his wife&quot;. Brad tries to convince him to stay but the last we see of Alvaro is him walking down the road slowly getting covered by the ash.

Lexi hears a noise from the back and alerts Brad. A masked man appears who reveals himself to be Rick ([[Jon Huertas]]). He tells Lexi that there is a ship on the coast that has medical supplies and is helping people. Lexi, Rick and Timmy leave for help and Brad hears newscasts on the radio saying that the bombs contained a hybrid viral strain that attacks the respiratory system. That same night Brad is visited by a Corporal Marshall ([[Max Kasch]]) and his men. He asks Brad several questions, such as how well his house has been sealed, who else is there/has been there, and if there had been any contact between him and anyone on the outside. Brad mentions the cell-phone which Lexi had thrown through the window and the marshall demands a sample of the dust off the phone. Marshall tells Brad that he will soon be back with the results and that his wife should under no circumstances be let into the house. As the marshall leaves we hear him recite the home's address and say &quot;Red Tag&quot;.

Lexi returns home the next day without Timmy or Rick and sees the red tag placed outside the house. Lexi tells Brad that Timmy was treated with all the other children and that she saw five men get shot. Lexi rings her brother Jason ([[Will McCormack]]) so that she can have someone to talk to about simple things to pass the time, after she could not cope with talking to her mother who is frantic with worry about her.

The next couple of hours are spent with Brad and Lexi on either side of their back door talking to each other about what they will do, assuming that they survive this crisis. Brad imagines that after this they will both probably end up on one of those morning talk shows where everyone goes to reveal their woes. Troops appear from the side of the house and grab Lexi while preventing Brad from coming outside to interfere with them. The soldier manages to calm Brad down and explains to him that because Brad did such a good job sealing up the house there was no new air to circulate through. The virus multiplied to lethal levels and the air inside the house is now lethal. Brad doesn't understand what the soldier is saying and insists that they bring his wife back. The marshall tells him &quot;Please don't struggle.&quot;

A large heavy piece of plywood is put over the back door which completely covers it. A hole is drilled through the wood and a pipe appears through which a gas starts to be pumped in. More boards seal the windows and doors but Brad manages to break down the plywood covering his front door, only to discover that a fumigation tent has been erected over the whole house. He tries to tear through the tent and is knocked unconscious by the rifle butt of a soldier as Lexi screams Brad's name. The camera cuts to Brad as he takes his last few breaths.

Lexi is sitting on the edge of an ambulance being attended to by a female nurse who says &quot;Say a prayer; you might just make it.&quot; The film closes with Lexi in too much shock to say anything, her cell phone ringing.
