'''Abercrombie House''' was built in [[Bathurst, New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in the 1870s by the Stewart family who were Bathurst pioneers. William Stewart came to Australia from England in 1825 as part of the colonisation of the penal colony (Australia). William was the Lieutenant Governor General of New South Wales; which meant he was hypothetically 2nd in command to running Australia. William was given land in Bathurst as a reward for doing his job well. William Stewart's eldest son James built Abercrombie House. The house is considered grand enough to be listed on the [[NSW]] Heritage Register. The {{convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on}} land and house is currently owned by the [[Rex Henry Morgan]] Family. Since 1969 the Morgan family has made major restorations to the house. The House is currently occupied by Richard Morgan's brother, Christopher, and his family. The [[Pittwater House Schools]] use this house as part of their country life scheme. Years 3-12 visit the house once a year for a week.
