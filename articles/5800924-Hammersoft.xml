The '''Italian elections of 1953''' were held on June 7. They were a test for leading [[centrism|centrist]] coalition ruled by [[Italian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Alcide De Gasperi]]. Italian electors chose '''the second Parliament of the Italian Republic'''.

==The Scam Law==
The election was characterized by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a [[bonus|superbonus]] of two thirds of seats in the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|House]] for the coalition which would obtain [[at-large]] the [[majority|absolute majority]] of votes. The change was hugely opposed by the opposition parties as well as the smaller DC coalition partners, which had no realistic chances of success. The new law was called ''Scam Law'' by its detractors, including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial [[landslide]] to the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]].

==Results==

The complaint campaign of the oppositions against the Scam Law reached its goal. The government coalition ([[Christian Democracy (Italy)|DC]], [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party (historical)|PSDI]], [[Italian Liberal Party|PLI]], [[Italian Republican Party|PRI]], [[South Tyrolean People's Party|SVP]], [[Sardinian Action Party|PSAZ]]) was stopped at an incredible 49.9% of national vote, resulting in the ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Minor dissident parties resulted determinant for the final result, especially the short-lived [[National Democratic Alliance (Italy)|National Democratic Alliance]]. Leading party [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] did not repeat the extraordinary result of five years before, which had been obtained under special conditions linked to the [[Cold War]], and lost a lot of votes to the [[right wing]], which included resurgent [[fascist]] politicians particularly in [[Southern Italy]].

Technically, the government won the election, reaching the [[majority]] of seats in both houses. But the frustration for the lack of the expected result caused big problems to the leading coalition. De Gasperi was forced to resign by the [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] on August 2: the [[Trentino|Trentin]] [[statesman]] consequently retired and died twelve months later. The legislature continued with weak governments, with minor parties refusing institutional responsibilities. [[Giuseppe Pella]] rose to power, but fell after five months only, following strong disputes about the status of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] which Pella was claiming. [[Amintore Fanfani]] not receiving a [[vote of confidence]], [[Mario Scelba]] and [[Antonio Segni]] followed with more traditional centrist coalitions supported by [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party (historical)|PSDI]] and [[Italian Liberal Party|PLI]]: under the administration of the first one, the problem of [[Trieste]] was closed ceding [[Koper]] to [[Yugoslavia]]. The parliamentary term was closed by the minority government chaired by [[Adone Zoli]], finishing a legislature which hugely weakened the office of the Prime Minister, held by six different rulers.
