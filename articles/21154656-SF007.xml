'''Daniel Valente Dantas''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[banker]] and financier, founder of [[Opportunity Asset Management]] in 1994.

He has appealed against his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12725169 | title = Fall of an opportunist | publisher = The Economist | date = December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dantas was arrested twice by [[ProtÃ³genes Queiroz]], police officer who investigated Daniel Dantas on ''Satiagraha Operation'', in early July 2008, but each time released almost immediately. The President of the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Court]] [[Gilmar Mendes]] gave Dantas two [[habeas corpus]] in less than two days.

Daniel Dantas was finally convicted to ten years imprisonment in December 2008 for attempting to bribe a police officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;/&gt;

National Council of Justice: Conduct of Judge De Sanctis in Satyagraha is incompatible with a judgeâs behavior and with the due process.
On June 7th, 2011 the National Council of Justice (CNJ) unanimously recognized that Judge Fausto de Sanctis, at the time the head judge of the 6th Criminal Court of SÃ£o Paulo, intentionally disobeyed the orders of the Federal Supreme Court (STF), when he ordered the detention of Daniel Dantas in Operation Satyagraha. 
The judges of the CNJ followed the vote of reporting Judge Morgana Richa, who determined that De Sanctisâs conduct is incompatible with that of a judge, and that he would only escape proper punishment through the lack of a legal provision. 

STF voids Satyagraha for irregularities.
Also on the 7th June 2011, the Higher Court of Justice (STJ) accepted the opinion of the Federal Public Prosecutorâs Office and voided the criminal action originating from Operation Satyagraha, for its irregularities. 
According to the President of the 5th Bench of the Higher Court of Justice, Jorge Mussi, âthe involvement of ABIN (Brazilian Intelligence Agency) was demonstrated in a document in which the Federal Police ordered the internal investigation of irregularities in the operationâ. 
The scheme of informal investigation set up in Satyagraha represents, for Mussi, âa model of investigation more suited to the secret police, beyond the most basic rules of the Democratic State of Lawâ. 

== Operation Satyagraha ==
In July 2008, several [[TrueCrypt]]-secured hard drives were seized from Daniel Dantas, who was suspected of financial crimes. The Brazilian National Institute of Criminology (INC) tried for five months (without success) to obtain access to TrueCrypt-protected disks owned by the banker, after which they enlisted the help of the [[FBI]]. The FBI used [[dictionary attack]]s against Dantas' disks for over 12 months, but were still unable to decrypt them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dantas&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = John | last = Leyden | title = Brazilian banker's crypto baffles FBI | url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/28/brazil_banker_crypto_lock_out/ | publisher = The Register | date = June 28, 2010 | accessdate = August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
