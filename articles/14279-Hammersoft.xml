'''Hugh Marston &quot;Hef&quot; Hefner''' (born April 9, 1926) is an American magazine publisher, founder and [[Chief Creative Officer]] of [[Playboy Enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playboyenterprises.com/home/content.cfm?content=t_officers&amp;ArtTypeID=CorpOfficers&amp;MmenuFlag=profile&amp;SmenuFlag=sub_corp_profile_officers_o Corporate Officers].

==Early life==
Hefner was born in Chicago, Illinois, the elder of two sons born to Grace Caroline (nÃ©e Swanson; 1895â1997) and Glenn Lucius Hefner (1896â1976), both teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false &quot;Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream&quot;].

He later graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[psychology]] with a double [[academic minor|minor]] in [[creative writing]] and [[art]] in 1949, earning his degree in two and a half years. Hugh was a member of Delta Chi Fraternity. After graduation, he took a semester of graduate courses in [[sociology]] at [[Northwestern University]] but dropped out soon after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playboyenterprises.com/home/content.cfm?content=t_template&amp;packet=00061D22-C172-1C7A-9B578304E50A011A&amp;MmenuFlag=profile Hugh M.

==Career==
Working as a [[copywriter]] for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', he left in January 1952, after being denied a $5 raise. In 1953, he mortgaged his furniture, generating a bank loan of $600 (or $800âhe cannot recall which) and raised $8,000 from 45 investorsâincluding $1,000 from his mother (&quot;Not because she believed in the venture,&quot; he told ''[[E!]]'' in 2006, &quot;But because she believed in her son.&quot;)âto launch ''[[Playboy]]'', which was initially going to be called ''Stag Party''. The undated first issue, published in December 1953, featured [[Marilyn Monroe]] from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/famousentrepreneurs/p/hughhefner.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (Hefner, who never met Monroe, bought the [[crypt]] next to hers at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_20110203&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/magazine/06Hefner-t.html | title = How Hef Got His Groove Back | date = February 3, 2011 | author = Charles McGrath | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seeing-stars.com/Buried2/PierceBros5.shtml Westwood Village Memorial Cemetery]. Seeing-Stars.com.&lt;/ref&gt;)

After it was rejected by ''Esquire'' magazine in 1955, Hefner agreed to publish in ''Playboy'' the [[Charles Beaumont]] science fiction short story, &quot;The Crooked Man,&quot; about straight men being persecuted in a world where homosexuality was the norm. After receiving angry letters to the magazine, Hefner wrote a response to criticism where he said, &quot;If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the reverse was wrong, too.&quot; Hefner is portrayed as a gay rights pioneer in the documentary film, ''[[Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Michelle.

On June 4, 1963, Hefner was arrested for selling obscene literature after an issue of ''Playboy'' featuring nude shots of [[Jayne Mansfield]] was released.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} A jury was unable to reach a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/articles/Hugh-Hefner-9333521?part=1 Hugh Hefner Biography]. biography.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

His former secretary, Bobbie Arnstein, was found dead in a Chicago hotel room after an overdose of drugs in January 1975. Hefner called a press conference to allege that she had been driven to suicide by narcotics agents and federal officers. Hefner further claimed the government was out to get him because of ''Playboy''{{'s}} philosophy and its advocacy of more liberal drug laws.&lt;ref name=answer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/02/entertainment/et-book2 |title=The life and times of an alpha male |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |author=David Cotner |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SunTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921023/REVIEWS/210230302/1023

In 2009, Hefner talks about making a film about his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-girls-next-door/the-girls-next-door-hef-ready-25741.aspx |title=Hef Ready for the big screen? |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |author= |publisher=BuddyTV |date=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for television and has made several movie appearances as himself. In 2010, he received a &quot;worst supporting actor&quot; nomination for a [[Razzie]] award for his performance in ''[[Miss March]]''.

A documentary by Brigitte Berman, [[Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel]] was released on July 30, 2010. He had previously granted full access to documentary filmmaker and television producer [[Kevin Burns]] for the A&amp;E Biography special, [[Hugh Hefner: American Playboy]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hughhefnerplayboyactivistrebel.com/ Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hefner and Burns later collaborated on numerous other television projects, most notably on [[The Girls Next Door]], a reality series that ran for six seasons (2005-2009) and 90 episodes.  

In 1999, Hefner financed the [[Clara Bow]]-documentary, ''Discovering the It-girl.'' &quot;Nobody has what Clara had. She defined an era and made her mark on the nation,&quot; he stated.&lt;ref&gt;Variety, June 7, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hefner married Northwestern University student Mildred Williams (born March 10, 1926) in 1949. They had two children, [[Christie Hefner|Christie]] (born November 8, 1952) and David (born August 30, 1955).&lt;ref name='PlayboyTimeline'&gt;[http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/hmh/timeline/pre50s-content.html Playboy Time Line]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the wedding, Mildred confessed that she had had an affair while he was away in the Army. He called the admission &quot;the most devastating moment of my life.&quot; A 2006 ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' profile of Hefner revealed that Mildred allowed him to sleep with other women, out of guilt for her infidelity and in the hopes that it would preserve their marriage. They divorced in 1959.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Hefner remade himself as a [[bon vivant]] and [[Promiscuity|man about town]], a lifestyle he promoted in his magazine and two TV shows he hosted, ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'' (1959â1960) and ''[[Playboy After Dark]]'' (1969â1970). He admitted to being {{&quot; '}}involved' with maybe eleven out of twelve months' worth of Playmates&quot; during some of these years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/critics/content/articles/060320crbo_books NewYorker.com], Acocella, Joan. &quot;The Girls Next Door.&quot; ''[[The New Yorker]]'', March 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Michelle]], [[Marilyn Cole]], [[Lillian MÃ¼ller]], [[Shannon Tweed]], [[Brande Roderick]], [[Barbi Benton]], [[Karen Christy]], [[Sondra Theodore]], and Carrie Leighâwho filed a $35 million [[palimony]] suit against himâwere a few of his many lovers. In 1971, he acknowledged that he experimented in [[bisexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5020806.stm | work=BBC News | title=Faces of the week | date=May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved from Chicago to Los Angeles.

Hefner had a minor stroke in 1985 at age 59. After re-evaluating his lifestyle, he made several changes. The wild, all-night parties were toned down significantly and in 1988, daughter Christie began to run the Playboy empire. The following year, he married Playmate of the Year [[Kimberley Conrad]]. The couple had two sons, Marston Glenn (born April 9, 1990) and Cooper Bradford (born September 4, 1991).&lt;ref name=TV&gt;[http://www.tv.com/cooper-hefner/person/545473/summary.html TV.com], Cooper Hefner&lt;/ref&gt; The ''E! True Hollywood Story'' profile noted that the notorious [[Playboy Mansion]] had been transformed into a family-friendly homestead. After he and Conrad separated in 1998, Conrad moved into a house next door to the mansion.

Hefner then began to move an ever-changing coterie of young women into the Mansion, even dating up to seven girls at once, among them, [[Brande Roderick]], [[Izabella St. James]], [[Tina Marie Jordan]], [[Holly Madison]], [[Bridget Marquardt]], and [[Kendra Wilkinson]]. The reality television series ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' depicted the lives of Madison, Wilkinson and Marquardt at the Playboy Mansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-girls-next-door/a-new-boy-for-former-girl-next-26275.aspx BuddyTV.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, all three girls made the choice to leave the mansion. Hefner was quick to rebound and soon began dating his new &quot;Number One&quot; girlfriend, [[Crystal Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/01/06/2009-01-06_meet_playboy_founder_hugh_hefners_other_.html NYdailyNews.com], &quot;Meet Playboy founder Hugh Hefner's other girlfriend, Crystal Harris&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; along with 20-year-old [[twin|identical twin]] and models [[Kristina and Karissa Shannon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/10/17/1224351116190.html TheAge.com], Party's over for Playboy king Hugh Hefner, ''[[The Age]]'' October 18, 2008.

==Politics and philanthropy==
The [[Hugh Hefner First Amendment Award]] was created by Christie Hefner &quot;to honor individuals who have made significant contributions in the vital effort to protect and enhance First Amendment rights for Americans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Playboy Enterprises, Inc., &quot;[http://www.playboyenterprises.com/home/content.cfm?content=t_title_as_division&amp;ArtTypeID=0008B752-BBD0-1C76-8FEA8304E50A010D&amp;packet=0001F2B3-75D2-1C7A-9B578304E50A011A&amp;MmenuFlag=foundation&amp;viewMe=1 The Playboy Foundation â Hugh M.

He has donated and raised money for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmeat.com/media_political_donations/Hugh_Hefner.php Hugh Hefner's Federal Campaign Contribution Report]. NewsMeat.com.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has more recently referred to himself as an Independent, due to disillusionment with both the Democratic and Republican Parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.com/#!/hughhefner/status/97538784245190656] Twitter.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Hefner helped organize fund-raising efforts that led to the restoration of the [[Hollywood Sign]]. He hosted a gala fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion and personally contributed $27,000 (or 1/9 of the total restoration costs) by purchasing the letter Y in a ceremonial auction.&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article7109871.ece |title=Hugh Hefner saves iconic Hollywood sign |publisher=[[Times Online]] |date=April 27, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/history-10.html |title=The History of the Sign: 1978: A Sign is Reborn |publisher=Hollywood Sign |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hefner donated $100,000 to the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinematic Arts]] to create a course called &quot;Censorship in Cinema,&quot; and $2&amp;nbsp;million to endow a chair for the study of American film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iF4fMFSrRMvJfzXniugOlAw1MvugD8SUB2PG0 AP.Google.com], Hefner Gives $2M to USC Film School [[Associated Press]], November 16, 2007.{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both through his charitable foundation and individually, Hefner also contributes to charities outside the sphere of politics and publishing, throwing fundraiser events for Much Love Animal Rescue, as well as [[Generation Rescue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://celebrityhalo.blogspot.com/2008/10/hugh-hefner-jenny-mccarthy-fund-autism.html | title = Hugh Hefner &amp; Jenny McCarthy Fund Autism Research | work = Celebrity Halo | month = October | year = 2008 | accessdate =December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]] campaign organization supported by [[Jenny McCarthy]].
