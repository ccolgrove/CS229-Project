'''Highway 24''', also known as the '''Little Fort Highway''' or the '''Interlakes Highway''', is a 97&amp;nbsp;km-long east-west connection between the [[British Columbia Highway 97|Cariboo Highway]], just south of [[100 Mile House, British Columbia|100 Mile House]], and the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Southern Yellowhead Highway]] at [[Little Fort, British Columbia|Little Fort]].  It practically provides a &quot;second-chance&quot; route to travellers heading east from [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] who believe they chose the wrong route to the northern part of the province or toward [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. Highway 24 first opened in [[1967]].

==Route description==
Highway 24 begins in the west at [[93 Mile House]], approximately 11&amp;nbsp;km (7&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[100 Mile House]].  After 9&amp;nbsp;km (6&amp;nbsp;mi), it passes through the small community of [[Lone Butte, British Columbia|Lone Butte]]. After passing several turn-offs to resort lakes including Sheridan Lake, the highway passes through the community of [[Bridge Lake, British Columbia|Bridge Lake]], 38&amp;nbsp;km (24&amp;nbsp;mi) later. The highway then proceeds another 50&amp;nbsp;km (31&amp;nbsp;mi) east through the forest and over a large hill before reaching its terminus in Little Fort.

A very scenic drive, the highway follows a historic trail used by the [[Secwepemc|Shuswap people]] as a trade route and was later developed by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in the early 19th century to bring furs from northern BC out to Fort Kamloops and the [[Columbia River]].
