[[Colin McCool]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]]. Bradmanâs men were undefeated in their 34 matches and this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''. 

A frontline [[leg spin]]ner and [[batting order (cricket)|middle-order]] batsman, McCool was not prominent in the team's success. Although McCool started his Test career strongly, his form began to decline during the previous Australian season. After starting the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, a bloodied callus on his spinning finger troubled McCool. This prevented him from bowling for prolonged periods, and along with [[Ron Hamence]], he was one of two squad members who did not play a Test on tour. Along with [[Doug Ring]], the trio called themselves &quot;ground staff&quot; because of the paucity of their on-field duties in the major matches and they often sang ironic songs about their status. 

During the tour, McCool took 57 [[first-class cricket|first-class]] wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 17.82; he was the fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. With England agreeing to have a new ball available after every 55 [[over (cricket)|overs]], more frequently than the old rule of replacing the ball after every 200 runs, [[fast bowling]] dominated over spin. As a result, McCool did not play in the Tests, but was used heavily in the tour matches so the leading pacemen could conserve their energy for the important matches. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall, he delivered the least overs because of his injured finger. McCool took five wickets in an innings three times, his best return being 7/78 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. 

Although McCool also played as a frontline batsman during his career, his performances during the tour were far below his usual standards, scoring only 306 runs at a [[batting average]] of 20.40 with three half-centuries. However, he remained prominent with his fielding, taking 20 catches in 17 matches. 

==Background ==
Following the resumption of cricket after [[World War II]], McCool had started his Test career strongly. After making his debut in a one-off Test against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1945&amp;ndash;46, he played in all five Tests against [[England cricket team|England]] during the 1946&amp;ndash;47 home season, scoring 272 runs at an average of 54.40 and taking 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;Cashman et al., p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;batting&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html| title =Test Batting and Fielding for Australia: Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Bowling.html| title =Test Bowling for Australia: Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' said his batting featured &quot;wristy cuts&quot; and &quot;vigorous hooks&quot;, adding that there were &quot;few better players of spin bowling on a difficult pitch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; ''Wisden'' judged his slow and [[flight (cricket)|loopy]] leg spin &quot;a clever mixture of [[leg break|leg-breaks]] and [[googly|googlies]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; However, when India toured Australia for the first time in 1947&amp;ndash;48, McCool played in three Tests without much success, scoring only 46 runs and taking only four wickets. As a result, he was dropped for the last Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;battingIndia&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Batting.html| title =Test Batting and Fielding for Australia: India in Australia 1947/48| publisher = [[CricketArchive]]| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bowlingIndia&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Bowling.html| title =Test Bowling for Australia: India in Australia 1947/48| publisher = [[CricketArchive]]| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early tour ==

Nevertheless, McCool gained selection as part of [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team to tour England in 1948]] under [[Donald Bradman]]. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the opening match of the tour, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=haigh/&gt; Although he was only selected sporadically during the preceding Test series against India, McCool was chosen alongside [[off spin]]ner [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and appeared to be part of Bradman's Test plans. The home side batted first and McCool took his maiden wicket on English soil, having former England captain [[Bob Wyatt]] [[stump (cricket)|stumped]] by fellow Queenslander [[Don Tallon]]. He removed Wyatt's replacement for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] without further addition to the score and ended with 2/38 as the home side were dismissed for 233. McCool returned the favour during Australia's innings. Coming in at No. 5, he made a fifth ball duck and was part of a middle-order collapse that saw Australia lose 4/38 before steadying to [[declaration and forfeiture|declare]] at 8/462. In the second innings, McCool did the bulk of the damage, taking four of the five first wickets&amp;mdash;two of whom were stumped by Tallon&amp;mdash;to leave the hosts at 5/122 before Australia completed an innings victory. McCool had been the most successful bowler in the opening match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched&gt;{{cite web|title=Matches, Australia tour of England, Apr-September 1948 |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/invincibles/engine/series/61329.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=worcs&gt;{{cite web

McCool was rested for the second tour match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], which Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; The next match against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]]&amp;mdash;on a [[sticky wicket|damp pitch]] favourable to slower bowling&amp;mdash;was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 53&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; McCool made three in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101.&lt;ref name=york/&gt; After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 5/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory when McCool arrived at the crease. To make matters worse, [[Sam Loxton]] was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced the prospect of losing to an English county for the first time since 1912.&lt;ref name=f55/&gt; McCool scored five before hitting a [[long hop]] back to left-arm spinner [[Johnny Wardle]] to leave Australia at 6/31.&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite web

After going wicketless for 31 runs in the first innings, he did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414 in reply to the hostsâ 167. In the second innings, McCool took the first four wickets&amp;mdash;including two stumpings by [[Ron Saggers]]&amp;mdash;to leave the hosts at 4/73. He returned to take three more wickets and end with 7/78 as Cambridge fell for 196 to lose by an innings and 51 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite web

The next match was against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) at [[Lord's]].

It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, with [[Len Hutton]], [[Denis Compton]] and [[Bill Edrich]]&amp;mdash;three of England's top four batsmen&amp;mdash;all playing.&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; Batting at No. 8, McCool made a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] as Australia collapsed late in their innings, losing 5/54 to be bowled out for 552. He was not required to bowl in the first innings as the three pacemen [[Ray Lindwall]], [[Ernie Toshack]] and Miller skittled England for 189. McCool was given the shortest spell of the frontline bowlers in the second innings as the fast bowlers again made early inroads. He sent down 7.2 overs, and disposed of the tail, removing the last four wickets, including MCC and England captain [[Norman Yardley]]. McCool ended with 4/35 as the MCC lost their last four wickets for 28 to be all out for 205, giving Australia a victory by an innings and 158 runs.&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; 

Four matches followed the MCC fixture before the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]].&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; McCool was rested for the first of these against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; He returned for the following match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool would not have the endurance required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match.

Between Tests, McCool was recalled for the match against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]]. He took 1/19 in the first innings before coming in at the fall of the fifth wicket and scoring an [[not out|unbeaten]] 50 as Australia declared at 8/352.

The next match was against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and started the day after the Second Test. McCool bowled only three overs in the first innings, before contributing 26 with the bat in Australia's reply. After the tourists had taken a first innings lead of 168, McCool bowled heavily as Bradman eased the workload on his Test players in the second innings. McCool removed Surrey's top three batsmen&amp;mdash;two of them stumped by Saggers&amp;mdash;to leave the hosts at 3/94.

A 100-run second wicket partnership by [[Arnold Townsend]] and [[Denis Smith (cricketer)|Denis Smith]] took Derbyshire to 1/110. McCool removed Townsend for 46 and quickly dismissed the next two batsmen to leave Derbyshire at 4/116. He returned with the score at 5/163 and took three further wickets in close succession to dismiss the hosts for 182, sealing victory by an innings. McCool ended with 6/77 from 29 overs.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He returned for the non-first-class match against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]], and came to the crease with Australia in trouble at 3/22. He top-scored with 64 to help Australia reach 282 all out. McCool took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply when rain ended the match after the first day.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;durham&quot;/&gt; After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the first four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]].&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{Cite web|title=Player Oracle IWG Johnson 1948 |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=736&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Miller&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=1948&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason=1948 |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was fellow leg spinner Ring and not McCool who was called in.

== Later tour matches ==

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Australia batted first against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and McCool made a duck in their total of 361.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite web

Forced to follow on, Kent were bowled out for 124 to lose by an innings, but not before attacking McCool and taking 42 runs from his five wicketless overs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the next match against the [[Gentlemen of England cricket team|Gentlemen of England]], McCool was rested as Australia amassed 5/610 and won by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=gents&gt;{{cite web

Promoted to fourth drop, McCool could only make six as Australia declared at 5/560. Somerset reached 2/63 in reply before McCool took four quick wickets amid their collapse to 7/68. McCool ended with 4/21 as the hosts folded for 115. Forced to follow on, Somerset reached 3/49 before McCool took four of the next five wickets as the hosts fell to 8/66, and eventually 71 all out, handing Australia victory by an innings and 374 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=somerset&gt;{{cite web

McCool toiled for 36 overs in taking 2/89 as the hosts were bowled out for 298 when rain caused the match to end in a draw.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=soe&gt;{{cite web

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to play.&lt;ref name=plg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 207&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt; After the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team,&lt;ref name=plg&gt;Perry, pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Ringâs omission for Johnson, so McCool was left out. After Australia had taken a 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. In the first match, McCool came in with Australia 4/91 and put on 109 with [[Arthur Morris]] to consolidate the innings. When McCool was out for 52 and Morris for 109, the Australians collapsed and lost 6/36 to end with 236.&lt;ref name=scot1&gt;{{cite web

In the second match, McCool took 3/31 as the hosts made 178 after batting first. He opened the innings with the bat and made 108 in three hours, with 13 fours. Australia declared at 6/407 and McCool took 0/19 in seven overs as Australia wrapped up the tour with another innings victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=scot2&gt;{{cite web

== Role ==
[[Image:Colin McCool graph 1948.png|300px|right|thumb|A chart showing McCool's batting performance during the tour.

The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate [[not out]]s.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;]] 

A frontline [[leg spin]]ner and middle-order batsman, McCool was not prominent in the team's success. Although he had started his Test career strongly, McCool's form began to decline in the previous Australian season of 1947&amp;ndash;48. In his first full Test season in 1946&amp;ndash;47, which featured five Tests against England, McCool batted at No. 6 and scored 95 and 104 [[not out]]. He also took five wickets in an innings on two occasions.&lt;ref name=az/&gt; He ended the series with 272 runs at an average of 54.40 and took 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;batting&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html| title =Test Batting and Fielding for Australia: Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47| publisher = [[CricketArchive]]| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Bowling.html| title =Test Bowling for Australia: Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47| publisher = [[CricketArchive]]| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following season he made only 46 runs and took only three wickets in three Tests against India before being dropped.&lt;ref name=az/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;battingIndia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bowlingIndia&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, McCool started the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, and was selected in the tour opener against Worcestershire and later against the MCC in his role as an all rounder.&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt;  

Bowling for long periods caused McCool to continually tear a [[callus]] on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollard&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollard|first=Jack|title=Australian cricket: The Game and the Players|year=1988 |publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson|location=Sydney|isbn=0 207 15269 1|pages=685&amp;ndash;687}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave him out of the Test matches, feeling that his finger would not be able to handle the necessarily long bowling spells.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOC&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradman|first=Donald|title=Farewell to Cricket|year=1994|publisher=Editions Tom Thompson|location=Sydney|isbn=1-875892-01-X|pages=228&amp;ndash;229.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was aided by England and Australiaâs agreement to allow a [[Cricket ball#Condition of a cricket ball|new ball]] to be used every 55 [[over (cricket)|overs]], instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to [[fast bowling|fast]] and [[swing bowling]], so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollard&quot;/&gt; 

McCool was thus one of two players along with [[Ron Hamence]] who did not play a Test during the season. Along with [[Doug Ring]], Hamence and McCool called themselves &quot;ground staff&quot; because of the paucity of their on-field duties in the major matches, and they often sang ironic songs about their status.&lt;ref name=&quot;RingObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Doug Ring | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1434027/Doug-Ring.html| work = [[The Daily Telegraph]]| date = 2003-06-25| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SomersetYearBook&quot;&gt;[[Donald Bradman]] referred to these players as the &quot;Groundbowlers&quot; in an appreciation of McCool for the 1959 testimonial year granted by Somerset.{{Cite book

McCool took 57 first-class wickets at 17.82; he was the fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; As England agreed to have a new ball available after every 55 overs, fast bowling dominated in the Tests,&lt;ref name=pollard/&gt; so McCool was used heavily in the tour matches to allow the leading pacemen to conserve their energy in preparation for the Tests. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall he bowled the least overs due to his injured finger.&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, Apr-September 1948 &amp;ndash; First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aus&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=2;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948 &amp;ndash; Australia |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCool had the worst [[economy rate]] among the regular bowlers, but he took his wickets at a faster rate; his [[strike rate]] was second only to paceman [[Ray Lindwall]].&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;  

Although McCool also played as a frontline batsman during his career, with a first-class average of 32.85 and 18 centuries,&lt;ref name=az/&gt; his batting performances during the tour were far below his usual standards, garnering only 306 runs at 20.40 with three half-centuries.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; His highest score was 76 against Gloucestershire,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; although he added two more fifties and a century against Scotland in the three non-first-class fixtures.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; During the tour, McCool usually batted from Nos. 5 to 8.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|bat|1|a}} A specialist at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|first slip]],&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; McCool remained prominent with his fielding, taking 20 catches in 17 matches.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;
