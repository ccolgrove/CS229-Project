The name ''Ironman Triathlon'' refers to both the original Ironman triathlon and the annual [[Ironman World Championship]]. Also called Ironman Hawaii, the world championships of the event, held annually in [[Hawaii]] since [[1978 in sports|1978]] (with an additional race in 1982), are now preceded by a series of qualifying events. Ironman Triathlon became known for its grueling length, harsh race conditions, and [[Broadcasting of sports events|television coverage]].

==History==
The idea for the original Ironman Triathlon arose during the awards ceremony for the 1977 [[Oahu]] Perimeter Relay (a running race for 5-person teams). Among the participants were numerous representatives of both the Mid-Pacific Road Runners and the Waikiki Swim Club, whose members had long been debating which athletes were more fit, runners or swimmers. On this occasion, [[U.S. Navy]] Commander John Collins pointed out that a recent article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine had declared that [[Eddy Merckx]], the great Belgian cyclist, had the highest recorded &quot;[[VO2 max|oxygen uptake]]&quot; of any athlete ever measured, so perhaps cyclists were more fit than anyone. CDR Collins and his wife Judy Collins had taken part in the triathlons staged in 1974 and 1975 by the San Diego Track Club in and around [[Mission Bay, California]], as well as the 1975 Optimist Sports Fiesta Triathlon in [[Coronado, California]]. A number of the other military athletes in attendance were also familiar with the San Diego races, so they understood the concept when Collins suggested that the debate should be settled through a race combining the three existing long-distance competitions already on the island: the [[Waikiki]] Roughwater Swim (2.4&amp;nbsp;mi./3.86&amp;nbsp;km), the Around-Oahu Bike Race (115&amp;nbsp;mi./185.07&amp;nbsp;km; originally a two-day event) and the [[Honolulu Marathon]] (26.219&amp;nbsp;mi./42.195&amp;nbsp;km). 

Until that point, no one present had ever done the bike race. Collins calculated that by shaving {{convert|3|mi|km}} off the course and riding counter-clockwise around the island, the bike leg could start at the finish of the Waikiki Rough Water and end at the [[Aloha Tower]], the traditional start of the Honolulu Marathon. Prior to racing, each athlete received three sheets of paper listing a few rules and a course description. Handwritten on the last page was this exhortation: &quot;''Swim 2.4 miles! Bike 112 miles! Run 26.2 miles! Brag for the rest of your life''&quot;, now a registered trademark.  

With a nod to a local runner who was notorious for his demanding workouts, Collins said, &quot;Whoever finishes first, we'll call ''him'' the Iron Man.&quot; Each of the racers had their own support crew to supply water, food and encouragement during the event.  Of the fifteen men to start off in the early morning on February 18, 1978, twelve completed the race. [[Gordon Haller]], a US Navy Communications Specialist, was the first to earn the title Ironman by completing the course with a time of 11 hours, 46 minutes, 58 seconds.  The runner-up John Dunbar, a [[US Navy SEAL]], led after the second transition and had a chance to win but ran out of water on the marathon course; his support crew resorted to giving him beer instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ironman.com/holdingcell/2003/january-2003/a-look-back-at-a-look-back-ironmans-first-10-years#ixzz1XGburp4M|title=A Look Back at a Look Back: Ironmanâs First 10 years|date=23 January 2003|accessdate=7 September 2011|publisher=World Triathlon Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1094935/index.htm|title=Ironman|date=14 May 1979|accessdate=7 September 2011|publisher=Sports Illustrated|last=McDermott|first=Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navyseals.com/ironman-competition-co-founded-navy-officer-1978|title=Ironman competition co-founded by Navy officer in 1979|date=10 October 2008|accessdate=7 September 2011|publisher=NavySeals.com|last=Newell|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no further marketing efforts, the race gathered as many as 50 athletes in 1979. The race, however, was postponed a day because of bad weather conditions. Only fifteen competitors started off the race Sunday morning. San Diego's Tom Warren won in 11 hours, 15 minutes, 56 seconds. [[Lyn Lemaire]], a championship cyclist from Boston, placed sixth overall and became the first &quot;Ironwoman&quot;. 

Collins planned on changing the race into a relay event to draw more participants, but ''Sports Illustrated's'' journalist Barry McDermott, in the area to cover a golf tournament, discovered the race and wrote a ten page account of it.  During the following year, hundreds of curious participants contacted Collins.

In 1981 organizer Valerie Silk moved the competition to the less urbanized [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i Island]] (called the Big Island) and in 1982 moved the race date from February to October; as a result of this change there were two Ironman Triathlon events in 1982.
[[Image:IMG 8473Iron.JPG|thumb|right|Start &amp; Finish of the [[Ironman World Championship]] on Ali{{okina}}i Drive in [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]] Hawaii]]

A milestone in the marketing of the legend and history of the race happened in February 1982. [[Julie Moss]], a college student competing to gather research for her exercise physiology thesis, moved toward the finish line in first place. As she neared the finish, severe fatigue and dehydration set in, and she fell, just yards away from the finish line. Although [[Kathleen McCartney (triathlete)|Kathleen McCartney]] passed her for the womenâs title, Moss nevertheless crawled to the finish line. Her performance was broadcast worldwide and created the Ironman mantra that just finishing is a victory. 

The sport of [[triathlon]] was added as an Olympic sport at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney as a shorter distance race ({{convert|1500|m|mi|adj=on}} swim, {{convert|40|km|mi|adj=on}} cycle, {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=on}} run).

There have been a number of non-WTC &quot;Ironman Distance&quot; triathlons that have been held since the mid-1990s.  The limited number of WTC-sanctioned events, and the limited number of entries available per race, have combined with a growth in the sport that has created demand for these non-trademarked events.  Many of them share the {{convert|2.4|mi|km|adj=on}}, {{convert|112|mi|km|adj=on}}, {{convert|26.2|mi|km|adj=on}} format with Ironman. Originally, many used the Ironman name.  Due to aggressive trademark protection, most of these races no longer use the word &quot;Ironman&quot;. The largest of these include the Vineman Triathlon and Silverman Triathlon. 

The original Ironman is held in conditions which are uniquely punishing for endurance racing: the Hawaii water is warm enough that helpfully buoyant [[wetsuits]] are not allowed; though the cycling hills have only moderate gradients they are normally crossed by strong and gusting winds; and the marathon leg of the race is usually extremely hot. Other races under the WTC aegis have their own difficulties, characteristic of their setting and season. Anyone completing one of these races within the time limit, so long as it is the prescribed distance, is entitled to call themselves an Ironman (the term being gender-neutral). At one time there was no cut-off time, then a 15 hour time limit. For these events the normal time limit is now 17 hours. Some iron distance races (not sanctioned by the WTC corporation, but using the same standard distances) have different cut-off times.

==Today==
[[File:Ironman Australia - Swim finish - E. Innocenti.JPG|right|thumb|Ironman Australia: swim finish]]
The Ironman format remains unchanged, and the Hawaiian Ironman is still regarded as an honored and prestigious triathlon event to win worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beyondtransition.com/site/2011/09/ironman-world-championship-kailua-kona-hawaii-triathlete%E2%80%99s-guide/|title=Ironman World Championship, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii Triathleteâs Guide|date=29 September 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011|publisher=BeyondTransition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v5f3DOa06bkC&amp;pg=PP14&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=I'm Here To Win|last=McCormack|first=Chris|coauthors=Tim Vandehey|isbn=9781455502677|date=2011|publisher=Center Street}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although thousands of athletes worldwide compete at an Ironman event each year, the vast majority aim simply to just finish the course if they are first timers, or set a personal record if they've raced this distance before. Only very talented athletes realistically compete for a spot in Hawaii, and just finishing an Ironman race is often the highlight of many triathletes' career. Athletes with disabilities now compete in the event in the physically challenged category, and are required to meet the same cutoff times as able bodied competitors. Australian John MacLean was the first physically challenged athlete to complete the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/topics/_/page/ironman-world-championship|title=Ironman World Championship|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People completing such an event within the strict event time cutoffs are agreed to be recognized as &quot;Ironmen&quot;: the plural &quot;Ironmans&quot; refers to multiples of &quot;Ironman&quot; as a short form of &quot;Ironman Triathlon.&quot; In the triathlon community an Ironman is someone who has completed a race of the appropriate distance, whether or not it falls under the aegis of WTC.

==Ironman World Championships==
{{main|Ironman World Championship}}

Over time the popularity of the sport of triathlon grew, and the annual race on the Big Island became The Ironman World Championship, with a series of qualifying races required to enter the championship. The Hawaii race consists of the [[swimming (sport)|swim]] in the bay of [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]], the [[Cycling|bike]] ride across the Hawaiian lava desert to [[Hawi, Hawaii|HÄwÄ«]] and back, and the [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] run along the coast (from [[Keauhou]] to [[Keahole Point]] and back to Kailua-Kona); finishing on Ali{{okina}}i Drive. The most recent Ironman World Championship took place on October 8, 2011.

The current Ironman Hawaii course record was set in 2011 by [[Craig Alexander (triathlete)|Craig Alexander]] (Australia), whose winning time was 8 hours 3 minutes 56 seconds.  [[Chrissie Wellington]] (Great Britain) set the women's course record in 2009 with a winning time of 8 hours 54 minutes 2 seconds.

For amateur triathletes, qualifying for the World Championship is through placement in one of the other Ironman series of races or a few selected Ironman 70.3 races. Entry into the race can also be obtained through a random allocation lottery or through the Ironmanâs charitable eBay auction.

==Ironman series==
{{For|links to previous Ironman series|Ironman World Championship}}
There are 26 Ironman Triathlon races throughout the world that enable qualification for 2012 Ironman World Championships. Professional athletes qualify for the championship through a point ranking system, where points are earned based on their final placement in Ironman and [[Ironman 70.3]] events. The top 50 male and top 30 female professionals in points qualify for the championship. Amateur athletes qualify for the championship by receiving slots allocated to each age group's top finishers in a qualifying event. The Ironman qualifying events for 2012 include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Qualify&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ironmanworldchampionship.com/qualification/|title=Ironman World Championship Qualification|accessdate=22 November 2011|publisher=World Triathlon Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ProQualify&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ironmanpromembership.com/kpr/|title=IM Qualifying|publisher=World Triathlon Corporation|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ironman 70.3 ==
{{main|Ironman 70.3}}

In 2005, WTC instituted the Ironman 70.3 race series.  This shorter course, also known as a Half Ironman, consists of a {{convert|1.2|mi|km|sing=on}} swim, {{convert|56|mi|km|sing=on}} bike ride, and {{convert|13.1|mi|km|sing=on}} run.  As with the Ironman series, it consists of a number of qualifying races at various locations worldwide, culminating in a world championship race with athletes drawn largely from top finishers in the qualifying events. The world championship is held at [[Lake Las Vegas]] in [[Henderson, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ironman.com/events/ironman70.3|title=Ironman 70.3 Series|publisher=World Triathlon Corporation|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For amateur athletes, some 70.3 events act as qualifiers for the full Ironman World Championships in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qualify&quot;/&gt; For professional triathletes, up to three 70.3 events can be used to accumulate points to be put towards their championship qualifying point rankings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProQualify&quot;/&gt;

==The Ironman trademark==
The Ironman Triathlon logo is a trademark of the [[World Triathlon Corporation]].  The WTC has also registered the trademark &quot;Ironman Triathlon&quot; for its athletic competitions, and the trademark &quot;Ironman&quot; for a line of clothing, athletic equipment, and souvenirs, and licensed the name to [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] for their line of [[Timex Ironman]] [[wristwatch]]es. The trademark also extends to the use of &quot;140.6&quot; and &quot;70.3,&quot; the respective distances for a full and half Ironman.

===Symbols===
M-Dot is the symbol that refers to the event. The symbol is taken from the Ironman logo, which is the word IRONMAN (in all caps) with a dot on top of the letter M, which is meant to look like a person.  The dot is the head of the person and the M is the body of the person. It represents the need to have a fit body and a strong willpower.

==Iron-distance triathlon==
Other organizations holding a race of equal distances may only refer to their triathlons as a &quot;[[Full Distance Triathlon]]&quot; or something similar, occasionally also involving the -man suffix, though the term 'ironman' is used to refer to such races unofficially. Races that are not officially &quot;Ironman&quot; race are also referred to as Iron distance and Half Iron distance (unofficially).

Examples of such races on the full iron distance are:
* The [http://www.challenge-family.com Challenge Family] is a series of large full and half iron-distance triathlon races. Full distance races take place during 2011 in:
**[[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]
**[[Cairns]], Australia

**[[Challenge Copenhagen]], in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark
**[[Henley-on-Thames]], United Kingdom

==Training for Iron-distance triathlon==
Training for the Ironman or Iron-distance triathlon requires preparing for long-distance competition in three events. Training can take several years of aerobic base training before a triathlete is prepared to safely compete at Iron-distance events. There are many coaching services available for full-distance triathlon training.
