Currently, '''[[Pennsylvania]]''' recognizes neither '''[[same-sex marriage]]s''', '''[[civil unions]]''', nor '''[[domestic partnerships]]''', though attempts have been put forth in the recent years to allow for such unions, as well as several measures that would block such legislation, such as amending the [[Constitution of Pennsylvania|State Constitution]] to prohibit same-sex marriage.

==Current law==
The current Pennsylvania statute defines marriage as &quot;between a man and a woman.&quot; While Pennsylvania is one of the minority of states not to have a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, bills have been introduced throughout the past, the most recent in January 2010 by Sen. John Eichelberger, with 15 other senators as co-sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senatoreichelberger.com/2010/01/eichelberger-introduces-marriage-amendment/ |title=Eichelberger Introduces Marriage Amendment |publisher=Senatoreichelberger.com |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill had been previously introduced in 2008, though subsequently stalled after lawmakers voiced concern over whether or not the proposed amendment would prohibit only same-sex marriage and civil unions; including language that possibly could be interpreted by the courts to prohibit hospital visitation rights, employer health benefits and recognition of a [[Will (law)|will]] for same-sex couples in addition, which was the case in Michigan after the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] ruled that providing such benefits to same-sex couples was unconstitutional, due to their interpretation of [[Michigan State Proposal - 04-2 (2004)|Michigan State Proposal - 04-2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumenstyk |first=Goldie |url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/4454/michigan-supreme-court-upholds-ban-on-same-sex-benefits |title=Michigan Supreme Court Upholds Ban on Same-Sex Benefits |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex marriage==

The most recent proposal to extend marriage to [[same-sex couple]]s by amending the statute was introduced in May 2009, which is currently being debated by lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09148/973329-454.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Tom | last=Barnes | title=Senator pushes bill to allow same-sex marriage | date=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 however, Republican [[Pat Toomey]] won the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010|2010 United States Senate election]] in Pennsylvania and has voted to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/PA/Pat_Toomey.htm |title=Pat Toomey on the Issues |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date=1999-05-25 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inyork.com/nation/ci_16513882 ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pennsylvania Marriage Amendment==
In Pennsylvania, a [[constitutional amendment]] requires approval by both houses of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|state legislature]] in two successive two-year sessions by means of majority vote, before going before voters in a state-wide [[Referendum#United States|referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pennsylvania Constitution|publisher=Pennsylvania General Assembly|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/VC/visitor_info/creating/constitution.htm|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
In 2006, a group of five state representatives, with [[Pennsylvania]] [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Scott W. Boyd]] as a main sponsor, introduced House Bill 2381, proposing an amendment to the [[Pennsylvania Constitution]] defining marriage as between one man and one woman.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Barnes (American journalist)|title=Pa. House passes gay marriage ban|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2006-06-07|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06158/696289-85.stm|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had 87 cosponsors and was approved June 6, 2006, with a vote of 136â61 in favor.&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt; The Senate voted on the bill 38â12 in favor on June 21, 2006. The bill was referred to the Rules Committee in the House of Representatives on June 22, 2006 where it stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2005&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=2381 |title=The Pennsylvania General Assembly |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
Senate Bill 1250, a bill similar to House Bill 2381 and with [[Pennsylvania State Senate|State Senator]] [[Mike Brubaker]] as the main sponsor was approved in 2008 by the Pennsylvania Senate Judiciary Committee. It would have banned same-sex marriage and its &quot;functional equivalent&quot;.&lt;ref name=Brubaker&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Barnes (American journalist)|title=Panel OKs constitutional ban on gay marriage|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2008-03-19|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08079/866239-85.stm|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language led to debate on whether the bill would not only ban [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil union]]s, but also prevent hospital visitation, employer health benefits and recognition of a [[will (law)|will]] for same-sex couples.&lt;ref name=Brubaker/&gt; The bill was laid on the table on May 6, 2008 because the House of Representatives in the State Government Committee would not allow Senate Bill 1250 to be considered by the committee in a timely manner. Senator Brubaker requested the bill be laid aside. The Senate agreed to the motion with a voice vote in the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2007&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1250 |title=The Pennsylvania General Assembly |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
In 2010, Senate Bill 707 was introduced by State Senator [[John Eichelberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2009&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=707 |title=The Pennsylvania General Assembly |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed amendment failed to advance in the Pennsylvania State Senate after it failed in the Judiciary Committee. All 5 Democrats voted to table the amendment and were joined by 3 Republicans. Six Republicans opposed tabling the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/RCC/PUBLIC/listVoteSummary.cfm?sYear=2009&amp;sInd=0&amp;chamber=S&amp;cteeCde=19&amp;theDate=03/16/2010&amp;rNbr=755 |title=The Pennsylvania Senate - Senate Committee Roll Call Votes |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
In 2011, House Bill 1434 was introduced by Pennsylvania State Representative [[Daryl Metcalfe]] with 36 cosponsors on May 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2011&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1434 |title=The Pennsylvania General Assembly |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred  to the Committee of State Government. The bill would amend the state constitutional stating to ban same-sex marriage and any substantial equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2011&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=1434&amp;pn=1724 |title=Regular Session 2011-2012 House Bill 1434 P.N. 1724 |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic partnerships==
While domestic partnerships are not offered statewide, the city of [[Philadelphia]] offers domestic partnership registries for City workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phila.gov/phils/Docs/Inventor/Textonly/execorders/96-02.htm |title=Domestic Partnerships |publisher=Phila.gov |date=1996-06-07 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Pittsburgh]] also provides domestic partnerships, which have no residency requirement and are limited to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/16679607/detail.html |title=Ravenstahl Signs Legislation For Domestic Partner Registry |publisher=Thepittsburghchannel.com |date=2008-06-22 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
An April 2011 survey by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-affiliated polling firm [[Public Policy Polling]] (PPP) found that a 35% plurality of Pennsylvania voters surveyed oppose any legal recognition of same-sex unions. However, 33% supported civil unions and 30% supported same-sex marriage, for a total of 63% supporting some form of legal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_PA_0420.pdf Pennsylvanians favor civil unions for gay couples]&lt;/ref&gt;
