'''South Dakota State University''' is the largest [[university]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[South Dakota]], located in [[Brookings, South Dakota|Brookings]]. A public [[land-grant university]] and [[sun grant college]], founded under the provisions of the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]], SDSU offers programs of study required by, or harmonious to, this Act. In step with this land-grant heritage and mission, SDSU has a special focus on academic programs in [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[nursing]], and [[pharmacy]], as well as the [[liberal arts]]. The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] classifies SDSU as a Research University with high research activity. The graduate program is classified as Doctoral/Science, Technology, Engineering, Math dominant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=219356&amp;start_page=institution.php&amp;clq={%22first_letter%22%3A%22S%22} Carnegie Classifications | Institution Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; SDSU is governed by the [[South Dakota Board of Regents]], which governs the state's six public universities and two special schools.

==History==
The university was founded on February 21, 1881 as '''Dakota Agriculture College'''. The first building, with funding from the territorial legislature, was built in 1883, six years before the State of South Dakota was incorporated. Numerous expansions were funded in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name was changed in 1904 to '''South Dakota State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts'''. In 1964, the name was changed to South Dakota State University, reflecting the more comprehensive education offered at the university.

In 1923, SDSU's instructional program was organized under five divisions: Agriculture, Engineering, General Science, Home Economics, and Pharmacy. In 1956, a Nursing program was established, and in 1957 a formal graduate school was formed. When the University changed its name in 1964, the colleges were renamed Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Home Economics, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School. In 1974, the College of General Registration (now the College of General Studies) was formed. In 1975, the Division of Education was created. An Honors College was formed in 1999. Two colleges and seven departments combined in 2009 to create the College of Education and Human Sciences. The current names of these colleges are; Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Education and Human Sciences, Engineering, General Studies, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Honors Colleges and the Graduate School.

Among the inventions and discoveries originating at SDSU are the [[Briggs &amp; Stratton]] engine, invented by alumnus [[Stephen Foster Briggs]], and [[cookies and cream]] [[ice cream]], which was created at the university's dairy plant. Also, [[Daktronics]], one of the world's leading manufacturers of electronic signage, was founded by two SDSU professors, and is still headquartered in Brookings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daktronics.com/Company/History/Pages/default.aspx Company History: Daktronics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
SDSU awards [[associate degree]]s, [[bachelor's degree]]s, [[master's degree]]s, and [[doctoral degree]]s. Enrollment as of fall 2010 was 12,816. The total enrollment of SDSU has increased each year for the past seven years.

==Athletics and activities==
[[File:South Dakota State University Jackrabbits.png|thumb|right|Athletics logo]]
{{Main|South Dakota State Jackrabbits}}
SDSU's athletic mascot for both the men's and women's teams is the [[Jackrabbit]],  Both the men's and women's sports teams are officially referred to as the Jackrabbits although some fans and media writers may informally call the women's teams &quot;Lady&quot; Jackrabbits or &quot;Lady&quot; Jacks. The [[homecoming]] celebration, [[Hobo Day]], is &quot;The Biggest One-Day Event in the Dakotas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.sdstate.edu/AlumniFoundation/SDSUFoundation/ProjectsandPriorities/Pride.cfm]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 375+ member SDSU Marching Band, &quot;The Pride of the Dakotas&quot;, given the special name the Millennium Band in 2000 by the [[South Dakota State Legislature]], has marched in the 1981 and 1997 Presidential Inaugural Parades in [[Washington, D.C.]]; A Capital Fourth in 2000 in Washington DC which was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]; the 2003 and 2008 [[Tournament of Roses]] Parade in [[Pasadena, California]] making them the second collegiate band in the history of the Rose Bowl to be invited to march twice when their team was not competing; and the Korean War Monument Dedication at the state's capital [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] in 2004, in the company of two other college bands and 60-some high school bands from across the state.
In 2004, SDSU began a transition to [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]], ending its long association with the [[NCAA Division II]] [[North Central Conference]]. SDSU is now a member of [[The Summit League]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]] [[Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]], the [[Western Wrestling Conference]] and [[Varsity Equestrian]]. The Jackrabbits have 21 varsity sports and numerous intramural and club teams.

The women's [[basketball]] team won the 2003 [[NCAA Women's Division II Basketball Championship|Division II Championship]]. In the spring of 2007 and 2008, the Jacks were invited to compete in postseason action in the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament|WNIT]]. This made them the only transition team (a team that is in the process of being certified for a new division) in WNIT history to do so. In 2007, they received a bye in the first round and continued on to victories over [[Illinois State Redbirds|Illinois State]] and [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]], but were beaten by the eventual tournament champions, [[University of Wyoming|Wyoming]], in the 4th round of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womensnit.com/07-Post-Bracket.jpg Post Bracket]&lt;/ref&gt; This was an exciting time at SDSU, as their home stadium, [[Frost Arena]], was filled to capacity for both games with the game versus Indiana selling out in a matter of hours.

On March 10, 2009 the Jackrabbit women's basketball won the Summit League Championship for the first time and played in their first ever NCAA Tournament. They beat Texas Christian in the first round 90-55 but lost to Baylor in the second round 60-58. That season they finished with a overall record of 32-3 and 17-1 in the Summit League. The Jacks women's basketball team is led by head coach Aaron Johnston. In 2010 the SDSU women again qualified for the NCAA tournament as a 14 seed, but lost in the first round to Oklahoma, eventual final four participant. SDSU finished with a 22-11 (14-4) record.  On March 8th, 2011, the Lady Jacks won their third consecutive Summit League Championship, advancing the NCAA tourney for a third straight year.

The [[Dakota Marker]] is the trophy awarded to the winner of the annual college football game played between the South Dakota State University (SDSU) Jackrabbits and the [[North Dakota State University]] (NDSU) Bison.  The trophy is a replica of one of many stone boundary markers that can be found along the border between the states of [[South Dakota]] and [[North Dakota]]. SDSU won the first Dakota Marker game in Brookings, SD, in 2004.  NDSU won the Dakota Marker games held in Fargo, ND in 2005 and 2006.  SDSU won the Dakota Marker in Brookings in 2007 and in 2008 in Fargo as well as at home in Brookings in 2009. In 2009 SDSU made their first ever Division 1 FCS playoff appearance, but lost to eventual Runner-up Montana 61-48 in the first round, SDSU finished with a record of 8-4 and 7-1 in the MVFC. South Dakota State football owns one Great West Conference championship in 2007.

South Dakota State recently has released a master plan for renovations in its athletic department. The Dykhouse Student Athlete Center was a starting point for renovations. The Dykhouse is located in the north endzone of Coughlin Alumni Stadium and was opened in the spring 2010 following the spring football game. Also in the master timeline is expansion of Frost Arena (Basketball), a brand new 22,500 seat horseshoe football stadium and an indoor athletics practice facility. There is no timeline as of now when the renovations will begin but speculation is in the next 4â10 years.

==Residential life==
SDSU has eight traditional residence halls and one suite style building on campus.  Hansen Hall and Waneta Complex are located on the west side of campus in what is called the Medary Area.  Brown, Mathews, and Pierson Halls along with the Spencer Hall-Abbott Hall-Thorne Hall residence complex are located  in Jackrabbit Villageâthe Grove Area near the Student Union.  Binnewies, Young and Caldwell Halls are located on the east side of campus.  Binnewies, Caldwell and Young Hall make up the Larson Complex.

All of the residence halls with the exception of Caldwell are co-ed by wing, with each wing having its own bathroom.  Caldwell Hall is suite style, meaning two rooms share a common bathroom for the four occupants. 

Certain halls have a Living/Learning Community, where an entire floor is composed of a certain group of students.  Some examples on campus include Substance Free, Agriculture and Biology Majors, Honors College, Engineering House, and Health Professionals House.

Furniture in the halls except the Annex is fully moveable, and capable of being lofted on its own, so students do not need to purchase or bring their own loft. Residents may also contract phone and cable services with the appropriate companies. Washers and dryers are available in all the halls and operate with either cash or by using campus Hobo Dough.

80 one-bedroom apartments and eight two-bedroom apartments are also available for rent for married students in State Court and State Village.  Four-bedroom apartments for single students are available in Berg and Bailey Halls on the Medary side of campus.

==Presidents==
On January 1, 2007, [[David Chicoine]] became the 19th President of South Dakota State University.  Chicoine and his wife are alumni of SDSU, and prior to becoming president he was Vice President for Economic Development and Technology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].
