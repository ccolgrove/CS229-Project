&quot;'''Thereâs No One As Irish As Barack O'Bama'''&quot; is a humorous folk song written in 2008 by the Irish band Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/USElection/article/530779 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=5 November 2008 |title=Obama's Kenyan kin rejoice in race that riveted world |last=Moore |first=Matt|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later known as The Corrigan Brothers), and set to a tune derived from a traditional air. The song celebrates the Irish ancestry of the [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]].

The song, which received huge publicity in America and was described as a &quot;web hit&quot; by the [[BBC]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=leader/&gt; became popular after being released on YouTube,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; and as of 6 November 2008 it had over 50,000 hits, (80,000 by 10 November, 300,000 by 15 November, whilst Black's version had 700,000) and the band reported that they had been invited to perform in the anticipated victory celebrations for Obama, and at the [[Irish-American]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] inauguration party in Washington in January 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nenagh&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/news/obama-support-night-in-moneygall-1525479.html | title = Obama support night in Moneygall | date = 6 November 2008 | publisher = [[The Nenagh Guardian]] | accessdate = 2008-11-10 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts==
Ger Corrigan alleged that Shay Black, brother of Irish musician [[Mary Black]], &quot;hijacked&quot; the song and claimed a co-writing credit while failing to acknowledge Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys' authorship of the original version, a charge Black denied.&lt;ref name=leader/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/row-over-obama-song-1514648.html |work=[[Irish Independent]] |first=Barry |last=Duggan |date=31 October 2008 |title=Row over O'Bama song| accessdate = 2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;voice&quot;/&gt;
{{bquote|It is very simple, he sent me an email in June asking if he could add some verses for a band camp he was holding â¦ It was then posted on YouTube as if it had been written entirely by him - a claim repeated on his own website and by bloggers and national media. He never gave us any credit.... We demanded he take it down but he refused. This is a complete hijacking; if I add two verses to &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot; it doesn't mean I wrote it. To say we are not impressed is an understatement - this is pure opportunism. |||Band member Ger Corrigan in reference to Shay Black, as reported by the ''[[Limerick Leader]]''.&lt;ref name=leader/&gt;}}
Both sides sought legal advice; the band contacted YouTube's solicitors as well as a copyright solicitor before announcing in a press release that the dispute had been resolved.&lt;ref name=leader/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release |work=hardydrew.com |url=http://www.hardydrew.com/?Press_Release| accessdate = 2008-11-10 |author=Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Fintan O'Toole]] criticized the song in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' for &quot;its ignorance of cultural history&quot;, claiming that it was inappropriate given [[Irish American]]s' history of racism against [[African American]]s, and that emphasizing Obama's Irish heritage would be &quot;muscling in on his parade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Ger Corrigan later reported that the Corrigan Brothers had signed a deal with Universal for two singles and one album, with an option on a second album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/Brothers-hit-big-time-thanks.4739866.jp|title= Brothers hit big time, thanks to O'Bama|last=Owens|first=Alan|date=29 November 2008 |work=Limerick Leader|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Irish Obama' band hits big time |journal=[[BBC]] |year=2008 |issue=21 December |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7794385.stm |accessdate=2008-12-21 | date=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the Corrigan Brothers released a new version of their song for radio play to celebrate Barack Obama's visit to Ireland the following May. Enitled ''Welcome Home President Barack O'Bama'', the song focussed on Obama's visit to his ancestral home in Moneygall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/musical-brothers-back-on-the-barack-bandwagon-2597020.html|last=Ni Bhraonain|first=Eimear|title=Musical brothers back on the Barack bandwagon|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
