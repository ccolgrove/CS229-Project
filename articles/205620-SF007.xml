'''Squid''' is a [[proxy server]] and [[web cache]] [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]. It has a wide variety of uses, from speeding up a [[web server]] by caching repeated requests; to caching [[World Wide Web|web]], [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and other [[computer network]] lookups for a group of people sharing network resources; to aiding security by filtering traffic. Although primarily used for [[HTTP]] and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], Squid includes limited support for several other [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] including [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]], [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]], [[Internet Gopher]] and [[HTTPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Squid FAQ: About Squid |url = http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/AboutSquid |accessdate = 2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squid was originally designed to run on [[Unix-like]] systems, but also runs well on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based systems. Released under the [[GNU General Public License]], Squid is [[free software]].

It is used by [[Wikimedia Foundation]] on [[Wikipedia]].

==History==
Squid was originally developed by Duane Wessels as the ''Harvest object cache'', part of the [[Harvest project]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.squid-cache.org/Intro/ Squid intro], on the Squid website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/199504.mbox/%3CPine.BSD.3.91.950404163551.11902J-100000@get.wired.com%3E ''Harvest cache now available as an &quot;httpd accelerator&quot;''], by Mike Schwartz on the http-wg mailing list, Tue, 4 April 1995, as forwarded by [[Brian Behlendorf]] to the [[Apache HTTP Server]] developers' mailing list&lt;/ref&gt; Further work on the program was completed at the [[University of California, San Diego]] and funded via two grants from the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Squid Sponsors |url = http://www.squid-cache.org/SPONSORS.txt |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014113215/http://squid-cache.org/SPONSORS.txt |archivedate = 2007-10-14 |accessdate = 2007-02-13 | quote = The NSF was the primary funding source for Squid development from 1996-2000. Two grants (#NCR-9616602, #NCR-9521745) received through the Advanced Networking Infrastructure and Research (ANIR) Division were administered by the University of California San Diego }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duane Wessels forked the &quot;last pre-commercial version of Harvest&quot; and renamed it to Squid to avoid confusion with the commercial fork called Cached 2.0, which became [[NetCache]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auug-keynote&quot;&gt;Duane Wessels [http://www.life-gone-hazy.com/writings/auug-keynote.ps.gz Squid and ICP: Past, Present, and Future], Proceedings of the Australian Unix Users Group. September 1997, Brisbane, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19961112032719/http://www.netcache.com/ netcache.com], [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Squid version 1.0.0 was released in July 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;auug-keynote&quot;/&gt;

Squid is now developed almost exclusively through volunteer efforts.

Web proxy Caching is a way to store requested Internet objects (e.g. data like web pages) available via the HTTP, FTP, and Gopher protocols on a system closer to the requesting site. [[Web browser]]s can then use the local Squid cache as a [[Proxy server|proxy]] HTTP server, reducing access time as well as [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] consumption. This is often useful for [[Internet service provider]]s to increase speed to their customers, and [[local area network|LANs]] that share an [[Internet]] connection. Because it is also a proxy (i.e. it behaves like a client on behalf of the real client), it can provide some [[internet privacy|anonymity]] and [[security]]. However, it also can introduce significant privacy concerns as it can log a lot of data including [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] requested, the exact date and time, the name and version of the requester's web browser and operating system, and the [[HTTP referrer|referrer]].

A client program (e.g. browser) either has to specify explicitly the proxy server it wants to use (typical for ISP customers), or it could be using a proxy without any extra configuration: âtransparent cachingâ, in which case all outgoing HTTP requests are intercepted by Squid and all responses are cached. The latter is typically a corporate set-up (all clients are on the same LAN) and often introduces the privacy concerns mentioned above.

Squid has some features that can help [[Anonymity|anonymize]] connections, such as disabling or changing specific header fields in a [[client (computing)|client's]] HTTP requests. Whether these are set, and what they are set to do, is up to the person who controls the computer running Squid. People requesting pages through a network which transparently uses Squid may not know whether this information is being logged.&lt;ref&gt;See the documentation for &lt;tt&gt;header_access&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;header_replace&lt;/tt&gt; for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; Within UK organisations at least, users should be informed if computers or internet connections are being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.yourprivacy.co.uk/computer-monitoring-workplace-your-privacy.html Computer Monitoring In The Workplace and Your Privacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse proxy==
The above setupâcaching the contents of an unlimited number of [[webserver]]s for a limited number of clientsâis the classical one. Another setup is â[[reverse proxy]]â or âwebserver accelerationâ (using &lt;tt&gt;http_port 80 accel vhost&lt;/tt&gt;). In this mode, the cache serves an unlimited number of clients for a limited number ofâor just oneâweb servers.

As an example, if ''slow.example.com'' is a ârealâ web server, and ''www.example.com'' is the Squid cache server that âacceleratesâ it, the first time any page is requested from ''www.example.com'', the cache server would get the actual page from ''slow.example.com'', but later requests would get the stored copy directly from the accelerator (for a configurable period, after which the stored copy would be discarded). The end result, without any action by the clients, is less traffic to the source server, meaning less CPU and memory usage, and less need for bandwidth. This does, however, mean that the source server cannot accurately report on its traffic numbers without additional configuration, as all requests would seem to have come from the reverse proxy. A way to adapt the reporting on the source server is to use the [[X-Forwarded-For]] HTTP header reported by the reverse proxy, to get the real client's IP address.

It is possible for a single Squid server to serve both as a normal and a reverse proxy simultaneously.  For example, a business might host its own website on a web server, with a Squid server acting as a reverse proxy between clients (customers accessing the website from outside the business) and the web server.  The same Squid server could act as a classical web cache, caching HTTP requests from clients within the business (i.e. employees accessing the internet from their workstations), so accelerating web access and reducing bandwidth demands.

==Media-range limitations==
This feature is used extensively by video streaming websites such as [[YouTube]], so that if a user clicks to the middle of the video progress bar, the server can begin to send data from the middle of the file, rather than sending the entire file from the beginning and the user waiting for the preceding data to finish loading.

Partial downloads are also extensively used by Microsoft [[Windows Update]] so that extremely large update packages can download in the background and pause halfway through the download, if the user turns off their computer or disconnects from the Internet. 

The [[Metalink]] download format enables clients to do [[segmented downloading|segmented downloads]] by issuing partial requests and spreading these over a number of mirrors. 

Squid can relay partial requests to the origin web server. In order for a partial request to be satisfied at a fast speed from cache, Squid requires a full copy of the same object to already exist in its storage.

If a proxy video user is watching a video stream and browses to a different page before the video completely downloads, Squid can not keep the partial download for reuse and simply discards the data. Special configuration is required to force such downloads to continue and be cached.

==Supported platforms==
Squid can run on the following [[operating system]]s:

* [[AIX operating system|AIX]]
* [[BSD/OS|BSDI]]
* [[Digital Unix]]
* [[FreeBSD]]
* [[HP-UX]]
* [[IRIX]]
* [[Linux]]
* [[Mac OS X]]
* [[NetBSD]]
* [[NeXTStep]]
* [[OpenBSD]]
* [[OS/2]] and [[eComStation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;SquidWarp&quot;&gt;[http://os2ports.smedley.info/index.php?page=squid OS/2 Ports by Paul Smedley], OS/2 Ports&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[SCO OpenServer]]
* [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]
* [[UnixWare]]
* [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]

==Performance==
The Squid web site claims that if working in front of the server application, it can improve performance by up to four times. Squid is especially efficient in case of (probably unexpected) high traffic to one or several particular pages, as in this case near 100% of caching can be achieved.

==Recent development==
By 2006 work was under way to include [[Internet Content Adaptation Protocol|ICAP]] support&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/ICAP&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, work got seriously under way to complete and include [[IPv6]] support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/SQUID_3_1_0_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of version 3.1, this work is complete.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/IPv6&lt;/ref&gt;
