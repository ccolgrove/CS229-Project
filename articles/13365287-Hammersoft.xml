'''Water''' is a song by English rock band [[The Who]] originally appearing as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to &quot;5.15&quot; in 1973, and again to the single &quot;[[Love, Reign o'er Me]].&quot;

==Lifehouse==
===Background===
After the success of [[Tommy (album)|Tommy]] in 1969, Pete Townshend began work on ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]''. For the first recordings, Pete produced several demos at his ''Eel Pie Studios'' which were related to &quot;Lifehouse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Next'' 1995 Reissue Liner Notes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning===
It was during these sessions that &quot;Water&quot; was first recorded in the Spring of 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewho.com/index.php?module=discography&amp;discography_item_id=67&amp;discography_tag=albums&lt;/ref&gt; The plot in ''Lifehouse'' revolved around a totalitarian society without rock music. In this society, there is also rampant pollution which becomes a '''teenage wasteland'''. '''Water''' talks of the toughness of everyday life and how:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;They need water,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And maybe somebody's daughter.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
