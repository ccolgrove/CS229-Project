'''Slamboree''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event from [[World Championship Wrestling]] held from 1993 through 2000. It was held in the month of May. It was originally billed as &quot;The Legends' Reunion&quot; because many retired legends from [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] attended the PPV and other events scheduled for that weekend. The first three Slamborees saw inductions into the [[WCW Hall of Fame]] during the PPV. They also included matches with the legends participating.
