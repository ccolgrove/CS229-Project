==History==
===Founding: 1943 to 1969===
The story of Florida International University's founding began in 1943, when state Senator [[Ernest R. Graham (politician)|Ernest 'Cap' Graham]] (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator [[Bob Graham]]) presented the state legislature with the initial proposal for the establishment of a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/brief_history2|title=History from 1943 to 1979|accessdate=2007-11-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Senate Bill 711 was introduced by Florida Senator Robert M. Haverfield. It instructed the state Board of Education and the [[Board of Regents]] (BOR), to begin planning for the development of a state university in Miami. The bill was signed into law by then-governor [[W. Haydon Burns]] in June 1965, marking FIU's official founding.

FIU's founding president [[Chuck Perry|Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Perry]] was appointed by the Board of Regents in July 1969 after a nationwide search. At 32 years old, the new president was the youngest in the history of the State University System and, at the time, the youngest [[university president]] in the country. Perry recruited three co-founders, Butler Waugh, Donald McDowell and Nick Sileo. [[Alvah Chapman, Jr.]], former ''[[Miami Herald]]'' publisher and [[Knight Ridder]] chairman, used his civic standing and media power to assist the effort. In the 1980s, Chapman became chair of the FIU Foundation Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt;

The founders located the campus on the site of the original [[Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport|Tamiami Airport]] on the [[Tamiami Trail]] ([[U.S. Route 41]]) between Southwest 107th and 117th Avenues, just east of where the West Dade Expressway (now the [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]]) was being planned.  The abandoned airportâs air traffic control tower became FIUâs first building. It originally had no telephones, no drinking water, and no furniture. Perry decided that the tower should never be destroyed, and it remains on campus, where it is now known variously as the &quot;Ivory Tower,&quot; the &quot;Tower Building,&quot; or the &quot;Public Safety Tower,&quot; and is the former location of the FIU Police Department.

===Opening of the doors: 1969 to 1975===
[[Image:FIU plaza.JPG|225px|thumb|left|The Graham Center, FIU's student union. Over 3.5 million people walk through the Graham Center every year, making it the heart of student life at FIU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://guc.fiu.edu/index.cfm?Type=About&amp;subType=home&amp;Page=AtaGlance|title=Graham Center information|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In September 1972, 5,667 students entered the new state university, the largest opening day enrollment at the time. Previously, Miami had been the largest city in the country lacking a public baccalaureate-granting institution. Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now [[Miami-Dade College]]). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the [[University of Miami]] and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be 9 years before lower-division classes were added.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt;

The first commencement, held in June 1973, took place in the reading room of the ground floor of Primera Casa - the only place large enough on campus for the ceremony. More than 1,500 family members and friends watched FIU's first class of 191 graduates receive their diplomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt;

By late 1975, after seven years at the helm, [[Chuck Perry|Charles Perry]] felt he had accomplished his goal and left the University to become president and publisher of the Sunday newspaper magazine ''Family Weekly'' (now ''[[USA Weekend]]''), one of the country's largest magazines. When he left, there were more than 10,000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt;

===Crosby and Wolfe: 1976 to 1986===
[[File:FIU ChemistryPhysics.JPG|thumb|225px|right|FIU is the [[List of largest United States university campuses by enrollment|15th-largest university in the United States]], and the largest in South Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;qf&quot;/&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}]]
[[Harold Crosby]], the University's second president and the founding president of the [[University of West Florida]] in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], agreed in 1976 to serve a three-year &quot;interim&quot; term. Under his leadership, FIU's North Miami Campus (which was officially renamed the Bay Vista Campus in 1980, the North Miami Campus in 1987, the North Campus in 1994, and the [[Biscayne Bay Campus]] in 2000) - located on the former Interama site on [[Biscayne Bay]] - was opened in 1977. State Senator Jack Gordon was instrumental in securing funding for the development of the campus. President Crosby emphasized the university's international character, prompting the launching of new programs with an international focus and the recruitment of faculty from the Caribbean and Latin America. President Crosby's resignation in January 1979 triggered the search for a &quot;permanent&quot; president.&lt;ref name=&quot;history3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/brief_history3.htm|title=History from 1979 to 1986|accessdate=2007-11-09|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070906223202/http%3A//www.fiu.edu/docs/brief_history3.htm |archivedate = September 6, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Baker Wolfe]], a former United States diplomat and then-president of [[Portland State University]] became FIU's third president, from 1979 to 1986. After stepping down as president, Wolfe taught in the university's [[International Relations]] department. The [[student activity center|student union]] on the Biscayne Bay Campus is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;history3&quot;/&gt;

===Maidique: 1986 to 2009===
Cuban born [[Modesto A. Maidique]] assumed the presidency at FIU in 1986, becoming the fourth in the university's history. Maidique graduated with a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), before joining the private sector. He held academic appointments from MIT, Harvard and Stanford Universities, and has been named to several US Presidential boards and committees.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US1273287&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on University Park CDP, Florida].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his leadership, FIU heralded in an era of unprecedented growth and prestige with all facets of university undergoing major transformations. Physically, the university tripled in size and its enrollment grew to nearly 40,000. During his 23 years as president, the school established the [[Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine]], the [[Florida International University College of Law|FIU College of Law]], the [[Florida International University School of Architecture|FIU School of Architecture]] and the Robert Stempel School of Public Health. Also during his tenure, endowment grew from less than $2 million to over $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://president.fiu.edu/about/past].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

During Maidiqueâs tenure, the university added 22 new doctoral programs. Research expenditures grew from about $6 million to nearly $110 million as defined by the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.fiu.edu/2008/11/fiu-president-modesto-maidique-stepping-down/].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, FIU attained the highest ranking in the Carnegie Foundation classification system, that of âDoctoral/Research University-Extensive.â&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/institution.php].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; FIUâs faculty has engaged in research and holds far-reaching expertise in reducing morbidity and mortality from cancer, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, diabetes and other diseases, and change the approaches to the delivery of health care by medical, public health, nursing and other healthcare professionals, hurricane mitigation, climate change, nano-technologies, forensic sciences, and the development of biomedical devices.

The arts also flourished while Maidique was at the helm, with the university acquiring The [[Wolfsonian-FIU|Wolfsonian-FIU Museum]] on Miami Beach and building the Patricia and Phillip [[Frost Art Museum]] on its main campus. In athletics, FIU made inroads in becoming a powerhouse athletic university during Maidique's time as president and he championed the eventual establishment of a NCAA football program. Finally, the school earned membership into Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest honor society.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=8].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Maidique was the second longest-serving research university president in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.fiu.edu/2008/11/fiu-president-modesto-maidique-stepping-down/].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Now President Emeritus, he currently serves as the Alvah H. Chapman, Jr., Eminent Scholar Chair in Leadership and Executive Director of the Center for Leadership and  Professor of Management at FIU.

On November 14, 2008, Maidique announced that he would be stepping down and asked FIU's Board of Trustees to begin the search of a new president. He said he would remain president until a new one was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fiusm.com/articles/slug-president-maidique|title=President Maidique resigns|accessdate=2008-11-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 25, 2009, [[Mark B.

[[File:FIUgreen.JPG|right|thumb|225px|View of the campus towards the College of Nursing and Health Sciences Building.]]
The main campus, University Park, renamed Modesto Maidique Campus in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fiu.edu/2009/06/fiuâs-university-park-renamed-modesto-a-maidique-campus/|title=FIUâs University Park renamed Maidique Campus}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompasses 344&amp;nbsp;acres (1.4&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) in the Miami neighborhood of [[University Park, Florida|University Park]], (from which the area derives its name).

University Park houses almost all of the university's colleges and schools as well as all the administrative offices and main university facilities. University Park is also home to the Ronald Reagan Presidential House, the home of FIU's president, the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, the [[Frost Art Museum]], the International Hurricane Research Center, and the university's athletic facilities such as [[FIU Stadium]], [[U.S. Century Bank Arena]], and the [[University Park Stadium]].

Located five blocks north of University Park, is the 38-acre (145,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Engineering Center]] which houses a part of the [[Florida International University College of Engineering and Computing|College of Engineering and Computing]] and is the home of FIU's [[Motorola]] [[Nanotechnology|Nanofabrication]] Research Facility. The Engineering Center is serviced by the CATS Shuttle, FIU's student buses, which run throughout the day on weekdays connecting the two parts of campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cec.fiu.edu/CEC_About.htm|title=FIU Engineering Center|accessdate=2007-11-10|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071213055332/http%3A//www.cec.fiu.edu/CEC_About.htm |archivedate = December 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====University Park history====
Construction on the campus began in 1965 with the complete destruction of [[Tamiami Airport]] in 1969. At the time, very little was located around FIU, and the campus was referred to as University Park. As Miami grew west, the area came to be known as University Park after the university's campus name.

Until the early-1990s, aerial pictures of the campus clearly revealed the features of the airport that used to occupy the land until 1969. [[Construction]] has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/fiuvideos/other1.html|title=History of FIU video|accessdate=2007-11-10|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071017121815/http%3A//www.fiu.edu/docs/fiuvideos/other1.html |archivedate = October 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; University Park is a lush, heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes and nature preserves, as well as an arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fiusm.com/articles/slug-stadium|title=FIU Stadium construction information|accessdate=2008-09-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2009, FIU's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to rename the University Park campus to the Modesto Maidique Campus. However, the change created a large backlash from the FIU community, as many felt it unfitting to name the campus after him. A campaign by FIU students and alumni was created to revert the name change, and to keep the name University Park. A [[Facebook]] group, &quot;No to Maidique's Campus&quot; with over 2,000 supporters has made national news, in many newspapers, TV news stations, and collegiate magazines, supporting to keep the name &quot;University Park&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://fiusm.com/news/2009/6/20/students-rally-online-against-renaming-of-campus&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, plans are underway for two new residence halls for 1,240 students, called &quot;Parkview Housing&quot; to be built on the Panther Hall parking lot, north of [[FIU Stadium]]. Parkview Housing will be built in two phases in two separate buildings, each housing 620 and 600 students respectively, to be completed by Fall 2013 and Fall 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://facilities.fiu.edu/projects/BT_889/BT-889%20Parkview%20Housing%20AE%20Project%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries===
[[File:FIU Green Library.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Green Library, is one of the largest libraries in the Southeastern U.S. and is the largest building on-campus.]]
FIU has six libraries, Green Library, FIU's main library; the Glenn Hubert Library (Biscayne Bay Campus), the Wolfsonian Library, the Engineering Library, the Law Library, and the Medical Library.

====Green Library====
Green Library is FIU's main library, and is the largest building on-campus, and one of the largest libraries in the Southeastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fiu.edu/files/news/21stcentury.html|title=FIU Library -- Library for the 21st Century|accessdate=2008-12-19}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the late 1960s, the Green Library was expanded by the architecture firm M. C. Harry &amp; Associates, Inc. in the early 1990s to its current eight floors, with a capacity to expand to a total of 15 floors if expansions are necessary. This eight floor structure was built around the original three-story 1960s library, while it was still in use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcharry.com/html/3-fiu-lib.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The first floor of the building has numerous offices, classrooms, auditorium spaces, a snack stop, and a [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campusdish.com/en-US/CSS/FloridaInternationalUniv/Locations/MMC-GreenLibrary.htm|title=CampusDish at Florida International University-Green Library|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second floor has the reference section, cartography, circulation, and numerous computer and printing labs. The third and fourth floors are the home of the Medical Library, as well as a resource center for students of the Honors College, special collections section, archives, and study lounges. The fifth floor is the home of the School of Architecture Library, as well as the music and audiovisual sections. The sixth, seventh, and eighth floors are strictly quiet floors, and contain the general collection floors, numerous student study lounges, and library administration offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.fiu.edu/AboutUs/FloorPlans/tabid/180/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://medicine.fiu.edu/library.php&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law and Engineering libraries====
Other libraries at University Park include the three-story [[Florida International University College of Law|College of Law]] Library in Diaz-Balart Hall, the Engineering Library, and the Medical Library. The Law Library opened in 2002, and has three floors, with all three holding the library's general collection. The third floor has a two-story, quiet reading room, as well as numerous study lounges. Although the Law Library is restricted to Law students, other students may use the library for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.lawnet.fiu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=644&lt;/ref&gt; The Engineering Library is located on the second  floor of the main building of the Engineering Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.fiu.edu/AboutUs/DepartmentsServices/EngineeringLibraryServices/tabid/292/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical Library====
[http://medlib.fiu.edu The FIU Medical Library] opened in August 2009 at the same time as the opening of the [[FIU Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine|Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine]]. The Medical Library offers a rich array of resources, services, and instructional support to advance the teaching and learning, discovery, and healthcare programs of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and is currently located on the third floor of Green Library building. Future construction of buildings for the College of Medicine will include a new space for the Medical Library outside of Green Library.&lt;ref&gt;http://medlib.fiu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wolfsonian and Glenn Hubert libraries====
The Wolfsonian Library is located at the [[Wolfsonian-FIU Museum]] in [[South Beach]], on the corner of [[Washington Avenue (Miami Beach)|Washington Avenue]] and 10th Street.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsonian.org/collections/c9/main.html&lt;/ref&gt; The collection focuses exclusively on [[architecture]], [[art]], [[design]], and [[history]] of the [[Western World]] from 1885 to 1945. The library serves mostly as a [[research library]] with an extensive collection of [[primary sources]]. For students, prior approval from the staff is needed to enter the library. The Glenn Hubert Library, previously named the 'Biscayne Bay Library', is the main, and sole library at the [[Biscayne Bay Campus]].

Together, the entire FIU university-wide Library holdings include over 2,097,207 volumes, 52,511 current serials, 3,587,663 microform units, and 163,715 audio visual units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fiu.edu/files/about/annual%20report%20accountability%20report%2005%20-%2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=FIU Libraries|accessdate=2007-11-09|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071129064451/http%3A//library.fiu.edu/files/about/annual%2520report%2520accountability%2520report%252005%2520-%252006.pdf |archivedate = November 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Hurricane Research Center===
[[File:FIU Everglades.JPG|right|thumb|225px|Everglades Hall, upperclassmen apartments.]]
The International Hurricane Research Center (IHRC) is the nationâs only university-based research facility dedicated to mitigating the damage tropical storms inflict on people, the economy, and the environment. The IHRC is home to four institutes: the Laboratory for Coastal Research; the Laboratory for Social Science Research; the Laboratory for Insurance, Financial &amp; Economic Research; and the Laboratory for Wind Engineering Research, as well as the FIU Wall of Wind. This first-of-its-kind testing system consists of a series of large industrial fans powered by race car engines. It produces a wind field equivalent to a Category Four [[hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fiu.edu/releases/2007/05-30_damageresearch.htm|title=International Hurricane Research Center|accessdate=2007-06-01|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070602141001/http%3A//news.fiu.edu/releases/2007/05-30_damageresearch.htm |archivedate = June 2, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with the [[National Hurricane Center]] (also located at University Park), the IHRC is located on the western side of the campus.

===Construction and expansion===
In the early 2000s, emphasis at FIU was placed on growth in degree programs and student enrollment. Since 2005 however, student enrollment has been capped and emphasis is now being placed on improving the quality of the existing academic programs. With the addition of the [[Florida International University College of Medicine|College of Medicine]], the demand for facilities and classroom space has greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facilities.fiu.edu/Planning/SelectionProcess.htm|title=Florida International University Facilities Management|accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future projects and/or buildings under construction include:

FIU also holds many Golden Panther spirit events throughout the year. Some of these include, Panther Camp held in the Summer prior to the Fall term for incoming freshmen, where students spend a weekend in a [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] center learning all the traditional Golden Panther cheers, chants, traditions meeting other incoming students. Started in 2006, Panther Camp has grown quickly in popularity from only 25 participants in 2006 to over 120 participants in 2007. In 2008, Panther Camp expanded to two camps with a combined total of 240 freshman participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fiu.edu/fiumag/Winter_07/news_03.htm|title=Panther Camp|accessdate=2008-09-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panther Camp is expected to grow in size for Summer 2010, as the waiting list has continued to double from year to year. Freshmen who participate are more likely to get involved in Student Life than other students.&lt;ref&gt;http://fiusm.com/news/2009/8/28/-88&lt;/ref&gt;

Week of Welcome, usually held the first or second week of the Fall semester holds many spirit events, such as Trail of the Torch.

Rage Week and [[Homecoming]] Week are other major back-to-back spirit weeks held in the Fall semester. They include the Homecoming Parade, Greek Row parties, Homecoming football game, Blue/Gold Party, pep rallies and other Panther Rage events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.beaconnewspaper.com/media/storage/paper540/news/2006/08/28/News/Welcome.Week.Starts.New.Year-2240354.shtml|title=Week of Welcome|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Superstitions and legends====
There are many other traditions at FIU that are not spirit-related. The large cube in front of DeuxiÃ¨me Maison is said to give good luck in exams and tests and thus is spun by hundreds of students every semester. During [[final exams]], a line forms around the cube with people waiting to be able to spin the cube for good luck on their exams. The &quot;Kissing Bridge&quot; tradition in Turtle Pond in between the Ryder Business Building and Green Library. The tradition is that if you kiss someone on the bridge you will stay with them forever. The top floor of Green Library is said to be haunted; students have reported a friendly ghost that wanders the halls minutes before the library closes at night.&lt;ref&gt;http://fiualumni.com/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=301&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[superstition]] is that if a student steps on the seal engraved in front of the Graham Center and in the WUC at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the university's student union, it is said that they will delay their graduation for many years, or never graduate at all, and thus even on crowded days, students go around the seal to avoid stepping on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fiualumni.com/traditions.htm|title=FIU traditions|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-11-10|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013173249/http%3A//fiualumni.com/traditions.htm |archivedate = October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}} (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;
