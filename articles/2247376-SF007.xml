'''Django''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|dÊ|Ã¦|Å|É¡|oÊ}} {{respell|JANG|goh}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/#what-does-django-mean-and-how-do-you-pronounce-it What does âDjangoâ mean, and how do you pronounce it?]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[open source]] [[web application framework]], written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], which follows the [[Modelâviewâcontroller|model-view-controller]] [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural pattern]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names Django FAQ about MVC in Django]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed to manage several news-oriented sites for [[Lawrence Journal-World|The World Company]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ljworld.com/about LJWorld.com / About us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Lawrence, Kansas]], and was released publicly under a [[BSD license]] in July 2005; the framework was named after guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/faq/ |title=Django FAQ |accessdate=2008-04-01 |publisher=Lawrence Journal-World }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008 it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation will take care of Django in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2008/jun/17/foundation/ Announcing the Django Software Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability and &quot;pluggability&quot; of components, rapid development, and the principle of [[Don't repeat yourself|DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)]]. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models.

Django also provides an optional administrative [[Create, read, update and delete|CRUD (create, read, update and delete)]] interface that is generated dynamically through [[Introspection (computer science)|introspection]] and configured via admin models.

==Components==
[[File:Django useradmin.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Django admin interface for modifying a user.]]
The core Django [[Model-view-controller|'''MVC''']] framework consists of an [[object-relational mapping|object-relational mapper]] which mediates between [[data modeling|data models]] (defined as Python classes) and a [[relational database]] (&quot;'''M'''odel&quot;);  a system for processing requests with a [[web template system|web templating system]] (&quot;'''V'''iew&quot;) and a [[regular expression|regular-expression]]-based [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] dispatcher (&quot;'''C'''ontroller&quot;).

Also included in the core framework are:

* A lightweight, standalone web server for development and testing.
* A form serialization and validation system which can translate between [[HTML]] forms and values suitable for storage in the database.
* A [[Web cache|caching]] framework which can use any of several cache methods.
* Support for [[middleware]] classes which can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions.
* An internal dispatcher system which allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals.
* An [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]] system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages.
* A [[serialization]] system which can produce and read [[XML]] and/or [[JSON]] representations of Django model instances.
* A system for extending the capabilities of the template engine.
* An interface to Python's built-in [[unit test]] framework.

==Bundled applications==

The main Django distribution also bundles a number of applications in its &quot;contrib&quot; package, including:

* An extensible authentication system.
* The dynamic administrative interface.
* Tools for generating [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] syndication feeds.
* A flexible commenting system.
* A sites framework that allows one Django installation to run multiple websites, each with their own content and applications.
* Tools for generating [[Google Sitemaps]].
* Tools for preventing [[cross-site request forgery]].
* Template libraries which enable the use of [[lightweight markup language]]s such as [[Textile (markup language)|Textile]] and [[Markdown]].
* A framework for creating [[Geographic information system|GIS]] applications.

==Applications built on Django==
*[[Django-cms|django CMS]], a [[free and open source software|free and open source]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.django-cms.org/en/developers/ |title=Developers|work=django-cms.org |accessdate=2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[content management system]] platform for publishing content on the [[World Wide Web]] and [[intranet]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/CMSAppsComparison |title=Django CMS Apps Comparison|work=djangoproject.com |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* The [[Pinax (software)|Pinax]] framework provides reusable applications aimed at Django-based social networking websites.
* [[RapidSMS]] is a framework for [[SMS]] applications built on Django.
* [[Pootle]] is an online translation management tool.
* [[Review Board]] is a web-based code review tool.
* [[Rietveld (software)|Rietveld]] is another web-based code review tool built on Django. It was originally written to serve as a showcase for using Django with [[Google_App_Engine|Google App Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/CodeReviewBackground CodeReviewBackground â rietveld â Background of the CodeReview (Rietveld) project. â Project Hosting on Google Code].

* [[Disqus]] uses Django for their widely popular discussion platform.
* [[Firstpex]] uses Django to run an auction style site for startups and companies selling shares and looking for investment.
* [[Spotify]] uses Django for some of their web sites.
* [[Instagram]] uses Django for their web application &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of|title=What Powers Instagram: Hundreds of Instances, Dozens of Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yandex]] uses Django for their weather forecast site, OpenID provider, blog hosting service, internal Wiki and internal Mail Archives.
* [[Transifex]] â an open source platform for [[localization]].
* [[Bucketlist]] â uses Django to let users store life goals.
* The [[Public Broadcasting Service]] in the United States uses Django for some of their web sites.&lt;ref name=20sites&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fearlessflyer.com/2009/11/20-creative-websites-running-django/|title=20 Creative Websites Running Django}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism]] uses Django for their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/blog/2009/may/20/webcasting-django/|title=Webcasting with Django|date=2009-05-20|publisher=[[Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Sciences at the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] uses Django for their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ei.rub.de] Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Sciences at the [[Ruhr University Bochum]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Universal Subtitles]] uses Django for its free and open source collaborative subtitling site.
* [[FreeNAS]] uses Django for its web interface in its newest major release, 8.0.
* [[DjangoSites.org]] uses Django for handling its Django-powered sites directory.

==Server arrangements==

Django can be run in conjunction with [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] using [[mod_wsgi]] or [[mod_python]]. Django also includes the ability to launch a [[FastCGI]] server, enabling use behind any web server which supports FastCGI. Another deployment option is [[nginx]] and uwsgi. It should also be possible to use other [[Web Server Gateway Interface|WSGI]]-compliant web servers. Django officially supports four database backends: [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], [[SQLite]] and [[Oracle Database|Oracle]]. [[MS SQL]] backend can be used with [http://code.google.com/p/django-mssql/ django-mssql] but only in [[Microsoft]] [[operating systems]], similarly external backends exist for [http://code.google.com/p/ibm-db/ IBM DB2] , [http://code.google.com/p/sqlany-django/ SQL Anywhere] and [http://code.google.com/p/django-firebird/ Firebird]. There is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] named [http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel django-nonrel] which supports [[NoSQL (concept)|NoSQL]] databases like [[MongoDB]] and [[Google App Engine]]'s Datastore.

Django may also be run in conjunction with [[Jython]] on any [[Java EE]] application server such as [[GlassFish]] or [[JBoss]]. In this case [http://code.google.com/p/django-jython/ django-jython] must be installed in order to provide [[JDBC]] drivers for database connectivity, which also provides functionality to compile Django in to a .war suitable for deployment.

Versions of Django prior to 1.0 had [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] issues &lt;ref name=&quot;code.djangoproject.com&quot;&gt;[http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoSpecifications/Core/Threading DjangoSpecifications/Core/Threading â Django â Trac]. Code.djangoproject.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and it would be recommended that those versions of Django only be used in a single threaded server configuration, such as with Apache prefork MPM using mod_python or embedded mode of mod_wsgi. Although Django 1.0 is principally believed to now be thread safe, some minor threading issues are still occasionally being found; it may be prudent to continue to use a single threaded server configuration and/or stay current with Django releases and notices about the multithreading issues. &lt;ref name=&quot;code.djangoproject.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Google App Engine]] includes support for Django version 1.x.x&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django-nonrel.html Running Pure Django Projects on Google App Engine]. Code.google.com (2010-11-01). Retrieved on 2011-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the bundled frameworks.

== Integrated development environments ==
While a number of Django developers use [[text editors]] such as [[VIM]], [[Emacs]] or [[TextMate]] with Django Bundle for their projects, the other prefer more specialized tools providing intellisense, code completion, debugging, refactoring, unit testing, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/175044/django-development-ide Django development IDEs discussion at Stackoverflow]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Eclipse_ide|Eclipse]] with [[PyDev]]
*[[PyCharm]]
*[[NetBeans]] with Django Plugin &lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/netbeans-django/ NetBeans Django Plugin]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wing IDE]]
*[[Eric Python IDE]]

== DjangoCon ==
There is a twice-yearly conference for Django developers and users, named &quot;DjangoCon&quot;, that has been held since September 2008. One DjangoCon a year is held in Europe, in May or June;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanyrd.com/series/djangocon-eu/ DjangoCon EU series], Lanyrd.com&lt;/ref&gt; while the other is held in the United States in September, usually in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanyrd.com/series/djangocon-us/ DjangoCon US series], Lanyrd.com&lt;/ref&gt;.
