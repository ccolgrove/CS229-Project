'''Chakra GNU/Linux''' is a [[Linux distribution]] originally based on [[Arch Linux]] and focused on the [[KDE Software Compilation 4|latest KDE software]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DWChakra&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=chakra|title = Chakra GNU/Linux|accessdate = 30 November 2010|last = [[Distrowatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[DistroWatch]] ''Chakra GNU/Linux'' ranks among the 20 most popular Linux distributions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The teamâs original project '''KDEmod''', modular KDE software packages for Arch Linux, was phased out in January 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;KDEmon-End&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chakra was initiated by KDEmod developers who decided to create a [[live CD]] based on Arch Linux. The objective of Chakra was to provide a desktop operating system easy to use but which maintains all the features, clarity, power and responsiveness of Arch Linux.

On August 30, 2010 the Chakra team released their first independent version, called ''Chakra GNU/Linux 0.2''. It is no longer a preconfigured Arch Linux live CD.&lt;ref name=&quot;0.2&quot; /&gt;

== Features ==
Chakra GNU/Linux includes both free and proprietary software, both for architecture i686 and x86-64. It provides a graphical installer called Tribe. It is based on KDE Software Compilation and is released under the semi-continuous model that is a [[rolling release]] accompanied by a stable base. This means that the core packages of Chakra (graphics, audio, etc.) are frozen and only updated to fix any security problems. These packages are updated after the latest versions have been thoroughly tested before being moved to permanent repository (about every six months). This allows stable base to ensure stability to the rest of the programs. The other applications (web browsers, games, media players, office suites, etc.) are updated following the rolling release model and are generally available immediately after their release.
