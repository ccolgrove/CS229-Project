'''Whitey''' (born Nathan Joseph White)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/3479a279-679d-4ff3-9a0b-e9908cab2e0c&lt;/ref&gt; is a musician from [[London]], UK.

==Career==

In 2004, he released an album named ''[[The Light at the End of the Tunnel is a Train]]''. The album predated the electro rock movement by several years, and was greeted at the time as a critical triumph, going on to make numerous Best Of Year lists worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/10bestcds/story/0,12102,1416646,00.html Observer Album Review]&lt;/ref&gt;   

In the summer of 2007, an album named ''Great Shakes'' was leaked onto the internet. As a consequence of this leak, this album was never officially released,&lt;ref&gt;http://s34385.gridserver.com/story/182&lt;/ref&gt; and Whitey was dropped from his record label. On 9 October 2007, the ''Wrap It Up EP'' was released though Pure Groove Music/Universal Music. It consisted of three songs: Wrap It Up, Cigarette, and Head in the Corner.&lt;ref&gt;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=265287924&amp;s=143441&lt;/ref&gt; Other appearances since then have been the track &quot;Stay on the Outside&quot; on ''[[KitsunÃ© Maison Compilation 4]]'', the release of the limited edition ''Made of Night EP'' on Marquis Cha Cha records and the track &quot;Wrap It Up&quot; on the [[Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack#Radio Broker|Grand Theft Auto 4]] in-game soundtrack. Tracks by Whitey have also featured in episodes of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[The O.C]]'', ''[[Kyle XY]]'', ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'' and ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]''. 

A full album named ''Stay On The Outside'' was planned for release in the later part of 2008, but this has been delayed. This album was planned to include a number of tracks from ''Great Shakes'' and a number of new tracks. A new album ''[[Canned Laughter (Whitey album)|Canned Laughter]]'' was self-released by Whitey on April 1, 2010. A further collection of tracks, ''Canned Laughter Vol.2'', was planned for released as a [[music download|digital download]] on Sept 1st 2010 but was, according to Whitey's official [[Myspace]], &quot;delayed indefinitely due to lack of funds, press, food and rent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myspace.com/hellowhitey#ixzz0yCnbZJyM&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2010, a track from the lost 'Great Shakes' album, entitled ''Blah'', appeared on the soundtrack to [[Gran Turismo 5]]. As of November 2011, Whitey has signed an American record deal with Dim Mak and has recorded Canned Laughter Vol. 2.
