The '''1918 U.S. Senate election''' occurred on November 5, 1918 coinciding with the midpoint of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s second term as [[President of the United States]].  The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] gained control with a slim 2-seat majority after picking up a net seven seats. The change in control was particularly important, since it meant that the Republicans were in a position to deny entry of the United States into the [[League of Nations]]--the centerpiece of Wilson's post-war foreign policy.

Republicans gained seven seats:

* [[Lawrence C. Phipps]] (CO)
* [[L. Heisler Ball]] (DE)
* [[Joseph M. McCormick]] (IL)
* [[Arthur Capper]] (KS)
* [[Selden P. Spencer]] (MO)
* [[Henry W. Keyes]] (NH)
* [[Irvine Lenroot]] (WI)--won in a special election

Democrats gained one seat:

* [[David I. Walsh]] (MA)
