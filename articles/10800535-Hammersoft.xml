'''Ronald Joseph''' (born October 9, 1944) was an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]]. Alongside his skating partner, sister [[Vivian Joseph]], Joseph took 2nd place at the Midwest Skating Championship in 1957 before winning a number of awards between 1961 and 1965, notable holding the top prize in the U.S. Junior National Champions (1961), U.S. Championship (1965) and North American Championship (1965). For a time they were awarded as bronze medalists in the 1964 Winter Olympic Games due to the disqualification of the German [[silver medal]]-winning team of [[Hans-JÃ¼rgen BÃ¤umler]] and [[Marika Kilius]], but after that team was reinstated in 1987, they were reinstated at 4th.
