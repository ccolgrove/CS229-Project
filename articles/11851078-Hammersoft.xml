''[[The Simpsons]]'' includes a large array of supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities, fictional characters within the show and even animals. The writers originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|town]]. A number of them have gained expanded roles and have subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to the creator of ''The Simpsons'', [[Matt Groening]], the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the [[Canada|Canadian]] sketch comedy show ''[[Second City Television]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/1|title=Matt Groening: Interview|accessdate=2006-10-22|last=Rabin |first= Nathan|date=2006-04-26|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agnes Skinner==
'''Agnes Skinner''', voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; is the mother of school principal [[Seymour Skinner]] and first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]] episode &quot;[[The Crepes of Wrath]]&quot; as an old woman who embarrassingly calls her son &quot;Spanky&quot;. However, as episodes progressed, the character turned bitter.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheCrepes&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[The Crepes of Wrath]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She is very harshly controlling of Seymour, and treats him like a mother would a small child, once grounding him because he did not say who was at the door after answering it, when it was &quot;[[Lisa's Rival|The Sugarman]]&quot;. She hates [[Edna Krabappel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpecialEdna&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Special Edna]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes has married a total of four times, once with Skinner's father, Sheldon Skinner, and following Sheldon's death she then married three more times, each time, to a [[tow truck]] driver.&lt;ref name=&quot;MidnightTowboy&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Midnight Towboy]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Several Springfield residents (including the Simpsons) are afraid of her.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePrincipal&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[The Principal and the Pauper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When Agnes' real son, &quot;[[The Principal and the Pauper|the real Seymour Skinner]]&quot; arrives in Springfield, Agnes turns him away, unhappy with her new living situation, largely because the true Seymour Skinner is a man who can stand up to Agnes and make his own decisions. Although she appears to not care for the fake Skinner, it turns out she really loves him, although she denies it in &quot;[[Large Marge]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePrincipal&quot;/&gt;

Agnes's first name was revealed in the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]] episode &quot;[[Bart the Fink]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Richmond196&gt;Richmond, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, the character was known as &quot;Mrs. Skinner&quot;.&lt;ref name=Richmond196/&gt; In the beginning of the series, the writers made several references to Agnes and Seymour's relationship being similar to that of Norman Bates and his mother's in the film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, Al (2003). Easter egg commentary for &quot;[[Separate Vocations]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;  In &quot;[[Boy Meets Curl]],&quot; it is revealed that some of Agnes' resentment to Seymour may have derived from even before Seymour was born&amp;nbsp;â during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], Agnes competed in the pole vaulting event while 9-months pregnant. When Seymour makes his first kick, he hits the bar, thus, making Agnes lose and subsequently crushing her dreams.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Boy Meets Curl]],&quot; first aired February 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[George Takei]] originally voiced Akira in &quot;One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish&quot;. Since Akira's speaking role in &quot;[[When Flanders Failed]]&quot;, [[Hank Azaria]] has voiced the character, doing an impression of Takei for the voice.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, Al (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[When Flanders Failed]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arnie Pye''', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], is a disgruntled, somewhat eccentric [[helicopter]] [[traffic reporting|traffic reporter]] for Springfield's [[KBBL (The Simpsons)|KBBL-TV]] (Channel 6). His name and appearance are a parody of the famous, Pulitzer winning 1930s journalist, [[Ernie Pyle]]. His segments are titled &quot;Arnie (or &quot;Pye&quot;) in the Sky&quot;. He has an apparent dislike of anchorman [[Kent Brockman]], with whom he often gets into arguments on the air, and Brockman once snarled that Arnie was a &quot;jackass&quot;.

==Arthur Crandall and Gabbo==
Arthur Crandall (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]) and Gabbo (voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]) are a puppet and [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] who start their own TV show that is in competition with [[Krusty the Clown]]'s. The show is a huge hit that ruins Krusty's career, but Bart then ruins Gabbo's future by capturing him making a rude comment on TV. The pair are later reduced to low-paying work such as a show at an Indian casino. The pair mainly appeared in Season Four's [[Krusty Gets Kancelled]] but they also appeared in [[Bart to the Future]], [[Homerazzi]], [[All About Lisa]], and ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.

==Artie Ziff==
'''Artie Ziff''' is a former classmate of Marge who becomes an Internet millionaire. He is voiced by [[Jon Lovitz]] in all appearances, except for season four's &quot;[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]&quot;, where he was voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Jean, Al|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season DVD Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]&quot;, where after he loses his bankrupt company to Homer, Homer is taken away by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for bankrupting the company, although Artie confesses in the end and goes to jail instead.  Strongly disliked by Marge since their experience at the senior prom when he attempts to grope her, he eventually comes to terms with the fact that his personality, not his religion ([[Judaism]]), is the reason he is disliked.&lt;ref name=&quot;HalfDecent&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Half-Decent Proposal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Animator [[David Silverman]] based Ziff's appearance and body language of a man he went to high school with.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers|accessdate=2007-07-29|date=2007-07-26|author=Larry Carroll|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a few occasions, Gerald has been shown being pushed in a stroller by his mother outside the [[742 Evergreen Terrace|Simpson house]] as in &quot;[[Lady Bouvier's Lover]]&quot;, as the two babies glare at one another.  The character's name was revealed in the episode &quot;[[The Canine Mutiny]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin, Doug and Gary==

Commentary for &quot;[[Homer Goes to College]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Because time was short, director [[Jim Reardon]] used a caricature of animator [[Rich Moore]] and colored it black for Benjamin.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Jim (2004). Commentary for &quot;Homer Goes to College&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bernice Hibbert==

Nevertheless, her marriage is on the rocks;&lt;ref name=&quot;DudeWheres&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Dude, Where's My Ranch?]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Bernice refuses to kiss Julius, even when an entire audience is looking at them.&lt;ref name=&quot;MargeandHomer&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Her drinking has been joked about on several occasions; she faints when she reads that [[prohibition]] had been introduced to Springfield&lt;ref name=&quot;HomervsThe&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and attends Springfield [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaysofWine&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Days of Wine and D'oh'ses]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill and Marty==
'''Bill and Marty''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]] and [[Dan Castellaneta]], are two [[radio programming|radio show]] [[presenter#Radio presenter|hosts]] and [[disc jockey|DJ:s]] on [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfieldâs]] own radio station [[KBBL (The Simpsons)|KBBL]]. Marty is middle-aged and [[baldness|balding]], while Bill is younger and has a full head of hair. They are responsible [[Bart Gets an Elephant|for giving]] [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] his [[elephant]], [[Stampy]], although they were surprised when Bart wanted Stampy, because they thought he would choose the other [[prize]], $10,000. When Mr. Burns monopolized the local media in [[Fraudcast News]], he fired the duo, but they have returned to the job in later episodes.

==Billy==
'''Billy''' is [[Troy McClure]]'s assistant who appeared in &quot;[[Lisa the Simpson]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Bart the Mother]]&quot;. He was supposed to appear in more episodes but due to McClure's voice actor [[Phil Hartman]]'s death, he was retired along with McClure. He is a child who appears in Troy McClure's educational films. He appears in the films &quot;Birds: Our Fine Feathered Colleagues&quot;, and &quot;In The Kitchen with [[DNA]]&quot;. He was voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]. A similar child named Jimmy (who at one point McClure also calls Billy) appears in &quot;The Meat Council Presents: 'Meat and You: Partners in Freedom'&quot; in the episode, &quot;[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]&quot;.

==Birch Barlow==
'''Birchibald &quot;Birch&quot; T. Barlow''' (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]] on &quot;[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]&quot; and [[Maurice LaMarche]] on &quot;[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]]&quot;). He is a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[talk show]] host on the radio station [[KBBL (The Simpsons)|KBBL]], who in voice and appearance is modeled after [[Rush Limbaugh]]. As of &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot;, he also has a show on [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], and serves as a parody of Fox News [[Fox News Channel controversies|conservative bias]].

On his [[radio programming|radio show]], he declares himself to be &quot;the [[fourth branch of government]]&quot; and &quot;the [[U.S. state|fifty-first state]]&quot;. He is also the author of the book ''Only [[Turkey (bird)|Turkey]]s Have [[Left-wing politics|Left Wings]]''. Barlow plays an important part in the episode &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot;, in which [[Sideshow Bob]], while jailed, calls Barlow on his radio show, giving Bob an outlet to voice how the prison treats him unfairly. Barlow, knowing Bob is a fellow [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], sympathizes with his complaints, and influences the rest of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] to as well. This leads to Bob's prompt release and ensuing [[mayor]]al [[Electoral fraud|election-rigging]].

Barlow also appears in the episode &quot;[[We're on the Road to D'ohwhere]]&quot; as a customer at Marge's prescription drug-laden &quot;yard sale&quot;, a reference to Limbaugh's [[Rush Limbaugh#Prescription drug addiction|Oxycontin addiction]].  Most recently Barlow appears with other Springfield Republicans in the episode &quot;[[E Pluribus Wiggum]]&quot;, in which he tells Lisa to make Ralph Wiggum decide whether he wants to run for President as a Republican or a Democrat.

==&quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy==
'''Bleeding Gums Murphy''', voiced by [[Ron Taylor (actor)|Ron Taylor]] and [[Daryl Coley|Daryl L. Coley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;coley&quot;&gt;[http://www.tv.com/daryl-l.-coley/person/3385/summary.html Daryl L. Coley] ''TV.com''. URL accessed on December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; was a jazz musician, idol, and mentor of [[Lisa Simpson]]. His actual first name has never been revealed, though Murphy claimed his nickname came from the fact he had never once been to a dentist, as &quot;I got enough pain in my life as it is&quot;. His significant roles were in the episodes &quot;[[Moaning Lisa]]&quot; and &quot;[['Round Springfield]]&quot;, though he appears in other episodes, such as &quot;[[Bart the Daredevil]]&quot; (where he is yellow), &quot;[[Dancin' Homer]]&quot;, &quot;[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]&quot;, &quot;[[Flaming Moe's]], &quot;[[Bart Gets an F]]&quot;, &quot;[[Radio Bart]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Lisa's Pony]]&quot;. In &quot;[[Dancin' Homer]]&quot;, he was voiced by Daryl L. Coley.&lt;ref name=&quot;coley&quot; /&gt; In &quot;Round Springfield we learn that at one point he had enjoyed a fairly successful career, releasing an album (&quot;Sax on the Beach&quot;) and appearing on [[Steve Allen (comedian)|Steve Allen]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;RoundSpring&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[['Round Springfield]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the Cosby children's four grandfathers on an episode of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'',  but quickly lost his money feeding his $1500-a-day habit of purchasing and smashing [[FabergÃ© egg]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoaningLisa&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Moaning Lisa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He had taught Lisa to display her emotions through music, prompting Lisa to hold him as an important figure in her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoaningLisa&quot;/&gt; His last appearance was in &quot;[['Round Springfield]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-6_episode-22 'Round Springfield] ''The Simpsons.com''. URL accessed on December 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; - after [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] ends up in the hospital, Lisa wanders off to find Murphy dying in a nearby ward. He explains about his life, family, and work to her as well as giving her advice for her upcoming school performance, giving her his saxophone. When Lisa returns, she finds out that Bleeding Gums has died from circumstances which are never revealed. No one, except for Lisa, attends Murphy's funeral. Lisa soon learns that though he may be gone, he still is alive in her.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoundSpring&quot;/&gt; It is strongly hinted that Murphy and [[Julius Hibbert|Doctor Hibbert]] are long-lost brothers, most notably by Murphy's quote: &quot;I don't really have a family. All I had was a little brother who grew up to become a doctor. He used to laugh at the most inappropriate times.&quot; Hibbert then laughs inappropriately and says, &quot;Hey, I've got an older brother that I'll never see. He's a jazz musician or some such. Oh well, bye, bye.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RoundSpring&quot;/&gt; Bleeding Gums Murphy is loosely based on [[Blind Willie Johnson]], at whose feet the young Bleeding Gums character learned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matt Groening]], DVD commentary for the episode &quot;'Round Springfield&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The voice of Bleeding Gums Murphy was provided by [[Ron Taylor (actor)|Ron Taylor]], while his saxophone playing is provided by [[Dan Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danhiggins.net/bio_short.html Dan Higgins Biography] ''Dan Higgins.net''. URL accessed on December 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As a sign of respect for the character, Murphy has been a fixture of ''The Simpsons'' opening sequence since [[The Simpsons (season 2)|the second season]]. Originally, even after his death, Bart would skateboard past him on the street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snpp.com/guides/openings.list.html Opening Sequence] ''SNPP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blinky==
'''Blinky''' is a three-eyed orange fish featured primarily in &quot;[[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish]]&quot;. Likely mutated by toxic waste from the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] pouring into the river, Blinky became a major news story when he was caught by [[Bart Simpson]]. [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] defends the fish, arguing that his extra eye is merely the next step in [[evolution]]. Mr. Burns later goes to the Simpsons' house for a meal to boost his race for governor. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], a supporter of Burns' opponent [[Mary Bailey (The Simpsons)|Mary Bailey]], deliberately serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns spits the fish out and subsequently loses the election. Blinky was briefly seen again in episodes &quot;[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]&quot; and &quot;[[Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in &quot;The Curse of the Flying Hellfish&quot;]]&quot;.  Blinky also made a brief appearance in an underwater section of tube-way Fry travels through in the [[Space Pilot 3000|pilot episode]] of the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', which was created by ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]].

==Blue Haired Lawyer==
'''Mr. Burns' Lawyer''',&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot;[[Bart Gets Hit by a Car]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as &quot;'''The Blue-Haired Lawyer'''&quot;, is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple86&quot;&gt;Gimple, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; He first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] episode &quot;[[Bart Gets Hit by a Car]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; He is Springfield's most prominent and powerful [[lawyer]], known for his blue hair and nasal [[New York]] accent. He also occasionally appears to serve as a prosecutor. Unlike [[Lionel Hutz]] or [[#Gil Gunderson|Gil Gunderson]], he is a competent though not necessarily ethical lawyer. He has served as [[Montgomery Burns|Burns']] head lawyer, helping him out with threats of the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|Power Plant]] closing down and of Burns losing his money. He is a member of the Springfield [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. His clients often tend to be antagonists of the Simpsons.

The character's demeanor, as well as Dan Castellaneta's voice for the character, are based on [[Roy Cohn]], best known as [[Joe McCarthy]]'s chief counsel during the [[McCarthyism|Communist witchhunts]] in the 1950s. Animator [[Jim Reardon]] modeled the character's appearance on actor [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Jim (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[Bart the Fink]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boobarella==
'''Boobarella''' is an ample-chested [[vampire]]-looking woman, first seen in the episode &quot;[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]&quot;. She is aware of her large breasts, and often makes reference to them on the rare occasion she appears on TV. Her character is a takeoff of [[Elvira, Mistress of the Dark|Elvira]], a character portrayed by [[Cassandra Peterson]], herself a takeoff of [[Maila Nurmi|Vampira]]. Her name is probably a takeoff from [[Vampirella]] and the 1968 cult science fiction/fantasy/horror film [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]], which stars [[Jane Fonda]] in the title role. Boobarella uses a stereotypical Eastern European &quot;horror&quot; accent and makes school supplies.

==Brandine Spuckler==
'''Brandine Spuckler''' is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; and is the partner of [[Cletus Spuckler]]. Brandine and Cletus are depicted as stereotypical yokels. Throughout the series, the two are shown to be brother and sister,&lt;ref name=&quot;AloneAgain&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; boyfriend and girlfriend,&lt;ref name=&quot;TheresSomething&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[There's Something About Marrying]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; mother and son,&lt;ref name=&quot;TheItalianBob&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[The Italian Bob]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and father and daughter.&lt;ref name=LittleBigGirl&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Little Big Girl]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She is apparently the daughter of Cletus and an alien. She has suffered from [[rabies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GooGoo&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Goo Goo Gai Pan]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and admitted to being [[literacy|illiterate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TwentyTwo&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Brandine is shown fighting in the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yokel&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Yokel Chords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She comes back revealing Cletus is the father of only two of the kids, casting doubt over the paternity of her other children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yokel&quot;/&gt; Assuming that all of the children believed to be Cletus' are also hers, Brandine has 45 specifically named children.  Brandine and Cletus were married by Homer during his brief stint as a priest.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimpleSimpson&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Simple Simpson]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; On April 27, 2008, more is revealed about Cletus and Brandine in an episode entitled &quot;[[Apocalypse Cow]]&quot;; Brandine had married Cletus at the age of 13, and had married four times before that.  Some of the most distinct features of Brandine are that she speaks in a thick accent, and wears her hair up high in red ponytail.

==Brunella Pommelhorst==
The school gym teacher, voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]/[[Maggie Roswell]] (in Moaning Lisa) First appeared in &quot;[[Moaning Lisa]]&quot;, although her name is not mentioned until &quot;[[The PTA Disbands]]&quot;. She has blond hair and usually wears a whistle and takes a tough-as-nails approach to teaching. In &quot;[[Little Girl in the Big Ten]]&quot;, she decides that because of the oath she took on ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess|Xena]]'', she has to fail Lisa but decides to let her make it up by taking private lessons. In a more recent episode, &quot;[[My Fair Laddy]]&quot;, she decides to leave for the year and return the next semester as &quot;Mr. Pommelhorst, the new shop teacher.&quot;

==Bumblebee Man==
The '''Bumblebee Man''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is the star of a Spanish-language television sitcom on &quot;[[Channel Ocho]]&quot;, in which he dresses in a [[bumblebee]] costume and performs [[Slapstick|slapstick comedy]]. In the episode &quot;[[Team Homer]]&quot;, his bowling shirt bears the name &quot;'''Pedro'''&quot;. He works at the same studio as [[Kent Brockman]]. His first appearance was in &quot;[[Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie]]&quot;. Bumblebee Man is never seen to take off his costume, even when by himself; the sole exception is the episode &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;, in which his private life is shown. In this short segment, he is portrayed as innately clumsy rather than simply acting as such.

In general, Bumblebee Man only speaks in simple, over-enunciated (and inaccurate) Spanish sentences. His catchphrases of choice are typically &quot;Â¡Ay, ay, ay, no me gusta!&quot; (&quot;I don't like it!&quot;), &quot;Â¡Ay, ay, ay, no es bueno!&quot; (&quot;That's not good!&quot;) and &quot;Â¡Ay, Dios no me ama!&quot; (&quot;God doesn't love me!&quot;). Quite commonly, his phrases will be intentionally sloppy Spanish. For example, in the episode &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;, there are several words used that are not real (such as &quot;wudpequero&quot; for &quot;[[woodpecker]]&quot;, rather than the correct ''pÃ¡jaro carpintero''). The crude Spanish is used so that English-speaking viewers would still understand what was being said.&lt;ref&gt;Season 7 DVD Commentary - &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; On occasions, he also speaks English, such as briefly in &quot;[[Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington]]&quot;. In &quot;[[Bart Gets Famous]]&quot;, he anchored the news with an articulate English accent, filling in for the regular, Kent Brockman.

Bumblebee Man is a caricature of ''[[El ChapulÃ­n Colorado]]'', a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian [[Roberto GÃ³mez BolaÃ±os]] (a.k.a. &quot;Chespirito&quot;), and his show consists of simple skits, often involving heavy [[slapstick]]. The staff have said that whenever they watched [[Telemundo]], this character was &quot;always on&quot;, thus they created Bumblebee Man, who is also always on the air when the Spanish-language channel is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; His costume was based on one used in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch &quot;Killer Bees&quot;.&lt;ref name=tvguide&gt;{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|accessdate=2007-08-15|date=2000-10-21|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|author=Joe Rhodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hank Azaria]] won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] for voicing Bumblebee Man, and various other characters, in 2003.&lt;ref name=Emmy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php|title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search|publisher=Emmys.org|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital City Goofball==
The '''Capital City Goofball''' is the mascot for Capital City. He was voiced by [[Tom Poston]]. His appearance seems to have been inspired by the mascot of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] baseball team, the [[Phillie Phanatic]].  The costume is a creature with a baseball body, with a blue Capital City T-Shirt, yellow arms and legs, a long flat-ended nose, tufts of fur at the side, a red hat with two springs, two costume eyes that look in either direction, and two more eyes that peek outside the mouth. The Capital City Goofball first appeared in the episode &quot;[[Dancin' Homer]]&quot; and shared the stage with Homer. In &quot;[[Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade]]&quot;, the Capital City Goofball represents Capital City in the state [[legislature]]; he spent 80 million dollars out of his own pocket to win the seat, and now is leading an effort to change the state's embarrassing, Confederate-symbol centered state flag. With the death of [[Tom Poston]] in 2007, it is likely that this character will be retired, if the precedent regarding Phil Hartman and [[Doris Grau]]'s characters (except for [[Lunchlady Doris]], who is still used and is now voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) is followed. He has not spoken since &quot;Bart and Lisa vs. the Third Grade&quot; and has been reduced to making minor background appearances and usual honking sounds.

==Captain Lance Murdock==

==Cookie Kwan==
'''Cookie Kwan''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]), is an [[Asian American]] [[real estate broker]] who first appears in the Season 9 ''Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;. She is the stereotypical competitive woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Realty&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She touts herself as being &quot;number one on the West Side&quot;, although she also works on the East Side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Realty&quot;/&gt; She is very aggressive toward anyone whom she deems a threat to her business, evidenced by when she threatens [[#Gil|Gil Gunderson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Realty&quot;/&gt; She had once attempted to seduce Ned Flanders,&lt;ref name=&quot;StarBornAgain&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[A Star Is Born-Again]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; had an illegitimate baby with Mayor Quimby,&lt;ref name=&quot;SheUsedto&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[She Used to Be My Girl]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and flirted with Homer.&lt;ref name=&quot;LargeMarge&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Large Marge]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She is friends with [[#Lindsey Naegle|Lindsey Naegle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LargeMarge&quot;/&gt; She is a Republican.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouKent&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She is played by MacNeille with a strong and harsh Asian accent.

==Crazy Cat Lady==
'''Eleanor Abernathy'''&lt;ref name=&quot;SeeHomerRun&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[See Homer Run]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]), better known as the '''Crazy [[Cat Lady]]''', is a woman with the appearance and behavior of a stereotypical mentally ill person. She first appears in &quot;[[Girly Edition]]&quot;. Abernathy is always surrounded by a large number of cats, and in every appearance she screams gibberish and/or throws cats at passersby.&lt;ref name=&quot;GirlyEdition&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Girly Edition]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She gives Lisa one of her cats, Snowball V, who looks exactly like her original [[Snowball II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IDohBot&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Abernathy has an unfortunate past. When she was eight, she was a smart and ambitious young girl who wanted to be both a lawyer and a doctor &quot;because a woman can do anything&quot;. She was studying for law school at 16, and by 24 she had earned a medical degree from [[Harvard Medical School]] and a law degree from [[Yale Law School]]. However, by 32, suffering from [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]], she had [[alcoholism|turned to alcohol]] and became obsessed with her pet cat. By the time she turned 40, she had assumed her present state as a drunken, raving lunatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpringfieldUp&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Springfield Up]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Abernathy briefly reverts to her sanity and high intelligence thanks to some pills that she shows the Simpsons, but after Marge points out that the pills are actually [[Reese's Pieces]] candy, Abernathy abruptly resumes her deranged behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;HomerandNeds&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When participating in a mayoral election, she lucidly discusses topics such as health care, economy and public education in between her screams and gibberish.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeeHomerRun&quot;/&gt;

In the episode &quot;[[A Midsummer's Nice Dream]],&quot; Abernathy is shown to be a hoarder. After Marge helps her clean up her house, she begins speaking normally and wearing proper clothing. Later, in an attempt to fix Marge's new hoarding problem, Abernathy reverts back to her crazy self, reclaiming all of the hoarded junk and calling her cats back to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMidsummersNiceDream&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons episode &quot;[[A Midsummer's Nice Dream]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crusher and Lowblow==
'''Crusher''' (also referred to as '''Joey''') and '''Lowblow''' are a pair of stereotypical henchmen often found in the employment of [[Montgomery Burns]] as he prefers the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons. Crusher's first appearance was in the second season episode [[Blood Feud]] where he is seen escorting Homer off the premises of the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. The two seem to be on first name terms as [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] calls him Joey. Their first appearance together was in the episode [[Last Exit to Springfield]] when the two of them kidnap Homer and take him to Burns Manor. They introduce themselves as &quot;Hired Goons&quot;, a term that Homer apparently is not familiar with. The pair rarely had speaking roles and were often used as Mr Burns' goons for a number of early episodes but eventually they became background characters.

==Database==
'''Database''', or '''Data''', (real name unknown to viewers) is a [[nerd]]y student who attends Springfield Elementary School. He first appeared in the episode &quot;[[Bart's Comet]]&quot; as a member of &quot;the Super Friends&quot;. He has since had speaking parts in several episodes. He is usually seen with his fellow nerd [[Martin Prince]]. Database is a common target for [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]], [[Dolph (The Simpsons)|Dolph]], [[#Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], and [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]]. Database is part of the group of boys who invade [[Shelbyville, NT|Shelbyville]] in &quot;[[Lemon of Troy]]&quot;. He is one of the Pre-Teen Braves in the episode &quot;[[The Bart of War]]&quot;. He is a member of the school band, as seen in &quot;[[The PTA Disbands]]&quot;. Database is known for his annoying, nerdy voice which is supplied by [[Nancy Cartwright]]. Database's father is shown in &quot;Lemon of Troy&quot;, although he utters no dialogue and is only in the background and has not appeared since that episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond178&quot;/&gt; [[Matt Groening]] has stated that Database is his least favorite character in the show.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[Lemon of Troy]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' (DVD). 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dave Shutton==
'''Dave Shutton''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; is a reporter for ''[[The Springfield Shopper]]''. Writer [[John Swartzwelder]] named Shutton after a friend of his.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot;[[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; His first appearance was in the season two episode &quot;[[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish]].&quot; Since then, his roles have become less relevant and have been reduced to cameos and appearances in crowd scenes. According to [[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)|&quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns&quot;, Part 2]], [[Kent Brockman]] does not like Dave Shutton and thinks he is unprofessional.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhoShot2&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Who Shot Mr. Burns#Part two|Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ThreeMen&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;$pringfield&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)|$pringfield]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declan Desmond==
'''Declan Desmond''' (voiced by [[Eric Idle]] of [[Monty Python]] fame) is an odd and skeptical British [[Documentary film|documentary]] filmmaker who has directed several films, including ''Do You Want Lies with That?'', ''American Boneheads: A Day In The Life Of Springfield Elementary'', ''Growing Up Springfield'', and ''Ainât No Mountain: A Blind Man Climbs Everest''.  ''Growing Up Springfield'' is his most notable documentary. It follows the lives of the inhabitants of Springfield, starting when they were in third grade and continuing every eight years. It is a parody of [[Michael Apted]]âs ''[[Up Series]]''. Desmond appeared in the episodes &quot;[['Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky]]&quot; and &quot;[[Fat Man and Little Boy (The Simpsons)|Fat Man And Little Boy]]&quot; and his Growing Up Springfield series were featured in the episode &quot;[[Springfield Up]]&quot;. The character is based on real British filmmakers [[David Attenborough]] and [[Desmond Morris]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

==Dewey Largo==
'''Dewey Largo''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], is the music teacher, whom Lisa credited with proving that any piece of music could have the soul sucked out of it. He is very uncreative and is a poor, pathetic music [[Conducting|conductor]]. He is always seen in the opening sequence, teaching his class and throwing Lisa out of his band class when she plays a funky/jazzy tune on her saxophone. His last name ''[[Grave (music)|Largo]]'' is also an Italian word for a slow, broad musical [[tempo]], a possible reference to the fact that he can make any piece of music uninteresting.

He has not played a large role in the series, but was originally intended to be an uptight [[Double act|foil]] for Lisa, and her non-conformist ways. After the first few seasons, Mr. Largo was rarely seen. However he has since resurfaced as a recurring character in the seventeenth season, making appearances in several episodes. In the 17th season in the episode &quot;[[Homer's Paternity Coot]]&quot; it is revealed that Largo was accepted to the [[Juilliard School]], but never got the letter as it was frozen atop Mount Springfield. He ended up at Springfield Elementary instead. A recurring gag since the 17th season episode &quot;[[See Homer Run]]&quot;, are allusions that Largo is [[gay]]. The 22nd season episode &quot;[[Flaming Moe]]&quot; confirmed Largo is gay and in a relationship with an older man.

==Disco Stu==
'''Disco Stu''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann116&quot;/&gt; is a man who is mentally stuck in the [[1970s|disco era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TwoBadNeighbors&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Two Bad Neighbors]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He is normally featured wearing a rhinestone-encrusted leisure suit. Stu was introduced as the punchline to a joke in &quot;[[Two Bad Neighbors]]&quot;. In a garage sale, Homer attempts to sell a jacket on which he had once tried to write &quot;Disco Stud&quot; in [[rhinestone]]s, but having made the letters too big he did not have room for the final '&quot;d&quot;. After Marge remarks that nobody would ever want to buy a jacket that read &quot;Disco Stu&quot;, another customer recommends it to Stu, but Stu replies &quot;Disco Stu doesn't advertise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TwoBadNeighbors&quot;/&gt; Stu's speech pattern is similar to that of [[#Duffman|Duffman]], also voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]; he [[illeism|speaks in the third person]], often referring to himself as &quot;Disco Stu&quot; (emphasizing &quot;Stu&quot; and then pausing before saying anything else; whatever follows usually rhymes with &quot;Stu&quot;). According to &quot;[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]&quot;, Stu actually is aware disco is dead, does not like disco music at all, and worries that his personality may make him a &quot;one-note guy&quot;. He is a Roman Catholic, having gotten an annulment from [[Pope John Paul II]] after a brief marriage to Selma Bouvier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strummer&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Stu was originally to be voiced by [[List of cast members of The Simpsons#Recurring guest voices|repeat guest star]] [[Phil Hartman]]. However, when the animators remodeled the character, [[show runner]] [[Bill Oakley]] described the original Disco Stu as &quot;a black, wrinkly [[John Travolta]]&quot;, and Hartman was not available to dub the voice, Hank Azaria took over the role.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[Two Bad Neighbors]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of 25, [[IGN]] named Stu the 24th top peripheral character in ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Goldman, Eric; Iverson, Dan and Brian Zoromski|title=Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral Characters|date=2006-10-06|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p1.html|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctor Colossus==
'''Doctor Colossus''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is a [[supervillain]] and a [[mad scientist]], who resides in Springfield. He has light blue skin and wears a white laboratory coat, gloves and goggles. Doctor Colossus is a minor character and usually only appears in the background. He lives on &quot;Death Mountain&quot;. Doctor Colossus is often shown in jail, hinting that he is very incompetent as a supervillain.

==Dolph==
'''Dolph''', voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]], is a bully and student at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. Dolph is recognized by his asymmetrical haircut which covers one eye and wears cutoff shorts and basketball shoes. He is [[left-handed]] and does not talk as much as the other bullies. He usually comes across as very intelligent and speaks a variety of languages including [[Esperanto]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]]. It turns out Dolph is [[Judaism|Jewish]] and attends [[Hebrew school]]. Despite the fact that he appears to be wholly [[White people|Caucasian]], in the episode &quot;[[Little Big Girl]]&quot; he shows up to multicultural day with a [[Lip plate|disked lower lip]], suggesting some African or South American descent. He lied to his friends about not having a [[bar mitzvah]], later claiming it had been &quot;just family&quot;. He has also mentioned the fact that he has two fathers. Dolph was named after one of Matt Groening's classmates from Lincoln High School named Dolph Timmerman. Groening stated that Timmerman was not a bully but just a real cool guy.

==Drederick Tatum==
'''Drederick Tatum''' (voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]) has appeared in several episodes. He is a professional boxer and the reigning [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|World Heavyweight Champion]]. He features prominently in the episode &quot;[[The Homer They Fall]]&quot;, in which [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] takes up boxing and is lined up as an opponent for Tatum, soon to be released from prison. The fight proves one-sided, and Homer is rescued by [[Moe Syzlack|Moe]] just as he is about to be knocked out by Tatum. Tatum grew up in Springfield, but in &quot;[[Flaming Moe's]]&quot; he calls the city &quot;a dump&quot; and says &quot;if you ever see me back there, you know I really fu*#ed up bad!&quot; 

A former 1984 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Gold medal#Olympic Games|Gold medalist]], he first became champion after defeating Watson in the heavily promoted &quot;Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out!&quot;, a fight Homer and his friends watched on his [[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment|illegal cable hookup]]. He was so feared inside [[prison]] he could stop [[prison riot|riots]] just by telling the rioters to shut up. Tatum also appears in &quot;[[Bye Bye Nerdie]]&quot;. Lisa tests her nerd spray on him, which forces [[Nelson Muntz]] to involuntarily get up and start punching Tatum, to little effect. A sobbing Nelson tries to apologise but Tatum rolls up his sleeves and declares &quot;you leave me little recourse!&quot;

Tatum is a parody of [[Mike Tyson]], with a high-pitched lisping voice, a menacing demeanor, a criminal record, financial problems and a tendency to make pseudo-intellectual comments like &quot;I insist that you desist&quot; and &quot;your behavior is unconscionable&quot;. He also has an unscrupulous manager named Lucius Sweet, who closely resembles Tyson's promoter/manager [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]]. Indeed, in &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot; Homer notes that Sweet &quot;is as rich and famous as Don King, and looks just like him&quot;. King and Tyson were asked to appear in the episode but declined. [[Paul Winfield]], who played King in a [[Tyson (1995 film)|1995 Tyson biopic]], took the role instead.

==Duffman==
'''Duffman''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is the [[mascot]] and spokesman for the fictional [[Duff Beer]] company in ''The Simpsons''. He first appeared in the episode &quot;[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]&quot;. Within the series, he is a [[Metafiction|fictional character]] played by several people, and sometimes simultaneously. He is an athletic and smooth-talking corporate personality who wears blue and red tights, a red cape, white gloves, and the Duff logo emblazoned across his chest. The costume &amp;mdash; featuring a red hat, dark sunglasses, and a &quot;[[Studded Belt|utility belt]]&quot; of beer cans around his waist &amp;mdash; is designed to &quot;create awareness of Duff&quot;. Duffman is generally known for his overly enthusiastic speech in which he refers to himself in the [[grammatical person|third person]], complete with dramatic pauses and ending with a suggestive &quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; and [[pelvic thrust]]s. His theme song which plays at every corporate-sponsored appearance is &quot;[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]&quot; by [[Yello]], with the exception of his appearance in &quot;[[To Surveil with Love]]&quot; where it was &quot;[[Get Ready for This]]&quot; by [[2 Unlimited]]. While usually loyal to his corporate sponsors, in the season 15 episode &quot;[[Co-Dependent's Day]]&quot;, Duffman reveals he is ashamed of betraying his [[Jew]]ish heritage by doing a Nazi-esque performance at [[Oktoberfest]] (&quot;This reich will last a thousand beers! Oh, ''ja''! [muttering]: I do this, and I'm [[Jews|Jewish]].&quot;). In the season 17 episode &quot;[[Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play]]&quot;, it was revealed that there were two more Duffmen working and claimed &quot;Three duffmans on duty tonight.&quot; (but this is kept a secret so as not to disillusion children). At least one of the actors playing Duffman was also revealed to be gay in episode &quot;[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]]&quot;, where Grady breaks up with Julio to date (a) Duffman.

Duffman is based on [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]]'s former mascot [[Anheuser-Busch#Advertising|Bud Man]]. Duffman's catchphrase comes from the song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, which the producers say became extremely popular after ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off#Music 2|Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' and many advertisers started using it. As a result, the writers felt that the song and phrase &quot;Oh yeah!&quot; would be suitable for Duffman. Duffman's thrusts were first acted out by [[Brad Bird]].&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in the [[audio commentary]] for &quot;[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, while helping alcoholics in a homeless shelter, Duffman, in civies, reveals his name as Barry Duffman.

==Eddie and Lou==
'''Eddie''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; and '''Lou''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]] respectively,&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond178&quot;/&gt; are [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] police officers. They first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]] episode &quot;[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;disgrace&quot;&gt;Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot;[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The two do not have surnames, as Lou says &quot;we're like [[Cher]]&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frying&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode: &quot;[[The Frying Game]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in his younger years, Lou referred to himself as &quot;Lou the cop&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThatNinetys&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[That 90's Show]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lou is the police sergeant and a competent officer of the Springfield Police. He is a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to [[Chief Wiggum]], and often takes the time to point out Wiggum's mistakes. Lou has been shown to resent Wiggum, and is aware of his chief's ineptitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDontWanna&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lou was married to a woman named Amy.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dad Who Knew Too Little&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[The Dad Who Knew Too Little]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[The Bart of War]]&quot;, it is shown that Lou is divorced from his wife, and Eddie has been seeing her occasionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartofWar&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[The Bart of War]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lou is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pluribus&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[E Pluribus Wiggum]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentary for &quot;[[Bart vs. Thanksgiving]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elizabeth Hoover==
'''Elizabeth Hoover''' is a second grade teacher at Springfield Elementary, voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]] and [[Marcia Mitzman Gaven]] while Roswell was involved in a pay dispute. Miss Hoover has been worn down by her years in the public school system, and in [[Lisa Gets an &quot;A&quot;]] implies that she frequently drinks during lunch. She is very apathetic and bored with her job, and seems overwhelmed with stress, seeking whatever remedies she can to alleviate it. She is often seen smoking even while teaching, once even under a &quot;No Smoking&quot; sign in the assembly hall. Her desperate attempts to regain her stability include rushing out of class to recite &quot;Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean&quot; with her eyes closed, getting into her car and driving off on two occasions, and even letting [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] teach the class when she was granted [[tenure]].

When the series began Miss Hoover's hair was pale blue, but from Season 4 onwards, she has had brown hair, presumably because of stress.

==Fallout Boy==
In the series, Fallout Boy first appears in a 1950s ''[[#Radioactive Man|Radioactive Man]]'' [[serial film]] shown at a comic book convention in the episode &quot;[[Three Men and a Comic Book]].&quot; However, unlike many ''Simpsons'' characters, he has only made a handful of appearances since. While Radioactive Man is a broad parody of many superheroes, most obviously containing elements of [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] (and the comic incorporates an origin story similar to [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]), among others, Fallout Boy is mainly a parody of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (with his costume, references as being the 'young ward' of Radioactive Man, and his younger age and sidekick status) with elements of [[Spider-Man]] (his fictional comic book origin, for example). His catchphrase is &quot;Jiminy Jillickers!&quot;

Additionally, Fallout Boy also appears in a real-life comic book titled ''Radioactive Man'', published by [[Bongo Comics]] (a comic created in part by [[Matt Groening]], the creator of ''The Simpsons''). In these comic books, Fallout Boy's real name is Rod Runtledge, he has a brother named Dodd Runtledge, and they live in Zenith City. Rod is a [[high school]] [[nerd]] living with his aunt, Aunt June.

Fallout Boy was an average book worm, until one day, he was at a Radioactive demonstration, where he met up with Claude Kane. A tall piece of machinery fell towards them. Claude grabbed Rod and jumped over the rail, Claude holding onto the machine. The machine came to life, and as the ray passed through Claude, who became Radioactive Man, it hit Rod. Rod then got a pint sized version of RM's powers, and became Fallout Boy.

In the episode &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, Milhouse was chosen over Bart to play Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man movie to be filmed in Springfield. [[Rock music|Rock]] band [[Fall Out Boy]] took the name of this character after, when they asked a concert audience what band name they should have, a fan shouted &quot;Fallout Boy!&quot;

==Frankie the Squealer==
'''Frankie the Squealer''' is a member of the Mafia and associate of Fat Tony. However, he does not appear to be very useful to his colleagues in criminal activity due to his uncontrollable habit of [[informant|squealing]] (he claims that &quot;it makes [him] feel big&quot;), even squealing on himself one time. On several occasions, the mob has attempted to kill him for his squealing, though they have repeatedly been unsuccessful. Frankie first appeared in episode &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot; where his squealing habits are introduced after he squeals on himself for squealing.

==Gil Gunderson==
'''Gil Gunderson''', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple86&quot;/&gt; and first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 9)|ninth season]] episode &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot; as a real estate agent with [[Lionel Hutz]]'s Red Blazer Realty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gil&quot;&gt;Scully, Mike (2006). Commentary for &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a spoof of actor [[Jack Lemmon]]'s portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 [[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|film adaptation of the play]] ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gil&quot;/&gt; (Lemmon himself voiced a character similar to Levene in the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] episode &quot;[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for &quot;[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Show runner [[Mike Scully]] said that the writers thought that Gil would be &quot;a one-shot thing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scully, Mike (2006). He is seen working many different jobs in multiple epsisodes. Commentary for &quot;[[Natural Born Kissers]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the [[read-through|table read]] doing the character&quot;, Scully elaborated, &quot;we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gil&quot;/&gt; Writer [[Dan Greaney]] said that it was a great take-off on Levene to make Gil more desperate than he was.

Commentary for &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, &quot;[[Kill Gil, Volumes I &amp; II]]&quot;, the only episode to center on Gil, won a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] in the animation category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=2764|title=2008 Writers Guild Awards Winners Announced|accessdate=--|date=2008-02-09|publisher=[[Writers Guild of America, west|WGAW]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alice Glick==
'''Alice&lt;ref name=&quot;replaceable&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' season 23, episode 4: &quot;[[Replaceable You]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Glick''' is an elderly shut-in for whom Bart did chores in &quot;[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]&quot;; he didn't get paid very well, so he started to hate her. She had a brother named Asa, mentioned in the same episode, who died during [[World War I]]; he was killed by his own [[Hand grenade|grenade]], which he held for too long. [[Doctor Hibbert]] once confessed to leaving his car keys inside her. She is occasionally seen in the background of various episodes, often with a toothless laugh. She is a stereotypical lonely old woman, who spends her days &quot;watching her stories.&quot; She was originally voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]]&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Tress MacNeille]].

She later dies due to a heart attack caused by an invention Bart and Martin create in the episode &quot;[[Replaceable You]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;replaceable&quot;/&gt; Her final scene is dancing with [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] in Heaven.&lt;ref name=&quot;replaceable&quot;/&gt;

==Gloria==
'''Gloria''', voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] is [[#Snake Jailbird|Snake]]'s girlfriend. She is a [[parking enforcement officer|meter maid]]. She first appears in &quot;[[A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love]]&quot;, dating [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]]. She ends up leaving him to return to her ex-boyfriend Snake, for criticising but unintendedly complementing him in the same sentence. Gloria visits Snake in prison in &quot;[[I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]].&quot; She appears once again in &quot;[[Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes]]&quot;, where she is now pregnant. However in &quot;[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]]&quot; they have broken up. Then, in &quot;[[Wedding For Disaster]]&quot; they seem to have gotten back together and apparently got married.

==God==
'''[[God]]''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], has had many appearances in the series, including &quot;[[Homer the Heretic]]&quot;, &quot;[[Thank God, It's Doomsday]]&quot;, and a quick scene with him, [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and [[Harland Sanders|Colonel Sanders]] in &quot;[[Pray Anything]]&quot; as well as appearing in the flick across the town in the opening sequence (in the HD episodes) where he is fighting with the devil. He is portrayed in the traditional depiction of the [[Abraham]]ic God in the Western world: a gray-haired Caucasian man in a white robe with a booming voice. In most episodes, only his beard is seen as the camera only films him up to the shoulders (God is a head taller than everyone else in the Simpsons universe). His body is usually surrounded by a glowing light, and his robes float around him, though not always. He does not seem to be [[omniscience|all-knowing]]. Another notable characteristic of him is his ability to forgive and tolerate Homer's mishaps, despite his later often heretical attitude. In fact, he is good and even friendly terms with Homer, but he would not hesitate to severely punish him if Homer become too obnoxious. One of God's distinctive features is that he and [[Jesus]] are the only two ''Simpsons'' characters to be drawn with five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot, though not always.

==Grady and Julio==
'''Grady''', voiced by [[Scott Thompson]] and '''Julio''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]] are two [[homosexuality|gay]] men who become Homer's roommates when he leaves Marge in &quot;[[Three Gays of the Condo]]&quot;. Julio reappears in &quot;[[There's Something About Marrying]]&quot;, marrying another man, in &quot;[[I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]&quot; as one of the bank robbery hostages, and has speaking cameos in &quot;[[Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind]]&quot; and &quot;[[E Pluribus Wiggum]]&quot;. He appeared in the episode &quot;[[Four Great Women and a Manicure]]&quot;, in which he was seen as &quot;King Julio&quot; in Lisa's first story, &quot;Elizabeth the First&quot;. He works as a photographer, as seen in &quot;[[The Devil Wears Nada]]&quot;. Grady made his second appearance to date in &quot;[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]]&quot;, in which he persuades Homer to break up his (Grady's) relationship with Julio, so that he could pursue a relationship with [[Duffman]]. Julio made further appearances as Marge's Hairdresser in &quot;[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]]&quot; and &quot;[[Homer Scissorhands]]&quot;.

==Gunter and Ernst==
'''Gunter''' and '''Ernst''', [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]-style entertainers voiced by [[Harry Shearer]] and [[Hank Azaria]], are obvious parodies of [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]]: they speak with [[German language|German]] accents, their act involves [[magic (illusion)|magic]] and [[white tiger]]s, and one has black hair while the other has bleached-blond hair. The duo appear in the episodes  &quot;[[Viva Ned Flanders]]&quot;, &quot;[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)|$pringfield]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Jazzy and the Pussycats]]&quot;. In &quot;Jazzy and the Pussycats&quot;, they are seen at [[Amber Simpson|Amber Simpson's]] funeral. In &quot;[[The Simpsons Game]]&quot; it is revealed they performed at an aquarium.

In a case of life imitating art, the 1993 episode &quot;$pringfield&quot; (the first episode featuring Gunter and Ernst) depicts the duo being savagely mauled by their trademark white tiger, [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Anastasia|Anastasia]]. Ten years later, the trained white tiger [[Siegfried &amp; Roy#Horn's tiger injury|Montecore]] dragged Roy Horn off-stage by his neck during a performance at [[The Mirage]]. According to the DVD commentary on this episode on the Simpsons season five DVD set, the part where Gunter and Ernst get attacked is considered &quot;the greatest prediction&quot; the Simpsons ever made, but it was &quot;bound to happen&quot; considering how the tiger was treated.

==The Happy Little Elves==
The Happy Little Elves are a parody of [[The Smurfs]], who appeared more often in the show's earlier episodes. They are a favorite of Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Bart, however, hates them; he mainly refers to them as either &quot;those stupid elves&quot; &quot;The Crappy Little Elves&quot;, or &quot;The Little Green Idiots&quot;. Their movies include ''Return of the Happy Little Elves'', an unnamed Christmas movie as seen in &quot;[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]&quot;, ''The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cubs'', ''The Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town'', and ''The Happy Little Elves meet Fuzzy Snuggleduck'' (which was listed as an R-rated movie along with ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]'' and ''The Erotic Awakening of S'' on Rancho Relaxo's cable system). They were first mentioned in a [[Simpsons shorts|short]] on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' entitled &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. The most recent appearance they had was in &quot;[[Dial N for Nerder]]&quot; in March 2008. In more current episodes, they appear as wall decorations in Maggie's and Lisa's rooms.

==Helen Lovejoy==
'''Helen Lovejoy''' (nÃ©e '''Schwartzbaum'''), voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]] and [[Marcia Mitzman Gaven]], is [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Rev. Lovejoy]]âs judgmental and [[gossip]]y wife, and the mother of [[Bart's Girlfriend|Jessica Lovejoy]]. She introduced herself in the episode &quot;[[Life on the Fast Lane]]&quot; as &quot;the gossipy wife of the minister.&quot; Her catchphrase is [[for the children (politics)|&quot;What about the children?! Won't somebody ''please'' think of the children]]!?&quot; which she always says among a crowd when something bad is happening in the city. In &quot;[[Wedding for Disaster]]&quot;, the Parson remarks to Reverend Lovejoy that he remembers when Helen Lovejoy was Helen Schwartzbaum and prior to that, ''Harold'' Schwartzbaum, before deciding he has said too much, implying that Helen was not always a woman, however this is directly contradicted as in flashbacks she is shown to be a girl as a child, and the fact that she and Reverend Lovejoy have a biological daughter in Jessica. In [[E Pluribus Wiggum]], it was revealed that Helen is a member of the Springfield [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Caucus while in one of their dungeon meetings.

==Herman==
'''Herman''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; is the owner of Herman's Military Antiques. He is a right-arm above-elbow [[amputee]]; he tells Bart that the arm was lost when he stuck it out the window of a moving bus as a kid. A brilliant military tactician, Herman was instrumental in Bartâs victory in water balloon combat against Nelson and in the negotiation of the peace treaty between the two combatants in &quot;[[Bart the General]]&quot;, which is his most significant and first appearance.

He is friends with [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham Simpson]], to whom he sold a [[Fez (hat)|fez]], claiming it was previously owned by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]; Herman then advertised Abe's old hat as &quot;the hat [[William McKinley|McKinley]] was shot in&quot;. He also tried to sell counterfeit jeans out of the Simpsons' garage, but was foiled by [[Marge Simpson]]. 

Harry Shearer does an impression of [[George H.W. Bush]] for the voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groening, Matt 2001&quot;&gt;Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot;[[Bart the General]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Herman's facial appearance is modeled after ''Simpsons'' writer [[John Swartzwelder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Groening, Matt 2001&quot;/&gt; The original idea behind Herman, said Groening, was that each time he appeared, he would give a different explanation for how he lost his arm. However, the second joke, involving Herman having stuck his arm in a ball return at a bowling alley, got cut, and the writers never pursued the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2006). Commentary for &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jack Larson==
'''Jack Larson''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], was a slick spokesman and now president for Laramie Cigarettes and once owned the [[Springfield Isotopes]]. He also was the spokesperson in a commercial for the Little Miss [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] pageant, with Laramie cigarettes as the main sponsor.

==Janey Powell==
'''Janey Powell''', voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]], is a classmate and friend of [[Lisa Simpson]]. Janey first appeared in &quot;[[Bart the General]]&quot; and was once Lisa's closest friend. She has been at Lisa's [[sleepover]]s, and Lisa is seen watching cartoons at her house on numerous occasions.

Her description on The Simpsons [[Pogs|POG]] set described her as &quot;Lisa's fair-weather friend&quot;. Though she is sometimes seen spending time with Lisa, other times she teases her along with the other children. She is not portrayed as being nearly as intelligent or nerdy as Lisa. Janey may have had a crush on [[Milhouse Van Houten]], who has a crush on Lisa. She enjoys reading babysitting books.

==Jasper Beardly==
'''Jasper Beardly''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; is one of the elder residents of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], often portrayed as [[Abraham Simpson]]'s best friend. His most distinguishing features are his ultra-low, gravelly voice and very long beard. Jasper made his first appearance in &quot;[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]&quot;. He is a veteran of [[World War II]], but (according to the episode &quot;[[Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play]]&quot;) he attempted to avoid the draft by disguising himself as a woman. He stayed in Springfield to play in the local women's baseball league, along with his friend Abe, who was also avoiding the war but was exposed during a game.  In a deleted scene, it was shown that Jasper was the town pastor, prior to Reverend Lovejoy. He briefly served as substitute teacher of Lisa's class during which time he confiscated everything made of tin, got his beard caught in a pencil sharpener and threatened paddling for minor infractions such as looking out the window or talking out of turn.

In the subplot of the season nine episode, &quot;[[Lisa the Simpson]]&quot;, Jasper put himself in crude &quot;suspended animation&quot; in the [[Kwik-E-Mart]]'s freezer, and under advice from [[Dr. Nick Riviera]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] kept him frozen. When Jasper's frozen form became popular with customers, Apu started exploiting the spectacle, and transformed the Kwik-E-Mart into a special interest store dealing with weird items, or perfectly ordinary ones which had been made out to be abnormal, called the Freak-E-Mart. Jasper was accidentally unfrozen, and stepped out into what he thought was a future world, just as Apu was considering selling him to the [[#Rich Texan|Rich Texan]]. In the episode &quot;[[I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]&quot; Jasper mentions he is a [[diabetes mellitus|diabetic]].

==Jebediah Springfield==
'''Jebediah Obadiah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield''' (a.k.a. '''Hans Sprungfeld''') is the founder of the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. He is voiced by [[Harry Shearer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; According to legend, Jebediah Springfield and his partner Shelbyville Manhattan, led a band that left [[Maryland]] in search of &quot;New Sodom&quot; due to a misinterpretation of the Bible, but they parted ways over political differences: though both men are devoted to chastity and abstinence, Manhattan wanted to let people be free to marry their cousins if they wish, to which Springfield strongly opposes. It was then Manhattan went on to found the rival town of [[Shelbyville, NT|Shelbyville]], taking half of the settlers with him.

Springfield had many famous quotations, such as &quot;A noble spirit [[List of neologisms on The Simpsons|embiggens]] the smallest man&quot;. He also wears a [[coonskin cap]]. The Springfield Marathon commemorates an occasion on which he ran across six states in order to avoid his creditors. In &quot;[[The Telltale Head]]&quot; Bart beheaded the statue, thinking that this would make him more popular. In reality, the town became depressed and angry, leaving Bart to endure &quot;[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]&quot;-style guilt before replacing it. This episode is referenced in multiple ''Simpsons'' video games such as ''[[The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants]]'', where the statue's head serves as a [[power-up]] item, or ''[[The Simpsons Road Rage]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run]]'', where characters can kick or ram Jebediah's head off the statue.

Many Jebediah legends have been debunked during the run of the series. For instance, &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; repeatedly refers to Jebediah killing a bear with his bare hands, but on the news, [[Kent Brockman]] reveals that recent historical evidence suggests the bear actually killed Jebediah. On an expedition to Springfield's historic &quot;Fort Springfield&quot;, Bart uncovers other inconsistencies in the Jebediah legend, such as that he fought at [[Fort Ticonderoga]] the same day as the first [[Whacking Day]].

Most of Springfield's biography is revealed in the 1996 episode &quot;[[Lisa the Iconoclast]]&quot;, wherein [[Lisa Simpson]] discovers Jebediah Springfield's biggest secret: he was formerly a bloodthirsty pirate named Hans Sprungfeld, who once brawled with [[George Washington]] and lost after Washington crushed Sprungfeld's genitals in one of his sets of iron [[dentures|false teeth]]. Sprungfeld fled and changed his name in 1795 to hide his identity. He was well known for his &quot;silver tongue&quot; (literally; a metal [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] tongue, his original tongue having been bitten off by a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] pirate in a grog house fight). Before he died of [[diphtheria]], he wrote his confession on a scrap of canvas that he hid in a [[Fife (musical instrument)|fife]]. The canvas scrap formed the &quot;missing piece&quot; of the famously incomplete 1796 [[Gilbert Stuart]] portrait of George Washington; Sprungfeld picked it up during a fight against Washington which occurred while the latter was having his portrait painted. Lisa decides not to reveal this secret to the people of Springfield, seeing that the myth of Jebediah has brought out the good in everyone and that the true story will cause them to lose hope and morale within themselves.

The Australian rock-band &quot;[[Jebediah]]&quot; was named after Jebediah Springfield.

==Jimbo Jones==
'''Corky James''' &quot;'''Jimbo'''&quot; '''Jones''', voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; but was originally voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] in his first appearance in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]] episode &quot;[[The Telltale Head]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telltale&quot;/&gt; A real lowlife, he wears a purple [[tuque|knit cap]] and a black T-shirt emblazoned with a menacing skull. He can often be seen hanging around [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], [[Dolph (The Simpsons)|Dolph]], and sometimes [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]]. He is generally acknowledged as the leader of this clique. He enjoys intimidating his schoolmates and [[shoplifting]]. It is hinted that he comes from a well-off family, most notably in season six's [[The PTA Disbands]] when&amp;nbsp;â with the school closed for a teacher's [[strike action|strike]] - he and his mother watch [[soap opera]]s and sip tea together in a very nice living room. In season seven's [[Bart the Fink]], Bart discovers that Jimbo's real name is Corky. Jimbo's other known aliases are Jamesbo, Dr. J and Hector Gutierrez. Jimbo is named for executive producer [[James L. Brooks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Telltale&quot;&gt;Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot;[[The Telltale Head]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Jimbo runs for mayor in the Season 17 episode &quot;[[See Homer Run]]&quot;, with a campaign slogan of &quot;Tough on Nerds. Tougher on Dorks.&quot;

==Johnny Tightlips==
'''Johnny''' &quot;'''John'''&quot; '''Tightlips''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is a member of the Mafia and associate of [[Fat Tony]]. He says very little, which spares him from accusations of being a &quot;squealer&quot;, but his reticence tends to be unhelpful to others and even himself. In &quot;[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]&quot; he tries to help Fat Tony in taking away Marge's earnings from her 'Pretzel Wagon' franchise. In &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot;, there is a shoot-out in Fat Tony's mansion and Tightlips is shot by accident. When asked where he's injured, he says &quot;I ain't sayin' nuthin'!&quot;, and when asked what to tell the doctor he says, &quot;Tell him to suck a lemon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;icp&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF17|title =Insane Clown Poppy| publisher =The Simpsons Archive| accessdate =2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jub-Jub==
'''Jub-Jub''' is [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma Bouvier]]'s pet [[iguana]] and was originally owned by [[Simpson family#Other Bouvier family members|Aunt Gladys]]. It was first seen in &quot;[[Selma's Choice]]&quot;. Gladys gives Jub-Jub to [[Bouvier family|Jacqueline Bouvier]], who is highly unattached to it. As a result, she later passes it on to Selma. Selma once said that Jub-Jub will eat her remains upon her passing.

The name Jub-Jub was coined by then-writer [[Conan O'Brien]].&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite video | people=Stern, David|date=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Selma's Choice&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often said nonsensical things around the office for no apparent reason, one of which was &quot;Jub-Jub&quot;. Fans of [[KTCK|Sportsradio 1310]] in Dallas voted that Jub-Jub be the new nickname of morning radio host [[George Dunham]]. O'Brien, on October 17, 2007, mentioned his creation of Jub Jub and asked [[Joe Buck]], the play-by-play commentator of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] [[World Series]] on FOX, to say it during his broadcast. O'Brien promised $1,000.00 to the charity of the announcer's choice.  On October 24, 2007, during Game 1 of the [[2007 World Series]], Buck called field level reporter, [[Chris Myers]], &quot;our own little Jub-Jub.&quot; Jub-Jub was used as the first [[Twitter]] hash tag for O'Brien's &quot;[[The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour|Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour]]&quot; in 2010.

==Judge Constance Harm==
'''Constance Harm''', voiced by [[List of cast members of The Simpsons#Recurring guest voices|repeat guest star]] actress [[Jane Kaczmarek]]. She is a harsh, unforgiving disciplinarian.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Simpsons]]'' &quot;[[The Parent Rap]]&quot; - November 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; She enjoys creating cruel punishments for criminals in her court and frightening them with a miniature [[guillotine]] on the bench. She might be a transsexual based on a statement she makes during her first appearance in &quot;[[The Parent Rap]]&quot;: &quot;you remind me of me, when I was a little boy&quot;. Her name is a play on &quot;constant harm&quot;. The character is a parody of [[Judge Judy]]. In &quot;[[On a Clear Day I Can't See My Sister]]&quot;, she reveals she has a husband. Although Judge Snyder resolves court cases, Judge Harm has mainly been used for handing down negative verdicts, such as sentencing a family member to prison. She also appears in &quot;[[Brawl in the Family]]&quot;, &quot;[[Barting Over]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Wandering Juvie]]&quot;, &quot;[[Brake My Wife, Please]]&quot; and &quot;[[Chief of Hearts]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Simpsons]]'' &quot;[[Brake My Wife, Please]]&quot; - May 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judge Roy Snyder==
'''Roy Snyder''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple87&quot;&gt;Gimple, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] judge known for his lenient punishments and somewhat unorthodox rulings (as in the episode &quot;[[Sweets and Sour Marge]],&quot; when he bans sugar from Springfield). The character was originally named &quot;Judge Moulton&quot;, but show runners [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] did not know that, and called him &quot;Snyder&quot;.&lt;ref name=violence&gt;Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[The Day the Violence Died]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; His appearance is modeled on [[Robert Bork]].&lt;ref name=violence/&gt; Snyder's skin color has gone back and forth between yellow and brown repeatedly throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot;[[Krusty Gets Busted]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Just Stamp the Ticket&quot; Man==
This man first appears in &quot;[[When Flanders Failed]]&quot; when he goes to the [[Leftorium]] to get his parking validated because it is the only store that does it without requiring a purchase. [[Ned Flanders]] says he is &quot;right as rain, or, as we say around here, 'left as rain' but the man bluntly responds &quot;Just stamp the ticket. His next appearances is in &quot;[[Homer Alone]]&quot;, when the Squeaky Voiced Teen tries to hand him a flyer he brushes him off by saying &quot;Don't touch me&quot;. In a later episode, &quot;[[Mr. Plow]]&quot;, he tells [[Barney Gumble]] (who is handing out flyers dressed as Lullabuy$'s Big Baby) that he &quot;sickens&quot; him. He reappears again in [[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]], at the Springfield Swap Meet, he derides [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s &quot;cool&quot; wishbone necklaces, stating he doubted his &quot;son or daughter is that stupid&quot;.

==Dr. J. Loren Pryor==
'''Dr. J. Loren Pryor''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], is the school psychologist. He is based on an early design for [[Seymour Skinner]], and first appears in &quot;[[Bart the Genius]]&quot; where he decides to send [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to a school for [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] children after Bart cheats on a test. Bart later approaches him to request returning to Springfield Elementary. In &quot;[[Bart Gets an F]]&quot;, he tells Bart that he may have to repeat the fourth grade. He appears again, discussing Bart's problems at school and Lisa's special gift in a flashback sequence of &quot;[[Lisa's Sax]]&quot;. In this episode he also inadvertently reveals that [[Milhouse Van Houten]] possesses &quot;flamboyantly homosexual&quot; tendencies. Pryor does not appear again for several years until the episode &quot;[[See Homer Run]]&quot;, in which he tells Lisa that she is going through a developmental condition.

==Kearney Zzyzwicz==
'''Kearney Zzyzwicz''', voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]], is one of Springfield Elementary's many bullies. He has a [[buzz cut]], and wears a torn white T-shirt, blue shorts, and studded wristbands. Although he looks and sounds to be around [[#Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]] or [[#Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]]'s age, Kearney is actually older. He is [[Lisa the Iconoclast|the only Springfield Elementary School student who remembers the Watergate Scandal and the 1976 Bicenntenial]] (according to Principal Skinner), [[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife, and Her Homer|was in Otto the bus driver's third-grade class]] (according to Otto), [[Lisa's Date with Density|owns a car]] (even though he rode the school bus on &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot;, &quot;The Mook, the Chef, the Wife, and Her Homer&quot;, and &quot;How the Test Was Won&quot;), [[Lisa the Iconoclast|regularly shaves]], [[A Milhouse Divided|has custody of a child from a divorce]], [[Treehouse of Horror XIX|is old enough to vote in a general U.S. election]], [[Realty Bites|was sent to prison]], and [[Lisa Simpson, This Isn't Your Life|pays taxes]].

In &quot;[[She of Little Faith]]&quot;, Kearney dated Jimbo's mother. In the same episode, it is revealed that he is on the church council of the First Church of Springfield and is &quot;a teenager and the parent of a teenager&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;She of Little Faith&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= She of Little Faith |episodelink= She of Little Faith |series= The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |airdate= 2001-12-16 |season=13 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kearney often relies on (or tricks) [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] into procuring alcohol for himself and his friends (as seen in &quot;[[The Springfield Connection]]&quot;, &quot;[[Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Last Tap Dance in Springfield]]&quot;), and once used a fake ID (as seen in &quot;[[Much Apu About Nothing]]&quot;), though it is heavily implied that Kearney is of the legal age to buy alcohol for himself (as in &quot;[[El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)|El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer]]&quot;, in which he is seen drinking at [[Moe's Tavern]]).

Kearney's last name (Zzyzwicz) was revealed in a computer file in season 18's &quot;[[24 Minutes]]&quot;. Prior to that episode, Kearney's surname was never mentioned. In &quot;[[Bart Gets a 'Z']]&quot;, Kearney can be seen sitting in the back row of Bart's classroom, implying that Kearney is a fourth grader. Kearney's father was shown on the season eight episode &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot;, but in &quot;[[O Brother, Where Bart Thou?]]&quot;, Kearney reveals that both of his parents are incarcerated and they only meet when the prison and insane asylum have their annual mixer.

==Kirk Van Houten==
'''Kirk Van Houten''' (sometimes called '''Milhouse's Dad''') is voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]. He is the father of [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]], and the remarried husband of Luann Van Houten. He wears glasses just like his son and wife. He first appeared in &quot;[[Bart's Friend Falls in Love]]&quot;. Kirk has been portrayed as a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] middle-aged male loser and deadbeat dad. Much of his character revolves around his extreme [[depression (mood)|emotional depression]] after his divorce from his wife Luann. Luann got custody of Milhouse when they divorced, but Kirk has visiting rights and is often seen with Milhouse in later episodes. Kirk suffers from the need to cry all the time after his divorce, even in good times. The Van Houtens remarried in the [[The Simpsons (season 19)|nineteenth season]] episode &quot;[[Little Orphan Millie]]&quot;. In that episode it was established that Kirk is of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Danes|Danish]] ancestry. Kirk previously served in the [[U.S. Army]], and attended Gudger College. Apparently Kirk's mother is of [[Greeks|Greek]] ancestry, based on the nineteenth season episode &quot;[[Husbands and Knives]]&quot;. In the episode, Milhouse says, &quot;But that's the money Yaya Sophia gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter!&quot;.

According to Luann, Kirk was not a very good provider, and she had to borrow money from her sister to make ends meet. When Luann demands a divorce, Kirk is all too happy to oblige. Unfortunately, he loses his middle-management job at Southern Cracker, a job given to him by Luann's father, as a result. Kirk briefly attempts a career as a singer-songwriter, recording a demo tape of an original song titled &quot;Can I Borrow A Feeling&quot;, with mediocre results. Later, he attempts to win Luann back by singing the song to her. Luann does not reciprocate Kirk's feelings, choosing instead to remain with her boyfriend.

Kirk reveals in the episode &quot;[[I Am Furious Yellow]]&quot;, where he visits his son's school on career day, that he was currently employed as an assistant to the guy who puts fliers under people's windshield wipers. Kirk also had a job standing on the curb holding a sign directing people to a condo development and worked as a scarecrow protecting a soy-bean crop, which resulted in his eye being gouged by a crow. Since being fired from the cracker company, Kirk seems to be unable to maintain a steady job. He once shouted at Luann that she had to keep up the [[alimony]] payments she owed him, and he has been seen at the Springfield unemployment office, perhaps suggesting that alimony and [[unemployment benefits]] are his only steady sources of income. Kirk was put in jail in the episode &quot;[[Pranksta Rap]]&quot; for &quot;[[kidnapping]]&quot; Bart which he greatly enjoyed due to him being envied by women and fed three meals a day. In ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', Kirk is briefly seen attending an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting.

==Legs and Louie==
'''Legs''', voiced by [[Karl Wiedergott]] (formerly voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]), and '''Louie''', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], are the two Springfield Mafia hitmen who accompany [[Fat Tony]] at all times. The two lack any real definitive characteristic and are almost always seen together. Legs has a dark blonde short haircut and raspy voice. Louie has a slight black afro and a more high-pitched, even squeaky tone. Castellaneta based the voice on actor [[Joe Pesci]], one of the several references to ''[[Goodfellas]]'' used in the episode &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Castellaneta, Dan (2009). Commentary for &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Louie says that tear gas is &quot;[his] one weakness,&quot; though this is likely an embellishment. Dan Castellaneta was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 2011 for the voice of Louie, [[Homer Simpson]], [[Barney Gumble]], and [[Krusty the Clown]] thanks to the episode [[Donnie Fatso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/nominations/2011/Outstanding%20Voice-Over%20Performance |title=Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for 2011 - Outstanding Voice-Over Performance |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leopold==
'''Leopold''', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], is Superintendent Chalmers' assistant. He is a large, surly, snarling man that frequently speaks through clenched teeth, and is one of the few characters on ''The Simpsons'' to have [[eyebrow]]s. When Principal Skinner has to be temporarily replaced, Leopold stomps in, issues several threats, and terrifies the children by making them think he is the replacement, and then suddenly politely introduces the actual substitute, [[Ned Flanders]]. The children then collectively sigh with relief. The gag was repeated when [[Marge Simpson]] becomes a substitute teacher in the episode &quot;[[The PTA Disbands]]&quot;. Leopold often refers to the children of Springfield Elementary as &quot;little freaks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F18.html |title=[1F18] Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song |accessdate=2008-03-01 |last=Cherry |first=James A. |date=1996-07-21 |work=Episode transcript |publisher=The Simpsons Archive (snpp.com) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F19.html |title=[2F19] The PTA Disbands |accessdate=2008-03-01 |last=Cherry |first=James A. |date=1997-02-22 |work=Episode transcript |publisher=The Simpsons Archive (snpp.com) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lewis==
'''Lewis''' is an [[African American]] character, and student at [[Springfield Elementary School]] in Bart's class. He can be seen playing the bassoon in the opening sequence of the show. Although one of the most minor characters in the show, Lewis appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and occasionally speaks. He is usually seen with Richard. While Lewis has never had significant dialogue, he has been voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Jo Ann Harris]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Tress MacNeille]], and [[Russi Taylor]] throughout the series. Lewis's seeming insignificance to the show is underscored in the episode &quot;[[Das Bus]]&quot;, in which Bart mistakenly calls him &quot;Wendell&quot;.

==Lindsey Naegle==
'''Lindsey Naegle''' is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple87&quot;/&gt; and first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] episode &quot;[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naegle&quot;&gt;McCann, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In that episode, she had no name and was known only as &quot;The Generic Female TV Executive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond, p&quot;/&gt; She appeared again in &quot;[[Girly Edition]]&quot;, also as a generic female TV executive (only her hair and facial features differed from her first appearance).&lt;ref&gt;Gimple, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[They Saved Lisa's Brain]]&quot;, she was introduced as &quot;Lindsey Naegle&quot;, a member of the Springfield Chapter of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and has since become a recurring character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naegle&quot;/&gt; The writers modeled Naegle on a number of network executives that they have encountered while working on the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poochie&quot;&gt;Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for &quot;[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The character gets her last name from [[Hollywood]] [[talent agent]] Sue Naegle, president of [[HBO|HBO Entertainment]] and wife of ''Simpsons'' writer [[Dana Gould]].&lt;ref name=Selman&gt;Selman, Matt (2007).

[[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]], author of the book ''[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation|Planet Simpson]]'', called Naegle &quot;an excellent allegory for the modern corporate age: you don't see through her because there's nothing else to see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Her political allegiances are not concrete: In &quot;[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]],&quot; she is shown at the Republican Party headquarters; in &quot;[[E Pluribus Wiggum]],&quot; Naegle is conversely depicted as a Democrat.

==Lois Pennycandy==
'''Lois Pennycandy''' is the executive assistant to [[Krusty the Clown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Like&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Like Father, Like Clown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She swayed Krusty into visiting Bart after he saved Krusty from jail time,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Krusty Gets Busted]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and later reunited him with his estranged father the [[Rabbi]] [[#Rabbi Hyman Krustofski|Hyman Krustofski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Like&quot;/&gt; She was at Krusty's side during the auditions in which [[Sideshow Bob|Robert Terwilliger]] became Krusty's new sidekick,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Brother from Another Series]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and was at Krusty's &quot;funeral&quot; when he was presumed dead after crashing his private plane into a cliff.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Bart the Fink]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In a phone conversation, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] once asked her, &quot;How can [Krusty] hurt someone who loves him so?&quot; While looking at a framed photo of Krusty, Pennycandy replied, &quot;Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I've wasted my womanhood asking that same question.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Like&quot;/&gt;  Her only speaking roles are in &quot;[[Like Father, Like Clown]]&quot; and &quot;[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]&quot;, in which she was voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]].

==Luann Van Houten==
'''Luann Van Houten''' is voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]]. When Roswell left the show in 1998, she became a primarily nonspeaking character. However, Roswell returned in 2002. Since the season 8 episode, &quot;[[A Milhouse Divided]]&quot;, Luann was depicted as a promiscuous, single mother, who stuck her successful love life in her ex-husband, Kirk's face. She first appeared in &quot;[[Homer Defined]]&quot;. She wears glasses, a trait that she shares with her husband and son. Luann Van Houten's mother is [[Italians|Italian]]. She was born in [[Shelbyville, NT|Shelbyville]], and moved to Springfield in early life. It is stated in &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot; that she has a sister.

Luann was married to Kirk for several years, giving birth to a son, [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]], yet the marriage was an unhappy one. After an argument over a game of [[Pictionary]], she leaves Kirk after he remarks he can't draw &quot;dignity&quot;, since he gave it up when he married her. Although Kirk found the new liberty of a single life tough, Luann uses her newfound freedom to live life on the fast lane. Luann began dating [[American Gladiators|American Gladiator]] Pyro shortly after her divorce with Kirk for several seasons, but was caught cheating on him with his best friend, Gyro. In [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]]'s bachelor years, she had been one of his bachelorettes. In &quot;[[Milhouse of Sand and Fog]]&quot;, it is revealed that Luann had also gone out with Disco Stu as well and had begun a relationship with [[#Sea Captain|Sea Captain]].

In &quot;[[Milhouse of Sand and Fog]]&quot; the Van Houtens reunited. Since then, they are often seen together (although in the episode &quot;[[Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair)]]&quot;, Kirk was seen with Milhouse at a single father's outing, showing he and Luann were still not married). As of &quot;[[Little Orphan Millie]]&quot;, they are remarried.

==Luigi Risotto==
'''Luigi Risotto''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple86&quot;&gt;Gimple, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; is the proprietor of Luigi's, a Springfield [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurant. He is a parody of the &quot;Italian pasta/pizza chef&quot; [[stereotype]] (and in fact is on a bowling team called &quot;The Stereotypes&quot; along with [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[#Sea Captain|Captain Horatio McCallister]], and [[Groundskeeper Willie]]), but seems to be aware of his status as a [[stock character]]. He is polite to his customers and treats them with respect when they order and then loudly insults and belittles them to his cook Salvatore, apparently unaware that they can hear him from the kitchen. In the episode &quot;[[The Last of the Red Hat Mamas]],&quot; he reveals that he does not speak Italian. It is hinted that Luigi is an illegal immigrant, even though he tried to run for mayor, telling Springfielders, &quot;I make-a you the good government, just how-a you like it!&quot; The animators copied Luigi's appearance from a chef that was on the front of a pizza box.&lt;ref&gt;Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lunchlady Doris==
'''Lunchlady Doris Freedman''', voiced by [[Doris Grau]] up until her death, and now voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]],  is a sardonic chef for Springfield Elementary. She can frequently be seen serving deeply unpleasant meals, such as animal genitalia and ground up gym mats, because of the school budget cutbacks.  She has also made a handful of appearances acting as a school nurse, apparently due to budget cutbacks.

After Grau's death in 1995, Lunchlady Doris was retired out of respect for over 10 years. Due to the delay between recording some episodes and the time they actually air, Grau's voice was included in episodes airing as late as 1997 such as &quot;[[Lisa's Sax]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snpp.com/guides/doris.html |title=The Simpsons Archive: The Lunchlady Doris File |publisher=Snpp.com |date=2005-08-28 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lunchlady Doris is seen as a silent background character until she speaks in the 18th season during &quot;[[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer]]&quot;, where she is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]], season 19's &quot;[[The Debarted]]&quot;, where she is again voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] but with a different voice, and season 20's &quot;[[Father Knows Worst]]&quot;.

==Lurleen Lumpkin==
'''Lurleen Lumpkin''' (voiced by [[Beverly D'Angelo]]) is an aspiring country singer who is managed by Homer in &quot;[[Colonel Homer]]&quot;. Homer discovers her in a [[redneck]] bar in the middle of nowhere and is amazed by her voice. He decides to help her launch a singing career, much to the chagrin of Marge. Grateful for Homer's help, Lurleen becomes attracted to him and tries to lure him with an erotic song called &quot;Bunk with Me Tonight&quot;. Homer, who had been ignorant of this, suddenly realizes that managing Lurleen could hurt his marriage, so he quits as her manager. A saddened Lurleen sings a song called &quot;Stand By Your Manager&quot;.

Lurleen's next appearance is in &quot;[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]&quot;, in which she is briefly seen in the center square of ''[[Hollywood Squares|Springfield Squares]]''. In an earlier episode, &quot;[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]&quot;, a much rougher-looking Lurleen, voiced by [[Doris Grau]], makes a brief appearance, in which it is revealed that she had been to the [[Betty Ford Center|Betty Ford Clinic]] and &quot;spent last night in a ditch&quot;. In this episode her voice sounds exactly the same as [[Lunchlady Doris]]'s, rather than her soft, Southern voice she had when she was first introduced.

The nineteenth season episode  &quot;[[Papa Don't Leech]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/808/808965p1.html IGN TV] ''tv.ign.com''. Retrieved July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; follows up on her story with her moving into the Simpsons' home and taking a waitress job at Moe's in order to pay a $12 million tax bill. It is revealed she has a father named Royce [[Boss Hogg]] Lumpkin, who was never much supportive of her and had been missing for years. Marge undertakes efforts to find him and reunite him with Lurleen. As soon as it happens, Lurleen writes a new, upbeat composition called &quot;Daddy's Back&quot;, but Royce sells the song, taking the writing credits for himself (but altering some lyrics), to the [[Dixie Chicks]]. As soon as she learns of this, Lurleen confronts Royce and reveals the truth to the Dixie Chicks, who assault him with their musical instruments and invite Lurleen to join their tour. Lurleen ends up engaged to a man who looks very much like Homer (like her previous husbands did) and tours as an opening act for the Dixie Chicks.

==Dr. Marvin Monroe==
'''Dr. Marvin Monroe''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] who first appeared in the first season episode &quot;[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]&quot;. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] pawns the family television in order to afford a session with Monroe for him and his [[dysfunctional family]]. The failed attempt at therapy culminates with the Simpsons [[electroconvulsive therapy|electroshocking]] each other endlessly, to the point of causing a blackout. Unable to help the Simpsons, Monroe refunds double what the Simpsons paid, and the Simpsons buy a new TV.

Monroe appears in &quot;[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]&quot; in which 70% of that episode's original animation had to be redone, although the scenes involving Monroe were mostly untouched, said co-director [[David Silverman]].&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, David (2001). Commentary for &quot;[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The script of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; describes Monroe as &quot;a heavy, [[chain-smoking]], compulsive eater.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Script for &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea behind the character, said [[Matt Groening]], was that he was born [[Marilyn Monroe]] and was &quot;very caught up over that&quot;, which is why he became a therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe's voice is based on psychiatrist [[David Viscott]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot;[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Monroe's works is ''Dr. Marvin Monroe's Guide to Etiquette'', which Bart receives as a birthday gift in &quot;[[Radio Bart]]&quot;.

Since the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]], the character Monroe has been retired. This is because voicing the character strained [[Harry Shearer]]'s throat and, eventually, the voice became too annoying for Groening, which, he acknowledges, is the point.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror II]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The character's retirement was marked by the broadcast of a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital over [[#Eddie and Lou|Lou]]'s walkie-talkie in [[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)|&quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, Part Two]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several references to Monroe being dead have been made: a glimpse of his gravestone in &quot;[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily|Alone Again, Natura-diddily]]&quot;, a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Gymnasium seen in &quot;[[Bye Bye Nerdie]]&quot;, and an interstitial in the &quot;[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|138th Episode Spectacular]]&quot;. However, Monroe is seen alive in the [[The Simpsons (season 15)|fifteenth season]] in &quot;[[Diatribe of a Mad Housewife]]&quot; to purchase a copy of Marge's novel &quot;The Harpooned Heart&quot;, stating simply that he has &quot;...been very sick&quot; when asked about his absence by Marge.

==Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon==
'''Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon''' is the wife of [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]] and the mother of their eight children. She first appeared as a little girl in Apu's flashback in the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]] episode &quot;[[Much Apu About Nothing]]&quot;, in which Apu tells her that he is sorry that their [[arranged marriage]] will not happen, before getting on a plane departing for the U.S. to pursue the [[American Dream]]. Her first adult appearance is in the [[The Simpsons (season 9)|ninth season]] episode [[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Manjula&quot;&gt;Cohen, David (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[Much Apu About Nothing]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that ''Fried Green Tomatoes'' is her favorite [[Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe|book]], [[Fried Green Tomatoes (film)|movie]], and [[fried green tomatoes (food)|food]]. She has excellent culinary skills, demonstrated by her ability to make a wide variety of dishes using only chickpeas, lentils, and sometimes rice. She is also one of Marge's best and only friends, and they often walk their babies together.

In &quot;[[The Sweetest Apu]]&quot;, Apu has an affair with the [[List of products in The Simpsons#Squishee|Squishee]] lady. After Homer discovers this, he and Marge confront Apu, who caves under the guilt and vows to apologize to Manjula, who sets him a number of grueling tasks in penance.&lt;ref name=Manjula&gt;{{cite video|people=Cohen, David|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD Video Collector's Edition commentary for the episode &quot;Much Apu About Nothing&quot;|medium=DVD|publisher=Twentieth Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Richard Appel]] had pitched the idea of Apu marrying years before he wrote &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot; for season nine.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Richard (2006). Commentary for &quot;[[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; For that episode, it took several attempts by the character designers to model Manjula because making women look appealing in [[Matt Groening]]'s drawing style is hard for the animators to do.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Steven Dean (2006). Commentary for &quot;[[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, Mark (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Colonel Homer]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[David X. Cohen|David Cohen]] named Manjula after a friend of much of the staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manjula&quot;/&gt; Manjula was voiced by former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Jan Hooks]] from seasons 9 to 14,&lt;ref&gt;Gimple, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and also by [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Maggie Roswell]].

==Martha Prince==
'''Martha Prince''', voiced by [[Russi Taylor]], is the wife of Martin Prince Sr. and mother of [[Martin Prince]]. Martha is probably best known for attempting to sell Martin's extremely valuable [[Star Wars]] merchandise to Comic Book Guy for an extremely cheap price. She was warned by Bart and Milhouse before she sold them and decided to not to sell them. It was also hinted by Martin that she shoplifts a lot, &quot;stuff she doesn't even need&quot;. She also was responsible for all of the guest getting sick at Martin's birthday party, by serving diseased oysters instead of cake, with the exception of Bart, Lisa, Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel.

==Martha Quimby==
'''Martha Quimby''' is the wife of the Mayor of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Joe Quimby|Joseph Quimby]]. She wears a pink outfit and a pillbox hat similar to the outfit worn by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy]] on the day of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]]. According to Mayor Quimby, the couple met while Martha was working at the &quot;[[Bart After Dark|Maison DerriÃ¨re]]&quot;, a local [[American burlesque|burlesque house]]. She first appeared in &quot;[[Bart Gets Famous]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond, p. 215&quot;&gt;Richmond, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; when she walks in on Mayor Quimby in bed with another woman, an event she laughs off when he defends himself with &quot;I didn't do it.&quot; She is humiliated when Marge accidentally uncovers her husband's lothario ways in &quot;[[The Last of the Red Hat Mamas]]&quot; and kicks Marge and her friends out before they can have tea. Martha Quimby is voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]].

==Martin Prince Sr.==
'''Martin Prince Sr.''' is the father of [[Martin Prince]], and husband of Martha Prince. He is a [[stock broker]] in Springfield and was shown bringing his son to work on &quot;Go To Work With Your Parents Day&quot;, where Martin made over $1 million trading soy futures (and subsequently lost all but $600). He appears to be a nerd much like his son, seeing as he has somewhat of a lisp. Martin Sr. was also one of the fathers that went in Ned Flanders's RV, to find their sons in Shelbyville. He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].

==Mary Bailey==
'''Mary Bailey''' is the governor of [[Springfield's state]]. She is voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;/&gt; She ran against Mr. Burns in &quot;[[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish]]&quot;, winning in a landslide after Mr. Burns spit out a piece of baked [[Three-eyed fish|Three eyed Fish]] during a photo-op at the Simpsons' home. Mary Bailey would later appear briefly in the episode &quot;[[Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade]]&quot; when Bart and Lisa's class visit [[List of fictional locations in The Simpsons#Capital City|Capital City]]. They show Bailey their class projects (designing a new state flag). Mary Bailey wails in disgust after unfurling Lisa's flag. Bart had redesigned it to look like a butt with &quot;Learn to Fart&quot; underneath. She also appears in &quot;[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]]&quot; where a prison is built out of a defunct concert hall. She decides to release all the abused prisoners to a garbage barge where they would &quot;bare-knuckle box until one of you emerges as king of your floating hell.&quot; She looks nearly identical to Bea Simmons, Abe Simpson's former girlfriend in the episode [[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]].

==Maude Flanders==
'''Maude Flanders''', voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]] and temporarily by [[Marcia Mitzman Gaven]] between 1999 and 2000 when Roswell did not work for the show, was the wife of [[Ned Flanders]], and is the deceased mother of Rod and Todd. While she was not employed outside the home, Maude was a busy homemaker and a tireless advocate for the children, whose innocence is so often sullied by the &quot;evils&quot; of cartoon violence, liberal education, and the insidious influences of [[popular culture]]. Even though she spent much of her free time in prayer and reading the Bible and helping out her husband at the [[List of fictional locations in The Simpsons#The Leftorium|Leftorium]], Maude was known to let her hair down for the occasional dinner party at the home of her neighbors, [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]]. Homer often made statements insinuating his attraction to Maude, thereby literally [[Ten Commandments|coveting his neighbor's wife]]. Also, in the second season episode &quot;[[The War of the Simpsons]]&quot;, Homer ogled at Maude's very low-cut dress at a dinner party, which resulted in him and Marge going to marriage camp.

In the season eleven episode &quot;[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]&quot;, Maude was killed by a t-shirt cannon at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] Speedway when [[Homer]] ducked at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seifert |first=Andy|title=Indiana Man says no to the White Sox T-shirt cannons |url=http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/indiana-man-says-no-to-the-white-sox-tshirt-cannon,26920/|work=[[The A.V.

Her [[death]] crushed Ned who, though used to some measure of hardship, assumed that they would always be together. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving ''The Simpsons'' in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], which airs the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;TC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Voice Of 'Maude' Disputes Report|newspaper=[[The Columbian]]|date=2000-02-05|page=E6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cartwright&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= [[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]|last= Cartwright|first= Nancy|authorlink= Nancy Cartwright|chapter=Lady, that ain't no gutterball!|page=96|year= 2000|publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7868-8600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice actress [[Marcia Mitzman Gaven]] was hired to fill in for Roswell's characters,&lt;ref name=&quot;watrerloomarcia&quot;/&gt; including Maude in &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot; and the earlier episodes of the eleventh season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will corporate greed kill Maude of 'Simpsons'?|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=2000-02-07|page=D8}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the producers decided to kill the character off to open up new storylines for the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;watrerloomarcia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Maude Flanders will likely leave Simpsons|newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record{{!}}The Record]]|date=2000-02-05|page=F04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roswell returned to ''The Simpsons'' in 2002&lt;ref name=&quot;Basile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title=There's a New Maude in Town|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/maggieroswell/a/roswellreturn.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home in Denver.&lt;ref name=&quot;2003Husted&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Husted|first=Bill|title=Maggie's back |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date=2003-06-01|page=F-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Husted2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Husted|first=Bill|title=She's wanted dead or alive by folks on 'Simpsons'|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maude's ghost appears in the opening sequence for &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]&quot;, and during the credits of &quot;[[Bart Has Two Mommies]]&quot; she is seen in heaven with [[Bob Hope]] and God, wondering how her boys are doing.  Maude appeared through flashbacks in &quot;[[Dangerous Curves (The Simpsons)|Dangerous Curves]]&quot;, &quot;[[Take My Life, Please]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Postcards from the Wedge]]&quot;.  Maude also appears in &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror XXII]]&quot; as the devil's wife.

==Ms. Albright==
'''Ms. Albright''' is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond179&quot;&gt;Richmond, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; She is the First Church of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] Sunday school teacher. She speaks with a soft [[Southern American English|Southern accent]]. She appears to be good friends with [[#Helen Lovejoy|Helen Lovejoy]]. She is occasionally seen in the background of various episodes as well as in church scenes (such as in &quot;[[The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star]]&quot;).

==Miss Springfield==
'''Miss Springfield''' (voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]]) is a [[Beauty contest|beauty pageant]] winner, who first appears in &quot;[[Whacking Day]]&quot;. She is the lover of [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby]], and is seen several times in bed with him. She only appears with the sash and the crown of Miss Springfield.

In &quot;[[Mayored to the Mob]]&quot;, she is one of two women escorting Mayor Quimby to a convention. Since then, she is often seen escorting him to Springfield events such as conventions, recitals, and plays. In one episode, it is revealed she is illiterate. Quimby scolds her for lying about her graduating from &quot;typing school&quot;. She then admits she has trouble with the [[space bar]]. In &quot;[[Smoke on the Daughter]]&quot;, she appears (and claims to be) pregnant, and Quimby believes he may be the father.

==Mr. Costington==
'''Mr. Costington''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann116&quot;/&gt; is the president of Costington's Department Store. He first appeared as &quot;Chairman&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gimple, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]] episode &quot;[[Trash of the Titans]]&quot;, in which he invented &quot;Love Day&quot;, and later in &quot;[[Homer vs. Dignity]]&quot;. He is one of very few characters on the show who has eyebrows. Costington's catchphrase is &quot;You're fiiired!&quot;, delivered while shaking his jowls. In &quot;[[The Boys of Bummer]]&quot;, he hires Homer with a jowl-shaking &quot;You're hiiired!&quot; Homer has worked for him on three occasions: as a Thanksgiving Day Parade [[Santa Claus]], mattress salesman, and model for top-brand jeans. He also employs the [[#Yes Guy|Yes Guy]], who is seen working at the store in most of his appearances.

==Mr. Teeny==
'''Louis âMr. Teenyâ Toot''', also known as '''Joseph Teeny''' and voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], is Krustyâs trained chimpanzee who frequently appears on the show. He first appeared in &quot;[[Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge]]&quot;. Like Krusty, he is a heavy smoker, and often seems depressed off-stage. He is sometimes seen as Krustyâs driver and butler. Teenyâs uncle was former head monkey at the ministry of tourism in Brazil. Three other monkeys have died while working for Krusty known by the same name. Krusty once said he missed the third Mr. Teeny and the current one couldnât hold a candle to him. His motherâs name is Toot-Toot, and she refers to him as Louis when they are reunited in &quot;[[Bart Has Two Mommies]]&quot;. Teeny also was a writer for the âGood Guy Awardsâ and quit after being insulted on-stage by Krusty. He is an immigrant from Brazil and has been deported but was returned. He wears a pink hat and bow tie but has also been seen in a tuxedo and golden encrusted thong. Krusty has implied that if he can not find a human willing to donate a lung when he gets cancer, he is planning on harvesting one from Mr. Teeny. As of &quot;[[Wedding For Disaster]]&quot;, there have been seven Mr. Teenys.

==Mrs. Muntz==
'''Mrs. Muntz''', voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple87&quot;/&gt; She is [[Nelson Muntz]]'s mother. Nelson receives his trademark laugh from her. Early on in the series, Nelson would often mention his parents, and it was often implied that Nelson's mother does not care for him. In &quot;[[A Milhouse Divided]]&quot;, Nelson tells [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] that his mom is addicted to [[throat lozenge|cough drop]]s, which is why his father left the family.
Mrs. Muntz works at Hooters in &quot;[[Bart Star]]&quot;, but was fired in a later episode for gaining weight. She owns a dilapidated house and is depicted as a jailbird, a prostitute, a stripper, or something similar.

In &quot;[['Tis the Fifteenth Season]]&quot;, she appears, telling Nelson that his father simply did not like him, and he left with her golden tooth. Nelson's mother was fully introduced in &quot;[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]&quot;, after years of being mentioned. A loud, high-pitched contemptuous woman, she neglects Nelson. She implies she misses Nelson's father. At the end of the episode, the three Muntzes reunite, and she receives a new job as Lady Macbeth, with &quot;the third director she slept with&quot;. Since then, she is often seen around in Springfield. Curiously, in [[The Simpsons (season 18)|Season 18]]'s &quot;[[The Haw-Hawed Couple]]&quot;, she appears with [[brown hair]]. As revealed in &quot;[[Dial 'N' for Nerder]]&quot;, Nelson even refers to her as Mrs. Muntz.

==Old Barber==
'''Jake the Barber'''&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann86&quot;&gt;McCann, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; originated in one of the [[The Simpsons shorts|Tracey Ullman shorts]], &quot;Bart's Haircut&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, David (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Homer Defined]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox&lt;/ref&gt; In the short, he cuts Bart's hair not to his liking and Bart tries several ways to hide it. [[Dan Castellaneta]], voiced the Old Barber in that short and in subsequent episodes in the series, based the voice on comedian [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;Castellaneta, Dan (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Homer Defined]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Barber made his last appearance in the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode &quot;[[Lisa the Tree Hugger]]&quot;. He was voiced by [[Harry Shearer]] in that episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann87&quot;&gt;McCann, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Silverman]] had to create a [[model sheet]] of the Old Barber for [[Jim Reardon]], who directed &quot;22 Short Films about Springfield.&quot; Before then, there was no model sheet for the character.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Jewish Man==
'''Asa''', a.k.a. '''Old Jewish Man''', or '''Crazy Old Man''' (according to &quot;[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]&quot;) is [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham Simpson]] and [[Jasper Beardly]]'s friend. Mayor Quimby once referred to him as &quot;Old Jewish Man&quot;; also, a list of heart recipients in &quot;[[Homer's Paternity Coot]]&quot; listed him as &quot;Old Jewish Man&quot;. He speaks with a stereotypical Jewish-American accent (voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]), and curses in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] in one episode. He is apparently friendly with [[Krusty the Clown]] and Krusty's father, according to &quot;[[Simpsons Christmas Stories]]&quot;. He is often seen yelling at people, and as seen in &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror VI#Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores|Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores]]&quot;, owns a store called Zip Boys, a parody of [[Pep Boys]]. He once had a brief period of stardom after his act of dancing on a street corner singing &quot;[[The Old Gray Mare]]&quot; with his pants down became a hit on television. In &quot;[[Natural Born Kissers]]&quot;, it was revealed that he worked as a studio executive during the making of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and suppressed an alternate ending to the film. He was also responsible for a &quot;Killing Spree Ending&quot; to ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. He observes that the quality of studio management has changed over the years. In &quot;[[Love Is a Many Strangled Thing]]&quot; he dies by dancing too hard, although his ghost continues dancing. He reappears in &quot;[[Replaceable You]]&quot; alive.

== Opal ==
'''Opal''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) is a talk show host. This celebrity is based on ''[[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]]'', as is her show. She first appears in &quot;[[Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair)]]&quot; where her segment on successful women depresses Marge, who feels her life of chores and child-raising has left her without any purpose. She later appeared in the back-to-back [[The Simpsons (season 19)|nineteenth season]] episodes &quot;[[Husbands and Knives]]&quot; and &quot;[[Funeral for a Fiend]]&quot;. Marge is a fan of hers, and was interviewed by Opal after achieving success through her chain of ''Shapes'' gyms for women.

==Patches and Poor Violet==
'''Patches and Poor Violet''' are two of Springfield's orphans, voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]] and [[Tress MacNeille]], respectively. Introduced in â[[Miracle on Evergreen Terrace]],â Patches gives the [[United States dollar|dollar]] they were saving to Bart, which was their vitamin money. They have since had cameos in â[[I'm Goin' to Praiseland]]â and â[[Simple Simpson]],â but are seen in many other episodes. Poor Violet often has a cough, while Patches seems to vaguely resemble [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] from [[Charles Dickens]]â ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. Their skin color is not the âhealthyâ yellow of the Simpson family, but rather a more sallow, sickly tone.

==Plopper==
{{Redirect3|Spider-Pig|For the variation of Spider-Man who happens to be a pig, see [[Spider-Ham]]. For the song of the same name, see [[The Simpsons Movie: The Music]]}}
'''Plopper''', also known as '''Spider-Pig''' and later renamed to '''Harry Plopper''' (a play on the popular fictional character [[Harry Potter]]), is a pig who first appears in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. Plopper has since become memetic, gaining immense popularity in the real world and on the internet, especially his theme song &quot;Spider-Pig&quot;, which peaked at number 23 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=33298 |title=Hans Zimmer - Spider Pig |publisher=Chart Stats |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pig is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]. Plopper has also made appearances in the episodes and comics, and also appears in the reanimated opening sequence, featuring in the pan across Springfield.

Plopper's first appearance is in the movie, where he stars in a TV ad to promote Krusty's new burger, The Clogger. After the filming is completed, Krusty orders the pig to be killed. Homer becomes upset about this, and immediately adopts him. Since Homer does not spend time with Bart, because he's always seen with Plopper, Bart goes fishing with Ned Flanders. Homer then spends a lot of time with Plopper and neglects Bart. Later in the movie, Homer is seen making the pig walk on the ceiling whilst singing &quot;[[Spider Pig (song)|Spider Pig]]&quot;, a parody of the [[Spider-Man theme song]]. Homer later calls him Harry Plopper, and the pig is seen with glasses and a lightning bolt-shaped scar, based on the character [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]].

At one point in the movie, the Simpsons' house is completely destroyed after being sucked into a [[sinkhole]] in their backyard.  This may lead to the assumption that the pig is killed in the movie or could've run off to the [[Springfield Retirement Castle]]. But at one point Bart's dog survives without the family and tells Bart &quot;I did what no other dog could do&quot; which possibly implies that the dog ate the pig to survive. However, during the 2007 San Diego Comic Convention, an official Simpsons Panel revealed that there was a scene at the end of the movie involving the pig that was cut which later appeared on the DVD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/808/808965p1.html IGN: SDCC 07: The Simpsons Panel]&lt;/ref&gt; This removed sequence is a slightly alternate ending of the movie when the townspeople are rebuilding the Simpsons' house and involves Plopper, the Multi-Eyed Creature, and Santa's Little Helper painting a dog house. During the following TV seasons, Plopper makes a few more appearances.

== Poochie ==
When [[television network|network]] [[executive officer|executives]] decided that ''The Itchy and Scratchy Show'' needed an &quot;update&quot; to keep the interest of its audience, they devised Poochie, a cartoon dog &quot;with an attitude.&quot; After widespread auditions, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] was chosen to [[voice actor|provide Poochie's voice]]. The character debuted to an unimpressed audience following a massive [[advertising campaign|publicity campaign]]; he only served to interfere with the well-oiled machine of hyperviolent [[slapstick]] that Itchy and Scratchy had perfected over the years. When dissatisfied viewers flooded the network with letters crying for Poochie's immediate removal, if not death, the executives quickly decided to get rid of the character. Homer begged for another chance, insisting that Poochie would grow on the audience; this argument held little weight until the actress who performed voices for both Itchy and Scratchy declared her support for Poochie as well. Homer was shocked, however, when the next cartoon aired: it contained a hastily-animated, [[retroscript]]ed segment stating that Poochie had decided to return to his &quot;home planet,&quot; and that he died when his [[spacecraft|spaceship]] crashed.

He has since been seen once in a cameo at a funeral in an ''Itchy &amp; Scratchy'' cartoon featured in [[Little Big Mom]]. Also in &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror IX]],&quot; he skateboards in the road and gets run over by Scratchy driving a car. However he survives only to have his skateboard falling form the sky and hitting him in the head. He also continues to be released in Itchy &amp; Scratchy related merchandise such as on t-shirts in &quot;[[Fat Man and Little Boy]]&quot;. A matrix Poochie also appears in [[Kill Gil Vols. 1 &amp; 2]] during the Krusty on ice show and a Poochie balloon appears in the cartoon in &quot;[[Funeral for a Fiend]]&quot;.

Poochie reappears in [[The Simpsons Game]] as a boss on the ''Grand Theft Scratchy'' level.

==Princess Kashmir==
'''Princess Kashmir''' is the [[belly dance]]r who first appears in &quot;[[Homer's Night Out]]&quot; (and was the first woman who almost ruined Homer's marriage to Marge as Marge saw Homer dancing with her as a bad example for Bart in how to treat women). She dated Apu in &quot;[[Lisa's Pony]],&quot; dated Apu's brother Sanjay on a few occasions, and is seen dancing with Chief Wiggum in the episode &quot;[[Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment]]&quot; (which also shocked and offended the women in town, much like what happened with Homer). She has also appeared in two [[couch gag]]s (the one on &quot;Marge vs. The Monorail, in which the Simpsons sit on the couch, followed by three rows of recurring extras and secondary characters, and the ''Sgt. Pepper'' album parody on &quot;Bart After Dark&quot; and the original airing of &quot;The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochy Show&quot;), and is seen dancing on the stage in the Maison DerriÃ¨re in the episode &quot;[[Bart After Dark]]&quot;. Her nickname is 'Queen of the Mysterious East'. Her real name is Shauna Tifton, and also goes by April Flowers when performing in strip clubs. According to the DVD commentary for the season eight episode &quot;Bart After Dark,&quot; Princess Kashmir was originally going to be an actual bachelor party stripper on her premiere episode, but the FOX censors at the time objected (though they had no problem letting Princess Kashmir tell Bart that she works under the name &quot;April Flowers&quot; when she performs at strip clubs).

==Principal Dondelinger==
'''Harlan Dondelinger''', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]] was Springfield High School's principal, first seen in the episode &quot;[[The Way We Was]]&quot;, a flashback to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s senior year in high school. He later appeared in the episode &quot;[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]&quot; at Homer and Marge's high school reunion and teaches night classes to ease the pain of his wife's recent death. He appeared in &quot;[[Half-Decent Proposal]]&quot; when [[#Artie Ziff|Artie Ziff]], Marge's high school prom date, recreated their prom. Dondelinger made his most recent appearance in the [[The Simpsons (season 20)|twentieth season]] episode &quot;[[Take My Life, Please]]&quot;.

==Rabbi Hyman Krustofski==
'''Hyman Krustofski''' is the father of [[Krusty the Clown]]. He first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] episode &quot;[[Like Father, Like Clown]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In this episode, in [[The Simpsons (season 15)|season fifteen]]'s &quot;[[Today I Am a Clown]]&quot;, and [[The Simpsons (season 21)|season twenty-one]]'s &quot;[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]]&quot; he is voiced by comedian [[Jackie Mason]] (because in the three episodes, he was a major character, while in cameo speaking appearances, he is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]).

In &quot;[[Like Father, Like Clown]]&quot;, Rabbi Krustofski had been estranged from his son for twenty-five years. He disowned Krusty when the young man chose to become a clown when Krustofski had wanted him to follow the family tradition of becoming a rabbi. Years later, after much exchanging of [[Talmud]] passages between Bart Simpson and Rabbi Krustofski, Bart read the Rabbi a quote from [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] admiring the Jews, which finally convinced Rabbi Krustofski to accept his son for his career in entertainment. He and Krusty reunited on the air of Krusty's show. The episode is a parody of the film ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]''. The parody was writer [[Jay Kogen]]'s idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Wolodarsky, Wallace|title=The Simpsons The Complete Third Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot;[[Like Father, Like Clown]]&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought it would be a funny parallelâand a chance to do a lot of easy jokesâif it were a clown instead of a singer who gets rejected by his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Kogen, Jay|title=The Simpsons The Complete Third Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot;[[Like Father, Like Clown]]&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's casting was fitting in that the real-life Mason, like Krusty, also came from a family of rabbis but rejected his destiny in order to become a comedian.

Jackie Mason won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] for his performance as Krustofsky in &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Briefingâ'Simpsons' score big in Prime-Time Emmys|date=1992-08-03|accessdate=2008-11-18|page=L20|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Daily News|Daily News of Los Angeles]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]'' named Mason one of the show's 20 best guest stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/RecRoom/7123-Simpsons-20-best-guest-voices-of-all-time/|title=The Simpsons 20 best guest voices of all time|date=2006-03-29|accessdate=2008-11-18|publisher=The Phoenix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rachel Jordan ==
'''Rachel Jordan''' (voiced by [[Shawn Colvin]]) is the lead singer of Kovenant, a fictional Christian rock band. She is first seen in &quot;[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]&quot;, when she befriends [[Ned Flanders]] after [[Maud Flanders|Maude]]âs death. She appears towards the end of the episode singing the song &quot;''He's the Man''&quot; while the organist at the church was on a much needed vacation. The song was featured on ''[[The Simpsons: Testify]]''.  She returns in &quot;[[I'm Goin' to Praiseland]]&quot;.  She stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after Ned attempted to mold her in the image of his deceased wife Maude only to have her think Ned is using her and runs off. At the end of the episode, she returns and has a date with Flanders. She has not made an appearance since.

== Radioactive Man ==
'''Radioactive Man''' is a fictional [[comic book]] [[superhero]]. The character was heavily featured in the episodes &quot;[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]&quot; and &quot;[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackey&quot;/&gt; Within the ''Simpsons'' universe, he was created by Morty Mann. He has been portrayed in many media since his debut in ''Interesting Stories'' #27.&lt;ref name=&quot;moms&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Moms I'd Like to Forget]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of ''Radioactive Man'' appeared in 1952. He was featured in at least one 1950s era black-and-white serial, sponsored by Laramie Cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in ''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a [[Camp (style)|camp]]y early 1970s television series resembling ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''. In one episode of ''The Simpsons'', a Hollywood studio attempted to film a Radioactive Man movie in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The movie starred [[Rainier Wolfcastle]] as Radioactive Man. The role of Fallout Boy, Radioactive Man's sidekick, was cast from local children and went to [[Milhouse Van Houten]]. The movie was never completed due to budget overruns caused by constant [[Price gouging|price-gouging]] by Springfield vendors, and Milhouse snapping from the pressure of the role, and refusing to continue to portray Fallout Boy.&lt;ref&gt;Season seven episode &quot;[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of ''The Simpsons'', the Radioactive Man character also appeared in a real comic book series based on him that was first published by [[Bongo Comics]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simpsons.ugo.com/?cur=radioactive-man-comic&amp;gallery=true|title=Radioactive Man|accessdate=2008-08-03|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bongo comics expanded more on the character, including his powers, giving him several which parodied those of [[Superman]] including super speed, flight, and the power to fire beams of &quot;[[Energy blasts|clean, nuclear heat]]&quot; from his eyes. The character has also appeared in issues of ''Simpsons Comics''&lt;ref name=&quot;ugo&quot;/&gt; and ''[[Simpsons Super Spectacular]]'', and in the 1992 video game ''[[Bartman Meets Radioactive Man]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackey|first=Bob|title=Retro Revival Retrospective: The Simpsons Part 6|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8991894|work=Retro Gaming Blog|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2010-08-03|date=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rainier Wolfcastle ==
'''Rainier [[Luftwaffe]] Wolfcastle''' (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]) is an action hero star and a close parody of actor/bodybuilder/politician [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name=star&gt;Jean, Al (2005). Commentary for &quot;[[A Star Is Burns]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; This basis has been drawn out over the series. Wolfcastle's wife is named Maria, just like the real Schwarzenegger's now separated wife [[Maria Shriver]]. Like Schwarzenegger, Wolfcastle is an active member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and owns a [[Hummer]]. In the episode &quot;[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]&quot;, [[Bart Simpson]] tells Wolfcastle that his &quot;last movie really sucked&quot; (Along with [[Chief Wiggum]]'s line of &quot;Magic Ticket, my ass, McBain!&quot;), alluding to Schwarzenegger's film ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', which was panned by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. Twentieth Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfcastle owns a restaurant named Planet Springfield, a parody of [[Planet Hollywood]], which Schwarzenegger co-owned with other celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title= Commentary for &quot;[[My Sister, My Sitter]]&quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfcastle has starred in many action movies, most notably the ''McBain'' series (a parody of action movies) and the movie of ''Radioactive Man''. Rainierâs more recent movies have gained less renown, and he is even forced to do comedies and even [[standup comedy]].  Wolfcastle has made cameo appearances as an [[Academy Award]] presenter, a celebrity spokesperson, and a celebrity judge. In a recall election of [[Mayor Quimby]], Wolfcastle ran for his seat.  He has a daughter named [[Greta Wolfcastle|Greta]] who had a crush on Bart in the episode &quot;[[The Bart Wants What It Wants]]&quot;.

The writers invented Wolfcastle as the action hero McBain for the episode &quot;[[Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?]]&quot;. Because they liked the scene involving the character from that episode, they used him again in &quot;[[The Way We Was]]&quot;, which was recorded and aired before &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; The ''McBain'' films satirize clichÃ©s of [[action films]].&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt; Martin, Jeff; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot;[[Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The character was originally named McBain, until an actual film called ''[[McBain (film)|McBain]]'' was released in 1991. That film's producers refused to allow the show to use the name, so &quot;Rainier Wolfcastle&quot; became the name of the actor playing the McBain role.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt; Brooks, James L.; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David (2002). Commentary for &quot;[[The Way We Was]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Castellaneta]], the voice of [[Homer Simpson]], doubles as Wolfcastle when Harry Shearer is absent from table reads.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

'''Colonel Antoine &quot;Tex&quot; O'Hara''', often referred to simply as the '''Rich Texan''', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple86&quot;/&gt; He is a stereotypical rich, callous but gregarious business owner. He is an active member of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and speaks with a heavy [[Texas]] drawl. His morality can wildly vary from episode to episode; he can sometimes be selfish and sadistic, and at other times polite and friendly. He is based on the Texan oil tycoon character from [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In the fifth season episode &quot;[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)|$pringfield]]&quot; (the Rich Texan's debut, though a similar character once appeared in the season two episode &quot;Old Money&quot;), Homer addresses the Rich Texan as [[United States Senate|Senator]], although this was never again referenced. Rich Texan sports a [[bolo tie]] and a white cowboy hat. He is also [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], as revealed in &quot;[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]&quot;. He has stated in &quot;[[Marge's Son Poisoning]]&quot; that he enjoys moonlit walks on the beach; in the same episode he held Homer and Moe at gunpoint while forcing them to walk along with him after being tricked by the two. He is well known for pulling out a pair of revolvers and firing them into the air while yelling &quot;Yee Haw!&quot; whenever he is happy or excited. He has a [[homosexuality|gay]] grandson, as revealed in &quot;[[Million Dollar Abie]]&quot; and a daughter named Paris Texan (who looks and acts like hotel heiress [[Paris Hilton]]). In the episode &quot;[[Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times]]&quot;, it is revealed that the Rich Texan is originally from [[Connecticut]], despite his brash, stereotypically Southern persona. This is a reference to [[George W. Bush]]'s Connecticut roots.

==Richard==
'''Richard''' is a gray-haired student at [[Springfield Elementary School]] and is one of Bart's good friends. He is first seen in &quot;[[Bart the Genius]]&quot;. He is usually seen with Lewis and has a leather jacket and a shirt with a small diamond embroidered on the center. Richard appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and in the early seasons was often involved with mischief. he's been voiced over the course of the series by [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Jo Ann Harris]], [[Pamela Hayden]], and [[Maggie Roswell]]. In early seasons he was commonly seen hanging out with [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], Lewis, and [[Milhouse]], but in recent years he is only seen in the classroom and in crowd scenes. He had a brief speaking part in &quot;[[The Haw-Hawed Couple]]&quot;, in which he was voiced by Pamela Hayden. His hair color changes from black to gray, to brown, and then to blue throughout the course of the show. However, in [[List of The Simpsons comics|Simpsons Comics]], his hair always appears gray.

==Rod Flanders==
'''Rod Flanders''' is voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]]. Rod is Ned Flanders' 10 year old son. Rod prays often; first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. He prays for God to watch over him and his younger brother, Todd, as well as for the success of his father's business. He also prays for all of the other children like his neighbor [[Bart Simpson]], who do not pray for themselves. Ned has described Rod's hobbies as including &quot;being quiet during trips, clapping with songs and [[diabetes]]&quot;. Rod's largest role was in &quot;[[Bart Has Two Mommies]]&quot;, where he obtains new climbing skills and rescues Bart from a chimpanzee atop a church. This episode also reveals that Rod thinks of [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] as the most fun he has had since [[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily|his mother died]]. In &quot;[['Tis the Fifteenth Season]],&quot; he mentions that he is &quot;jealous of girls 'cause they get to wear dresses,&quot; suggesting nascent [[transvestism]].

In a &quot;freeze-frame gag&quot; in the episode &quot;[[Homer Badman]]&quot;, Rod is stated to be the younger Flanders child.

==Ruth Powers==
'''Ruth Powers''' is [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]]' next-door neighbor, introduced when she moves to their neighborhood in the episode &quot;[[New Kid on the Block]]&quot;. She is divorced and has a daughter, [[Laura Powers]]. According to &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;, Ruth divorced her husband because his career got in the way with his family life, but in &quot;[[Marge on the Lam]]&quot;, Ruth tells Marge that all her husband ever did was &quot;eat, sleep, and drink beer&quot; and never gave her money for child support (which led to Ruth stealing her husband's convertible). She is usually seen as a background character, sometimes in events that occurred even before she moved next door (such as the baby shower for Maggie in &quot;[[And Maggie Makes Three]]&quot;). She even continues to be a background character despite her later imprisonment. She nearly always wears a red headscarf. In the episode &quot;[[The Cartridge Family]]&quot; she was part of the NRA. She was voiced by [[Pamela Reed]] in her first two speaking appearances. [[David Mirkin]] said that Pamela Reed would always give great performances and that he does not know why they did not use her more.&lt;ref&gt;Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[Marge on the Lam]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode &quot;[[Marge on the Lam]]&quot; features Ruth and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] going on the run from the law in a stolen convertible, a parody of ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]''. Ruth makes an appearance in the episode &quot;[[Strong Arms of the Ma]]&quot;, as a huge [[female bodybuilder]], advising Marge (who is taking up weightlifting) to use [[steroid]]s. She reveals during her time in prison, she was &quot;Miss [[Mexican Mafia]]&quot;.

==Sam and Larry==
'''Sam and Larry''', also known as &quot;Barfly #1&quot; and &quot;Barfly #2&quot;, are two regular patrons of [[Moe's Tavern]]. Their first appearance is in &quot;[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]&quot;. Virtually nothing is known about them, except that Sam always wears a cap and glasses and Larry has an orange jacket and a balding head and either looks extremely drunk or very depressed. Sam has spoken only a few times throughout the series; on the season three episode &quot;[[Lisa the Greek]]&quot;, Sam asks Homer who he bet on during the Super Bowl. In &quot;[[Worst Episode Ever]]&quot; Sam is shot in the back by [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], for trying to pay in [[Sacagawea dollar]]s. Larry hasn't spoken, except for in fantasy sequences.

==Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon==
'''Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]), voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple87&quot;/&gt; and is [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]]'s younger half-brother and uncle of Apu's eight children. He has a daughter named Pahusacheta and a son named Jamshed. Sanjay has a wife, as he asked Apu to promise not to sleep with her if he dies (Apu's response to this request was a cheery &quot;I promise nothing!&quot;). Sanjay was shown as Apu's business partner at the Kwik-E-Mart in the earlier episodes. His final speaking appearance was in [[I'm with Cupid]]. However, he has appeared as a background character in [[Moe Letter Blues]] and [[The Simpsons Movie]].

==Sarah Wiggum==
'''Sarah Wiggum''' (nÃ©e '''Kanickee'''), voiced by [[Pamela Hayden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gimple87&quot;/&gt; She is the gentle wife of [[Chief Wiggum]] and mother of [[Ralph Wiggum]]. She first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]] episode &quot;[[Duffless]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[Duffless]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Bernice Hibbert and Martha Quimby, she is one of the less notable characters who hardly ever speaks; however in [[The Simpsons Game]] she only ever says &quot;Clancy!&quot;, whether hit or in Marge's [[Ochlocracy|mob]]. In the episode, &quot;[[A Star Is Born-Again]]&quot;, at the Jellyfish Dance, Clancy mentions she was more beautiful at that moment than the day he arrested her, to which she giggles in reply. He then mentions he only planted the [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] on her so she would &quot;notice&quot; him. Sarah (according to Clancy) is his &quot;home force&quot; and he affectionately calls her &quot;[[Pillsbury Doughboy|Poppin' Fresh]]&quot;. In the episode, &quot;[[Grade School Confidential]]&quot;, she immediately dials the authorities to Clancy's command. Ralph apparently gets his appearance from her, as the two look very similar.

==Scott Christian==
'''Scott Christian''' (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]) is a newsreader from the early seasons of the show. Originally, Christian and [[Kent Brockman]] shared the anchor desk equally, but eventually Brockman started to become the more commonly used anchor. In his final appearances, Christian was used mostly when Kent was in the field and an introduction was needed. His final speaking appearance was &quot;[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]&quot;. Christian was supposed to be permanent anchor,&lt;ref&gt;Season 1 DVD Commentary - &quot;[[Krusty Gets Busted]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; always filling in for an absent Brockman, but was quickly phased out as the show progressed. He briefly appeared (with red colored hair) with the other Springfield celebrities in the season 18 episode &quot;[[Homerazzi]]&quot; and made a cameo in &quot;[[Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?]]&quot;.

==Sea Captain==
'''Captain McCallister''' ('''Horatio''' or '''Pete'''), more commonly known as &quot;'''The Sea Captain'''&quot;, voiced by [[Hank Azaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond178&quot;/&gt; Azaria modelled the voice on actor [[Robert Newton]], who played pirates in several movies.&lt;ref&gt;Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[New Kid on the Block]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The writers' &quot;love of sea talk&quot; is what inspired them to invent the Sea Captain.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jeff (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[I Married Marge]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; His character is based on the stereotype of sailors and pirates, including the stereotypical pirate catchphrase, &quot;Yarr!&quot; He is a member of the Springfield [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and has a peg leg in which he keeps liquor. In &quot;[[The Bart of War]]&quot; he uses his wooden leg to have a vicious sword fight with [[Sideshow Mel]]'s bone.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartofWar&quot;/&gt;

The Sea Captain is always seen holding a corncob pipe and squinting: because he has at least one glass eye - though once he was seen tapping both of his eyes and says he has 'two glass eyes.' In addition to eye(s), he also has an artificial leg. As an entrepreneur, McCallister is equally incompetent. On several occasions, he acknowledges his incompetence with a depressed: &quot;Yarr, I don't know what I'm doin'.&quot; Although he once states under oath (in &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;) that he is not a real sea captain, at various occasions in later episodes he is indeed shown captaining a ship. His restaurant, ''The Frying Dutchman'', is a failing business venture that does not generate enough income to support its owner. During the episode &quot;[[Mr. Plow]]&quot;, the Captain pitches his 90 track [[sea shanty|sea shanties]] CD set in a [[television advertisement|commercial]], which aired on [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channel 92. In the episode &quot;[[Lisa Gets an &quot;A&quot;]]&quot;, the captain appears as a penniless bum. When seeing Homer and Marge walking Homer's pet [[lobster]] at the beach, he approaches them and claims that he runs a &quot;small academy for lobsters&quot;. However, when Marge refuses to send the lobster away to &quot;some snobby boarding school&quot;, McCallister asks her for spare change instead. 

His only main roles were in episodes &quot;[[New Kid on the Block]]&quot; and in &quot;[[The Wettest Stories Ever Told]]&quot;. In the former, Homer sues his restaurant ''The Frying Dutchman'' because they kicked him out at the restaurant's closing time before Homer had eaten all he could eat. In the latter, he cannot bring the Simpsons their food for numerous reasons like the &quot;chef having problems with tonight's special&quot;, which was an octopus. He then ignores the family while playing pickup [[basketball]] games with the restaurant's staff.

==Sherri and Terri==
'''Sherri''' and '''Terri''', voiced by [[Russi Taylor]], are [[Semiidentical twins|identical twins]] with long purple hair and pale skin. They perpetually reinforce their identities as twins, with things such as [[cryptophasia|making up their own 'twin' language]]. They are in the same class as [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. In &quot;[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]&quot; it is revealed that their father is [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s [[supervisor]] at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. He fires Homer for causing an accident while waving to Bart from a cart during a school tour of the plant. Homer, however, had the last laugh when he was promoted above the twins' father to safety inspector. Their mother is shown in &quot;[[Bart Sells His Soul]]&quot; and looks just like her daughters. Sherri is two seconds older than Terri;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Simpsons Game]]''&lt;/ref&gt; they share their birthday with Rod Flanders.

The girls themselves dress identically, reinforcing their &quot;twin-ness&quot;. They are quite snobbish, and never miss an opportunity to berate Bart. Bart appears to have a crush on one of them, as admitted in &quot;[[Hungry, Hungry Homer]]&quot;. Sherri referred to Bart as an ugly, smelly dork, but was persuaded by Homer to go on a date with Bart after he told her that she could not do much better. One of the twins stated that her sister had a crush on Bart in &quot;[[Bart Star]]&quot;. Another time, in &quot;[[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]&quot;, Homer openly addressed Terri as &quot;the girl Bart has a crush on&quot;. In [[The Way We Weren't]], they introduce a cousin who has a crush on Bart. In [[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]] it was revealed that they were actually conjoined triplets, and that the third triplet is seeking revenge. In &quot;[[Lisa's Substitute]], they nominate Bart as the class president.

==Sideshow Mel==
'''Melvin Van Horne''', better known as '''Sideshow Mel''' (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]), is [[Krusty the Clown]]'s sidekick. He replaced [[Sideshow Bob]] after Bob was incarcerated for [[Krusty Gets Busted|framing Krusty for armed robbery]]. Mel's hiring was never explicitly shown in the series and his full name was only revealed when he announced himself while trying to solve the mystery of who shot Mr. Burns in the episode &quot;[[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]&quot; and in the episode &quot;[[All About Lisa]]&quot; on the portrait of Sideshow Mel in the past. He first appeared in &quot;[[Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge]]&quot;, shortly after Sideshow Bob was sent to prison, filling the exact role that Bob once did. Little is known about Mel. He is a [[Cornell University]] graduate, and a former ''Gulp 'n Blow'' employee. Sideshow Mel is revealed, in the episode entitled &quot;All About Lisa&quot;, to have been the winner of the prestigious Springfield Entertainer of the Year award. The intoxication of applause made him reduce himself to ridiculous behavior for laughter, which he compared to heroin and checking email. Sideshow Mel uses a [[slide whistle]] to communicate on camera just like Bob. When not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose [[United Kingdom|British]]/[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]an accent (Castellaneta's play on [[Kelsey Grammer]]'s character, [[Sideshow Bob]]) and owns poodles. When Springfield inhabitants form an angry mob, Mel often takes a leading role. Mel wears a bone in his hair and have been used as a weapon. In &quot;[[Homerazzi]]&quot; it was revealed that Mel was in a bitter [[child custody|custody]] battle and that he has a son, who looks just like him except without a bone in his hair. In &quot;[[I'm with Cupid]]&quot;, he reveals he has a wife named Barbara, who appears in &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot; where they are bowling in a house that Marge tries to sell to them. She is revealed to be giving birth in the episode &quot;[[All About Lisa]]&quot;, suggesting that Mel has at least two children. She looks like a European woman, and has light hair. 

Sideshow Mel is often subject to abuse by Krusty, just as Sideshow Bob was before him. Such occurrences include 'Krusty's Slide', where he is forced into a mixture of pudding, pickle brine and laundry detergent, a tub of rancid [[BÃ©arnaise sauce]] and a tub of [[refried beans]]; another unseen one is in &quot;[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]&quot; where he states that Krusty once poured [[liquid nitrogen]] down his pants and cracked his buttocks with a hammer. In the episode &quot;[[Day of the Jackanapes]]&quot;, it is shown that Krusty can remember Sideshow Bob's name, but not Sideshow Mel's.

==Snake==
'''Chester''' &quot;'''Snake'''&quot; '''Turley'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Fool Monty |episodelink=The Fool Monty|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Price, Michael (writer); Moore, Steven Dean (director) |network= Fox|station= |airdate=November 21, 2010 |number=06 |season=22 |time=14:43 |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is voiced by [[Hank Azaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond178&quot;&gt;Richmond, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent antagonist in the series, he is [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s resident [[Recidivism|recidivist]] felon, consistently getting arrested for violent crimes but rarely appearing to stay in jail. He speaks with a [[valleyspeak|&quot;Valley Boy&quot;]] accent. He is partial to fast cars and fast women, and has a knack for reckless abandon. He owned a car called Li'l Bandit, which Homer won at a police auction (as seen in &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;).

Snake first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episode &quot;[[The War of the Simpsons]]&quot; as one of the partygoers during Bart and Lisa's wild house party. Whenever Snake appears in prison, his prison number is always 7F20, the production code of &quot;The War of the Simpsons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greaney&quot;/&gt; Hank Azaria's voice for Snake was based on a roommate he had while in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;barbershop&quot;/&gt;) His name was first mentioned by [[Sideshow Bob]] in &quot;[[Black Widower]]&quot; when Sideshow Bob was saying goodbye to his prison friends after being granted parole. The character was originally named Jailbird. The animators assigned him to the role of Snake in [[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]]'s &quot;Black Widower&quot; and the character has gone by that name ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Black Widower]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode &quot;[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]&quot;, Lisa tells a story in which Snake refers to himself as Professor Jailbird, an [[Indiana Jones]]-like archeologist who turned to robbing [[convenience store]]s as revenge for the theft of valuable coins he had excavated. Snake attended [[Middlebury College]], as he robs Moe's Tavern to pay off his student loans and is shown wearing a Middlebury shirt in &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;. He also played lacrosse at [[Ball State University]], according to &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror IX]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F18.html |title=[3F18&amp;#93; 22 Short Films About Springfield |publisher=Snpp.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these episodes are considered non-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. He has a casually hostile relationship with [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], whose convenience store he robs so frequently that Apu considers the continual robberies perfectly normal. Snake is often used as a cutaway foil for Apu; often, when Apu mentions his absence from the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], Snake is shown robbing it, with various snide remarks. In the episode &quot;[[Marge in Chains]]&quot;, he literally &quot;shoplifts&quot;, stealing the entire Kwik-E-Mart shop via a flat-bed truck, declaring &quot;I'm taking this baby to Mexico!&quot;. In &quot;[[Yokel Chords]]&quot;, he and Apu are seen in a psychiatrist's office, bickering about Snake's robberies and shootings in the manner of an unhappily married couple.

Snake has a son named Jeremy, who looks just like him (who was introduced in &quot;[[Pygmoelian]]&quot;) and likes to steal bicycles, a trait that Snake encourages. Unlike his father, Jeremy is rather timid as seen in ''The Seemingly Never-Ending Story''. Snake has another child on the way; however, it has been implied he and the mother, [[A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love|Gloria]], are no longer in a romantic relationship in the episode &quot;[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Crosswords]]&quot;. In the episode &quot;[[Wedding For Disaster]]&quot; Snake and Gloria are seen getting married at city hall. In the episode, &quot;[[Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes]]&quot;, he is seen with the pregnant Gloria driving a car.

==Squeaky-Voiced Teen==
'''Squeaky Voiced Teen''', aka Pimple-Faced Teen, real name Jeremy Freedman (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]),&lt;ref name=Gimple87&gt;Gimple, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; is one of few [[adolescence|teenagers]] on the show and is perpetually trapped in a series of dead-end jobs, usually working at Krusty Burger (as a cashier or, in the case of &quot;[[Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy]]&quot;, a supervisor in charge of training new employees), the grocery store (as a bagboy, as seen in &quot;[[Selma's Choice]]&quot; and &quot;[[Simpson Safari]]&quot;), or at a movie theater (as either [[Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie|the ticket master]], [[E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)|concession stand clerk]], or [[Jaws Wired Shut|usher]]). The Squeaky Voiced Teen has [[acne vulgaris|acne]], and his voice is in the process of breaking. The Squeaky Voiced Teen's personality is shy, pathetic, miserable, and awkward. He is often concerned about others and usually reports them to his boss; however, when he very rarely is the boss himself, he seizes opportunity and becomes stubborn and evil. Beginning with ''[[Team Homer]]'', it is revealed that the Squeaky-Voiced Teen's mother is Lunchlady Doris.

Castellaneta lifted his voice for the character from actor [[Richard Crenna]]'s as Walter Denton in the sitcom ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Castellaneta, Dan (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[Boy-Scoutz N the Hood]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Several different models of Squeaky-Voiced Teen have been used throughout the series, featuring counterparts in Mexico, Australia and England. [[Steven Dean Moore]] uses them all as waiters at the ice cream parlor the Simpsons eat at in &quot;[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Steven Dean (2008). Commentary for &quot;[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Groening]] called Squeaky-Voiced Teen his second favorite &quot;unnamed&quot; character after [[Comic Book Guy]], whose name was finally revealed to be &quot;Jeff Albertson&quot; in the episode &quot;[[Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[Boy-Scoutz n the Hood]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stampy==
'''Stampy''' is a male [[African elephant]] first appearing in the episode &quot;[[Bart Gets an Elephant]]&quot; (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). Bart wins the elephant in a radio contest called &quot;[[Media in the Simpsons#KBBL|KBBL]] Is Gonna Gimme Something Stupid&quot;. As a prize, Bart was offered either an elephant or $10,000 in cash, with the elephant option as a joke. [[#Bill and Marty|Bill and Marty]] had anticipated all winners would opt for the cash and were caught off guard when Bart chose the elephant. With the prospect of being fired looming, they eventually get Bart an elephant. Bart decides to name the elephant Stampy, who soon starts to cause trouble and costs a large amount of money in upkeep. Anxious to escape this, Homer offers Stampy to a [[nature reserve|wildlife reserve]]. However, on his realization that he will get nothing in return, he elects to sell Stampy to local [[poaching|poacher]] and [[ivory]] dealer, Mr. Blackheart. Homer later changes his mind after Stampy rescues him from a tar pit. Stampy likes [[peanut]]s and putting people in his mouth. He does not like other elephants, as can be seen when he is first introduced to the wildlife reserve.

Stampy is alluded to in other episodes. At [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu's]] wedding, Bart sees Apu riding an elephant. Bart comments that he wishes that he had an elephant. Lisa responds, &quot;You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.&quot; Bart simply replies, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; Stampy also appears in &quot;[[Miracle on Evergreen Terrace]]&quot; in Bart's water dream, and made a second (and more important) appearance on season 14's &quot;[[Large Marge]]&quot;, where he was involved in an attempt to restore the public opinion of [[Krusty the Clown]]. Stampy also attacks a bear in the final scene of &quot;[[The Fat and the Furriest]]&quot; and appears in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', where he cracks the dome that covers Springfield, prompting the government's drastic action.

==State Comptroller Atkins==
'''State Comptroller Atkins''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is the [[comptroller]] of Springfield's state. In &quot;[[Lisa Gets an &quot;A&quot;]]&quot; he is sent to deliver the basic assistance grant to Springfield Elementary after Lisa cheats on a test and raises the school's GPA up to the state's minimum requirement. Otto's impersonation of Atkins suggests that he is of Canadian origin. He appears later in &quot;[[Saddlesore Galactica]]&quot;, where he moderates the elementary school band competition at the state fair. He plans to give Lisa the unusually large good sportsmanship award until he hears her brand the first-place band &quot;cheaters&quot; for using glow-sticks in their performance. Atkins' most recent appearance was in &quot;[[We're on the Road to D'ohwhere]]&quot;, in which Superintendent Chalmers and Atkins are participating in a [[Videoconferencing|video conference]] with Skinner. He is also on Lisa's list of &quot;interesting adults&quot; in &quot;[[Moe'N'a Lisa]]&quot;.

==Superintendent Chalmers==
'''Superintendent Gary Chalmers''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield's]] school district. He first appears in the episode &quot;[[Whacking Day]]&quot;. Chalmers is a strict and largely humorless man, with a short temper and low tolerance for disorder or rule-breaking; his general manner and personality are like those of a military officer. Whenever he visits Springfield Elementary, some sort of disaster strikes. He produces extreme anxiety in [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]], who offers increasingly improbable stories to explain what is happening. He is also known for seeming to be in complete disbelief of these improbable stories, but ultimately winds up actually believing them, teasing Skinner and the audience that he may actually take some action. Chalmers is known for throwing open the doors to the room and bellowing &quot;SKIN-NER!!!&quot; or &quot;SEY-MOUR!!!&quot;, to which Seymour stammers &quot;S-Superintendent Chalmers!&quot;. His catchphrase has caused some [[paranoia]] in Skinner (as seen in &quot;[[Lisa's Date with Density]]&quot;). On a few occasions, he says Skinner's name this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong, implying that he either pronounces Skinner's name this way by habit, or does it on purpose to scare him. In [[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]], he even pronounces the words &quot;skimmer&quot; and &quot;dinner&quot; in a similar manner to Skinner's name, who mistakes it as Chalmers wanting his attention. However, Chalmers does on at least two occasions show a fondness for Skinner. In &quot;[[The Debarted]]&quot;, both Skinner and Chalmers are lost in the foam of a massive explosion resulting from the mixture of [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption|Mentos and Diet Coke]], he screams Skinner's name and upon not receiving an answer, says it again in a softer manner. Skinner then replies to which Chalmers tells him in a frightened voice, &quot;Don't ever scare me like that again.&quot; More notable, in [[How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?]], when [[Edna Krabappel|Edna]] uses a pigeon to taunt Skinner about how much better her life is without him, Chalmers shows compassion for Skinner and even offers his friendship, but unfortunately, Edna reveals that she [[sexual intercourse|had an affair]] with Chalmers, leaving Skinner angry and forcing Chalmers to flee. In &quot;[[Lisa Simpson, This Isn't Your Life]]&quot;, it is revealed that Chalmers has nothing personal against Skinner and that he is only mad at the antics of the students and teachers, but [[scapegoat|he can only scold Skinner]] because he would have to face the ire of the parents or of the [[Teachers' union]] if he tries to chatise any group.

Chalmers' own competence and dedication to his job are questionable. He lets [[Ned Flanders]] allow the school to descend into [[anarchy]] when he (Flanders) is principal, freely admitting that he had fired Skinner for far less, explaining simply that &quot;Skinner really bugged me.&quot; He seems disturbingly unconcerned with the school's decline, saying that &quot;the way America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be like this in a matter of months. I say enjoy it â it's a hell of a toboggan ride!&quot; He also promotes people based on personal bias as opposed to actual competence, promoting Principal Holloway, described by Skinner as a &quot;drunk&quot; and Chalmers as a &quot;pill-popper&quot;, to assistant superintendent, overlooking the efforts made by Skinner to improve his school's standing. In the episode &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;, he mentions he is from [[Utica, New York]]. He has also mentioned that he attended [[Ball State University]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]].

In several episodes, such as &quot;[[Bart the Fink]]&quot;, Chalmers is seen dating [[Agnes Skinner]] (much to Seymour's chagrin), although in other episodes, he mentions he is married. His first name is revealed to be Gary in &quot;[[Yokel Chords]]&quot; and in &quot;[[Wild Barts Can't Be Broken]]&quot;, and it is revealed that he is a Spanish immigrant ''SeÃ±or Chalmers''. In the DVD commentaries to &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot; and &quot;[[Grade School Confidential]]&quot;, it is noted that Superintendent Chalmers seems to be one of the few &quot;normal&quot; characters on the show and is frequently alone in his awareness of the show's zaniness. In &quot;[[Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts]]&quot;, Chalmers indicates that he had a wife that has since passed on.

==Todd Flanders==
'''Todd Flanders''' is Ned Flanders' eight year old son, voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]. His voice is based on Sherman's from ''[[Mister Peabody|Peabody and Sherman]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt; Todd is the most impressionable member of the Flanders family. When exposed to [[profanity]], he himself starts to curse (&quot;Hell, no&quot; and &quot;I said I don't want any damn vegetables&quot;). When [[Moe Szyslak]] loses his temper at Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag restaurant, Todd responds with &quot;Ow, my freaking ears!&quot; Whether due to immaturity or relentless sheltering by his parents, whenever Todd comes into contact with anything outside his family and their [[Piety|pious]] ways, such as the time he was tricked into eating a [[Pixy Stix]] by [[Bart Simpson]], he turns aggressive, telling his brother to &quot;go to hell zitface&quot;, much to the delight of Bart. Todd can play the [[violin]] quite well, and is a part of the [[Springfield Elementary School]] band. He also plays mini golf quite well.

==Ãter ZÃ¶rker==
'''Ãter ZÃ¶rker''', {{anchor|Ãter}} voiced by [[Russi Taylor]], is an overweight [[Germany|German]] [[foreign exchange student]] with a [[sweetness|sweet tooth]], and odd habits such as offering his already-licked lollipops to others as a sign of friendship, and eating [[marzipan]] candies (called ''Joy Joy'') fortified with [[iodine]]. He was left behind on the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] field trip, according to the season six episode &quot;[[The PTA Disbands]]&quot;. His subsequent disappearance from the show for a significant period of time has become a running joke. In &quot;[[Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?]]&quot; his parents asked Skinner where their missing son was, and in &quot;[[24 Minutes]]&quot; he is seen stuck in a cobweb in the school air vents. It is revealed in the episode &quot;[[Jazzy and the Pussycats]]&quot; that he can play the [[trumpet]] quite well. He even makes a [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]] [[diorama]], but eats it before it can be graded in &quot;[[Lisa's Rival]]&quot;. During the school science fair in the season 23 episode &quot;[[Replaceable You]]&quot; Kearney has a human skull on display questioning &quot;Is This Ãter?&quot;  In the German dub of the show, Ãter is an exchange student from [[Switzerland]].

==Vanderbilts==
A rich couple who are frequently shocked by Homer's antics. They first appear in [[Saddlesore Galactica]] where Mr Vanderbilt breaks his monocle after being shocked.  This gag is reused in [[A Tale of Two Springfields]]. In [[Homer vs. Dignity]] Mrs Vanderbilt is shocked by [[Homer Simpson]]'s antics twice. In [[The Frying Game]], Mrs Vanderbilt is shown as friends with Mrs. Bellamy, Mrs. Glick and Agnes Skinner. They are a parody of the actual [[Vanderbilt family]].

==Wendell Borton==
'''Wendell Borton''' is a perpetually nauseated and very pale boy with worried eyes and curly hair. He first appears in &quot;[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]&quot; although his first speaking appearance is in &quot;[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]&quot;. He becomes especially sick on [[field trip]]s, with a tendency to become even paler than usual. He makes frequent appearances at the school nurse's office at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. A classmate of [[Bart Simpson]], Wendell is most often seen with classmates Richard Lewis and Martin. He voted for [[Martin Prince]], thus making Bart lose in the class election, and ensuring Martin's victory. He is one of the few characters (like Bart, Lisa, and Maggie) whose hair is the same color as his skin. Throughout the series, Wendell has been voiced by [[Jo Ann Harris]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], and [[Russi Taylor]].

==Mr. and Mrs. Winfield==
The '''Winfields''' are an elderly couple who live next door to the [[Simpson family]] early in the series and often talk about how crude and uncivilized the family is. They first appear in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]] episode &quot;[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]&quot;, cracking jokes about Homer. The couple eventually move to [[Florida]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] episode &quot;[[New Kid on the Block]]&quot; and have not been seen since. The couple appear in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episodes &quot;[[Simpson and Delilah]]&quot; and &quot;[[Bart's Dog Gets an F]]&quot;, in which the wife is revealed to be named Sylvia. She also has a small speaking role in the Season 3 episode [[Separate Vocations]] when she mistakenly thinks Bart is being arrested by the Springfield police. The couple appear in the pre-2009 opening credits of [[The Simpsons]], during the segment where [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] pass many characters while driving [[742 Evergreen Terrace|home]]. [[Matt Groening]] named the Winfields after friends of his.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2002). Commentary for &quot;[[The War of the Simpsons]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wiseguy==
'''Raphael''', a.k.a. '''Wiseguy''', is voiced by [[Hank Azaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann116&quot;/&gt; He first appeared as the chauffeur in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] in &quot;[[The Way We Was]]&quot;, but he has held numerous other jobs in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, David (2002). Commentary for &quot;[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simpsons'' [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] Bob Beecher commented on [[alt.tv.simpsons]] that, &quot;He doesn't have ''one'' name. His character's name always fits the scene so he's gone by many names, 'Clerk', 'Shopkeeper', etc. But in the script the direction given to the voice is 'Wiseguy Voice'. So call him 'Wiseguy' if you want.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snpp.com/guides/smam.file.html|title=The Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man File|publisher=[[The Simpsons Archive]]|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria does a [[Charles Bronson]]-impression for the voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;barbershop&quot;&gt;Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for &quot;[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious]]&quot;, [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] had Azaria voice a Simpsonized Charles Bronson as a reference to this.&lt;ref&gt;Jean, Al (2006). Commentary for &quot;[[Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiseguy has been dubbed &quot;The Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man&quot; by the show's Internet fans.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Day of the Jackanapes]]&quot;, [[Sideshow Bob]] calls Wiseguy by the name &quot;Raphael&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yes Guy==
The '''Frank Nelson Type''',&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; also known as &quot;'''The Yes Guy'''&quot;, is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann116&quot;&gt;McCann, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He first appeared in [[The Simpsons (season 10)|season ten]]'s episode &quot;[[Mayored to the Mob]]&quot; as the [[MaÃ®tre d'hÃ´tel|maÃ®tre dÎ]] at the Springfield Dinner Theater. He is a character known for bellowing &quot;Ye-e-e-s?!&quot; in a falling, then rising intonation, and appears to be highly eccentric in both his speech and appearance. The Yes Guy is a tribute to the recurring [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]] character from ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', and ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', whose trademark greeting in all his characters was a loud, drawn-out &quot;Ye-e-e-s?!&quot; Inexplicably, the original character could always be found working behind the service counter of whatever shop Benny or Fred Sanford might be patronizing, and his Simpsonian counterpart is similar.

In the Yes Guy's first appearance, Homer asks why his voice is always stretched, and the Yes Guy replies by saying &quot;I had a stro-o-o-oke&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayored&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Mayored to the Mob]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears in &quot;[[Homer vs. Dignity]]&quot;. He works at Costington's department store,&lt;ref name=&quot;MilhouseDoesnt&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Milhouse Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; works as juror number twelve of the Springfield Panel of Jury,&lt;ref name=&quot;TheMonkeySuit&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode: &quot;[[The Monkey Suit]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and as an executioner at Springfield Penitentiary.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheFrying&quot;&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[The Frying Game]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Homer refers to him as &quot;that jerk who always goes Yessss&quot;.&lt;ref name=SSCCTG&gt;''The Simpsons'' episode: &quot;[[Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A Brazilian version of him was seen in &quot;[[Blame It on Lisa]]&quot;, uttering &quot;Si-i-i-m?!&quot; (&quot;Yes&quot; in Portuguese).
