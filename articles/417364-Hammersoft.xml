{{TOC right}}

The following is a list of notable '''deaths in 2004'''. 

Entries for each day are listed alphabetically by surname.  A typical entry lists information in the following sequence:
* Name, age, country of citizenship and reason for notability, established cause of death, reference (and language of reference, if not [[English language|English]]).
&lt;!--
=============Please read before adding a name to this list=============
Only those meeting the [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|Wikipedia notability]] guidelines are listed, with a reference to a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]]. If there is not already a Wikipedia article for the person, please reconsider if the person is actually notable, or consider writing one yourself.

NOTE: Causes of death such as  &quot;old age&quot; and &quot;natural causes&quot; should not be cited unless stated in the reference. The intent of these pages is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily make the deceased &quot;notable&quot;. If you report the death of someone who does not already have a Wikipedia article, please consider starting one, provided the person is notable, with other third-party sources than the obituary.

Alphabetical order please. Please avoid [[WP:OVERLINK]]ing. Therefore, do not wikilink nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death, instead only adding &quot;links that aid navigation and understanding&quot;. Thank you.
