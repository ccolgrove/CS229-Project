The '''NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Championship''' has been played since 1972.

The tournament is a 32-team, single-elimination tournament. The Division II tournament is structured around the eight NCAA regions (Atlantic, Central, East, Midwest, South, South Central, Southeast, and West). Four teams from each region are selected with no automatic qualifiers given. The selection criteria used is similar to that used in Division I, although one difference is that the RPI is replaced with the Quality of Winning Percentage Index, a more subjective measure.

The first two rounds are played on campus sites with the higher seed hosting the four-team regional. The winners of each region meet in the quarterfinals, with the host being determined by specific criteria or, failing that, geographical rotation. The final two rounds are played at a predetermined site. In 2010, the semifinals and final were held at [[Owsley B. Frazier Stadium]] on the campus of [[Bellarmine University]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The 2011 semifinals and final for both the men's and women's Division II tournaments will be held at Ashton Brosnaham Park in [[Pensacola, Florida]] and hosted by the [[University of West Florida]].
