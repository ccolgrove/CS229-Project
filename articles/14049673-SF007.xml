'''MagicISO''' (also referred to as MagicISO Maker) is a CD/DVD image [[shareware]] utility that can extract, edit, create, and burn [[disc image]] files. It offers the possibility of converting between [[ISO image|ISO]] and [[Cue sheet (computing)|CUE/BIN]] and their proprietary Universal Image Format disc image format.

In addition to being able to edit the contents of the disc images without decompressing, it can make a disc image from an existing CD/DVD-ROM. Also, it can make bootable image files (file extension .bif). MagicISO can [[mount (computing)|mount]] disc images with the addition of MagicISO Virtual CD/DVD Manager.

The trial version cannot handle disc images larger than 300 MB. MagicISO is currently produced by MagicISO, Inc. The Company's domain name is registered to an address in Shanghai, China.

== Universal Image Format ==
'''Universal Image Format''' or '''UIF''' is a proprietary disc image format for CDs and DVDs designed for MagicISO. Compared to the widespread simpler image formats like .iso and .bin, UIF adds [[data compression|compression]], password-protected [[encryption]], MD5 [[checksum]]s and multi-session images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
== Problems with CIF files ==
MagicISO supports CIF files created by [[Easy CD Creator]], but only data CDs(ISO 9660 compatibles), not Audio CDs.
== MagicDisc ==
'''MagicDisc''', sometimes known as '''MagicISO Virtual CD/DVD Manager''' is a [[freeware]] virtual drive counterpart to '''MagicISO'''. It is a separate download needed to mount discs virtually.  MagicDisc can also decompress UIF images to ISO format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Unlike MagicISO, MagicDisc does not have support for [[.daa]] files that were produced by [[PowerISO]].
