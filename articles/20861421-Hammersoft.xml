The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Houston Texans]] season''' is the 8th season for the team in the [[National Football League]]. The Texans improved upon their 8â8 record in [[2008 Houston Texans season|2008]], claimed their first winning season in franchise history, and 4 straight heartbreaking division losses came back to haunt them, as they narrowly missed making the playoffs, being the first team out in a series of tiebreakers, and due to teams resting their starters against the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].

The Texans had eight selections for the 2009 NFL Draft. The Texans received an additional fourth-round pick (selection 122 overall) in a trade with the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for QB [[Sage Rosenfels]]. 

The team signed undrafted [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] running back [[Arian Foster]] after the draft, and signed him to the practice squad, and he made his NFL debut mid-season. Foster would go on to win the [[List of NFL rushing champions|NFL rushing title]]  [[2010 NFL season|the following year]].

==Coaching staff==
Head coach [[Gary Kubiak]] entered his fourth year as the Texans' head coach. [[Frank Bush]], who had served as the Texans senior defensive assistant since 2007, was promoted to defensive coordinator on January 13, 2009 after the firing of [[Richard Smith (football coach)|Richard Smith]]. Smith was terminated shortly after the conclusion of the 2008 season.

[[David Gibbs (football coach)|David Gibbs]], son of NFL coach [[Alex Gibbs]], was hired on January 19, 2009 as the new defensive backs coach after previously serving in the same role for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] since 2006.
