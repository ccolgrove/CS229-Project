'''Holly Barton''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the British soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Sophie Powles]]. She made her first on-screen appearance on 17 July 2009. Holly was introduced to the soap as part of the Bartons, a new farming family who took over the running of Butler's Farm. Holly was joined by her mother, father and two siblings. The family were described as being &quot;sexy, modern and contemporary&quot; by the show's series producer, [[Gavin Blyth]].

==Creation and casting==
In May 2009, it was announced that ''Emmerdale's'' new series producer, [[Gavin Blyth]], would introduce The Bartons, a new farming family, as part of an ongoing overhaul of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewFamily&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a156759/emmerdale-casts-sexy-farming-family.html|title='Emmerdale' casts 'sexy' farming family|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|last=Green|first=Kris|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family, which comprises five members - mother, father, two daughters and a son - took over the running of Butler's Farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewFamily&quot;/&gt; Of the family, Blyth said &quot;I don't want to make Emmerdale a show about teenagers and young people, it's about family values. The Bartons are sexy, modern and contemporary. They're almost happy - and in soapland that's quite strange!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/interviews/a159417/gavin-blyth-series-producer-emmerdale.html|title=Gavin Blyth (Series Producer, 'Emmerdale')|date=12 June 2009|first=Kris|last=Green|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalie J. Robb]] and [[James Thornton (actor)|James Thornton]] were cast in the roles of parents, [[John Barton (Emmerdale)|John]] and [[Moira Barton|Moira]]. [[Adam Thomas]] and [[Grace Cassidy]] were cast as their children [[Adam Barton (Emmerdale)|Adam]] and [[Hannah Barton|Hannah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewFamily&quot;/&gt;  

Former ''[[Britannia High]]'' actress Sophie Powles was cast in the role of eldest daughter Holly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Actress&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/NEW-DARLING-DALES/story-11530396-detail/story.html|title=Actress lands Emmerdale role|date=9 July 2009|work=[[Grimsby Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powles received a call from her agent telling her about an audition for ''Emmerdale'', which she thought was a great opportunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/interviews/v/8807-sophie-powles-emmerdale-interview.html|title=Sophie Powles (Emmerdale) Interview|publisher=Last Broadcast|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the audition, Powles attended the subsequent recalls, before getting down to the final four. After a screen test with Robb and Thornton, Powles was given the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; Shortly before filming her first scenes, the actress had to go shopping for Holly's costumes and had her hair dyed brown for the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; Of her casting, Powles said &quot;I always wanted to act and especially because it's a northern show and my family live just down the road in Otley, so I've got a strong Yorkshire connection. I did my first scene in the Woolpack and I was just amazed at how real it was and I feel so lucky to be doing a job I enjoy on a show that I love. It's really cool.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt;

==Development==
===Characterisation===
{{Quote|text=&quot;When she arrived in Emmerdale Holly seemed just like any other teenage girl, but her growing dependence on drugs changed her personality dramatically and led her to lie and steal from her family. The old Holly was considerate and caring, but the drug-dependent Holly is more of an unknown... That makes her unpredictable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HollyITV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/characters/holly-barton/|title=Holly Barton|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[itv.com]] on Holly}}

Holly is described as being a &quot;free spirit with a sense of adventure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/whos-who/holly-barton/768|title=Holly Barton|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powles opined Holly is &quot;the kind of girl who will get on with anybody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; She becomes friends with the people she meets and does not judge a book by its cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; Holly is loyal to her family and close to her mother, who she shares a strong bond with.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; Holly and her brother, Adam, have grown up together and there is only a year between them. Adam is quite protective of his sister. Holly loves Hannah to bits and they enjoy teasing each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; Holly does not spend her time reading fashion magazines and she wears whatever she is comfortable in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dynasty&quot;&gt;

She's not image conscious and doesn't waste time thinking 'I'm too fat' or 'I'm too thin'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dynasty&quot;/&gt; Upon her entrance to the show, Holly had not had a boyfriend before. Susan Griffin of the ''Liverpool Daily Post'' said she would not go short of an admirer or two, and Powles added &quot;Holly wouldn't go for someone who was typically good-looking. She doesn't go for the obvious.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dynasty&quot;/&gt; The actress thought Holly may have some unexpected friendships and relationships, which would work.&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; 

When Powles was asked if she was anything like Holly in real life, she told ''[[Inside Soap]]'', &quot;I used to be quite similar to her when she got on well with her family and was bubbly - but now she's very moody and stroppy, I'm nothing like her!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=5â11 June 2010|title=I'm so scruffy - no one recognises me!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=22|page=52|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly's descent into drugs changed her personality and Steve Hendry of the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' noted Holly was once a girl from a good family with a cheeky twinkle in her eye and she had become a &quot;desperate soul who is dragging her family down into the gutter along with her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendry&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2010/11/14/i-immersed-myself-in-research-about-effects-of-heroin-for-part-in-emmerdale-says-sophie-powles-86908-22717010/|title=I immersed myself in research about effects of heroin for part in Emmerdale, says Sophie Powles|last=Hendry|first=Steve|date=14 November 2010|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendry pointed out Holly had acted out of character and Powles agreed, saying &quot;When I came into ''Emmerdale'' Holly was a very bubbly character, obviously a bit cheeky and a bit naughty but never would you think she'd do drugs. That's why they picked her, to show there is no stereotype of the kind of person who gets into drugs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendry&quot;/&gt; Powles said Holly had turned into a &quot;nasty creature&quot; because of the drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/interviews/v/14556-sophie-powles-emmerdales-holly-interview.html|title=Sophie Powles (Emmerdale's Holly) interview|publisher=Last Broadcast|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress believed Holly has always been fiery, but when she gets intimidated that turns into aggression, which worries her family.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastB&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote=&quot;This is a serious, true story about cocaine and heroin.

It's a bit like an out-of-body experience for her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moon&quot;/&gt; Powles added Holly is panicking and crying, so Aaron and Jackson kick the toilet door down and look after her. Aaron takes Holly home and she promises him it will never happen again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moon&quot;/&gt; Powles revealed Aaron is unaware of how dependent on drugs Holly has become and the actress promised Holly would face more trouble in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moon&quot;/&gt;

==Storylines==
Holly and her family arrive in the village and move into Butler's Farm. Holly gets a job at Home Farm, where she make friends with her employer's daughter, [[Maisie Wylde|Maisie]] ([[Alice Coulthard]]). She also begins studying art at college. Holly persuades [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]) to become a life model for her art class, after another model drops out. Holly meets [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) and she is attracted to him. When Aaron accuses John of assault, Holly tries to seduce him into dropping the charges. Aaron calls her bluff and asks her to have sex with him, which she refuses to do. Holly and Aaron later go on a date and begin a relationship. Adam tells his family that he thinks Aaron is gay. Aaron denies Adam's accusations and Holly chooses to believe him. Holly later ends her relationship with Aaron.

On a night out, Holly gives Maisie some cocaine. Maisie's mother, [[Natasha Wylde|Natasha]] ([[Amanda Donohoe]], finds out and sacks Holly, before telling her parents. When John and Moira confront Holly, she tells them she occasionally experiments with drugs. Holly starts taking drugs more frequently with her friend [[Roz Fielding]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]), who supplies them to her. Holly is expelled from college after she fails to hand in her assignments. John and Moira find out about Holly's expulsion and learn she was dealing drugs. Holly is grounded and forced to work on the farm. She decides to stop taking drugs and earns the trust of her parents again. Vet [[Rhona Goskirk]] ([[Zoe Henry]]) visits the farm and finds some ketamine missing from her bag. John accuses Holly of taking it and searches her room, but does not find anything. Holly later retrieves the ketamine from Hannah's room, where she hid it, and swaps it for cocaine.

Holly overdoses in a toilet cubicle on a night out and Aaron takes Holly home. Holly begs him to keep her overdose a secret. Holly steals [[Scarlett Nicholls]]' ([[Kelsey-Beth Crossley]]) purse to get money for drugs and babysits [[Viv Hope]]'s ([[Deena Payne]]) children while high. Holly also steals Viv's valium pills and [[Isaac Nuttall]]'s ([[Jake Roche]]) MP3 player. Moira arranges for Holly to babysit for [[Laurel Thomas|Laurel]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) and [[Ashley Thomas]]' ([[John Middleton (actor)|John Middleton]]) children. Holly invites Roz to keep her company. Roz is disgusted when Holly insists on taking some cocaine. On their return home, Laurel and Ashley become suspicious about Holly's behavior and later find a wrap of cocaine. Ashley tells John and Moira and they manage to persuade him not to call the police. They confront Holly and she blames Roz. Roz becomes angry and tells John and Moira their daughter has a drug problem. When Holly refuses to stop doing drugs, John disowns her. Holly disappears, but later returns to pick up some belongings.

Holly runs into Scarlett in town, but she runs off when Scarlett refuses to give her money. Scarlett sends Holly a text asking if they can meet. Holly discovers she has been set her up, when John appears. He tries to manhandle her into his car, but Holly escapes and runs off. She and her friends later burgle Butler's Farm. Aaron finds Holly working in a bar in Hotten and tells Moira, who turns up and is angered when Holly shows no remorse for what she has done. Moira drags Holly into her car and takes her to the police station, where she asks an officer to arrest her. Moira changes her mind about pressing charges and Holly apologises to her parents. John and Moira later visit Holly at her new address and meet her boyfriend [[Dan Cravely]] (James Boyland). Dan throws Holly out, when she cannot pay her way and she returns to the village. Ashley and [[Douglas Potts]] ([[Duncan Preston]]) find Holly in the graveyard and take her home. Roz comes to visit and Holly asks her for drugs, but Roz refuses to help her.

Moira takes Holly to a counsellor, but Holly excuses herself and runs away. She gets some heroin and John and Moira find her collapsed in her room. Holly later has sex with a stranger for money, so she can buy some more drugs. John and Moira decide to lock Holly her in her room and she is forced to go through drug withdrawal alone. The situation begins to affect the whole family. Moira eventually buys some heroin and gives it to Holly, so she can be weaned off slowly. When John offers to take the drug with her, Holly decides to try to get clean. She goes on a methadone programme and gets a job at the factory.
