'''USS ''Harry S. Truman'' (CVN-75)''' is the eighth [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] [[supercarrier]] of the [[United States Navy]], named after the 33rd President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman]]. ''HST''{{'}}s [[callsign]] is ''Lone Warrior'' and is currently homeported at [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Virginia.

''Harry S. Truman'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 14&amp;nbsp;September 1996 by [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]], [[Newport News, Virginia]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 18&amp;nbsp;July 1998 with Captain [[Thomas Otterbein]] in command. President [[Bill Clinton]] was the keynote speaker, and other notable attendees and speakers included Missouri Representative [[Ike Skelton]], Missouri Governor [[Mel Carnahan]], [[Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]] and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John H. Dalton]]. 

USS ''Harry S. Truman'' was initially the [[flagship]] of Carrier Group Two and, beginning 1&amp;nbsp;October 2004, of [[Carrier Strike Group Ten]].

==Description==
''Harry Truman'' (also known as ''HST'' within the Navy) is 1,092&amp;nbsp;ft (333&amp;nbsp;m) long, 257&amp;nbsp;ft (78&amp;nbsp;m) wide and is as high as a twenty-four-story building, at 244&amp;nbsp;feet (74&amp;nbsp;m). The super carrier can accommodate approximately 80&amp;nbsp;aircraft and has a flight deck {{convert|4.5|acre|ha}} in size, using four elevators that are 3,880&amp;nbsp;ftÂ² (360&amp;nbsp;mÂ²) each to move planes between the flight deck and the hangar bay. With a combat load, ''HST'' displaces almost 97,000&amp;nbsp;tons and can accommodate 6,250&amp;nbsp;crewmembers. Her four distilling units can make 400,000 U.S. gallons (1,500&amp;nbsp;mÂ³) of [[potable water]] a day; her food service divisions serve 18,000&amp;nbsp;meals per day. There are over 2,500&amp;nbsp;compartments on board requiring 2,520&amp;nbsp;tons (2.1&amp;nbsp;MW) of air conditioning capacity (enough to cool over 2,000&amp;nbsp;homes). The warship uses two Mark&amp;nbsp;II stockless anchors that came from {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=8594 |title= T-2s, The End of an Era |first= Joseph |last= Gunder |date= 21&amp;nbsp;July 2003 |publisher= U.S.&amp;nbsp;Navy |accessdate= 2011-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and weigh 30&amp;nbsp;tons each, with each link of the anchor chain weighing 360&amp;nbsp;pounds (160&amp;nbsp;kg). She is currently equipped with three 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phalanx CIWS]] mounts and two [[Sea Sparrow]] SAM launchers. The ship cost over $4.5&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007 dollars to manufacture.

===Propulsion===
Two Westinghouse [[A4W]] [[nuclear reactor]]s are used for propulsion (the ship is capable of steaming more than three million miles before refueling) turning 4&amp;nbsp;five-bladed screws that weigh 66,220&amp;nbsp;pounds (30&amp;nbsp;t) each driving the ship at speeds over 30&amp;nbsp;knots (56&amp;nbsp;km/h).

===Recreation===
While underway, the ship has its own daily newspaper, the &quot;Give 'em Hell Herald&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truman.navy.mil/herald/herald.html&lt;/ref&gt; and its own weekly television newscast, &quot;The Lookout&quot;. In addition, the ship's Morale, Welfare &amp; Recreation (MWR) division collaborates with the public affairs office (PAO) to telecast bingo contests for the crew that award as much as $1,000 and several prizes.

===Awards===
''Harry S. Truman'' has been the recipient of numerous awards recognizing the ship's excellence. They include

===Ship's seal and battle flag===
The oval seal was designed by the ship's pre-commissioning crew and is primarily blue and gold. According to the ship's history webpage, a coat of arms &quot;characterizes the global on-station capability of the ship and the United States Navy&quot; and &quot;Truman's name forms the shape of a forward-deployed aircraft carrier prepared to uphold and protect American interests&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;truman.navy.mil&quot;&gt;[http://www.truman.navy.mil/check-in.html United States Navy]&lt;/ref&gt; The three flags near the bottom represent the letters &quot;HST&quot;.

The ''Truman'' battle flag was also designed by the ship's crew and is a variation of the guidons carried by the companies of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment of the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Infantry Division]], such as Battery D, the battery under the command of then Army Capt. Harry Truman during [[World War I]]. It consists of crossed cannons on a scarlet background with the phrase &quot;Give 'em hell&quot;, a reference to Truman's [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 reelection campaign]].

==Ship history==
===Pre-commissioning and construction===
[[Image:Harry S Truman Cover.jpg|thumb|left|A cover for the Keel Laying of CVN-75 showing her keel was laid as {{USS|United States}}]]

The keel was laid by [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] on 29&amp;nbsp;November 1993 and the ship was christened on 7&amp;nbsp;September 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;truman.navy.mil&quot;/&gt; ''HST'' was authorized and laid down as {{USS|United States}} but her name was changed in February 1995 at the direction of then [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John H. Dalton]].

Three Newport News shipworkers died during construction when a pump room filled with [[methane]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] gases during a sewage leak on 12&amp;nbsp;July 1997. They are commemorated by a brass plaque in the tunnel off Hangar Bay #1. The ship was christened on 7&amp;nbsp;September 1996, launched 13&amp;nbsp;September 1996, and the crew began moving aboard from contract housing in Newport News in January 1998. The ship successfully completed builder's [[sea trial]] on 11&amp;nbsp;June 1998 after a short delay due to noise issues in one of the reactor closure heads. The ship was officially accepted by the Navy on 30 June 1998 and was commissioned on 25&amp;nbsp;July 1998 at [[Naval Station Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Agostinelli, Giampaolo (2003) ''Where Sea Meets the Sky: Us Navy - Cvw-3 - Uss Harry S Truman'' Naval Institute Press. p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commissioning===
The keynote speaker of the commissioning ceremony was [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Other notable attendees and speakers were: Rep. [[Ike Skelton]], D-Mo., who pushed to have the carrier named after the 33rd president; [[Missouri]] Governor [[Mel Carnahan]]; [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|Captain]] [[Thomas Otterbein]], ''Trumanâs'' first commanding officer; [[Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]]; and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John H. Dalton]].

=== 1998â1999 ===
''Truman'' got underway for the first time as a U.S. Navy carrier in August 1998 to conduct [[flight deck]] certifications, an evolution designed to test the shipâs ability to successfully launch and recover aircraft. That was followed by numerous at sea periods for various training evolutions.

===2000 Maiden deployment===
The [[Maiden voyage|Maiden deployment]] of ''Harry S. Truman'' began on 28 November 2000 with [[Carrier Air Wing 3]] (CVW-3) embarked. After transiting the [[Suez Canal]], the air wing flew 869 combat sorties in support of [[Operation Southern Watch]] (OSW), including a strike on Iraqi integrated air defense system sites on 16&amp;nbsp;February 2001, in a sanctioned response to [[Iraq]]i [[surface-to-air missile]] fire against United Nations Security Council coalition forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;truman.navy.mil&quot;/&gt; Combat operations ended on 27&amp;nbsp;April and the ship returned to the U.S. on 23&amp;nbsp;May 2001. She then entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Va., for her first Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) on 5&amp;nbsp;September.

=== 2002â2003 ===
'''HST''' deployed on her second deployment on 5 December 2002, again with CVW-3 embarked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=4925 |title= Harry S.

''Truman'' conducted her second Planned Incremental Availability at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from August 2003 to 13&amp;nbsp;February 2004.

=== 2004â2005 ===
[[Image:carrier2.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|The ship anchored outside [[Portsmouth]], [[England]], while her crew enjoys a port visit.]]

On 2 June 2004, ''HST'' &quot;surged&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=13905 |title= HST Strike Group Certifies, Pulses East |first= April |last= Phillips |date= 24&amp;nbsp;June 2004 |publisher= U.S.&amp;nbsp;Navy |accessdate= 2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Summer Pulse 04'', deploying to the Mediterranean Sea in support of the Navy's Fleet Response Plan. The ship ported in Naples, Italy, and participated in Operation Majestic Eagle in the eastern Atlantic Ocean before returning home on 25&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=14427 |title= Truman Returns from Summer Pulse '04 |first= April |last= Phillips |date= 26&amp;nbsp;July 2004 |publisher= U.S.&amp;nbsp;Navy |accessdate= 2011-03-20 }}  United States Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship set out from Norfolk on her third extended deployment on 13&amp;nbsp;October 2004, and visited Souda Bay, Crete, before relieving {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} on 20&amp;nbsp;November in the [[Persian Gulf]].

''Truman'' and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 3 launched 2,577&amp;nbsp;sorties, totaling nearly 13,000 flight hours, in support of OIF and maritime security operations (MSO) before being relieved by {{USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70|6}} Carrier Strike Group in the Persian Gulf on 19&amp;nbsp;March 2005. Despite plans to cross the equator and visit [[South Africa]], diplomatic issues caused her instead to transit the Suez Canal, stopping in Portsmouth, England, prior to returning home on 19&amp;nbsp;April 2005.

On 1 September 2005, in response to the disaster of [[Hurricane Katrina]], ''Truman'' set sail for the devastated U.S. Gulf Coast. She arrived in the Gulf of Mexico on 4&amp;nbsp;September and served as the flagship for the Naval task force. While the ship's strike group (Carrier Strike Group 10) commander, Rear Adm. Joseph Kilkenny, was appointed deputy commander of [[Joint Task Force Katrina|Joint Task Force (JTF) Gulf Coast]] (also known as JTF Katrina &amp; Rita), the ship remained anchored in the gulf and provided fresh desalinated water for the relief effort via helicopter (the actual command hub for the JTF was {{USS|Iwo Jima|LHD-7|6}}). The carrier also provided support to [[JRB New Orleans]] in the form of aviation boatswain's mates and cooks to keep that station in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helis.com/featured/katrina.php Hurricane Katrina]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harry S. Truman'' returned to home port in October 2005 after five weeks of relief efforts.

===2006===
''Harry S. Truman'' entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for a Docked Planned Incremental Availability in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=21950 |title= Truman Begins DPIA 2006 |first= John |last= Stevens |date= 13&amp;nbsp;January 2006 |publisher= U.S.&amp;nbsp;Navy |accessdate= 2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship received many system upgrades, and underwent preventative maintenance to repair minor weld defects originating from the initial construction of the reactor plants. She left the yard in December 2006 and continued preparations for surge beginning in April 2007.

===2007===
On 15 August 2007, an [[E-2C Hawkeye]] [[aviation accident|crashed]] after taking off from the carrier, killing all three crewmembers. On 5&amp;nbsp;November 2007 ''Harry S. Truman'' left Norfolk for her fourth extended deployment with CVW-3 embarked in support of OIF.

===2008===
''HST'' returned to the US on 4 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Naval Aviation News, Sept 2009, p16&lt;/ref&gt; She first pulled into port in [[Naval Station Mayport]], Florida in order to welcome aboard family and friends for a three-day &quot;[[Tiger Cruise]]&quot;, before returning to Norfolk Naval Station on 4&amp;nbsp;June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=37725 |title= USS Harry S.
