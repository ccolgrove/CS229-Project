==Regular season==
The Huskies' season began with the team ranked #2 in the AP Poll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/polls?poll=1&amp;date=2008-10-27  College Basketball â Rankings â Rivals.com]&lt;/ref&gt; behind the [[2008â09 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|University of North Carolina]]. Off to a quick start, UConn opened with a string of eleven straight victories over non-conference opponents, including a sweep of the [[Paradise Jam Tournament]] in the U.S. Virgin Islands. During this stretch, the Huskies faced three teams that were ranked in the Top 25, including #8 [[2008-09 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]] in an overtime thriller in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/recap?gid=200812200233  No. 2 UConn rallies past No. 8 Zags in OT]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Big East Conference game of the season came at home against [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], which the Huskies lost 74â63. This was the start of a 19-game stretch where 18 of the games were against conference opponents, and where their opponents were ranked in nine of the games. After this first loss, the Huskies went on to win 13 straight, staying comfortably atop the Big East Conference standings. Among these was a 68â51 victory at #7 [[2008â09 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]]â the eventual outright Big East Champions.

The Huskies reached #1 in the rankings on February 2, 2009, and held it for three weeks. During this span junior guard Jerome Dyson, one of the team's biggest scoring threats and its best guard defender, injured his knee. He would not be able to play for the rest of the season. The team spent the final few weeks of the regular season adjusting to their smaller rotation. A 76â68 loss at home to #4 [[2008-09 Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team|Pittsburgh]] knocked them from the top spot. They would win their next three games, including at #8 [[2008â09 Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team|Marquette]], which was Coach Jim Calhoun's 800th career victory in Division I basketball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/recap?gid=200902250339  Calhoun wins No. 800 as UConn beats Marquette]&lt;/ref&gt; After one week at #2, UConn was again #1 in the polls, until a loss at #3 Pittsburgh to finish the regular season once again bumped the Huskies from the top.

The Huskies finished the regular season with 27 wins and 3 losses, with a conference record of 15â3. The team was not ranked out of the top 5 in the AP Poll at any point in the season.

==Post-season==
In the Quarterfinals of the Big East Tournament, UConn took on [[2008â09 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]]. The game would prove to be a historic event, as it took a Big East record six overtimes before Syracuse ultimately triumphed, 127â117. The contest is tied as the second longest in NCAA Division I history.

The Huskies earned the #1 seed in the West Regional of the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. They began play in Philadelphia, PA, where they had two blowout victories against Chattanooga and Texas A&amp;M. They moved on to Glendale, AZ for the West regionals, first defeating Purdue 72â60, then outlasting a pressing Missouri squad in the Elite Eight, 82â75. 

The following weekend the Huskies were in Detroit, MI for a Final Four matchup against the Midwest's #2 seed, Michigan State. The game was close throughout, until the Spartans began to take control near the ten minute mark of the second half. UConn would make one last run and cut the deficit to three late in the game, but Michigan State made key free throws and held on to win, 82â73. UConn's final record was 31 wins and 5 losses.
