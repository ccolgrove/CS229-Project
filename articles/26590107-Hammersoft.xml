==History==
On April 24, 2007, Tom Mutch resigned as head coach of the women's ice hockey program. The resignation came in the wake of an inappropriate relationship with [[Kelli Stack]], a freshman who was the [[Hockey East]] Player and Rookie of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sweet | first = Laurel J. | title = BC hockey coach quits after sexy messages surface | newspaper = Boston Herald | pages = A2 | date = 25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' had printed an article earlier that day that detailed the alleged explicit [[text messaging]] that occurred between the married Tom Mutch and Stack. Mutch was forced to resign. Though a sexual relationship was never proven, the messages were said to be &quot;filthy&quot; by news reports at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/sports/index.ssf/2008/11/through_a_nightmare_and_toward.html Through a nightmare and toward a dream].&lt;/ref&gt;

October 2010: Taylor Wasylk scored a goal and assisted on Kelli Stackâs goal as the Eagles tied Quinnipiac 3-3. Against Brown, she scored twice as the Eagles prevailed by a 5-2 mark. She fired 13 shots on goal in the two contests and earned a +6 plus/minus rating. For her efforts, she was recognized as Hockey East Rookie of the Week for the third consecutive week. Wasylk's honor marks the first time in Boston College Eagles women's ice hockey history that a player has won a league award for three consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://bceagles.cstv.com/sports/w-hockey/spec-rel/102510aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Kelli Stack finished October 2010 with fifteen points (nine goals, six assists) in eight games for Boston College. Stack started every game at center and has accumulated points in every game. She finished the month leading the Eagles in points, goals, power play goals, and shorthanded goals. On October 31, she was involved in all three goals against Connecticut (one goal, two assists). She was part of all three goals scored at Vermont on October 15 (two goals, one assist). Against the Syracuse Orange (on October 9), Stack scored a hat trick. For her efforts, she was the October 2010 Hockey East Player of the Month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hockeyeastonline.com/women/pres1011/201011/nov1wwr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2011, with two points in the game against Boston University in the first round of the 2011 Beanpot Tournament, Kelli Stack accumulated 199 points in her career and broke BC's all-time career points record, becoming the new program leader.&lt;ref&gt;http://bceagles.cstv.com/sports/w-hockey/recaps/020811aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 2011, the Eagles beat the [[Northeastern Huskies women's ice hockey|Northeastern Huskies]] by a 3-1 tally to claim their first Hockey East Tournament championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://bceagles.cstv.com/sports/w-hockey/recaps/030611aab.html&lt;/ref&gt;
