'''Timothy Richard &quot;Tim&quot; Tebow'''&lt;ref name=&quot;coaching character&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Suzy|title=Coaching character|publisher=[[Gainesville Sun]]| url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20071007/NEWS/710060317|accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-en|ËtiËboÊ|pron}}; born August 14, 1987) is an [[American football]] player who is currently the starting [[quarterback]] for the [[Denver Broncos]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He was drafted by the Broncos as the 25th overall pick in the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Florida Gators football|Florida]].
 
Tebow played quarterback for [[Allen D. Nease Senior High School|Nease High School]] in [[Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida]] and was ranked among the top quarterback prospects in the nation as a high school [[Twelfth grade|senior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Tebow recruiting profile|publisher=[[Rivals.com]]| url=http://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?pr_key=31436|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He ultimately chose to attend the University of Florida.  Tebow was a [[Quarterback#Dual-threat quarterbacks|dual threat quarterback]], adept at rushing and passing the football.  As a college [[freshman]], the Gators' coaches largely used him as a change of pace to the team's more traditional passing quarterback, [[Chris Leak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Person|first=Joseph|title=Dual threat|publisher=[[The State (newspaper)]]| url=http://www.thestate.com/sports/story/225436.html|date=2007-11-10|accessdate=2007-11-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111084832/http://www.thestate.com/sports/story/225436.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow contributed to the Gators' [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006 college football season]] as a key back-up, helping the team win [[college football]]'s [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|national championship game]] for the first time since 1996.

During the [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007 season]], Tebow was Florida's [[starting lineup|starting]] quarterback and became the first college football player to both [[rush (American football)|rush]] and [[Forward pass|pass]] for 20 or more [[touchdown]]s in a single season and the first college [[sophomore]] to win the [[Heisman Trophy]].&lt;ref name=Twenty&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/11/17/sports/s125524S08.DTL|title=Tebow Becomes NCAA's First 20-20 Player |work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2007-11-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214214856/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/11/17/sports/s125524S08.DTL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to winning the Heisman Trophy, his 2007 performance earned him the [[Maxwell Award]] as the nation's top football player, the [[Davey O'Brien Award]] as the nation's best quarterback and the [[James E. Sullivan Award]] as the nation's most outstanding amateur athlete in any sport.  In [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008]], Tebow led Florida to its second national championship in three years.  He was named the offensive MVP of the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game|national championship game]].

During 2010, his rookie season with the Broncos, he played occasionally as a [[wildcat formation|wildcat]] quarterback, before being named as the starter for the final three games of the 2010 season, due to an injury to then-starter [[Kyle Orton]].  He began the 2011 season on the bench, but following a 1&amp;ndash;4 start by Orton, Tebow replaced him as the starter after week 5 of that season.  Orton was later released by the Broncos, securing Tebow's position as the starter.

==Early years==
[[File:Tebow army all american.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Tebow at the 2006 [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]] as a high school senior.]]
Tebow was born in [[Makati City]] in the [[Philippines]], the son of Pamela Pemberton Tebow, daughter of a U.S. Army colonel, and Robert Ramsey Tebow, a pastor, who were serving as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Baptist]] [[missionary|missionaries]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;coaching character&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;birthplace&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=The Philippines Is In His Heart| publisher=Filipinas Magazine| date=July 6, 2009| url=http://www.filipinasmag.com/?p=496| accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bobtebowassoc&quot;&gt;''[http://www.btea.org/aboutus.asp The Tebow Family]'' Bob Tebow Evangelistic Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tamptr&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Joey|coauthors=|title=A CUT ABOVE|pages=|publisher=Tampa Tribune|date=2005-05-12|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampatribune/access/950609991.html?dids=950609991:950609991&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+25%2C+2005&amp;author=JOEY+JOHNSTON&amp;pub=Tampa+Tribune&amp;desc=A+CUT+ABOVE&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sunsent&gt;{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Dave|coauthors=|title=Tebow family's vision runs much deeper than just TDs|pages=|publisher=The Sun Sentinel|date=2008-08-08|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/other/sfl-flsptebowdad08sbaug08,0,5446800.story|accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; While pregnant, his mother suffered a life-threatening infection with a pathogenic [[amoeba]]. Because of the drugs used to rouse her from a [[coma]] and to treat her [[dysentery]], the fetus experienced a severe [[placental abruption]]. Doctors had expected a [[stillbirth]] and recommended an [[abortion]] to protect her life,&lt;ref name=&quot;coaching character&quot;/&gt; although abortions are illegal in the Philippines, but she remained undaunted and refused having an abortion. 

Tebow is the youngest of five children, with sisters Christy and Katie, and brothers Robby and Peter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesville.com/article/20071007/NEWS/710060317&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the Tebow children were [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] by their mother, who worked to instill the family's Christian beliefs along the way.&lt;ref name=&quot;bobtebowassoc&quot; /&gt; In 1996, legislation was passed in Florida allowing homeschooled students to compete in local high school sporting events. The law specifies that homeschooled students may participate on the team of the local school in the [[school district]] in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodbread|first=Chase|title=She Fought the Law and Tebow Won|publisher=[[The Florida Times-Union]]| url=http://www.flhef.org/newsflashes/tebow.html|date=January 1, 2006|accessdate=2007-11-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070820120330/http://www.flhef.org/newsflashes/tebow.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tebows lived in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and Tim played linebacker and tight end at the local Trinity Christian Academy for one season. Tebow's preferred position was quarterback, but Trinity football team's offense did not rely on passing the football, so he began to explore his options to play for a new high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glier|first=Ray|title=Parents, high school officials at odds over motivation for athletes' transfers|work=[[USA Today]]| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2006-11-21-transfers-cover_x.htm|date=November 21, 2006|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to attend Nease High School, which under head coach Craig Howard was known for having a passing offense. With the rest of his family living on a farm in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], Tim and his mother moved into an apartment in nearby [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]], making him eligible to play for the football team at [[Allen D. Nease Senior High School|Nease]]. His performance soon turned heads and led to a minor controversy regarding the fact that he was a home-schooled student having his choice of school to play for.&lt;ref name=&quot;tbo_sports&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=A Cut Above |last=Johnston |first=Joey| publisher=[[The Tampa Tribune]] | url=http://gators.tbo.com/gators/MGBQVFCAMHE.html|date=December 25, 2005|accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a junior at Nease, Tebow gained prominence as he became a [[Football Bowl Subdivision|major college football]] quarterback prospect and was named the state of Florida's Player of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;player of year&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=SAHS' Wiles, Nease's Tebow win state football awards |last=Barney |first=Justin| publisher=St Augustine Record | url=http://www.staugustine.com/stories/120905/spo_3507267.shtml|date=December 9, 2005|accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would repeat as Player of the Year in his senior season.&lt;ref name=&quot;player of year&quot; /&gt; One of his highlights as a high school athlete was finishing a game on a broken leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn heisman story&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida QB Tebow was the first underclassman to win the Heisman|publisher=[[ESPN]]| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3146714| date=2007-12-08 | accessdate=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his senior season he led the Nease Panthers to a state title, earned All-State honors, was named Florida's Mr. Football and a ''[[Parade Magazine|Parade]]'' magazine high school All-American.&lt;ref&gt;[http://all-americans.parade.com/2006_football/story.html 2006 Parade All-Americans]&lt;/ref&gt; Tebow finished his high school career with 9,810 passing yards, 3,186 rushing yards, 95 passing touchdowns and 62 rushing touchdowns. He played in the [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]] in [[San Antonio]], Texas which features the top 78 senior high school football players in the nation and is shown nationally on NBC television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivals100.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=880&amp;CID=497018 Tebow practices in Army All-American Bowl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow was considered one of the nation's top recruits and was the subject of an [[ESPN]] &quot;Faces in Sports&quot; documentary. The segment was titled &quot;Tim Tebow: The Chosen One&quot;, and focused on Tim's homeschool controversy and missionary work in the Philippines, as well as his exploits on the field of play and the college recruiting process.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://alabama.scout.com/2/477962.html Tim Tebow Takes Center Stage]'' Scout.com&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Tebow was also featured in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on the &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot; page.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.staugustine.com/stories/122104/spo_2770650.shtml Tebow in SI's Faces in the Crowd]'' St. Augustine Record&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he was named to [[FHSAA's All-Century Team]] that listed the Top 33 football players in the state of Florida's 100 year history of high school football.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fhsaa.org/news/2007/1212.htm FHSAA Announces All-Century Team]'' Florida High School Athletic Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having family ties to the University of Florida, where his parents first met as students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tebow Family|publisher=Bob Tebow Evangelistic Association| url=http://www.btea.org/aboutus.asp|accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tebow remained open-minded during the recruiting process and became very close to [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] coach [[Mike Shula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama Gets Close-Up Look at Florida's Tebow|last=Long |first=Mark| publisher=[[The Ledger]] | url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060928/NEWS/609280452/|date=September 28, 2006|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After careful consideration he decided to play for [[Urban Meyer]]'s [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]]. One of the reasons he chose Florida was because of Meyer's [[spread offense|spread option]] offense, an offense for which Tebow was deemed an archetypal quarterback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To one lucky program's delight, Tebow sweepstakes end today|publisher=[[Gainesville Sun]]| url=http://www.gainesvillesun.com/article/20051213/SPORTS/51213005|accessdate=2008-04-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow spent the last three summers before enrolling at the University of Florida in the Philippines, assisting with his father's orphanage and missionary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UF's success is Tebow's mission|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]| url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/08/12/Sports/UF_s_success_is_Tebow.shtml|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In answer to a 2009 interview question, Tebow stated that he was a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncaafootball.fanhouse.com/2009/07/23/tim-tebow-says-hes-still-a-virgin-saving-himself-for-marriage/|title=Tim Tebow Says He's Still a Virgin, Saving Himself for Marriage|author=Travis, Clay|date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was subject to much discussion about whether the question was necessary, including criticism of the reporter who originally asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/11979655|title=Tebow chaste-land: Decorum dies a little when pigskin meets 'Porky's'|author=Dodd, Dennis|date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on homeschooling movement===
On January 7, 2007, Tebow was featured prominently in an [[ESPN]] &quot;Outside The Lines&quot; feature on homeschooled athletes seeking equal access to high school athletics in other states. Because a homeschooler's access to public and private school athletic functions vary by state, Tebow and [[New York Jets]] defensive end [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] (who was allowed to play at his local high school in [[Pennsylvania]]) argue in favor of extending the right to play for local teams to more states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6Yg8Bwa3EY |title=ESPN Outside the Lines - January 7, 2007 |publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon becoming the first home-schooled athlete to be nominated for the Heisman Trophy, Tebow remarked, &quot;That's really cool. A lot of times people have this stereotype of homeschoolers as not very athletic â it's like, go win a  [[spelling bee]] or something like that â it's an honor for me to be the first one to do that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usadaily.com/article.cfm?articleID=188229 |title=Homeschooler Snaps Up Heisman Nomination |last=Lyman|first=Isabel |date=December 6, 2007 |publisher=USA Daily |accessdate=2007-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214012233/http://www.usadaily.com/article.cfm?articleID=188229 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow's example inspired equal access supporters in [[Alabama]] to name their bill in the [[Alabama Legislature]] &quot;The Tim Tebow Bill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timtebowbill.com |title=The State of Alabama's &quot;Tim Tebow Bill&quot; |accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill, which is pending in the Alabama Legislature, will allow Alabama homeschool athletes to play for their local high school teams just as Tebow did in Florida.

In January 2009, the &quot;Tebow bill&quot; was introduced in the [[Kentucky General Assembly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LRC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/09rs/SB44.htm|title=Senate Bill 44|publisher=Kentucky Legislative Research Commission|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill, which is still pending, is also modeled after Florida state law, allowing homeschool athletes to play for their local sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentucky.com/181/story/661927.html |title='Tebow bill' hits home |first=Valarie |last=Honeycutt Spears |publisher=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]] |date=2009-01-18 |accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow received the 2008 Quaqua ProtÃ©gÃ© Award as an outstanding home-education graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quaqua.org/protegerec.htm |title='Tebow Biography'|accessdate=2009-06-07}} {{cite web |url=http://www.quaqua.org/protege.htm |title='Protege Award'|accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==

As one of the most highly recruited quarterback prospects in the nation, Tebow received an [[athletic scholarship]] to attend the University of Florida in [[Gainesville, Florida]], where he played for coach [[Urban Meyer]]'s [[Florida Gators football]] team from [[2006 Florida Gators football team|2006]] to [[2009 Florida Gators football team|2009]].&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide&gt;''[http://web.gatorzone.com/football/media/2011/media_guide.pdf  2011 Florida Gators Football Media Guide]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 74&amp;ndash;75, 77, 81, 86, 89, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100&amp;ndash;103, 1`25, 127, 136, 138&amp;ndash;140, 141&amp;ndfash;142, 144, 146&amp;ndash;148, 152, 158, 159, 162, 171&amp;ndash;173, 186 (2011).  Retrieved August 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  From his freshman season in 2006, when he was a backup behind the Gators' career passing yardage leader, [[Chris Leak]], to his [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning sophomore season in 2007, to his BCS Championship-winning junior season in 2008, to his 13&amp;ndash;1 senior season, Tebow left an indelible legacy on the Florida Gators football program.  The Gators coaches selected him as a [[captain (sports)|team captain]] in 2008 and 2009, and he is the only three-time recipient of the Gators' most valuable player award, having been chosen by his teammates in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

===2006===
{{See also|2006 Florida Gators football team}}

Tebow started his career at Florida in the 2006 &quot;Orange and Blue&quot; Spring scrimmage, where he completed 15 of 21 pass attempts for 197 yards and one touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatorcountry.org/wearetheboys/?cat=12 Orange and Blue Scrimmage Game]&lt;/ref&gt; Coach Urban Meyer declared that Leak would remain the starting quarterback despite the expectations and performance of Tebow in the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alligator.org/pt2/060424foot1.php ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the 2006 season, Tebow was listed by ''Sports Illustrated'' as college football's future top mobile quarterback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/luke_winn/08/22/mobileQB.partthree/index.html |title=The next generation: Plenty of young mobile QBs ready to showcase talent |last=Winn |first=Luke |work=[[Sports Illustrated]]/[[CNN]] |date=August 22, 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Tebow remained the freshman backup behind senior Chris Leak throughout the season, Tebow was a significant contributor to the Gators' 2006 success.

Tebow made his college debut coming off the bench behind Chris Leak in a [[goal line (American football)|goal line]] situation against [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]]. He rushed for a touchdown on a designed quarterback scramble on his first play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores106/106245/NCAAF701468.htm Southern Miss vs. Florida USA Today]&lt;/ref&gt; In his next game, he led the team in rushing yards against [[UCF Golden Knights football|UCF]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=262520057 Florida Gators vs UCF Knights ESPN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow made his SEC debut against the [[2006 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]] on September 16. His performance included a ten-yard run on his first carry and converting a critical fourth down near the end of the game, which led to the Gators' go-ahead touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap?gid=200609160071 Florida-Tennessee game recap]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow's biggest game in the season came against the [[2006 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] on October 7, where he accounted for all three of the Gators' touchdowns, passing for two and rushing for another. Tebow had a one-yard run on the goal line for his first score, a one-yard &quot;jump pass&quot; to tight end Tate Casey, in which he jumped in the air and double-pumped his arm before releasing the ball, and a 35-yard play-action pass to [[wide receiver]] [[Louis Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/gators/news-article.aspx?storyid=66505 Firstcoastnews.com | Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Brunswick | Tim Tebow Excels as Florida Tops LSU 23-10&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow played a role in the Gators' victory in the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game]] against [[2006 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]. He threw for one touchdown and rushed for another, finishing with 39 rushing yards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls06/bowls?game=bcs 2007 Tostitos BCS National Championship game]&lt;/ref&gt;  He finished 2006 with the second-most rushing yards on the Gator team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gatorzone.com/football/history/2006/review.pdf |title=Season Review |publisher=Gatorzone.com |accessdate=2007-12-05|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow was named the starting quarterback for the Florida Gators for the 2007 season and was tipped by ''[[Sporting News]]'' to be one of college football's &quot;Breakout Players of 2007&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=162465 |title=Year in Preview: Made men |publisher=[[The Sporting News]] |accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gators' offense in 2007 was expected to be similar to what Urban Meyer used at [[Utah Utes football|Utah]].  Meyer viewed Tebow's abilities as being &quot;very similar to [[Alex Smith]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&amp;id=2765329 |title=Tebow's growth as a passer key for Gators |last=Schlabach|first=Mark |date=February 14, 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith had been a highly effective dual threat quarterback for Meyer's last team at Utah in 2004, and led the Utes to play in and win a [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl game, the first team from outside the [[BCS conference]]s to do so.   Smith went on to be the top overall pick in the [[2005 NFL Draft]].

Questions loomed as to whether or not Tebow was skilled enough as a passer to be able to carry the responsibilities of a starting quarterback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272440057&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines |title=Florida's Tebow throws for 300 yards, 3 TDs in debut as starter |date=September 2, 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he opened the year 13-of-17 for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns in his starting debut against [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football|Western Kentucky University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/02/ap/sportsline/main3227782.shtml Tebow Shines As Gators Crush W.

Additionally, he rushed 194 times for 838 yards and 22 touchdowns on the ground through 11 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2007&amp;div=4&amp;rpt=IA_playerpasseff |title=Bowl Subdivision (FBS) National Player Report: Passing Efficiency |publisher=[[NCAA]] |accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow's 51 touchdowns were more than 87 Division 1-A Teams scored.&lt;ref&gt;http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2007&amp;div=4&amp;rpt=IA_teamscoroff&amp;site=org&lt;/ref&gt;

In week 4 of the season, when the Gators faced [[2007 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss]] in an SEC match-up, Tebow broke the school record for rushing yards by a quarterback in one game, with 166 yards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?sport=footb&amp;id=12642&amp;html=0 Tebow has big day against Ole Miss]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, against [[2007 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]], Tebow rushed for two touchdowns to break the all-time SEC quarterback TD record in a single season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273070057 Tebow breaks record against Vanderbilt]&lt;/ref&gt; Against [[2007 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], leading by 10 in the 4th quarter, Tebow was largely ineffective and had a turnover as he was unable to lead his team to any score, and LSU came back to win the game. LSU went on to win the 2007 National Championship.

In a game versus the [[2007 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina Gamecocks]] on November 10, Tebow broke the school record for rushing touchdowns in a season and set a career high with 5 rushing touchdowns. This brought his season total to 19 rushing touchdowns, which tied him for the SEC record for any player in a season (shared with [[Shaun Alexander]], [[Garrison Hearst]], and [[LaBrandon Toefield]]). He also broke [[Danny Wuerffel]]'s conference record for touchdowns accounted for in a single season with 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071111/SPORTS/711110354/1002/SPORTS |title=Florida Gators' Tebow terrorizes South Carolina |publisher=[[Florida Today]] |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080511140231/http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071111/SPORTS/711110354/1002/SPORTS &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, Tebow had a record day against [[2007 Florida Atlantic Owls football team|Florida Atlantic]], he scored his 20th rushing touchdown to set a new conference record for most rushing touchdowns in a season. He also became the only person ever in NCAA History to score 20 touchdowns rushing and 20 touchdowns passing in the same season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twenty&quot;/&gt;

On November 24, against the [[2007 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]], Tebow threw for three touchdowns and rushed for two in a 45â12 rout of the Seminoles. It was later revealed that Tebow [[bone fracture|fractured]] his right hand during the third quarter but played the rest of the game. He had to wear a cast for the next three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/ncaa/specials/bowls/2007/12/14/tebow.cast.ap/ |title=Tebow practices without cast |date=December 14, 2007 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=2007-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071218173534/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/ncaa/specials/bowls/2007/12/14/tebow.cast.ap/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2007 season was over, Tebow was recognized as a first-team All-SEC selection and a consensus first-team [[All-American]],&lt;ref&gt;''2010 Division I Football Records Book'', [http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/DI/2010/Awards.pdf  Award Winners and All-Americans], National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 12 (2010).  Retrieved April 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a favorite for the [[Heisman Trophy]], given to the most outstanding college football player of the year, which he won on December 8 in New York City. He also received the [[Davey O'Brien Award]], annually given to the best quarterback in the nation, on February 18 in Fort Worth, Texas.

While the Gators finished the season in [[Orlando, Florida]] with a 41â35 loss to [[2007 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in the [[2008 Capital One Bowl]], Tebow maintained his record for both rushing and passing for at least one touchdown in every game played, and he raised the record for total touchdowns accounted for in a single season to 55.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=13153&amp;sport=footb&amp;html=0 Capital One Bowl, Gatorzone]&lt;/ref&gt; He played with a soft cast on the hand he broke in his previous game.

====Heisman Trophy====

On December 8, 2007, Tebow was awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]], finishing ahead of Arkansas's [[Darren McFadden]], Hawaii's [[Colt Brennan]], and Missouri's [[Chase Daniel]]. He was the first [[wiktionary:underclassman|underclassman]] to have ever won the Heisman Trophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn heisman story&quot; /&gt; He garnered 462 first place votes and 1957 points, 254 points ahead of runner-up Arkansas running back Darren McFadden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expanded Heisman Trophy voting results|publisher=NBC Sports| url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/6700005/| date= | accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the regular season as the only player in [[Division I (NCAA)|FBS]] history to rush and pass for at least 20 touchdowns in both categories in the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tim Tebow First Sophomore to Win Heisman|publisher=New York Times| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/sports/ncaafootball/09heisman.html?ref=sports| date=2007-12-08 | accessdate=2007-12-08 | first=Joshua | last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 32 passing touchdowns, and 23 rushing touchdowns.

Before the 2007 season had even come to a close, Florida coach Urban Meyer stated that he would likely use two quarterbacks during the 2008 season to take some of the workload off of Tebow's shoulders.&lt;ref name=2QBs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/orl-caponenotes2907dec29,0,1660313.story |title=Urban Meyer plans to use 2-QB system in 2008 |date=December 29, 2007 |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow led the Gators in rushing in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teams/stats?teamId=57&amp;year=2007 |title=Florida Gators Statistics - 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also had to play through a bruised shoulder and broken non-throwing hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;2QBs&quot;/&gt;

Before the 2008 season even started, Tebow had his name pulled from consideration for the Playboy Preseason All-American team because it conflicted with his Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-07-30-tebow-playboy_N.htm |title=Devout Heisman winner declines spot in 'Playboy' lineup | work=USA Today | first1=Tim |last1=Murphy |date=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2008, playing against the [[2008 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]], Tebow ran for his 37th rushing touchdown, breaking the school record previously held by former Florida running back [[Emmitt Smith]].

Tebow led the Gators to a 12&amp;ndash;1 record in 2008.  After clinching the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division title, the team played for and won the SEC title in the [[2008 SEC Championship Game]] against the [[2008 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]].  The win secured the #2 ranking in the final [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#BCS rankings|BCS standings]], which earned the Gators the chance to play the #1 ranked [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]] in the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game]], which they won 24&amp;ndash;14.

On December 13, 2008, Tebow finished third in the 2008 Heisman Trophy voting, with Oklahoma's [[Sam Bradford]] taking the top spot followed by Texas' [[Colt McCoy]], despite Tebow receiving the most first-place votes.&lt;ref name=Heisman08&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3767667 |title=Oklahoma quarterback Bradford wins Heisman |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow also won the Maxwell Award in 2008, becoming only the second player to win the award twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3763720|title=Florida Gators QB Tim Tebow second two-time winner of Maxwell Award|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|2009 Florida Gators football team}}

Tebow opened the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009 season]] continuing a streak of throwing and running for a touchdown in blowout wins over [[Charleston Southern]] and [[2009 Troy Trojans football team|Troy]].  He ran for a touchdown in the third game, a win against [[2009 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]], but failed to throw for a touchdown for the first time since his freshman season.

Tebow started against [[2009 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]] despite suffering from a respiratory illness and taking two bags of intravenous fluids before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/3717/tebow-rest-of-gators-expected-to-play |title=Tebow, rest of Gators expected to play |last=Low |first=Chris |work=ESPN |date=September 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran for two touchdowns to put him in 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown. Late in the third quarter, he was hit in the chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham and then in the back of the head while falling by the knee of Florida tackle [[Marcus Gilbert (American football)|Marcus Gilbert]]. Upon impact, he briefly displayed a prominent [[Fencing Response]] with his left arm, indicating that a concussion had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.alligator.org/articles/2009/09/29/sports/football/090929_foot.txt |title=&quot;Fencing response&quot; key indicator of concussion |last=McCall |first=Mike |date=September 29, 2009 |work=The Independent Florida Alligator }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped to the sidelines. Once there, he vomited. He was taken by ambulance to the [[Albert B.

On October 31, 2009, while playing against the [[2009 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]], Tebow ran for his 50th and 51st rushing touchdowns, breaking the SEC career record previously held by former Georgia running back [[Herschel Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Eichelberger |first=Curtis |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=apbrberk7GqY |work=Bloomberg News |date=October 31, 2009 |title=Florida's Tebow Breaks Walker's SEC Touchdown Record }}&lt;/ref&gt; His penultimate collegiate game, the 2009 SEC Championship saw him once again facing the University of Alabama. After a poor performance from the QB, the game ended in a Florida loss with Tebow on the sideline in tears. In the [[2010 Sugar Bowl]], Tebow's last college game, he had 533 yards of total offenseâa record for a  [[Bowl Championship Series]] gameâand accounted for four touchdowns in a 51â24 Florida win against [[2009 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tebow caps college career with 533 yards, Sugar Bowl romp|publisher=ESPN.

==&quot;The Tebow Rule&quot;==
In 2010, a new rule for the next NCAA football season, dubbed '''&quot;The Tebow Rule&quot;'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Tebow Rule 2&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sportscenter/post/_/id/31088/tim-tebow-rules-according-to-the-ncaa |title=Tim Tebow Rules!

In the 2009 BCS Championship Game, he wore [[John 3:16]] on his eye paint, and as a result, 92 million people searched &quot;John 3:16&quot; on Google during or shortly after the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tebow Rule 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tebow Rule&quot; /&gt; Additionally, later, when Tebow switched to another verse, there were 3.43 million searches of &quot;Tim Tebow&quot; and &quot;Proverbs 3:5-6&quot; together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google search&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college_uf/2009/09/tebow-draws-more-attention-for-eyeblack-messages.html |title=Tebow draws more attention for eye-black messages â Swamp Things â Gators Blog â Orlando Sentinel |publisher=Blogs.orlandosentinel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tebow stated of the searches &quot;It just goes to show you the influence and the platform that you have as a student-athlete and as a quarterback at Florida&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google search&quot;/&gt;

The NFL already has a rule like this in prohibiting players from wearing messages on eye black; so, Tebow would not be able to continue the practice in the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tebow Rule&quot; /&gt; Despite the media labeling it as the Tebow rule, the NCAA denies the rule was influenced by Tebow particularly, since many other notable players ([[Reggie Bush]] and [[Terrelle Pryor]] for example) wear or have worn messages on eye black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=231&amp;articleid=20100416_231_B3_INDIAN106579 |title=NCAA bans wedge, eye black |publisher=Tulsa World |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eye paint&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/16/ncaa-bans-eye-black-with_n_541201.html |title=NCAA Bans Eye Black With Messages |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An NCAA spokesman said &quot;When this rule was proposed the committee did not focus on any one team or student athlete. That measure reinforces what the intended use of eye black is, which is to shade the eyes from the sun.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eye paint&quot; /&gt;

==Professional career==
===Pre-draft===
After passing on the [[2009 NFL Draft]] for his senior season at Florida, Tebow went on to enter the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. Despite his college success, Tebow's NFL potential was much debated. According to former [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] coach [[Jon Gruden]], he could &quot;revolutionize&quot; the pro game. Says Gruden: &quot;Tim Tebow is 250 pounds, and he's the strongest human being that's ever played the position. He can throw well enough at any level.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/feb/08/080012/sp-gruden-not-holding-grudge/sports/ |title=Gruden Not Holding Grudge |newspaper=Tamba Tribune |date=February 8, 2009 |last=Kaufman |first=Ira }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Indianapolis Colts]] coach [[Tony Dungy]] said he would pick Tebow with a top 10 pick, and would take him over any quarterback in the 2010 draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=cr-inconvenienttruths112509&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Debate over Tebow's draft standing in full swing |work=Yahoo! Sports |last=Robinson |first=Charles |date=November 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, NFL analyst [[Mel Kiper, Jr.]] believes Tebow does not have the intangibles to play quarterback in the NFL. &quot;I don't think he can be a fulltime quarterback. I don't think he can be the quarterback of the future for you, but I do think in the third round, maybe the second round, he'll be the same as [[Pat White (American football)|Pat White]]&quot;, said Kiper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/apr/27/271621/kiper-tebow-not-nfl-quaterback/sports-colleges/ |title=Kiper: Tebow not an NFL-caliber quarterback |newspaper=Tamba Tribune |last=Richardson |first=Anwar |date=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow was particularly mentioned as a potential third round pick of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], his hometown team. Some, including Florida governor [[Charlie Crist]], believe that Tebow could be the remedy for dwindling Jaguars ticket sales at [[EverBank Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2009-12-08/story/draft_tebow_for_the_jaguars_florida_gov_crist_says |title=Draft Tebow for the Jaguars, Florida Gov. Crist says |last=Hunt |first=David |date=December 8, 2009 |newspaper=The Florida Times-Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early in the 2009 season, Jaguars owner [[Wayne Weaver]] stated: &quot;He (Tebow) clearly is an outstanding football player and would be an asset to any football organization. Clearly there's going to be a groundswell for Tebow, and we'll have to make that evaluation if we have a draft pick that's going to be anywhere near him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kuharsky, Paul: [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4478730] ESPN/NFL/AFC-South, September 16, 2009, &quot;Jags owner: Drafting Tebow possible&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone in the organization agreed, as Jaguar lineman [[Uche Nwaneri]] posted doubts about Tebow's potential NFL success on his team's website message board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.jaguars.com/index.php?showtopic=681930 |title=jaguars.com forum - Some things you should know before you buy into tebow jesus - Jaguars Forum |publisher=Forum.jaguars.com |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denver Broncos===
====2010====
Tebow was drafted by the [[Denver Broncos]] 25th overall in the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. The Broncos received the pick from the [[Baltimore Ravens]] for draft picks in the second, third and fourth rounds of the 2010 NFL Draft. Broncos head coach [[Josh McDaniels]] said about his two first-round selections, which included Tebow, &quot;We want players who are tough, smart, have great character, love football and are passionate about coming here and helping the Broncos win a championship. I think both players fit that role, and I think that's something that we're looking for in all of our players. What we're trying to build here is team chemistry and a team that cares about winning and winning a championship, and that's it.&quot; He also added specifically about Tebow, &quot;He has all the traits you look for. It's a good pick.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legacy&quot; /&gt; Tebow responded in an interview, saying, &quot;My greatest joy in Denver is going to be to repay Coach McDaniels for believing in me.&quot; Tebow also said of his critics, &quot;I just have a passion to play football. When you do things different than other people sometimes do them, and you don't settle for just being average, you open yourself up for criticism. But, I'm ready for it. I've learned to live with it. I never just wanted to do things the same way everybody else does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft10/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&amp;id=5127828 |title=2010 NFL Draft: Tim Tebow realizes dream when Denver Broncos select him in first round with 25th pick - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ESPN]]'s Bill Williamson said, &quot;Josh McDaniels' legacy ''is'' Tim Tebow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legacy&quot; &gt;{{cite web|last=Williamson |first=Bill |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afcwest/post/_/id/12461/mcdaniels-legacy-is-tebow |title=Josh McDaniels' legacy is Tim Tebow - AFC West Blog - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked how Tebow will be used, McDaniels commented that Tebow probably won't start at QB as a rookie; although, he said he'll &quot;play when he's ready.&quot; He also said that there could be some packages custom-made for Tebow right away and indicated that he could initially contribute to Denver's variation of the [[wildcat formation]], called the wild horse formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legacy&quot; /&gt;

''[[The Denver Post]]'' columnist [[Woody Paige]] praised the pick, saying &quot;Tim Tremendous may be high risk, but he will be a Mile High Reward...Tebow has become the most celebrated fourth-string rookie quarterback in NFL history, the most controversial quarterback pick by the Broncos since [[Tommy Maddox]] was chosen in exactly the same spot in the first round in 1992, the most decorated player and the most determined quarterback, and the most puzzling dichotomy, in the entire draft.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/paige/ci_14941740 Paige]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow wore number 15 on his jersey for the Broncos, the same number he wore in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/page.php?id=498&amp;contentID=11097 |title=â Official Website Of The Denver Broncos |publisher=Denverbroncos.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He set an NFL Draft record for jersey sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=aSIiAMznz60k |title=Tebow Sets Jersey Sales Record for NFL Draftee, Topping Sanchez |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had the best-selling jersey in the entire NFL each month since being drafted.  The Broncos, as a whole, led the NFL among all teams in jersey sales as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nfl.com/2010/07/07/tebow-leads-league-in-jersey-sales/ NFL.com Blogs Â» Blog Archive Tebow leads league in jersey sales Â«&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5165547 |title=Tim Tebow's No. 15 No. 1 in April NFL jersey sales - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2010, Tebow signed a five-year contract with the Broncos that had a base value of $11.25 million (he can make as much as $33 million through certain performance-based incentives).  The contract also included $8.7 million guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On October 17, 2010, Tebow scored his first NFL touchdown, which was a five-yard running play against the [[New York Jets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hiatt, Gabe |title='Tooth and Nail' |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Tooth-and-Nail/676efcd5-1025-45bc-85f0-dbe3493c4c49 |publisher=''denverbroncos.com'' |date=October 17, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 14, 2010, Tebow threw a three-yard touchdown pass to [[Spencer Larsen]] on his first career NFL pass attempt, as part of a 49-29 home victory over the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  He also added a one-yard rushing touchdown in the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301114007 Kyle Orton, Broncos jump out early, follow through to rout Chiefs].  Associated Press.  November 14, 2010.  Accessed November 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  His performance against the Chiefs earned him his first [[Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week]] honor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/partner?partnerType=rookies&amp;season=2010&amp;seasonType=REG&amp;week=10&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow [[starting lineup|started]] his first NFL game on December 19, 2010, which was a 39-23 road loss to the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301219013&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow completed eight of 16 passes for 138 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown pass.  He also rushed for 78 yards, 40 of which came on a touchdown run in the first quarter of the game.  It was the longest touchdown run for a quarterback in Broncos history and the longest touchdown run in NFL history for a quarterback in his first start. Tebow became just the third quarterback in NFL history to throw for a touchdown of 30 or more yards and run for a touchdown of 40 or more yards in the same game.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/afcwest/post/_/id/22013/tim-tebow-bought-himself-more-work&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the game with a 100.5 passer rating, the highest ever in team history for a professional debut.

Tebow's first career victory came in his second start on December 26, 2010.  The Broncos defeated the [[Houston Texans]], 24-23, in Denver.  Tebow helped rally the Broncos from a 17-0 deficit at halftime, as he finished the game with 308 passing yards and one touchdown pass.  He also added a fourth quarter rushing touchdown, which capped the comeback.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301226007&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow received his second Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honor following his performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/partner?partnerType=rookies&amp;season=2010&amp;seasonType=REG&amp;week=16&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow finished his rookie season playing sparingly in six games as a back-up (primarily on plays involving the wild horse formation, which is Denver's variation of the [[wildcat formation]]) before starting the last three games of the Broncos' season.  He threw for a total of 654 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions.  He also rushed for 227 yards and six touchdowns.  Tebow became the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for a touchdown in each of his first three career starts.

====2011====
Tebow began the [[2011 NFL season]] as the the [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]]' backup [[quarterback]], with [[Kyle Orton]] acting as the starter. After a 1&amp;ndash;4 start and some poor performances, Orton was replaced by Tebow at halftime during a home game against the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]] in the fifth week of the season. Tebow nearly led the Broncos back from a 16-point deficit, as he passed and ran for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, but San Diego ultimately won the game 29&amp;ndash;24. Shortly afterward, Broncos head coach [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] announced Tebow would start in the following game on the road against the [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]]. Tebow and the Broncos struggled in the first three-and-a-half quarters against Miami, but rallied from a 15&amp;ndash;0 deficit in the last three minutes to win the game 18&amp;ndash;15 in overtime. Denver became the first team in NFL history to win a game after being down by at least 15 points with three minutes to play in a game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-Triumph-in-Overtime/a39387ce-8dc1-4bde-a985-c57db3f599f0&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, Tebow rushed for 117 yards, along with passing for 124 yards and two touchdowns, as part of a 38&amp;ndash;24 road victory over the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]]. It was the first game in his NFL career that he rushed for at least 100 yards. Broncos [[running back]] [[Willis McGahee]] ran for 163 yards and two touchdowns, making Tebow and McGahee only the fifth quarterback/running back tandem in NFL history to run for at least 100 yards in the same game.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311106013&lt;/ref&gt; Denver followed up with a 17&amp;ndash;10 road win over another divisional rival, the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]]. Tebow completed two passes on eight attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown. His second completion, a 56-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to [[Eric Decker]] gave Denver a 17-7 lead and sealed the game. Tebow became the fifth quarterback since 1980 to win a game after being the sole quarterback on the winning team to complete two or fewer passes.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311113012&lt;/ref&gt; The next week, Tebow completed 9-of-18 passes for 104 yards in a [[Thursday Night Football]] home game against the [[New York Jets|Jets]]. He led a 95-yard, game-winning touchdown drive with less than six minutes to play, and the Broncos trailing, 13&amp;ndash;10. On 3rd-and-4, Tebow ran for a 20-yard touchdown with 58 seconds left. The Broncos won the game, 17&amp;ndash;13.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311117007&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==

Tebow appeared on the September 2008 cover of ''[[Men's Fitness]]'' magazine.

On April 8, 2010, Tebow was announced as the cover athlete for all three game platforms of the video game [[NCAA Football 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/108/1082609p1.html|title=EA Sports Announces Tim Tebow as NCAA Football Cover Athlete|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow is a [[spokesperson]] for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Jockey International]] and FRS Health Energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-04-08/sports/os-tim-tebow-nike-0408-20100408_1_tim-tebow-nike-family-nfl-draft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jockey.com/tebow/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-12-21/sports/sfl-tim-tebow-frs-healthy-energy-drink-122110_1_tim-tebow-foundation-endorsement-deal-gators&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebow was the first quarterback featured in [[ESPN]]'s &quot;Year of the Quarterback&quot; series in 2011.  The documentary, entitled &quot;Tim Tebow:  Everything in Between,&quot; followed him from the [[2010 Sugar Bowl]] to the [[2010 NFL Draft]].  It premiered on January 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2011/01/06/tebow-documenary-is-captivating-tv/6432/ | work=Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2011 the documentary was released on [[DVD]].

On May 31, 2011, [[HarperCollins]] released ''Through My Eyes'', an autobiography that Tebow co-wrote with author Nathan Whitaker.&lt;ref name=jones6022011&gt;Lindsay H. Jones, &quot;[http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_18187995  Tim Tebow's autobiography, &quot;Through My Eyes,&quot; offers closer look at Denver Broncos quarterback],&quot; ''The Denver Post'' (June 2, 2011).  Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow details his early life growing up in Jacksonville and the Philippines, as well as his college football experiences.&lt;ref name=jones6022011/&gt;  By June 1, 2011, the book had risen to No. 22 on Amazon.com's bestseller list.&lt;ref name=jones6022011/&gt; 

===Super Bowl Ad===

==Tebowing==
&quot;Tebowing&quot; is a [[neologism]] derived from Tebow's propensity for kneeling and praying.  The origin of the phrase is credited to fan Jared Kleinstein, who posted a picture with friends on [[Facebook]], in which they mimic a pose by Tebow that was caught on camera following the [[2011 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]' improbable [[overtime]] victory over the [[2011 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] on October 23,[[2011 NFL season| 2011]].&lt;ref name=jones10272011&gt;Lindsay Jones, &quot;[http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2011/10/27/the-story-behind-the-tebowing-crazy/10368/  The Story Behind the 'Tebowing' Craze],&quot; ''The Denver Post'' (october 27, 2011).  Retrieved November 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The popularity of the picture led Kleinstein to set up a website showing pictures submitted by people depicting various interpretations of &quot;Tebowing&quot; all over the world.&lt;ref name=jones10272011/&gt;
