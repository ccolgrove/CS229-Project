After her niece, Amelia, tells her she is being bullied by Samson Dingle, Rachel confronts his father, Sam. However, Rachel is forced to apologise to Sam, when she learns Amelia was actually bullying Samson. Rachel and Sam then become friends. Rachel's teenage nephew, [[Sean Spencer|Sean]] (Luke Roskell), finds her and reveals he stole some money from the local garage and [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) had collapsed while chasing him. Rachel is angered when Aaron's mother, [[Chas Dingle|Chas]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]), threatens Sean and tells him to stay away from Aaron. Rachel is given a job in [[The Woolpack]] by [[Diane Sugden]] ([[Elizabeth Estensen]]). She works alongside [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and she begins to fall for him.

Following a one-night stand with Cain, Amy discovers she is pregnant with his child. She tells Cain, who pays her to have an abortion. Amy goes to the clinic with her friend, [[Victoria Sugden]] ([[Isabel Hodgins]]), but she cannot go through with the abortion. Amy later changes he mind, but she is told her pregnancy is too far along to have the procedure. Amy keeps her pregnancy a secret from everyone, except [[Belle Dingle]] ([[Eden Taylor-Draper]]). Amy goes into labour and gives birth in the local cemetery, she believes her baby boy is dead and she wraps him up and places him in a phonebox. The baby is found by Hazel Rhodes and taken to the hospital.
