She is best known for her portrayals of Perry in the [[Harry Enfield]] film ''[[Kevin and Perry Go Large]]'', and of [[Linda La Hughes]] in the British sitcom ''[[Gimme Gimme Gimme (TV series)|Gimme Gimme Gimme]]'' (the latter of which she co-wrote and developed with [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]). She is also known for her regular appearances on ''[[French and Saunders]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Harry Enfield and Chums]]''. She has been nominated for six [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA awards]].

==Family and upbringing==
She was born at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in [[London]], and raised in the Irish area of [[Islington]]. Her mother Bridget (Bridie)[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018834/bio] died of cancer when she was two, and she was raised by neighbours (the Galvin family) for the following few years. Subsequently, she returned to live with her father Patrick (Paddy), an alcoholic, who died of cancer in 1985. Burke attended the [[Maria Fidelis RC Convent School]]. She has two older brothers, John and Barry.

==Career==
Burke's first role was in the controversial 1983 film ''[[Scrubbers]]'', directed by [[Sweden|Swedish]] actress [[Mai Zetterling]] and featuring [[Pam St. Clement]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Miriam Margolyes]], [[Honey Bane]], [[Debby Bishop]] and [[Eva Mottley]]. The movie was set in a young offenders' institute for girls and was seen as a female version of the film ''[[Scum (film)|Scum]]''. 

Burke appeared in a non-speaking role in a 1985 public information film about heroin addiction.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

Burke first became familiar to [[television]] audiences as a player of minor roles in sketches by better-known performers such as [[Harry Enfield]], [[Dawn French]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]].  Early TV work included regular appearances on the chat show &quot;The Last Resort&quot; hosted by [[Jonathan Ross]] on UK Channel 4 in the early 1980s, playing the characters 'Tina Bishop' and 'Perry the Pre-pubscent Schoolboy&quot;. Bishop was a continually pregnant &quot;expert&quot; offering advice on household chores, always with disastrous results. Along with [[French &amp; Saunders]], she has contributed to two [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] charity singles. She first appeared as a member of [[Bananarama]] parody band Lananeeneenoonoo in 1989, and then as a member of [[Spice Girls]]' look-alike band The Sugar Lumps in 1997. In real life Burke is a big fan of [[Morrissey]] and appeared in the video for his 1989 single &quot;[[Ouija Board, Ouija Board]]&quot; and later in the 2002 [[Channel 4]] documentary ''The Importance Of Being Morrissey''.

She quickly became successful in her own right and although mainly associated with [[comedy]], she has played several serious roles including that of Queen [[Mary I of England]] in ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]''. 

Burke won the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] award at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]] for her role in the gritty drama ''[[Nil by Mouth (film)|Nil by Mouth]] '' which also earned her a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;festival-cannes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4790/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Nil by Mouth |accessdate=2009-09-23|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then she has appeared as Perry in ''[[Kevin and Perry Go Large]]'', and as [[Linda La Hughes]] in ''[[Gimme Gimme Gimme (TV series)|Gimme Gimme Gimme]]'' were she was nominated for 3 [[British Comedy Awards]] (winning one) , 2 [[BAFTA]] TV Awards and a [[National Television Award]] for her performance. In 2000, she appeared in the cult film ''Love Honour and Obey'' with Ray Burdis.

In 2003, she was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

Beginning in 2001, she refrained from acting and threw herself into theatre directing; something she considers to be one of her true passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/10/19/btburke19.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2004/10/19/ixtop.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=My acting days are over | date=19 October 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said in an interview with Dawn French in ''Dawn French's Girls Who do Comedy'' that she no longer felt the same creative energy associated with acting that she used to (she described it as a &quot;feeling in my belly&quot;) and that this was the reason she had stopped acting. However, she has done some voiceover work in the past few years, including adverts for Ski yoghurt (in the UK) as well as ''[[Flushed Away]]'' (2006). She also appeared in the 2007 Christmas Special of ''The Catherine Tate Show'' as Nan's daughter.

In early 1990 she wrote and directed her first play, ''Mr Thomas'', at the [[Old Red Lion Theatre]]. Set in 1950s London it starred [[James Clyde]]{{dn|date=September 2011}}, [[Anita Graham]], [[Jamie Oliver]], [[Ian Jentle]], [[Oliver Smith (actor)|Oliver Smith]]{{dn|date=September 2011}}, and [[Ray Winstone]]. It was subsequently filmed and shown on [[Channel 4]] the next year.

In 2007, Burke contracted [[Clostridium difficile]] while in hospital for an operation, resulting in her having to pass directing duties on ''[[Dying for It]]'' at the Almeida theatre (which starred [[Charlie Condou]] and [[Sophie Stanton]] who she worked with on ''[[Gimme Gimme Gimme (TV series)|Gimme Gimme Gimme]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-507138/I-died-superbug-says-actress-Kathy-Burke.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=I almost died from superbug, says actress Kathy Burke | date=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Burke made her television directorial debut with the [[BBC Three]] sketch show series ''[[Horne &amp; Corden]]'', starring [[Mathew Horne]] and [[James Corden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/04_april/24/corden_horne.shtml Press Releases: Horne and Corden come up trumps for BBC Three | BBC Press Office&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Burke completed a short autobiographical film, &quot;Better Than Christmas&quot;, for &quot;Little Crackers&quot;, a collection of comic shorts.  Burke plays a nun.

In 2011, Burke played [[Connie Sachs]] in the [[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1322727/Kathy-Burke-star-film-version-John-le-Carr-s-Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Baz | last=Bamigboye | title=BAZ BAMIGBOYE: Why Kathy Burke is coming in from the cold | date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
