The city now known as Mexico City was founded by the [[Mexica]] people, later known as the [[Aztec]]s, in 1325. The old Mexica city is now referred to as [[Tenochtitlan]]. The Mexica were one of the last of the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking peoples who migrated to this part of the [[Valley of Mexico]] after the fall of the [[Toltec]] Empire. Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already in the valley, but the Mexica were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of [[Lake Texcoco]]. The Mexica themselves had a story about how their city was founded, after being led to the island by their principal god, [[Huitzilopochtli]]. According to the story, the god indicated the site where they were to build their home with a sign - an eagle perched on a [[nopal]] cactus with a snake in its beak. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states around Lake Texcoco, and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the [[Aztec|Aztec Empire]] reached much of [[Mesoamerica]], touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Scholars estimate that between 200,000 and 250,000 people lived in Tenochtitlan in 1500, more than four times the population of London at that time.

=== Spanish conquest of TenochtitlÃ¡n ===
[[File:BattleTexcocoLakeNHMDF.JPG|thumb|Model of the first naval battle between the Spanish and Aztec in lake Texcoco.]]

After landing in [[Veracruz]], [[HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s]] heard about the great city and the long-standing rivalries and grievances against it. Although CortÃ©s came to Mexico with a very small army, he was able to persuade many of the other native peoples to help him destroy Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciudadmexico&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciudadmexico.com.mx/historia.htm|title=Historia de la Ciudad de MÃ©xico|language=Spanish|accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CortÃ©s first saw TenochtitlÃ¡n on November 8, 1519.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marroqui&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Ciudad de Mexico|last=Marroqui|first=Jose Maria|year=1969|publisher=Ayuntamiento del Distrito Federal|location=Mexico City|pages=21â25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon viewing it for the first time, CortÃ©s and his men were stunned by its beauty and size. The Spaniards marched along the causeway leading into the city from [[Iztapalapa]]. Although Montezuma came out from the center of TenochtitlÃ¡n to greet them and exchange gifts, the camaraderie did not last long.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_e00.html |title=Conquistadors â CortÃ©s. November 1519, The Most Beautiful Thing in the World|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CortÃ©s put Montezuma under [[house arrest]], hoping to rule through him.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_f00.html|title=Conquistadors â CortÃ©s.

They elected a new king, [[CuitlÃ¡huac]], but he died after a few months due to smallpox; the next king was [[CuauhtÃ©moc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_h00.html |title=Conquistadors â CortÃ©s.

For three months, the city suffered from the lack of food and water as well as the spread of [[smallpox]] brought by the Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciudadmexico&quot;/&gt; CortÃ©s and his allies landed their forces in the south of the island and fought their way through the city, street by street, and house by house.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_i00.html |title=Conquistadors â CortÃ©s.

=== The rebuilding of the city as Mexico City ===
[[File:Oldmexicocity.jpg|thumb|Mexico City painting of 1628]]

The Spaniards practically razed TenochtitlÃ¡n. CortÃ©s first settled in [[CoyoacÃ¡n]], but decided to rebuild the Aztec site to erase all traces of the old order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marroqui&quot;/&gt; CortÃ©s did not establish an independent, conquered territory under his own [[Sovereignty|personal rule]], but remained loyal to the Spanish crown. The first [[viceroy]] of the new domain arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. By that time, the city had again become a [[city-state]], having power that extended far beyond the city's established borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2000&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Alvarez|first=Jose Rogelio|encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Mexico|language=Spanish|title=Mexico, Ciudad de|year=2000|publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|volume=9|pages=5242â5260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the Spanish preserved TenochtitlÃ¡n's basic layout, they built [[Catholic Church|Catholic churches]] over the old Aztec temples and claimed the imperial palaces for themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2000&quot;/&gt; TenochtitlÃ¡n was renamed &quot;Mexico&quot;, its alternative form name, as the Spanish found this easier to say.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marroqui&quot;/&gt;

=== Growth of the colonial city ===

[[File:Vista ote a pte del Monumento a la Independencia DF MEX.JPG|thumb|The ''Ãngel de la Independencia'' was built to celebrate Mexico's independence centennial]]
[[File:Old architecture Mexico City.jpg|thumb|left|Colonial style architecture in the historic center of Mexico City.]]

The city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|historic center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2000&quot;/&gt;
Economically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or [[Peru]], Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concise History of Mexico.|last=Hamnett|first=Brian R.|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Port Chester, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-521-58120-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[nobility]] flourished in New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas. Spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. Spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it. In the ensuing centuries, a [[Mexican nobility|noble title in Mexico]] did not mean one exercised great political power as one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladd&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artes deMexico Palacios de la Nueva EspaÃ±a The Mexican Nobility|last=Ladd|first=Doris M|year=1998|publisher=Artes de Mexico y del Mundo|location=Mexico City|isbn=978-968-6533-61-3|pages=84â86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family. Most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in New Spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. The craze to build the most opulent home possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Many of these homes can still be seen today, leading to Mexico City's nickname of &quot;The city of palaces&quot; given by [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander Von Humboldt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marroqui&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladd&quot;/&gt;

The Grito de Dolores (&quot;Cry of Dolores&quot;) also known as El Grito de la Independencia (&quot;Cry of Independence&quot;), uttered from the small town of Dolores near Guanajuato on September 16, 1810, is the event that marks the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence and is the most important national holiday observed in Mexico. The &quot;Grito&quot; was the battle cry of the Mexican War of Independence by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Roman Catholic priest. Hidalgo and several criollos were involved in a planned revolt against the Spanish colonial government, and the plotters were betrayed. Fearing his arrest,[1] Hidalgo commanded his brother Mauricio as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release the pro-independence inmates there on the night of September 15. They managed to set eighty free.[2] Around 6:00&amp;nbsp;am September 16, 1810, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation. Flanked by Allende and Juan Aldama, he addressed the people in front of his church, encouraging them to revolt.
The Battle of Guanajuato, the first major engagement of the insurgency, occurred four days later. Mexico's independence from Spain was effectively declared in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 27, 1821, after a decade of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iturbide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm|title=Don AgustÃ­n de Iturbide|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;citydata&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Mexico-City-History.html|title=Mexico City History|accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Federal District]] was established by the new government and by the signing of their new constitution, where the concept of a [[federal district]] was adapted from [[United States Constitution|The U.S. constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Countries of the World&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Thomas E.|last=Weil|title=Mexico: Chapter 3B.

=== The Battle of Mexico City===

The [[MexicanâAmerican War]] came to a close after the United States [[Military deployment|deployed]] [[Military organization|combat units]] deep into [[Mexico]] resulting in the capture of Mexico City and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th [[Division (military)|Divisions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/cerro_gordo.html|title=The Battle of Cerro Gordo|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion culminated with the storming of [[Chapultepec Castle]] in the city itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;storming&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/chapultepec_pillows_attack.html|title=The Storming of Chapultepec (General Pillow's Attack)|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was signed in what is now the far north of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/wars_end_guadalupe.html|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|author=Richard Griswold del Castillo|accessdate=October 18, 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5nE7IO7rN | archivedate = February 1, 2010| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Events such as the [[Reform War]] left the city relatively untouched and it continued to grow, especially during the rule of President [[Porfirio DÃ­az]]. During this time, the city developed a modern infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation, and communication systems. However, the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest languished in poverty.

=== Revolution===
Fast modern development eventually led to the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citydata&quot;/&gt; The most significant episode of this period for the city was the [[Decena trÃ¡gica|La decena trÃ¡gica]] (&quot;The Ten Tragic Days&quot;), a coup against [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Francisco I. Madero]] and his vice president, [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a Pino SuÃ¡rez]]. [[Victoriano Huerta]], chief general of the [[Huerta's Federal Army|Federal Army]] saw a chance to take power, forcing Madero and Pino Suarez to sign resignations. The two were murdered later while on their way to prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;redescolar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm|title=La Decena TrÃ¡gica, febrero de 1913|language=Spanish|accessdate=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century to present ===
[[File:Santa feconj Mexico City.jpg|thumb|left|The northern, central, and western areas of the city are marked with hundreds of high rise buildings]]
[[File:Torre mayor desde paseo reforma 2v.JPG|thumb|The 2nd tallest building in Latin America, the [[Torre Mayor]] was completed in 2003.]]

The history of the rest of the 20th century to the present focuses on the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences. In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;larosa&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atlas and Survey of Latin American History.

Sharpe, Inc.|location=Armonk, New York, USA|pages=118â125|isbn=978-0-7656-1597-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2000&quot;/&gt; and then began to grow upwards in the 1950s, with the [[Torre Latinoamericana]] becoming the city's first skyscraper.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciudadmexico&quot;/&gt; The [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] brought about the construction of large sporting facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2000&quot;/&gt; In 1969, the [[Mexico City Metro|Metro system]] was inaugurated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciudadmexico&quot;/&gt;
Explosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to 8,831,079.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2000&quot;/&gt; In 1980, half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge [[shanty town|shantytowns]] that extended for many miles.&lt;ref name=&quot;citydata&quot;/&gt; This caused serious air and [[water pollution]] problems, as well as a sinking city due to overextraction of groundwater, [[groundwater-related subsidence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;water&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexico City's Water Supply: Improving the Outlook for Sustainability.|coauthors=National Research Council Staff.|year=1995|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C., USA|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation.

The autocratic government that ruled Mexico City since the Revolution was tolerated, mostly because of the continued economic expansion since World War II. This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately. Nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the [[Tlatelolco massacre|massacre of an unknown number of protesting students]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citydata&quot;/&gt;

Three years later, a demonstration in the Maestros avenue, organized by former members of the 1968 student movement, was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called &quot;Los Halcones&quot;, composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the U.S.

On Thursday, September 19, 1985, at 7:19&amp;nbsp;am [[time zone|local time]], Mexico City was struck by an [[Mexico City earthquake|earthquake of magnitude 8.1]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Yunnven|last=Campus|title=A 20 aÃ±os del sismo del 85|url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/terremoto/475688.html|publisher=Televisa|location=Mexico City|date=September 19, 2005|accessdate=October 4, 2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]]. Although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in Asia and other parts of Latin America,&lt;ref name=&quot;Moreno&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno Murillo|first=Juan Manuel|year=1995|title=The 1985 Mexico Earchquake|periodical=Geofisica Coumbia|publisher=Universidad Nacional de Colombia|issue=3|pages=5â19|issn=0121-2974|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it proved to be a disaster politically for the [[Single-party state|one-party]] government. The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;haber&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Haber|first=Paul Lawrence|encyclopedia=Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico|title=Earthquake of 1985|year=1995|publisher=Taylor &amp; Frances Ltd.|pages=179â184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, [[straw that broke the camel's back|the last straw]] may have been the controverted elections of 1988. That year, the presidency was set between the P.R.I.'s candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and a coalition of left-wing parties led by CuauhtÃ©moc CÃ¡rdenas, son of the former president LÃ¡zaro CÃ¡rdenas. The counting system &quot;fell&quot; because coincidentally the light went out and suddenly, when it returned, the winning candidate was Salinas, even though CÃ¡rdenas had the upper hand. As a result of the fraudulent election, CÃ¡rdenas became a member of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. Discontent over the election eventually led [[CuauhtÃ©moc CÃ¡rdenas]] to become the first [[mayor|elected mayor]] of Mexico City in 1997. CÃ¡rdenas promised a more [[democracy|democratic government]], and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run for the presidency.

== Geography ==

Mexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico, sometimes called the Basin of Mexico. This valley is located in the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;PorruaCuenca&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diccionario Porrua de Historia, Biografia y Geografia de Mexico 6th ed. â Mexico, Cuenca de|year=1995|publisher=Editorial Porrua|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish|isbn=978â968â452â907â6|page=2238|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;casestudy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?cscid=100|title=Mexico City: Opportunities and Challenges for Sustainable Management of Urban Water Resources|month=December|year=2004|accessdate=November 25, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081207190625/http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?cscid=100 |archivedate = December 7, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a minimum altitude of 2,200&amp;nbsp;meters (7,217&amp;nbsp;feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;natresearch&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexico City's Water Supply: Improving the Outlook for Sustainability.|author=National Research Council Staff|year=1995|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C., USA|isbn=978-0-309-05245-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;PorruaCuenca&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;natresearch&quot;/&gt;
The city primarily rests on what was [[Lake Texcoco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PorruaCuenca&quot;/&gt; Seismic activity is frequent here.&lt;ref name=&quot;yip&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yip|first=Maricela|coauthors=Madl, Pierre|title=Air Pollution in Mexico City|page=16|publisher=University of Salzburg, Austria|date=April 16, 2002|url=http://biophysics.sbg.ac.at/mexico/air.htm|accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called ''[[groundwater-related subsidence]]''. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the city has sunk as much as nine meters in some areas. This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the [[Wet season|rainy season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natresearch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yip&quot;/&gt; The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of [[Milpa Alta]], [[Tlalpan]] and [[Xochimilco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yip&quot;/&gt;

=== Climate ===
[[File:Cumbres del Ajusco.jpg|thumb|[[Cumbres del Ajusco National Park]]]]

Mexico City has a [[oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''Cwb''), due to its tropical location and high elevation. The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of [[Iztapalapa]], [[Iztacalco]], [[Venustiano Carranza, D.F.|Venustiano Carranza]] and the west portion of [[Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.|Gustavo A. Madero]] are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of [[Tlalpan]] and [[Milpa Alta]], a mountainous region of [[pine]] and [[oak|oak trees]] known as the range of [[Ajusco]].

The average annual temperature varies from {{convert|12|to|16|C|F}}, depending on the altitude of the borough. The lowest temperatures, usually registered during January and February, may reach {{convert|-2|to|-5|C|F}}, and are usually accompanied by snow showers on the southern regions of Ajusco. The maximum temperatures of late spring and summer may reach up to {{convert|32|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}}. Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail. The central valley of Mexico rarely gets precipitation in the form of snow during winter; the two last recorded instances of such an event were on March 5, 1940 and January 12, 1967.

The region of the [[Valley of Mexico]] receives [[Anticyclone|anti-cyclonic]] systems. The weak winds of these systems do not allow for the dispersion, outside the basin, of the [[air pollution|air pollutants]] which are produced by the 50,000 industries and 4 million vehicles operating in and around the metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The area receives about {{convert|820|mm|in|1}} of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from June through September/October with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;natresearch&quot;/&gt; The area has two main seasons. The rainy season runs from June to October when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea. The [[dry season]] runs from November to May, when the air is relatively drier. This dry season subdivides into a cold period and a warm period. The cold period spans from November to February when polar [[air mass]]es push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry. The warm period extends from March to May when tropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain.&lt;ref name=&quot;lafragua&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Parque Tezozomoc.jpg|thumb|left|The City government has encouraged the preservation of green areas of the City such as Tezozomoc park.]]
[[File:MexCityPolution.JPG|thumb|Situated in a valley, and relying heavily on automobiles, the city suffers from poor air quality]]

Originally, much of the valley lay beneath the waters of [[Lake Texcoco]], a system of interconnected saline and freshwater lakes. The [[Aztec]]s built dikes to separate the [[Freshwater|fresh water]] used to raise crops in ''[[chinampa]]s'' and to prevent recurrent floods. These dikes were destroyed during the siege of Tenochtitlan, and during colonial times the Spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods. Only a small section of the original lake remains, located outside the Federal District, in the municipality of [[San Salvador Atenco|Atenco]], [[State of Mexico]]. In recent years, architects [[Teodoro GonzÃ¡lez de LeÃ³n]] and [[Alberto Kalach]], along with a group of Mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists, have developed the project plan for ''Recovering the City of Lakes''. The project, if approved by the government, will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the [[Valley of Mexico]], the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning.

The federal and local governments have implemented numerous plans to alleviate the problem of air pollution, including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and [[nitrogen oxide]]s.&lt;ref name=clean&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28391130/wid/18298287/page/2/|title=Mexico City cleans up its reputation for smog|date=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the levels of these two pollutants reach critical levels, contingency actions are implemented which may include closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the ''[[Hoy No Circula|A day without a car]]'' program to two days of the week.&lt;ref name=clean/&gt; To control air pollution, the government has instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and [[diesel fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=clean/&gt; Data from the city's 36 air-quality monitoring stations show lead levels down 95 percent since 1990, while [[sulfur dioxide]] has fallen 86 percent, [[carbon monoxide]] 74 percent, and peak ozone levels 57 percent since 1991.&lt;ref name=clean/&gt; In 1990, Patricia Saad Sotomayor reported in the Mexico City daily ''ExcÃ©lsior'' that &quot;100,000 children die every year as a result of pollution in the Mexico City metropolitan area, 250,000 people suffer from eye diseases..and life expectancy has been reduced by up to ten years, according to the National Environmentalist Groups.&quot; in a report to President Salinas. At the time, according to the United Nations pollution scale &quot;which set 100 as the maximum level before grave health problems begin&quot;, Mexico City's level was 97.5, compared to 4.5 for New York City, and 2.5 for Milan, Turin, and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/misc.activism.progressive/browse_thread/thread/a8b501df87ae6a3/3e869ad011a4dc32?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=pollution+kills+100,000+children+mexico+city#3e869ad011a4dc32] Pollution Kills 100,000 Children In Mexico City Each Year, by Patricia Saad Sotomayor, ''ExcÃ©lsior''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the non-urban forest areas of the southern boroughs were declared National Ecological Reserves by president [[Miguel de la Madrid|Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado]]. Other areas of the Federal District became protected over the following years.

The Acta Constitutiva de la FederaciÃ³n of January 31, 1824 and the Federal Constitution of October 4, 1824&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html|title=Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States (1824)}}&lt;/ref&gt; fixed the political and administrative organization of the [[Mexico|United Mexican States]] after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. In addition, Section XXVIII of Article 50 gave the new Congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located. This location would then be appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The two main candidates to become the capital were Mexico City and [[QuerÃ©taro, QuerÃ©taro|QuerÃ©taro]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, due in large part to the persuasion of representative [[Servando Teresa de Mier]], Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country's population and history, even though QuerÃ©taro was closer to the center geographically. The choice was official on November 18, 1824, and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 ac) centered on the [[ZÃ³calo|Zocalo]]. This area was then separated from the [[State of Mexico]], forcing that state's government to move from the [[Palace of the Inquisition (Museum of Mexican Medicine)|Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine)]] in the city to [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]]. This area did not include the population centers of the towns of [[CoyoacÃ¡n]], [[Xochimilco]], [[San Mateo Mexicaltzingo|Mexicaltzingo]] and [[Tlalpan]], all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2003&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Alvarez|first=Jose Rogelio|encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Mexico|title=Distrito Federal|year=2003|publisher=Sabeco International Investment Corp.|volume=IV|language=Spanish|isbn=978-1-56409-063-8|pages=2293â2314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, president [[Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna]], enlarged the area of the Federal District almost eightfold from the original {{convert|220|sqkm|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1700|sqkm|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}, annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion. (The [[MexicanâAmerican War|Mexican-American War]] had just been fought). The last changes to the limits of the Federal District were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current {{convert|1479|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} by adjusting the southern border with the state of [[Morelos]]. By that time, the total number of municipalities within the Federal District was twenty-two.

While the Federal District was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor, the municipalities within it were autonomous, and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century. In 1903 already, Porfirio DÃ­az largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the Federal District. Eventually, in December 1928, the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the Federal District. In place of the municipalities, the Federal District was divided into one &quot;Central Department&quot; and 13 ''delegaciones'' (boroughs) administered directly by the government of the Federal District. The Central Department was integrated by the former municipalities of Mexico City, Tacuba, Tacubaya and Mixcoac.

In 1941, the [[Pedro MarÃ­a de Anaya|General Anaya]] borough was merged to the Central Department, which was then renamed &quot;Mexico City&quot; (thus reviving the name, but not the autonomous municipality). From 1941 to 1970, the Federal District was comprised by 12 ''delegaciones'' and Mexico City. In 1970 Mexico City was split into four different ''delegaciones'': [[CuauhtÃ©moc]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]], [[Venustiano Carranza]] and [[Benito JuÃ¡rez]], increasing the number of ''delegaciones'' to sixteen. Since then, in a ''de facto'' manner, the whole Federal District, whose ''delegaciones'' had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered a synonym of Mexico City. However, the lack of a ''de jure'' stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. In 1993 this situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] whereby Mexico City and the Federal District were set to be the same entity. This amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.df.gob.mx/leyes/normatividad.html?materia=1&amp;apartado=15&amp;disp=140 Statute of Government of the Federal District] {{Wayback|url=http://www.df.gob.mx/leyes/normatividad.html?materia=1&amp;apartado=15&amp;disp=140|date =20080313061806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political structure ===

[[File:SalonCabildos1AyuntamientoDF.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of the Mexico City Hall.]]

Mexico City, being the seat of the powers of the Union, did not belong to any particular state but to all. Therefore, it was the president, representing the federation, who used to designate the head of government of the Federal District, a position which is sometimes presented outside Mexico as the &quot;Mayor&quot; of Mexico City. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the 1980s, given the dramatic increase in population of the previous decades, the inherent political inconsistencies of the system, as well as the dissatisfaction with the inadequate response of the federal government after the 1985 earthquake, residents began to request political and administrative autonomy to manage their local affairs. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Some [[political party|political groups]] even proposed that the Federal District be converted into the 32nd state of the federation.

In response to the demands, in 1987 the Federal District received a greater degree of autonomy, with the elaboration the first Statute of Government (''Estatuto de Gobierno''), and the creation of an Assembly of Representatives. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the 1990s, this autonomy was further expanded and, starting from 1997, residents can directly elect the head of government of the Federal District and the representatives of a unicameral Legislative Assembly (which succeeded the previous Assembly) by popular vote. The first elected head of government was [[CuauhtÃ©moc CÃ¡rdenas]]. CÃ¡rdenas resigned in 1999 to run in the 2000 [[election|presidential elections]] and designated [[Rosario Robles]] to succeed him, who became the first woman (elected or otherwise) to govern Mexico City. In 2000 [[AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador]] was elected, and resigned in 2005 to run in the 2006 presidential elections, [[Alejandro Encinas RodrÃ­guez]] being designated by the Legislative Assembly to finish the term. In 2006, [[Marcelo Ebrard]] Casaubon was elected for the 2006â2012 period.

The Federal District does not have a constitution, like the states of the Union, but rather a Statute of Government. As part of its recent changes in autonomy, the budget is administered locally; it is proposed by the head of government and approved by the Legislative Assembly. Nonetheless, it is the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]] that sets the ceiling to internal and external [[Government debt|public debt]] issued by the Federal District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finanzas.df.gob.mx/documentos/CodigoFinanciero_2007.pdf |title=Codigo Financiero Del Distrito Federal* |format=PDF |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 44th article of the Mexican Constitution, in case the powers of the Union move to another city, the Federal District will be transformed into a new state, which will be called &quot;State of the Valley of Mexico&quot;, with the new limits set by the Congress of the Union.

=== Elections and government ===
[[File:Marcelo Ebrard.jpg|thumb|Mexico City's [[Head of Government of the Federal District|Head of Government]] [[Marcelo Ebrard]].]]

In 2006, elections were held for the post of head of government and the representatives of the Legislative Assembly. The elected and incumbent head of government is now [[Marcelo Ebrard]] Casaubon, candidate of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD). Heads of government are elected for a 6-year period without the possibility of reelection. Traditionally, this position has been considered as the second most important executive office in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, Brian (1999) ''A Concise History of Mexico'' [[Cambridge University Press]]; [[Cambridge]], UK, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District]] is formed, as it is the case in all legislatures in Mexico, by both single-seat and proportional seats, making it a system of [[parallel voting]]. The Federal District is divided into 40 electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by [[Plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] plurality (FPP), locally called &quot;uninominal deputies&quot;. The Federal District as a whole constitutes a single constituency for the parallel election of 26 representatives by [[proportional representation|proportionality]] (PR) with open-party lists, locally called &quot;plurinominal deputies&quot;. Even though [[proportionality (political maxim)|proportionality]] is only confined to the proportional seats, to prevent a part from being overrepresented, several restrictions apply in the assignation of the seats; namely, that no party can have more than 63% of all seats, both [[uninominal]] and [[plurinominal]]. In the 2006 elections leftist PRD got the absolute majority in the direct uninominal elections, securing 34 of the 40 FPP seats. As such, PRD was not assigned any plurinominal seat to comply with the law that prevents overrepresentation. The overall composition of the Legislative Assembly is:

The politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City since the second half of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country, whether with the support of the federal governmentâas was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980sâor through laws recently approved by the Legislative Assembly. In April of the same year, the Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand [[abortion in Mexico]] beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it regardless of the reason should the mother request it before the twelfth week of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/420927.html|title=Aprueba ALDF en lo general reforma sobre el aborto|publisher=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=April 24, 2007|accessdate=April 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, the Federal District became the first city in Latin America, and one of very few in the world, to legalize [[same-sex marriage]].

=== Boroughs ===
{{See also|Mexico City's boroughs|Colonias of Mexico City}}

[[File:Boroughs of Mexican Federal District numbered.svg|thumb|The 16 boroughs of Mexico City]]

For administrative purposes, the Federal District is divided into 16 &quot;delegaciones&quot; or boroughs. While not fully equivalent to a municipality, the 16 boroughs have gained significant autonomy, and since 2000 their heads of government are elected directly by [[plurality voting system|plurality]] (they were previously appointed by the head of government of the Federal District). Given that Mexico City is organized entirely as a Federal District, most of the [[Municipal services|city services]] are provided or organized by the [[Government of the Federal District]] and not by the boroughs themselves, while in the [[constituent state]]s these services would be provided by the municipalities. The 16 boroughs of the Federal District are:

{|cellspacing=&quot;8&quot;

15. [[Venustiano Carranza, D.F.|Venustiano Carranza]]&lt;br /&gt;
16. [[Xochimilco]]
|}

The boroughs are composed by hundreds of ''[[Colonias of Mexico City|colonias]]'' or [[Neighbourhood|neighborhoods]], which have no jurisdictional autonomy or representation. It is plausible that the name, which literally means colony, arose in the late 19th, early 20th centuries, when one of the first urban developments outside the city's core was inhabited by a French colony in the city. Some colonias have identifiable attributes: [[Historic center of Mexico City|Historic Center]] is the oldest quarter in the city, some of the buildings dating back to the 16th century {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}; [[Condesa]] is known for its [[Art Deco]] architecture, and for being the newest artistic center of the city; [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]] is a growing business and financial district (built over old [[landfill]]s); [[Colonia Roma|Roma]] is a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux arts]] neighborhood and probably one of the oldest in the city; [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]] is an important commercial and economic center known for its large [[History of the Jews in Mexico|Jewish]] community, and [[Tepito]] and [[La Lagunilla]] are known for its large [[flea market]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

== Health ==
[[File:Dawn of Mexico City.jpg|thumb|Visible smog on a sunrise at 7 am, May 28, 2005]] 

Mexico City is home to some of the best private hospitals in the country; [[Hospital Ãngeles]], [[Hospital ABC]] and [[MÃ©dica Sur]] to name a few. The national [[Publicly-funded health care|public healthcare]] institution for [[private sector|private-sector]] employees [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]], has its largest facilities in Mexico City, including the National Medical Center and the [[La Raza]] Medical Center, and has an annual budget of over 6&amp;nbsp;billion pesos. The IMSS and other [[public health]] institutions, including the ISSSTE (Public Sector Employees' Social Security Institute) and the National Health Ministry (SSA) maintain large specialty facilities in the city. These include the National Institutes of Cardiology, Nutrition, Psychiatry, Oncology, Pediatrics, Rehabilitation, among others.

The [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a [[catalytic converter]], which reduce the emissions released. Trucks must use only [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG).
Also construction of an [[Mexico City Metro|underground rail system]] was begun in 1968 order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate [[traffic congestion]]. Today it has over 201&amp;nbsp;km of track and carries over 5 million people every day. Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during [[rush hour]]s the crush is so great, that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women.
Due to these initiatives and others, the air quality in Mexico City has begun to improve, with the air becoming cleaner since 1991, when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year.

Mexico City is one of the most important economic hubs in Latin America. The city proper (Federal District) produces 21.8% of the country's gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=cuna14&amp;c=1669|title=Producto interno bruto por entidad federativa. ParticipaciÃ³n sectorial por entidad federative|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], Mexico City had a GDP of $390&amp;nbsp;billion, ranking as the eighth richest city in the world after the greater areas of Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris, London and [[Osaka]]/[[Kobe]], and the richest in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukmediacentre.pwc.com&quot;/&gt; Making Mexico City alone the 30th largest economy in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;emporis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101008|title=Emporis|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mexico City is the greatest contributor to the country's industrial GDP (15.8%) and also the greatest contributor to the country's GDP in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] (25.3%). Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the southâmost of which is protected through environmental laws the contribution of the Federal District in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI&quot; /&gt; Mexico City has one of the world's fastest-growing economies and its GDP is set to double by 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;furness&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furness|first=Charlie|year=2008|month=April|title=Boomtown|journal=Geographical|volume=80|issue=4|pages=36â45|id=0016741X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As measured by the overall GDP of the entire metropolitan area, Mexico City is the richest city in the country and Latin America. In the 2002 Mexico City had an HDI index of 0.915&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2006/chapters/spanish/ |title= HDR 2006 &amp;#124; Spanish &amp;#124; Human Development Reports (HDR) &amp;#124; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |publisher=Hdr.undp.org |accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; identical to that of Republic of Korea. The level of household expenditure in Mexico City is close to that of an average household in Germany or Japan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The top twenty-five percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean [[disposable and discretionary income|disposable income]] of US $98,517 in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The extremely high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} makes the city attractive for [[luxury good]]s companies. The combined personal wealth of privately held income of citizens of the entire federal district is estimated to be $536.95&amp;nbsp;billion USD,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} $146&amp;nbsp;billion larger than the city's GDP of $390&amp;nbsp;billion,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} which only takes into account the combined net worth of goods, services and corporately held assets.

The economic reforms of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks, were privatized. He also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). This led to the decentralization&lt;ref name=&quot;furness&quot;/&gt; and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as many factories moved to the [[State of Mexico]] and to the northern border.

Historically, and since pre-Hispanic times, the [[Valley of Mexico|valley of AnÃ¡huac]] has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's [[CuauhtÃ©moc]] [[borough]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} At the beginning of the 20th century, the ''elites'' began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of [[Mixcoac]] and [[San Ãngel]] were incorporated by the growing conurbation. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/census.html |title=The Hispanic Experience â Indigenous Identity in Mexico |publisher=Houstonculture.org |accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.

Up to the 1980s, the Federal District was the most populous [[political divisions of Mexico|federal entity]] in Mexico, but since then its population has remained stable at around 8.7&amp;nbsp;million. The growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the Federal District to 59 municipalities of the [[state of Mexico]] and 1 in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CONAPOzm2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.conapo.gob.mx/publicaciones/dzm2005/index.htm Consejo Nacional de PoblaciÃ³n, MÃ©xico; DelimitaciÃ³n de las zonas metropolitanas de MÃ©xico 2005].

Retrieved September 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of the most populous conurbations in the world. Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the [[Greater Mexico City|Metropolitan Area of Mexico City]] is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,&lt;ref name=sintesis&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/proyectos/conteos/conteo2005/sintesis.pps SÃ­ntesis de Resultados del Conteo 2005] INEGI&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenon most likely attributable to the [[environmental policy]] of decentralization. The [[net migration rate]] of the Federal District from 1995 to 2000 was negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob62&amp;c=3883&amp;e=09 |title=Tasa de emigraciÃ³n, inmigraciÃ³n y migraciÃ³n neta de las entidades federativas |publisher=Inegi.gob.mx |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they represented around 18.74% of the city's population, [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous peoples]] from different [[Political divisions of Mexico|regions of Mexico]] have immigrated to the capital in search of better economic opportunities. [[Nahuatl|NÃ¡huatl]], [[Otomi language|OtomÃ­]], [[Mixtec]]o, [[Zapotec languages|Zapoteco]], and [[Mazahua]] are the indigenous languages with the greatest number of speakers in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen23&amp;c=4169&amp;e=09 PoblaciÃ³n de 5 y mÃ¡s aÃ±os hablante de lengua indÃ­gena por principales lenguas, 2005] INEGI&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Mexico City is home to large communities of [[expatriate]]s and immigrants, most notably from South America (mainly from [[Argentine people|Argentina]] and [[Colombian people|Colombia]], but also from [[Brazilian people|Brazil]], [[Chilean people|Chile]], [[Uruguayan people|Uruguay]] and [[Venezuelan people|Venezuela]]), from Central America and the Caribbean (mainly from [[Cubans|Cuba]], [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[List of Salvadorans|El Salvador]], [[Haiti]] and [[Hondurans|Honduras]]); from Europe (mainly from [[Spanish people|Spain]], [[Germans|Germany]] and [[Swiss people|Switzerland]], but also from [[Czechs|Czech Republic]], [[French people|France]], [[Italian people|Italy]], [[Dutch people|the Netherlands]], [[Polish people|Poland]] and [[Romanians|Romania]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;extranjeros&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/151/15103202.pdf |title=Asociaciones de Inmigrantes Extranjeros en la Ciudad de MÃ©xico.

While no official figures have been reported, [[Census|population estimates]] of each of these communities are quite significant. Mexico City is home to the largest population of [[Demographics of the United States|U.S. Americans]] living outside the United States. Current estimates are as high as 600,000 U.S. Americans living in Mexico City, while in 1999 the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs estimated over 440,000 Americans lived in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carl Franz and Lorena Havens |url=http://www.peoplesguide.com/1pages/retire/work/bil-maste/%232americans.html |title=How Many Americans Live in Mexico? |publisher=Peoplesguide.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overseasdigest.com/amcit_nu2.htm |title=Private American Citizens Residing Abroad |publisher=Overseasdigest.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority (90.5%) of the residents in Mexico City are Roman Catholic, higher than the national percentage, even though it has been decreasing over the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mrel07&amp;c=4140&amp;e=09 Volumen y porcentaje de la poblaciÃ³n de 5 y mÃ¡s aÃ±os catÃ³lica por entidad federativa, 2000] INEGI&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other religions and philosophies are also practiced in the city: many different types of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups, different types of [[History of the Jews in Mexico|Jewish communities]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Islam]] and other [[spiritual]] and [[philosophical]] groups, as well as an increasing number of [[Irreligion by country|irreligion]].

[[File:Trajinera.JPG|thumb|left|Xochimilco riverboats]]

The [[Historic center of Mexico City]] (''Centro HistÃ³rico'') and the &quot;floating gardens&quot; of [[Xochimilco]] in the southern borough have been declared [[World Heritage Site]]s by the [[UNESCO]]. Famous landmarks in the Historic Center include the [[ZÃ³calo|Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n]] (ZÃ³calo), the main central square with its time clashing Spanish-era [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] and [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]], and Delran, and ancient Aztec temple ruins [[Templo Mayor]] (&quot;Major Temple&quot;) are all within a few steps of one another. (The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables.)

The most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden [[El Ãngel|Angel of Independence]], found on the wide, elegant avenue [[Paseo de la Reforma]], modeled by the order of the Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Mexico]] after the [[Champs-ÃlysÃ©es]] in Paris. This avenue was designed over Americas' oldest passage in the 19th century to connect the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] (seat of government) with the [[Chapultepec Castle|Castle of Chapultepec]], the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]] as several [[corporate headquarters]] are located. Another important avenue is the [[Avenida de los Insurgentes]], which extends {{convert|28.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.

The [[Chapultepec]] park houses the ''[[Chapultepec Castle|Castle of Chapultepec]]'', now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the [[Museo Nacional de AntropologÃ­a|National Museum of Anthropology]] (which houses the [[Aztec calendar stone|Aztec Calendar Stone]]). Another magnificent piece of architecture is the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Fine Arts Palace]], a stunning white marble theatre/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below. Its construction began during the presidency of [[Porfirio DÃ­az]] and ended in 1934, after being interrupted by the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s. The [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas|Plaza of the Three Cultures]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] neighbourhood, and the shrine and [[Basilica]]s of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] are also important sites. There is a [[double-decker bus]], known as the &quot;Turibus&quot;, that circles most of these sites, and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed.

In addition, the city has around 160 museums, over 100 [[art museum|art galleries]], and some 30 [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} It has the fourth highest number of theatres in the world after New York, London and Toronto, and it is the city with the highest number of museums in the world. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In many locales (Palacio Nacional and the [[National Institute of Cardiology|Instituto Nacional de CardiologÃ­a]], to name a few), there are murals painted by [[Diego Rivera]]. He and his wife [[Frida Kahlo]] lived in the southern suburb of [[CoyoacÃ¡n]], where several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public. The house where [[Leon Trotsky]] was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in CoyoacÃ¡n.

In addition, there are several restored ''haciendas'' that are now restaurants, such as the San Ãngel Inn, the Hacienda de Tlalpan and the Hacienda de los Morales, all of which are stunning remnants of Mexican history and house some of the best food in the world.

=== Public Transportation ===

[[File:MetrobÃºs Set Dominguez.jpg|thumb|MetrobÃºs at [[Avenida de los Insurgentes|Insurgentes Avenue]]]]

Mexico City is served by the ''[[Mexico City Metro|Sistema de Transporte Colectivo Metro]]'', a 207&amp;nbsp;km [[rapid transit|metro]] system, which is the largest in Latin America. The first portions were opened in 1969 and it has expanded to 11 lines with [[List of Mexico City metro stations|175 stations]]. A [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] system, known as the [[Ferrocarril Suburbano de la Zona Metropolitana del Valle de MÃ©xico|Tren Suburbano]], similar to the Parisian [[RÃ©seau express rÃ©gional|RER]] started operations in 2008 connecting the city downtown to the Northern suburbs. A twelfth (gold color) metro line is currently in construction, and will add an additional 25&amp;nbsp;km to the network. The ''metro'' is one of the busiest in the world transporting approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;million people every day, surpassed only by subway lines in Moscow (7.5&amp;nbsp;million), Tokyo (5.9&amp;nbsp;million), and New York City (5.1&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm|title=MTA NYC Transit â Info|publisher=Mta.info|date=October 27, 1904|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is heavily subsidized, and has the lowest fares in the world, each trip costing 3.00 [[Mexican peso|Mex$]] and taking each passenger to almost any place in the mega city from 05:00&amp;nbsp;am to midnight. Several stations display [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] artifacts and architecture that were discovered during the metro's construction. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} However, the [[Mexico City Metro|Metro]] does not extend outside the limits of the Federal District, for which an extensive network of bus routes exists. These routes are mostly managed by private companies which are allowed to operate buses as long as they adhere to certain minimal service quality standards.

The city government also operates a network of large buses, in contrast with the privately operated [[Pesero|microbuses]] (''peseros''), with fares barely exceeding that of the metro. Electric transport other than the metro also exists, in the form of several [[Trolleybuses in Mexico City|Mexico City trolleybus]] routes and the [[Xochimilco Light Rail]] line, both of which are operated by ''[[Servicio de Transportes ElÃ©ctricos]]''. The central area's last [[Tram|streetcar]] line (tramway, or ''[[:es:TranvÃ­a|tranvÃ­a]]'') closed in 1979, but the reintroduction of streetcars to the historic city center is planned.&lt;ref&gt;''Tramways &amp; Urban Transit'' magazine (UK), April 2010, p. 150. [[Light Rail Transit Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; The city's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Mexico City MetrobÃºs|MetrobÃºs]], began operation in June 2005, along [[Avenida de los Insurgentes|Avenida Insurgentes]]. A second line was constructed along Eje 4 Sur, opening in December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = GÃ³mez Flores | first = Laura | title = Con retraso de siete meses inicia lÃ­nea 2 del MetrobÃºs | language = Spanish | date = December 16, 2008 | publisher=[[La Jornada]] | url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/12/16/index.php?section=capital&amp;article=037n2cap | accessdate =June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a third line opened in February 2011, serving Eje 1 Poniente between [[Tenayuca]] and [[Metro EtiopÃ­a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = GÃ³mez Flores | first = Laura | title = Pretenden entregar antes la lÃ­nea 3 del MetrobÃºs | language = Spanish | date = May 31, 2010 | publisher=[[La Jornada]] | url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/05/31/index.php?section=capital&amp;article=038n2cap | accessdate =June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the microbuses were removed from its route, it was hoped that the MetrobÃºs could reduce pollution and decrease transit time for passengers. Also, since late 2002, the white and green taxis have been joined by red and white ones as part of a program to replace older vehicles with new ones.

=== Roads ===
[[File:Avenida Carlos Lazo.jpg|thumb|left|Highways connect all areas of the city]]
[[File:MexCity10.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of the elevated freeway running from the northern area of the city to the southern area]]
In the late 1970s many arterial roads were redesigned as ''ejes viales''; high-volume one-way roads that cross, in theory, Mexico City proper from side to side. The ''eje vial'' network is based on a quasi-[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid, with the ''ejes'' themselves being called ''Eje 1 Poniente'', ''Eje Central'', and ''Eje 1 Oriente'', for example, for the north-south roads, and ''Eje 2 Sur'' and ''Eje 3 Norte'', for example, for east-west roads. Two freeway ring-roads serve to connect points within the city and the metropolitan area: Circuito Interior (the inner ring) and PerifÃ©rico, which connect to one straight freeway: the Viaducto (Viaduct) (connecting west with east, from Observatorio to the Airport). Traffic in this system is so dense that an elevated highway that runs on top and parallel to a part of the PerifÃ©rico, had to be constructed and finished in 2003. This elevated highway is colloquially called ''segundo piso'' (&quot;second level&quot;) of the PerifÃ©rico.

There is an environmental program, called [[Hoy No Circula]] (&quot;Today Does Not Run&quot;, or &quot;One Day without a Car&quot;), whereby only vehicles with certain ending numbers on their [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]] are allowed to circulate on certain days, in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== Cycling ===
The local government continuously strives for a reduction of massive traffic congestion, and has increased incentives for making a [[bicycle-friendly]] city. A bicycle lending program was created in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Historico]], in which a citizen or tourist can loan a bicycle for 3 hours, by filling out a simple form and presenting a valid ID, the so-called ''Cicloestaciones'' are located primarily by the [[Paseo de la Reforma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sma.df.gob.mx/sma/index.php?opcion=26&amp;id=607 |title=:: SecretarÃ­a del Medio Ambiente del Gobierno del Distrito Federal :: |publisher=Sma.df.gob.mx |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a service called Ecobici, in which registered residents can get bicycles for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes with a pre-paid subscription of 300 pesos a year, there are a total of 90 stations scattered along the [[Colonia Roma|Roma]]-[[Condesa]], [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro]], [[Colonia JuÃ¡rez (Mexico City)|JuÃ¡rez]] neighborhoods within 300&amp;nbsp;meters from each other and are fully automatic only serving one bicycle per person using a transponder based card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecobici.df.gob.mx/home/home.php |title=Ecobici |publisher=Ecobici.df.gob.mx |accessdate=April 17, 2011}} {{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both bicycle service users have access to several permanent [[CiclovÃ­a]]s in the city, the most important runs 59&amp;nbsp;kilometers from [[Polanco]] to [[Fierro del Toro]], which is located south of [[Cumbres del Ajusco National Park]], near the [[Morelos]] state line. The city's initiative is inspired by forward thinking examples, such as [[Denmark]]'s [[Copenhagenization (bicycling)|Copenhagenization]].

=== Buses ===
[[File:TAPO.jpg|thumb|Retail center in the waiting area of the TAPO bus terminal.]]
The city has four major bus stations (North, South, Observatorio, TAPO), which comprise one of the world's largest transportation agglomerations, with bus service to many cities across the country and international connections. The city has one train station, used for commercial and industrial purposes (interstate [[train|passenger trains]] are now virtually non-existent in Mexico). A suburban rail system, the ''[[Ferrocarril Suburbano de la Zona Metropolitana del Valle de MÃ©xico|Tren Suburbano]]'' serves the metropolitan area, beyond the city limits of the [[Mexico City Metro|metro]], to municipalities such as [[Tlalnepantla de Baz|Tlalnepantla]] and [[CuautitlÃ¡n Izcalli, Mexico State|CuautitlÃ¡n Izcalli]], with future extensions to [[Chalco]] and [[Los Reyes Acaquilpan|La Paz]].

=== Airports ===
[[File:Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de MÃ©xico - Terminal 2 - Ãrea de Salidas.JPG.jpg|thumb|left|Departures waiting area in Terminal 2 of the Mexico City airport.]]
Mexico City is served by [[Mexico City International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA Airport Code]]: MEX). This airport is Latin America's busiest and largest in traffic, with daily flights to North America, mainland Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia. [[AeromÃ©xico]] ([[SkyTeam|Skyteam]]) and [[Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n|Mexicana]] ([[Oneworld]]) are based at this airport, and provide codeshare agreements with non-Mexican airlines that span the entire globe. It is used by over 26 million passengers per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeropuertosmexico.com/DF/aptoDFes.htm Aeropuertos Mexico] {{Wayback|url=http://www.aeropuertosmexico.com/DF/aptoDFes.htm|date =20090227034956}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This traffic exceeds the current capacity of the airport, which has historically centralized the majority of [[Air Traffic|air traffic]] in the country. An alternate option is [[Lic. Adolfo LÃ³pez Mateos International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA Airport Code]]: TLC) located in the nearby [[Toluca]], [[State of Mexico]] with about 4.5&amp;nbsp;million passengers transported last year. In 2008, about 31 million people went through the city's airports. The government engaged in an extensive restructuring program that includes the new second adjacent terminal, which began operations in 2007, and the enlargement of four other airports (at the nearby cities of [[Toluca]], [[QuerÃ©taro, QuerÃ©taro|QuerÃ©taro]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] and [[Cuernavaca]]) that, along with Mexico City's airport, comprise the ''[[Grupo Aeroportuario del Valle de MÃ©xico]]'', distributing traffic to different regions in Mexico. The city of [[Pachuca, Hidalgo|Pachuca]] will also provide additional expansion to central Mexico's airport network. Mexico City's airport is the main hub for 11 of the 21 [[List of airlines of Mexico|national airline companies]].

Mexico City is one of the most important cultural centers in the world, boasting more museums than any other city.&lt;ref name=&quot;emporis.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Emporis|url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=city&amp;lng=3&amp;id=101008|title=Mexico City â Emporis|publisher=Emporis|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also comes third in the number of theaters in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;emporis.com&quot;/&gt; just after London and New York. Having been the capital of a vast pre-Hispanic empire, and also the capital of richest viceroyalty within the [[Spanish Empire]] (ruling over a vast territory in the Americas and [[Spanish East Indies]]), and, finally, the capital of the Mexican federation, Mexico City has a rich history of [[Mexican art|artistic expression]]. Since the Mesoamerican pre-Classical period the inhabitants of the settlements around Lake Texcoco produced many works of art and complex craftsmanship, some of which are today displayed at the world-renown [[Museo Nacional de AntropologÃ­a|National Museum of Anthropology]] and the ''[[Templo Mayor]]'' Museum. While many pieces of pottery and stone-engraving have survived, the great majority of the Amerindian iconography was destroyed during the Conquest of Mexico.

During colonial times the first art produced was that of the codices generated to preserve or recuperate Amerindian iconography and history. From then, artistic expressions in Mexico were mostly religious in theme. The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] still displays works by [[Juan de Rojas]], [[Juan Correa]] and an [[oil painting]] whose authorship has been attributed to [[BartolomÃ© Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]. Secular works of art of this period include the [[equestrian statue|equestrian sculpture]] of [[Charles IV of Spain]], locally known as ''El Caballito'' (&quot;The little horse&quot;). This piece, in bronze, was the work of [[Manuel TolsÃ¡]] and it has been placed at the [[Plaza TolsÃ¡]], in front of the Palacio de MinerÃ­a (Mining Palace). Directly in front of this building is the beautiful [[Museo Nacional de Arte]] (Munal) (the National Museum of Art).

During the 19th century, an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos ([[San Carlos Art Academy]]), founded during colonial times, and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes PlÃ¡sticas (the [[National School of Visual Arts]]), which is currently one of the [[art school]]s of UNAM. Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ([[National Museum of San Carlos]]). One of the students, [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a Velasco GÃ³mez|JosÃ© MarÃ­a Velasco]], is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century. It was during [[Porfirio DÃ­az]]'s regime that the government sponsored arts, especially those that followed the French school. In spite of that, popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished like those of [[JosÃ© Guadalupe Posada]] and [[Manuel Manilla]]. The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt, VelÃ¡zquez, Murillo, and Rubens.

After the [[Mexican Revolution]], an [[avant-garde]] [[art movement|artistic movement]] originated in Mexico City: [[mural]]ism. Many of the works of muralists [[JosÃ© Clemente Orozco]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]] are displayed in numerous buildings in the city, most notably at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]. [[Frida Kahlo]], wife of Rivera, with a strong nationalist expression, was also one of the most renowned of Mexican painters. Her house has become a museum that displays many of her works.

The former home of Rivera muse [[Dolores Olmedo]] house the namesake museum. The facility lies in the Xochimilco precinct in the southern part of the city and includes several buildings surrounded by sprawling manicured lawns. It houses a large collection of Rivera and Kahlo paintings and drawings, as well as living ''Xoloizcuintles'' ([[Mexican Hairless Dog]]). It also regularly hosts small but important temporary exhibits of classical and [[modern art]] (e.g. Venetian Masters and Contemporary New York artists).

During the 20th century, many artists immigrated to Mexico City from different regions of Mexico, like [[Leopoldo MÃ©ndez]], an engraver from Veracruz, who supported the creation of the socialist Taller de la GrÃ¡fica Popular ([[Popular Graphics Workshop]]), designed to help [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] workers find a venue to express their art. Other painters came from abroad, like [[Catalonia|Catalan]] painter [[Remedios Varo]] and other Spanish and Jewish exiles. It was in the second half of the 20th century that the artistic movement began to drift apart from the Revolutionary theme. [[JosÃ© Luis Cuevas]] opted for a modernist style in contrast to the muralist movement associated with social politics.

Mexico City has numerous museums dedicated to art, including Mexican colonial, modern and [[contemporary art]], and international art. The Museo Tamayo was opened in the mid-1980s to house the collection of international contemporary art donated by famed Mexican (born in the state of Oaxaca) painter [[Rufino Tamayo]]. The collection includes pieces by Picasso, Klee, Kandinsky, Warhol and many others, though most of the collection is stored while visiting exhibits are shown. The [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] ([[Museum of Modern Art]]) is a repository of Mexican artists from the 20th century, including Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros, Kahlo, Gerzso, Carrington, Tamayo, among others, and also regularly hosts temporary exhibits of international modern art. In southern Mexico City, the Museo Carrillo Gil ([[Carrillo Gil Museum]]) showcases avant-garde artists, as does the University Museum/Contemporary Art (Museo Universitario Arte ContemporÃ¡neo â or MUAC), designed by famed Mexican architect [[Teodoro GonzÃ¡lez de LeÃ³n]], inaugurated in late 2008. The [[Museo Soumaya]], named after the wife of Mexican tycoon [[Carlos Slim]], has the largest private collection of original [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] sculptures outside Paris. It also has a large collection of DalÃ­ sculptures, and recently began showing pieces in its masters collection including [[El Greco]], VelÃ¡zquez, Picasso and Canaletto. The museum inaugurated a new futuristic-design facility in 2011 just north of Polanco, while maintaining a smaller facility in Plaza Loreto in southern Mexico City. The [[ColecciÃ³n Jumex]] is a contemporary art museum located on the sprawling grounds of the [[Jumex]] juice company in the northern industrial suburb of [[San CristÃ³bal Ecatepec|Ecatepec]]. It is said to have the largest private contemporarry art collection in [[Latin America]] and hosts pieces from its permanent collection as well as traveling exhibits by leading contemporary artists. The Museo de San Ildefonso, housed in the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City's historic downtwon district is a 17th century colonnaded palace housing an art museum that regularly hosts world-class exhbitis of Mexican and international art. Recent exhibits have included those on David LaChapelle, Antony Gormley and Ron Mueck.
The National Museum of Art (Museo Nacional de Arte) is also located in a former palace in the historic center. It houses a large collection of pieces by all major Mexican artists of the last 400 years and also hosts visiting exhibits.

[[Jack Kerouac]], the noted American author, spent extended periods of time in the city, and wrote his masterpiece volume of poetry ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' here. Another American author, [[William S. Burroughs]], also lived in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of the city for some time. It was here that he accidentally shot his wife.

There are more than 150 museums in Mexico City. Most of the museums can be visited from Tuesday to Sunday from 10&amp;nbsp;am to 5&amp;nbsp;pm, although some of them have extended schedules, such as the Museum of Anthropology and History, which is open up to 7&amp;nbsp;pm. In addition to this, entrance to most museums is for free on Sundays. However, in some cases a modest fee may be charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/visita.html |title=Ciudad de MÃ©xico.- atractivos turÃ­sticos |publisher=Mexicocity.com.mx |accessdate=April 17, 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090225110752/http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/visita.html |archivedate = February 25, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major addition to the city's museum scene is the Museum of Remembrance and Tolerance (Museo de la Memoria y Tolerancia), inaugurated in early 2011. The brainchild of two young Mexican women as a holocaust museum, the idea morphed into a unique museum dedicated to showcasing all major historical events of discrimination and genocide. Permanent exhibits include those on the holocaust and other humanitarian atrocities in history among others. It also houses temporary exhibits, including a recent one on Tibet which was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in September 2011.

[[File:UNAM library.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]]]
[[File:SEPCornerDF.JPG|thumb|Headquarters of the Mexican secretary of education]]

The second oldest university in the Americas, established in 1551, the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM), is located in Mexico City. It is the largest university on the continent, with 305,969 students from all backgrounds enrolled. Three [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]], several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's [[scientific method|scientific research]] and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centers. The National Autonomous University of Mexico ranks 45th in the Top 200 World [[College and university rankings|University Ranking]] published by [[Times Higher Education|The Times Higher Education Supplement]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/144076.html |title=Times Higher Education Supplement, 2006 |publisher=Eluniversal.com.mx |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as [[Ciudad Universitaria]], was named a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 2007.

The second largest higher-education institution is the [[National Polytechnic Institute]] (IPN) (which includes, among many other relevant centers, the [[CINVESTAV|Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n y de Estudios Avanzados]] (Cinvestav), where high-level research is performed about very different scientific and technological disciplines.

The whole funding is allocated by the government of Mexico City (in some specific cases, such as [[El Colegio de MÃ©xico]], funding comes from both the city's government and other public and private national and international entities). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

A very special case is that of [[Colegio Nacional|El Colegio Nacional]], created during the governmental period of [[Miguel AlemÃ¡n ValdÃ©s]] to have, in Mexico, an institution very similar to the [[CollÃ¨ge de France|College of France]]. The very selected and [[privileged group]] of Mexican scientists and artists belonging to this institution (the membership is lifelong; some of the current members are [[Mario Lavista]], [[Ruy PÃ©rez Tamayo]], [[JosÃ© Emilio Pacheco]], [[Marcos Moshinsky]] (d.2009), [[Guillermo SoberÃ³n Acevedo]], and many others) have the obligation of disclosing their works among the general population, through conferences and public events such as concerts and recitals.

[[File:LitDecorationsWestZocaloGrito2010.JPG|thumb|left|Decorated facade of the Portal de Mercaderes market building.]]

The city's main source of fresh produce is the [[Central de Abasto, Mexico City|Central de Abasto]]. This in itself is a self-contained mini-city in the southeastern neighborhood of [[Iztapalapa]] covering an area equivalent to several dozen city blocks. The wholesale market supplies most of the city's &quot;mercados&quot;, supermarkets, and restaurants, as well as individuals who come to purchase the freshest variety for their household. Tons of fresh produce are trucked in from all over Mexico every day.

The principal fish market is known as [[La Nueva Viga Market|La Nueva Viga]] and is located in the southern part of the city, in the same complex as the Central de Abastos. Fresh fish from all around the country is available, mainly from the central Pacific coast and [[Veracruz]].
The world-renowned market of [[Tepito]] occupies 25 blocks of the city, and is known to sell everything and anything, except dignity.

A staple for consumers in the city is the omnipresent &quot;mercado&quot;. Every major neighborhood in the city has its own borough-regulated market, often more than one. These are large well-established facilities offering most basic products, such as fresh produce and meat/poultry, dry goods, tortillerÃ­as, and many other services, such as locksmiths, herbal medicine, hardware goods, sewing implements, and a multitude of stands offering freshly made, home-style cooking and drinks in the tradition of [[aguas frescas]] and [[atole]].

In addition, &quot;mercados sobre ruedas&quot; or mobile markets, set up shop on city streets in many neighborhoods, depending on the day of the week. Sundays are the day in which the largest number of these markets are set-up. The stalls generally use awnings of a single color or shade (pink and red, for example), making them easily identifiable from several blocks away.

Large, modern chain supermarkets including [[Soriana]], [[Comercial Mexicana]] and [[Chedraui]] are scattered throughout the city. Others are located within mini-malls, in which the supermarket anchors a number of other shops, such as banks, dry-cleaners, shoe repairs, and fast-food eateries.
Small &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; corner stores (known as &quot;abarroterÃ­as&quot; or more colloquially as &quot;changarros&quot;) abound in all neighborhoods, including many finer residential neighborhoods. These are small shops offering basics such as soft drinks, packaged snacks, canned goods, and dairy products. Thousands of [[C-stores]] or corner stores, such as [[OXXO|Oxxo]], [[7-Eleven]], and Extra are located throughout the city.

=== Downtown ===
[[File:FacadeCenCommMaderoDF.JPG|thumb|left|Downtown Mexico City]]

The [[La Merced Market, Mexico City|Mercado La Merced]] is one of city's oldest and is considered a smaller, older version of the Central de Abastos, where thousands of items are sold. The Mercado de Jamaica specializes in fresh flowers.

Calle Dolores, one block off Avenida JuÃ¡rez, has one block known as [[Chinatown, Mexico City|Mexico City's Chinatown]]. The one block contains numerous stores selling imported Chinese knick-knacks, and restaurants offering lacquered [[Peking Duck|Peking duck]], many of the early settler's who created the Chinatown are actually of [[Filipino people|Philippine]] descent.

== Nicknames ==
[[File:ESCALERAS DEL PALACIO POSTAL-2.jpg|thumb|left|The Postal Palace.]]
Mexico City was traditionally known as ''La Ciudad de los Palacios'' (&quot;the City of the Palaces&quot;), a nickname attributed to Baron [[Alexander von Humboldt]] when visiting the city in the 19th century who sending a letter back to Europe said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe.

During [[AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador|LÃ³pez Obrador]]'s administration a political slogan was introduced: ''la Ciudad de la Esperanza'' (&quot;The City of Hope&quot;). This slogan was quickly adopted as a nickname to the city under LÃ³pez Obrador's term, although it has lost popularity since the new slogan ''Capital en Movimiento'' (&quot;Capital in Movement&quot;) was adopted by the recently elected administration headed by [[Marcelo Ebrard]] Casaubon; the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media.

The city is colloquially known as ''Chilangolandia'' after the locals' nickname ''[[chilango]]s'', which is used either as a pejorative term by people living outside Mexico City or as a proud adjective by Mexico City's dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;1994 Oxford Spanish-English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of Mexico City are more formally called ''capitalinos'' (in reference to the city being the capital of the country) or, more recently ''defeÃ±os'' (a word which derives from the postal abbreviation of the Federal District in Spanish: D.F., which is read &quot;De-Efe&quot;.)

== Law enforcement ==
{{Main|Federal District Police}}
[[File:Federal police building.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Headquarters of the Mexican Federal Police]]
The Secretariat of Public Security of the Federal District (SecretarÃ­a de Seguridad PÃºblica del Distrito Federal â SSP) manages a combined force of over 90,000 officers in the Federal District (DF). The SSP is charged with maintaining [[public order crime|public order]] and safety in the center of Mexico City. The historic district of the city is also roamed by tourist police, which aims to serve and orient tourists. These enforcement agents dress in a more traditional outfit and ride on horses.

The investigative Judicial Police of the Federal District (PolicÃ­a Judicial del Distrito Federal â PJDF) is organized under the Office of the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General]] of the DF (the ProcuradurÃ­a General de Justicia del Distrito Federal). The PGJDF maintains 16 precincts (delegaciones) with an estimated 3,500 judicial police, 1,100 investigating agents for prosecuting attorneys (agentes del ministerio pÃºblico), and 941 experts or specialists (peritos).

Between 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher &quot;since most people are reluctant to report crime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Reuters|title=Police say Giuliani helps cut Mexico City crime|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/20040512-1639-crime-mexico.html|publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=May 12, 2004|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under policies enacted by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the city police force. Mexico City currently has one of the highest police officer to resident ratios in the world, with one uniformed police officer per every 100 citizens. Although the city has experienced a dramatic downfall in crime, it is still not as safe as large cities found in highly developed western European cities such as Frankfurt or Barcelona but is safer than cities such as Moscow or Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/security-central-in-mexico-citys-makeover/article2084076 This page is available to GlobePlus subscribers]&lt;/ref&gt;
