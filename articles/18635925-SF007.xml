'''Parted Magic''' is a computer [[operating system]] based on [[GNU/Linux]] and is distributed as [[free and open source software]]. It is named after [[GParted]], an open source partitioning tool, and the [[Linux_distribution|distribution]] is primarily designed for the purpose of [[disk partitioning]] and [[data recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shilliday|first=Barry|url=http://www.computeractive.co.uk/pcw/pc-help/1928465/backup-restore|publisher=Computeractive|accessdate=21 August 2011|title=Backup and Restore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The distribution is directly bootable by [[CD]] or [[USB flash drive]] on [[Personal computer|PC]] hardware, and does not require installation, or the presence of an installed operating system. This allows its use as a recovery tool, as well as a tool to configure new systems. Unlike most Linux distributions, it does not include a method for permanent installation (although this may be performed manually).&lt;ref&gt;http://partedmagic.com/doku.php?id=frugal_install&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originally designed for mechanical [[hard disk drives]], Parted Magic is suitable for use also with [[solid state drives]] and can perform a secure erase (a method to return a drive to its factory state). [[Corsair Memory|Corsair]], a major SSD manufacturer, recommends its use as &quot;the most common and user-friendly tool&quot; for performing a secure erase on its drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to secure erase Corsair SSDs with Parted Magic|url=http://blog.corsair.com/?p=4484|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parted Magic supports reading and writing to a variety of modern [[file systems]], including [[ext3]], [[ext4]], [[File_Allocation_Table|FAT]] and [[NTFS]], and as such is able to access disk drives formatted for use under [[Microsoft Windows]] and GNU/Linux systems.

The distribution includes local network and Internet support, and comes with the [[Firefox]] web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=partedmagic|title=Parted Magic|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Parted Magic has received positive reviews from mainstream technical magazines and websites,&lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/Parted-Magic/3000-2094_4-10663999.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/rsstory/73085.html|title=PartedMagic: A swiss army knife for hard drive resuscitation|last=Germain|first=Jack|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] noting in particular ability to recover data from multiple operating systems and its free cost, &quot;About the only other thing I can say about Parted Magic, besides that it's a must-download for your toolkit, is that it's free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,74365/description.html|last=Jacobi|first=Jon|accessdate=21 August 2011|publisher=PC World|title=Review of Parted Magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Requirements==

As of version 11.11.11, Parted Magic supports [[Intel x86]] and [[x86-64]] processors natively, and requires a computer with at least an [[i586]] Intel-compatible processor and 175MB of [[RAM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://partedmagic.com/doku.php&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- primary source only for now--&gt;
