'''Dassault Aviation''' ({{IPA-fr|daso}}; {{euronext|AM}}) is a [[France|French]] [[Aerospace manufacturer|aircraft manufacturer]] of [[military aircraft|military]], [[regional jet|regional]] and [[business jet|business]] [[jet aircraft|jets]], a subsidiary of [[Dassault]] Group.

It was founded in 1930 by [[Marcel Bloch]] as [[SociÃ©tÃ© des Avions Marcel Bloch]] or &quot;MB&quot;. After World WarÂ II, Marcel Bloch changed his name to [[Marcel Dassault]], and the name of the company was changed to '''Avions Marcel Dassault''' on 20Â DecemberÂ 1947. In 1971, Dassault acquired [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]], forming '''Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation''' (AMD-BA). In 1990, the company was renamed Dassault Aviation.

==History==

The [[SociÃ©tÃ© des Avions Marcel Bloch]] was founded by [[Marcel Bloch]] in 1930. In 1935 Bloch and [[Henry Potez]] entered into an agreement to buy SociÃ©tÃ© AÃ©rienne Bordelaise (SAB), subsequently renamed ''SociÃ©tÃ© AÃ©ronautique du Sud-Ouest''. In 1936 the arms industry in France was nationalised as the ''[[SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale de Constructions AÃ©ronautiques du Sud Ouest]]'' (SNCASO). Marcel Bloch was asked to act as delegated administrator of the Minister for Air.

During the occupation of France the country's aviation industry was virtually disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Dassault Aviation ''[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/passion/gb/dassault_a_a_z/histoire_aviation/1916_1945/1916_1945_d.cfm History, 1916 to this day: During the War]''. Accessed 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Bloch was imprisoned by the [[Vichy government]] in October 1940. In 1944 Bloch was deported to the [[Buchenwald]] concentration camp by the German occupiers where he remained until it was liberated on 11 April 1945.

On 10 November 1945 at an extraordinary general meeting of the ''SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme des Avions Marcel Bloch'' the company voted to change its form to a limited liability entity, ''SociÃ©tÃ© des Avions Marcel Bloch'', which was to be a holding company. On 20 January 1947 ''SociÃ©tÃ© des Avions Marcel Bloch'' became ''SociÃ©tÃ© des Avions Marcel Dassault'' to reflect the name adopted by its owner.

In 1954 Dassault established an electronics division (by 1962 named ''Electronique Marcel Dassault''), the first action of which was to begin development of airborne radars, soon followed by seeker heads for air-to-air missiles, navigation and bombing aids. From the 1950s to late 1970s exports become a major part of Dassaultâs business, major successes were the [[Dassault Mirage]] series and the [[Dassault_Falcon|Mystere-Falcon]]. The average rate in the period 1952â1977 was 58%.&lt;ref&gt;Dassault Aviation ''[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/passion/gb/dassault_a_a_z/histoire_aviation/1945_1965/1945_1965_d.cfm History, 1916 to this day: Export becomes one of Dassault's main lines of business]''. Accessed 5Â JanuaryÂ 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1965 and 1966 the French government stressed to its various defence suppliers the need to specialize to maintain viable companies. Dassault was to specialise in combat and business aircraft, [[Nord Aviation]] in [[ballistic missiles]] and [[Sud Aviation]] civil and military transport aircraft and [[helicopter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dassault Aviation ''[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/passion/gb/dassault_a_a_z/histoire_aviation/1965_1986/1965_1986_a.cfm History, 1916 to this day: The company's successive reorganizations]''. Accessed 5Â JanuaryÂ 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (Nord Aviations and Sud Aviation would merge in 1970 to form [[AÃ©rospatiale]]) .

On 27 June 1967 Dassault (at the urging of the French government) acquired 66% of [[Breguet Aviation]]. Under the merger deal SociÃ©tÃ© des Avions Marcel Dassault was dissolved on 14 December 1971, with its assets vested in Breguet, to be renamed Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation (AMD-BA).

[[Dassault SystÃ¨mes]] was established in 1981 to develop and market Dassaultâs [[CAD]] program, [[CATIA]]. Dassault SystÃ¨mes was to become a market leader in this field.

In 1979 the French government took a 20% share in Dassault and established the SocietÃ© de Gestion de Participations AÃ©ronautiques ([[SOGEPA]]) to manage this and an indirect 25% share in Aerospatiale (the government also held a direct 75% share in that company). In 1998 the French government transferred its shares in Dassault Aviation (45.76%) to Aerospatiale. On 10 July 2000, AÃ©rospatiale-Matra merged with other European companies to form [[EADS]].

In 2000 [[Serge Dassault]] resigned as Chairman and was succeeded by Charles Edelstenne. Serge Dassault was appointed honorary chairman.
