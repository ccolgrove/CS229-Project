'''NTFS-3G''' is an [[open source]] [[cross-platform]] implementation of the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[NTFS]] file system with read-write support. NTFS-3G often uses the [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]] [[file system interface]], so it can run unmodified on many different [[operating system]]s. It is runnable on [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|OpenSolaris]], [[BeOS]], [[QNX]], [[WinCE]], [[Nucleus RTOS|Nucleus]], [[VxWorks]], [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]],&lt;ref name=&quot;community-edition&quot;&gt;[http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-download/ NTFS-3G Community Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MorphOS]], and [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref name=&quot;catacombae&quot;&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/catacombae/ NTFS-3G for Mac OS X (&quot;Catacombae&quot;)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is licensed under either the [[GNU General Public License]] or a proprietary license. It is a partial [[fork (software development)|fork]] of [[ntfsprogs]] and is under active maintenance and development.

NTFS-3G was introduced by one of the senior Linux NTFS developers, Szabolcs Szakacsits ({{IPA-hu|ËsÉboltÊ ËsÉkÉtÊitÊ}}), in July 2006. The first stable version was released on 2007-02-21 as version 1.0. The developers of NTFS-3G later formed a company, [[Tuxera|Tuxera Ltd.]], to further develop the code. NTFS-3G is now the free &quot;community edition&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;community-edition&quot; /&gt; while Tuxera NTFS is the proprietary version.

==Features==
NTFS-3G supports all operations for writing files: files of any size can be created, modified, renamed, moved, or deleted on NTFS partitions. [[NTFS#File compression|Transparent compression]] is supported, but there is no support for [[Encrypting File System|encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-faq/ NTFS-3G FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Support to modify [[access control list]]s and [[file system permissions|permission]]s is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/b.andre/security.html NTFS-3G: NTFS Driver with Ownership and permissions]&lt;/ref&gt; NTFS partitions are [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] using the [[Filesystem in Userspace]] (FUSE) interface.

NTFS-3G supports partial NTFS [[journaling file system|journaling]], so if an unexpected computer failure leaves the file system in an inconsistent state, the volume can be repaired. As of 2009, a volume having an unclean journal file is recovered and mounted by default. The ânorecoverâ mount option can be used to disable this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.ntfs-3g.devel/678 NTFS-3G 2009.2.1 changelog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
Benchmarks show that the driver's performance via [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]] is comparable to that of other filesystems' drivers in-kernel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csamuel.org/2007/04/25/comparing-ntfs-3g-to-zfs-fuse-for-fuse-performance/ Comparing NTFS-3G to ZFS-FUSE for FUSE Performance]&lt;/ref&gt; provided that the CPU is powerful enough. On embedded or old systems, the high processor usage can severely limit performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-commercial/performance/ Performance at Tuxera]&lt;/ref&gt;.
Current versions often show 100% CPU utilization on dealing with big files on fragmented NTFS file systems &lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntfs-3g/+bug/392204 / Huge CPU usage by mount.ntfs process] &lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
* NTFS-3G forked from the Linux-NTFS project on 2006-10-31.
* On 2007-02-21, Szabolcs Szakacsits announced &quot;the release of the first open source, freely available, stable read/write NTFS driver, NTFS-3G 1.0.&quot;
* On 2009-10-05, NTFS-3G for Mac was brought under the auspices of [[Tuxera]] Ltd. and a proprietary version called Tuxera NTFS for Mac was made available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/2009/10/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac.html NTFS-3G for Mac OS X is now Tuxera NTFS for Mac]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 12th, 2011 it was announced that Ntfsprogs project was merged with NTFS-3G.
