PiTiVi is designed to be intuitive [[video editing software]] that integrates well in the [[GNOME]] desktop environment. It aims to be &quot;a powerful, flexible video editor that can appeal to [[prosumers]] and professionals.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.pitivi.org/wiki/Roadmap&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Edward Hervey started working on PiTiVi in 2004 as an end-of-studies project at the EPITECH engineering school in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially written in C, the PiTiVi code base was rewritten in Python eighteen months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;edward.hervey-is.that.a.video.editor&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation, Edward was hired by [[Fluendo]] to work on GStreamer for the following two years,&lt;ref name=&quot;edward.hervey-is.that.a.video.editor&quot; /&gt; after which Edward co-founded Collabora's Multimedia division in order to improve PiTiVi, GStreamer and the GNonlin plugins.&lt;ref name=&quot;collabora.who-are-we&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In the past there have been several video editors available for [[Linux]], but, they were considered difficult to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;jono-bacon.pitivi.5JAN2010&quot;&gt;[http://gnomejournal.org/article/79/pitivi Jono Bacon, The GNOME Journal - PiTiVi, January 5, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] Community Manager [[Jono Bacon]] stated &quot;Back in 2006, the video editing situation was looking far more exciting. Michael Dominik was working on the hugely exciting Diva project and Edward Hervey was working on PiTiVi. Both combined exciting technologies, being built on the formidable foundations of [[GTK]], [[GNOME]], [[GStreamer]], and Cairo. Diva was developed using Mono, and PiTiVi using Python. With the video buzz in the air, Michael and Edward both demoed their projects at the Villanova GUADEC to rapturous applause&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jono-bacon.pitivi.5JAN2010&quot; /&gt;

Bacon also noted that PiTiVi has taken a long time to mature: &quot;For Edward to have created the first incarnation of PiTiVi he needed to ensure that GStreamer and GNonLin were mature and stable enough to use for his application&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jono-bacon.pitivi.5JAN2010&quot; /&gt;

=== Inclusion in the default set of Ubuntu applications ===
In April 2010, with the launch of [[Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx]], PiTiVi version 0.13.4 became the first default movie editor offered as part of the  [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] ISO CD. 

In May 2011, it was announced that PiTiVi would be no longer part of the Ubuntu ISO, starting with [[Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot]]'s release in October 2011. The reasons given for removing it included &quot;poor user reception, lack of fit with the default user-case for Ubuntu, lack of polish and the application's lack of development maturity&quot;. PiTiVi will not be replaced on the ISO with another video editor and will remain available to users for installation from the Ubuntu repositories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Launchpad&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pitivi/+publishinghistory|title = Publishing history of âpitiviâ package in Ubuntu|accessdate = 23 September 2010|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul15Jan10&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2010/01/ubuntu-1004-alpha-2-brings-pitivi-panel-changes.ars|title = Ubuntu 10.04 alpha 2 brings Pitivi, panel changes|accessdate = 23 September 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG13May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/pitivi-to-be-removed-as-default-app-in-ubuntu-11-10/|title = Video editor PiTiVi to be removed as default app in Ubuntu 11.10|accessdate = 14 May 2011|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, Jeff Fortin, one of the project developers raised concerns regarding the reasons given for removing PiTiVi from the set of default applications and voiced disappointment in Canonical/Ubuntu not supporting the application as they would have been expected to.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-desktop/2011-May/003061.html PiTiVi in Ubuntu 11.10 and beyond] by Jeff Fortin, 25 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The switch to GStreamer Editing Services ===
Edward Hervey announced the availability of GStreamer Editing Services (GES) at the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.gnome.org/edwardrv/2009/11/30/the-result-of-the-past-few-months-of-hacking/&lt;/ref&gt; Further confirmations of intentions to migrate PiTiVi to GES came at the Meego conference in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://sf2011.meego.com/program/sessions/video-editing-your-pocket&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until the 0.15 release that it was officially announced that the next release would be based upon GES.&lt;ref&gt;http://thiblahute.blogspot.com/2011/09/pitivi-015-is-out.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
PiTiVi inherits its capabilities for importing and exporting (rendering) media from the [[GStreamer]] framework, or plugins for the GStreamer framework. PiTiVi supports simple media editing capabilities such as trimming, snapping, splitting and cutting of clips. Audio mixing is supported by curves, visualised as line segments drawn over an audio waveform. PiTiVi has the ability to step through a piece of media using scrubbers or keyboard shortcuts. Audio and video clips can be linked together, and treated as a single clip. Initial support for video mixing (compositing and transitions) has been added in late 2009 but is still under heavy work. A more exhaustive list of features can be found on the PiTiVi website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-FranÃ§ois Fortin Tam gave a talk at [[Libre Graphics Meeting]] 2009, discussing how usability became a major focus for the PiTiVi project,&lt;ref name=&quot;pitivi.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lgm.pitivi.2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = January 4, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how design considerations impacted PiTiVi's user-interface, with examples such as the use of subtle gradients in timeline objects, drag and drop importing and direct manipulation, native theme integration, and reducing complexity by carefully evaluating the need (or lack thereof) to impose preference choices onto users.&lt;ref name=&quot;lgm.pitivi.2009&quot;/&gt; Another talk, focused on the economics of open source video editors, was given by Jean-FranÃ§ois at [[Libre Graphics Meeting]] 2011.

The PiTiVi project also has a user manual that covers the usage of the application. PiTiVi has been translated and localized for several languages by the GNOME [[i18n]] teams.

Through GStreamer, PiTiVi is the first open source video editor to support the [[Material Exchange Format]] (MXF).&lt;ref name=&quot;collabora.project.pitivi&quot;&gt;{{cite web

As part of a [[Google Summer of Code]] project to &quot;Permit Pitivi users to add effects to the videos they are editing&quot;, Thibault Saunier implemented video effects in the development version of PiTiVi. This work was initially anticipated to be included starting with PiTiVi 0.13.5&lt;ref name=&quot;OMBU&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/06/video-effects-in-pitivi.html|title = Video Effects in PiTiVi|accessdate = 06 July 2010|last = Alexithymia|first = Joey-Elijah|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but was announced as being deferred to the 0.13.6 release.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2010/09/21/pitivi-0-13-5-released/|title = PiTiVi 0.13.5 released|accessdate = 15 May 2011|year = 2010|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features were finally released as version 0.14.0-2 on 1 June 2011. Aside from improved and expanded effects this version included a new welcome screen, a redesigned project settings dialog box and a simplified rendering dialog. In reviewing this version for [[OMG! Ubuntu!]] writer Joey Sneddon said of the new rendering that it &quot;totally wipes the floor with its competition: it is so incredibly simple to use.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG01Jun11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.something.com|title = PiTiVi video editor updates adds video effects, new features and more|accessdate = 1 June 2011|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = June| work = [[OMG!

==Sponsorship==
At the end of 2008, Collabora Multimedia decided to fund the development of PiTiVi throughout 2009 by assigning Edward Hervey, Brandon Lewis and Alessandro Decina to improve PiTiVi and GNonlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;collabora.project.pitivi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Media attention==
In an interview with gnomedesktop.org Edward Hervey discussed the state of PiTiVi and Linux Video editing; at one stage Edward notes that &quot;there's a total lack of cohesion between all the various multimedia applications/libraries/device-support on Linux which is IMHO the reason why we're not yet the reference platform for multimedia creation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = January 4, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view is further expanded on in another article showing Edward believes that &quot;if the Linux desktop was going to have a nice and easy to use video editor any time soon, we needed to do something to increase the pace of development significantly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;linux.com-collabora.funds&quot;&gt;{{cite web
