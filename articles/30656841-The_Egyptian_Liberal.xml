The ''' 2011 Yemen Uprising''' followed the initial stages of the [[Tunisian Revolution]] and occurred simultaneously with the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian Revolution]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Thousands call&quot; /&gt; and other [[Arab Spring|mass protests in the Middle East in early 2011]]. In its early phase, protests in [[Yemen]] were initially against unemployment, economic conditions&lt;ref name=&quot;afreuters&quot; /&gt; and corruption,&lt;ref name=&quot;People are fed up&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The protestors' demands then escalated to calls for [[President of Yemen|Yemeni President]] [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] to resign. Mass defections from the military, as well as from Saleh's government, effectively rendered much of the country outside of the government's control, and protesters vowed to defy its authority.

A major demonstration of over 16,000 protestors took place in [[Sana'a]], Yemen's capital, on 27 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish Times breaking26&quot; /&gt; On 2 February, Saleh announced he would not run for reelection in 2013 and that he would not pass power to his son.

On a &quot;Friday of No Return&quot; on 11 March, protestors called for Saleh's ousting in Sana'a where three people were killed. More protests were held in other cities, including [[Al Mukalla]], where one person was killed. On 18 March, protesters in Sana'a were fired upon resulting in 52 deaths and ultimately culminating in mass defections and resignations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/4/worldupdates/2011-06-04T010231Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-574889-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates Yemen president Saleh fights to keep grip on power]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in late April, Saleh agreed to a [[Gulf Co-operation Council]]-brokered deal only to back away hours before the scheduled signing three times.

In early July the government rejected the opposition's demands, including the formation of a transitional council with the goal of formally transferring power from the current administration to a caretaker government intended to oversee Yemen's first-ever democratic elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/news_middleeast_africa/2011-07-06/minister-says-yemen-will-not-accept-a-transitional-council.html|agency=NTDTV|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=7 July 2011|title=Minister Says Yemen Will Not Accept a Transitional Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, factions of the opposition announced the formation of their own 17-member transitional council on 16 July, though the [[Joint Meeting Parties]] that have functioned as an umbrella for many of the Yemeni opposition groups during the uprising said the council did not represent them and did not match their &quot;plan&quot; for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/16/us-yemen-idUSTRE76F0ZP20110716?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FworldNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+International%29|agency=Reuters|date=16 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011|title=Yemen protesters set up transitional council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A draft amendment to the [[constitution of Yemen]] is currently under discussion in parliament despite opposition protests. The amendment seeks to allow Saleh to remain in the office of president for life. He urged the opposition to take part in an election on April 27 to avoid &quot;political suicide.&quot;

The current parliament's mandate was extended by two years after an agreement in February 2009 agreement the ruling [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] and opposition parties seeking a dialogue on political reforms such as: moving from a presidential system to a proportional representation parliamentary system and a more [[federalism|decentralised]] government. Neither measure has been implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_karman_detained&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129112626339573.html |title=New protests erupt in Yemen - Middle East |publisher= [[Al Jazeera English]] |date=|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 alleged internal governmental dissent===
According to a [[WikiLeaks]] report released 31 January 2011, in December 2009 [[United States]] diplomat Angie Bryan claimed that there had been opposition to Saleh from his closest advisors for several months. Bryan wrote, &quot;Like other Saleh watchers, xxxxx&lt;ref name=&quot;why_xxxxx&quot;&gt;Names hidden by [[WikiLeaks]] and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|collaborating newspapers]].&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes the multitude of threats facing Saleh as qualitatively different and more threatening to the regime's stability than those during any other time in Yemen's history. 'Saleh is overwhelmed, exhausted by the war, and more and more intolerant of internal criticism. Saudi involvement comes at just the right time for him' xxxxx said. Largely unprecedented criticism of Saleh's leadership within the rarified circle of Saleh's closest advisors has increased in recent months, even including longtime Saleh loyalists such as Office of the Presidency aides xxxxx, according to xxxxx. These names add to the growing chorus of Saleh loyalists that have shed their traditional aversion to disparaging the man they call 'The Boss'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;09SANAA2279&quot;&gt;{{cite document| last = Bryan | first =Angie | title = Yemeni tribal leader: for Saleh, Saudi involvement in Sa'ada comes not a moment too soon | id={{WikiLeaks cable|09SANAA2279}} | publisher =[[WikiLeaks]]| date=28 December 2009 | url =http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/12/09SANAA2279.html | accessdate=31 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w8OrQ284 |archivedate=31 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediation attempts===

In April, the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] attempted to mediate an end to the crisis, drafting several proposals for a transition of power. Toward the end of the month, Saleh signaled he would accept a plan that would see him leave power one month after signing and provided for a national unity government in the lead-up to elections.&lt;ref&gt;Hatem, Mohammed; Carey, Glen (23 April 2011).

In late May, opposition leaders received assurances that Saleh would sign the GCC plan after all, and they signed the deal the day before the president was scheduled to ink it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Xinhua|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-05/22/c_13887312.htm|title=Yemeni opposition signs the Gulf-brokered deal|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Saleh once again decided not to sign, and a brief but tense standoff occurred on 22 May when Saleh's supporters surrounded the embassy building of the [[United Arab Emirates]] in Sana'a, trapping international diplomats (including the secretary-general of the GCC) inside until the government dispatched a helicopter to ferry them to the presidential palace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/05/22/150031.html Saleh Gunmen Hold Many Envoys Hostage At Uae Embassy In SanaâA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May, a day after Saleh refused to sign the transition agreement, Sheikh [[Sadiq al-Ahmar]], the head of the [[Hashid]] tribal federation, one of the most powerful tribes in the country, declared support for the opposition and his armed supporters came into conflict with loyalist security forces in the capital Sana'a after Saleh ordered al-Ahmar's arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;570news&quot;/&gt; Heavy street fighting ensued, which included artillery and mortar shelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;570news&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational.ae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alternet.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday.com&quot;/&gt; The militiamen had surrounded and blocked off several government buildings in the capital&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/in-transition/Renewed-Yemen-Clashes-Leave-at-Least-Seven-Dead-122497914.html Yemeni Tribesmen Take Control of Government Buildings in Sana'a]&lt;/ref&gt; and people on the ground were reporting that it looked like the situation was deteriorating into a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watoday.com.au/world/yemen-on-the-brink-of-civil-war-20110524-1f1l1.html Yemen on the brink of civil war]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the situation in Sana'a was developing, about 300 Islamic militants attacked and captured the coastal city of [[Zinjibar]] (population 20,000)(see [[Battle of Zinjibar]]). During the takeover of the town, the militants killed five policemen, including a high-ranking officer, and one civilian. Two more soldiers were killed in clashes with militants in Loder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=690711&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=200 Al-Qaida kills 5 policemen in S.

A ceasefire was announced late on 27 May, by al-Ahmar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-05/27/c_13897885.htm Yemeni armed tribesmen announces ceasefire with gov't forces]&lt;/ref&gt; and the next day, a truce was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20110528-yemen-mediators-work-consolidate-sanaa-truce# Yemen mediators work to consolidate Sanaa truce]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition demonstrators had occupied the main square of [[Ta'izz]] since the start of the uprising against the rule of president Saleh. The protests were for the most part peaceful. However, that changed on 29 May, when the military started an operation to crush the protests and clear the demonstrators from their camp at the square. Troops reportedly fired live ammunition and from water cannons on the protesters, burned their tents and bulldozers ran over some of them. The opposition described the event as a massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13592935 Yemen forces 'kill 20 protesters' in Taiz]&lt;/ref&gt; (see 2011 [[Ta'izz clashes]])

However, by 31 May, the ceasefire had broken down and street fighting continued in Sana'a.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13599828 Yemen unrest: UN says 50 killed in Taiz since Sunday]&lt;/ref&gt; Tribesmen had taken control of both the headquarters of the ruling General People's Congress and the main offices of the water utility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/deadly-clashes-in-yemeni-cities-as-troops-kill-7-20110531-1feb4.html Deadly clashes in Yemeni cities as troops kill 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June, units of the loyalist Presidential Guard, commanded by one of Saleh's sons, shelled the headquarters of an army brigade belonging to the defected 1st Armored Division, even though the defected military units were holding a neutral position in the conflict between the loyalists and the tribesmen. The worst of the fighting was in the northern Hassaba neighborhood, where tribal fighters seized a number of government ministries and buildings. Government artillery fire heavily damaged the house of al-Ahmar and the government cut the area's electricity and water supplies. The government units, led by one of Saleh's sons, and loyalist special forces attacked but failed to recapture the Hassaba administrative building. Tribal fighters also seized the office of the General Prosecutor in the city's northwest. They were backed up by two armored vehicles from the 1st Armored Division. The Interior Ministry stated that the tribesmen had also captured a five-story building in the pro-Saleh Hadda neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ijEmHA2z43gq3RNjiWfRY94J2nwA?docId=3e4ceb37a4a7464284bb0a86f4773a2e Street battles in Yemeni capital leave 41 dead]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 24 hours since the breakdown of the ceasefire, 47 people were killed on both sides during the heavy street fighting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/airport-shuts-as-fighting-rages-in-yemen-20110602-1fh0v.html Airport shuts as fighting rages in Yemen]&lt;/ref&gt; including 15 tribesmen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/06/01/yemen.unrest/index.html?section=cnn_latest Source: Missiles strike at Yemeni defectors' compound]&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE73L1PP20110601 Explosions and street fighting grip Yemen capital]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June, a bombing at the presidential palace left Saleh injured and seven other top government officials wounded. Saleh, the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the parliament chief, the governor of Sana'a and a presidential aide were wounded while they were praying at a mosque inside the palace compound. Saleh was initially said to be injured in the neck and treated on the scene; later reports indicated his wounds were far more severe - including a collapsed lung and burns over 40% of his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mohammed |last=Jamjoom |first2=Hakim |last2=Almasmari |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/06/07/yemen.unrest/ |title=Witnesses: Tribal fighters take over major city in Yemen |publisher=CNN.com |date= 8 June 2011|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four presidential guards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/mobile/article/700141205/Yemen-president-wounded-as-tribesmen-strike-palace.html Yemen president wounded as tribesmen strike palace]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sheikh Ali Mohsen al-Matari, an imam at the mosque, were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;palaceshell&quot;/&gt;

In early July the government rejected the opposition's demands, including the formation of a transitional council with the goal of formally transferring power from the current administration to a caretaker government intended to oversee Yemen's first-ever democratic elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/news_middleeast_africa/2011-07-06/minister-says-yemen-will-not-accept-a-transitional-council.html|agency=NTDTV|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=7 July 2011|title=Minister Says Yemen Will Not Accept a Transitional Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, factions of the opposition announced the formation of their own 17-member transitional council on 16 July, though the [[Joint Meeting Parties]] that have functioned as an umbrella for many of the Yemeni opposition groups during the uprising said the council did not represent them and did not match their &quot;plan&quot; for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/16/us-yemen-idUSTRE76F0ZP20110716?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FworldNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+International%29|agency=Reuters|date=16 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011|title=Yemen protesters set up transitional council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August, Saleh left the hospital in Saudi Arabia, but he did not return to Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera Yemen Live Blog. [http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/yemen-aug-7-2011-0935|Sunday, August 7, 2011 - 09:35 Entry]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 18 September troops loyal to president Saleh opened fire on protesters in Sanaa, killing at least 26 people and injuring hundreds. Witnesses said security forces and armed civilians opened fire on protesters who left Change Square, where they had camped since February demanding regime change, and marched towards the city centre. Earlier on that day, government trooops fired mortars into Al-Hasaba district in Sanaa, home to opposition tribal chief Sheik [[Sadeq al-Ahmar]] who said his fighters did not return fire after they were shelled by the Republican Guard.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/09/2011918141553217505.html Dozens of protesters shot dead in Yemen]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September government troops and snipers in nearby buildings again opened fire on Monday at peaceful demonstrators and passers-by in the capital's Change Square, killing at least 28 people and wounded more than 100. Additional deaths were reported in the southwestern city of [[Taiz]], where two people were killed and 10 were injured by gunfire from Saleh loyalists. Abdu al-Janadi, Yemen's deputy information minister, rejected accusations that the government had planned attacks on the protesters, and accused what he described as &quot;unknown assailants&quot; of carrying out the acts.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/09/201191913558115259.html Death toll soars in Yemen violence]&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September protesters and ex-soldiers stormed a base of the elite Republican Guards, who are loyal to the president. Reports said not a single shot was fired as the Guards fled the base, leaving their weapons behind.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119201429637417.html Yemeni toll rises after fresh Sanaa shelling]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September fighting broke out between Republican Guard troops commanded by Saleh's son Ahmed, and dissidents loyal to General [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]]. Fighting which had been concentrated since 18 September in the city centre and at Change Square spread on to Sanaa's Al-Hasaba district, where gunmen loyal to powerful dissident tribal chief Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar traded fire with followers of [[Saghir bin Aziz]], a tribesman loyal to Saleh.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119227516362990.html Deadly fighting rages through Yemeni capital]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September, Yemeni state-television announced that Saleh had returned to the country after three months amid increasing turmoil in a week that saw increased gun battles on the streets of Sana'a and more than a 100 deaths.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/09/201192344820432439.html Yemen's Saleh calls for ceasefire on return]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 2011, Saleh flew to [[Riyadh]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] to sign the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] plan for political transition, which he had previously spurned. Upon signing the document, he agreed to legally transfer the office and powers of the presidency to his deputy, Vice President [[Abdu-Rabbo Mansour al-Hadi]], within 30 days. He is reportedly to fly to [[New York City]] for further treatment, where [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] said he hoped to meet with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;survivor&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/November/middleeast_November598.xml&amp;section=middleeast|agency=Khaleej Times|title=Saleh, Yemenâs great survivor, finally quits power|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March, he announced a [[Yemeni constitutional referendum, 2011|referendum]] on moving to a parliamentary system of government would be held later in the year. A spokesperson for the anti-government protesters said this was &quot;too little, too late.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12697077 | title = Yemen: President Saleh Announces 'Parliamentary System' | publisher = BBC News | date = 1 March 2011 | accessdate = 11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said a new constitution would guarantee the separation of legislative and executive powers and prepare for a new election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New constitution promised for Yemen | publisher = [[Al-Jazeera English]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/201131073622898186.html |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March, Saleh fired the cabinet, Saleh fired all members of his [[Cabinet of Yemen]] on the same day including Prime Minister [[Ali Muhammad Mujawar]] and vice-Prime Ministers [[Al-Rashad Mouhmmed AlaÃ¯my]], [[Abdul-Karim Al-Ar'haby]] and [[Sadiq Amin Abu-Rass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Yemeni President Fires Government | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12800887 | date = 20 March 2011 |accessdate = 21 March 2011 | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but asked them to remain in a caretaker role until he forms a new one.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJYemen20Mar&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Yemen President Fires Cabinet | publisher = [[Al-Jazeera English]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011320180579476.html | date = 20 March 2011 | accessdate = 20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the [[Yemeni Congregation for Reform]], the largest opposition party in Yemen, Mohammed al-Sabry, stated, &quot;We want constitutional amendments but we want amendments that don't lead to the continuance of the ruler and the inheritance of power to his children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;afreuters&quot; /&gt; He also doubted Saleh's pledge not to seek re-election. Al-Sabry said Saleh made a promise in 2006 not to run, but then failed to fulfill his pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110202/D9L4JL1O0.html |title=Yemeni president says he won't seek another term |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |date=|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March, Saleh, in a letter passed to opposition groups, offered to hold a referendum on a new constitution, then a parliamentary election, followed by a presidential poll before the end of 2011. The opposition groups said they were studying the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yemeni president offers early elections | publisher =[[Al-Jazeera English]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/201132323226372234.html |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March, Saleh issued a statement that he &quot;has accepted the five points submitted by the JMP, including formation of a government of national unity and a national committee to draft a new constitution, drafting a new electoral law, and holding a constitutional referendum, parliamentary elections and a presidential vote by the end of the year&lt;ref&gt;Jamjoom, Mohammed (24 March 2011).

On 30 March, at a meeting with Mohammed al-Yadoumi, head of the Islah party, Yemen's president has made a new offer, proposing he stays in office until elections are held at the end of the year but transferring his powers to a caretaker government, with a prime-minister appointed by the opposition.

===Arrests and repression===
[[File:Yemen protest3.jpg|thumb|A television reporter in the middle of protesters in [[Sana'a]] on 3 February.]]
On 23 January, Tawakel Karman was detained and charged with &quot;'inciting disorder and chaos' and organising unauthorised demonstrations and marches&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ifex_karman_freed&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = | title = Authorities Release Journalists for Fear of Tunisia-Style Unrest | publisher =[[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] | date = 26 January 2011 | url =http://www.ifex.org/yemen/2011/01/26/karman_released/ | accessdate = 1 February 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wBItIgt2 | archivedate = 1 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karman was a leader of two student rallies in Sana'a and called for the overthrow of Saleh's regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_karman_detained&quot;/&gt; Her husband said her whereabouts were not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_karman_detained&quot; /&gt; Several hundred students protested outside Sana'a University demanding her release.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_karman_detained&quot; /&gt; Thousands of people protested against the arrest of Karman and other protestors by a sit-in outside of the prosecutor's office. She was freed 30 hours after her arrest on parole, with the condition not to violate &quot;public order and the law&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ifex_karman_freed&quot; /&gt; Karman returned to participating in demonstrations hours after her release.&lt;ref name=&quot;ifex_karman_freed&quot; /&gt;

On 14 March, security forces raided an apartment shared by four Western journalists and deported them. [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned the action and noted that two other foreign journalists were also deported two days earlier. The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] also condemned the expulsions. They also said that two Yemeni journalists informed them that a group of twenty people, believed to be government supporters, went to the Yemeni Journalists' Syndicate in Sana'a a day earlier{{When|date=March 2011}} and threatened to burn it down.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJYemen15Mar&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Yemen Deports Foreign Journalists | publisher =[[Al-Jazeera English]] | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011314212132903514.html | date = 15 March 2011 | accessdate = 15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further said that Yemeni journalists are facing increasing harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | title = Attacks on Journalists in Yemen, Sudan Amid Street Protests |url=http://cpj.org/2011/01/attacks-on-journalists-in-yemen-sudan-amid-street.php | publisher = [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]  | date = | accessdate = 1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reactions==
{{main|International reactions to the 2011 Yemeni uprising}}
The Yemeni government's response to protests prompted a backlash even from traditional allies like the [[United States]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sudarsan Raghavan&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021804066.html| title = In Yemen, Government Loyalists Harden Their Attacks on Protesters| author = Raghavan, Sudarsan | work = [[The Washington Post]]| date = 18 February 2011 | accessdate = 17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67892/bernard-haykel/saudi-arabias-yemen-dilemma|publisher=Foreign Affairs|first=Bernard|last=Haykel|title=Saudi Arabia's Yemen dilemma|date=14 June 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of national governments have called on President Saleh to resign, and the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] introduced an initiative calling upon Saleh to relinquish power in favor of a new, democratically elected government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13190305|agency=BBC News|date=25 April 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011|title=Yemen: Opposition backs GCC plan for Saleh resignation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2011, Tawakul Karman was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her visible role as a woman in the Arab Spring movement and as a human right activist in Yemen. She shared the Prize with  Liberian President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] and Liberian peace activist [[Leymah Gbowee]].

==Analysis==
===Use of pink===
[[File:Yemen protest1.jpg|Protesters with pink signs and headwear on 3 February.|thumb]]
{{main|Colour revolution}}
Yemeni protesters wore [[pink]] ribbons to symbolise the &quot;[[2010â2011 Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]]&quot; and indicate their non-violent intent.&lt;ref name=&quot;tom finn&quot; /&gt; Shawki al-Qadi, a lawmaker and opposition figure, said pink was chosen to represent [[love]] and to signal that the protests would be peaceful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Code Pink&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Opposition factions===
{{See also|Political parties in Yemen}}
According to [[Al Jazeera English]] in late February, the deeply fractured opposition includes the [[Joint Meeting Parties]] (JMP; formed in 2002), [[al-Islah|Islah]] (also known as Yemeni Congregation for Reform and the major member of JMP), the al-Ahmar family, and various insurrection groups including the [[Houthis]] in the north and the [[South Yemen Movement]] in the south. These groups include socialist, Islamist and tribal elements with differing goals. Islah, which [[Yemeni parliamentary election, 2003|currently holds about twenty per cent]] of the seats in the legislature, includes some members of the Ahmar family, Yemen's [[Muslim Brotherhood#Yemen|Muslim Brotherhood]], and [[Salafi]] preacher [[Abdul Majid al-Zindani]], labeled a &quot;specially designated global terrorist&quot; by the US. The JMP also includes the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), Al-Haq, the Unionist party, and the Popular Forces Union party. The al-Ahmar sons&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Sadek al-Ahmar]] and [[Hamid al-Ahmar]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; whose late father was a former leader of the Hashid tribal confederation, want power. The Southern Movement has temporarily dropped its calls for secession with calls for Saleh's ouster.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (28 February 2011).

[[Al Jazeera English]].  Retrieved 16 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[human rights in Yemen|Yemeni human-rights activists]] and students disagree with [[Political parties in Yemen|political parties]] regarding tactics for political change in Yemen. Some political parties have called for reform to take place under President Saleh, while students and human rights activists have wished to &quot;channel the momentum of the [[2010â2011 Arab world protests|2010&amp;ndash;2011 uprisings in the region]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WP_Yemeni_tactics&quot; /&gt; In late January, a lawyer and human-rights activist involved in organising protests, Khaled al-Anesi, stated &quot;There is a popular movement and a political movement in Yemen. But there is no support from the political parties for the popular movement, which is not organised. It is still weak and in the beginning stages.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WP_Yemeni_tactics&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Raghavan, Sudarsan | title = In Yemen, Calls for Revolution But Many Hurdles | date = 31 January 2011 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/30/AR2011013003175.html | accessdate = 16 May 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5w8L4BScB | archivedate = 30 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that in the absence of obvious candidates for the presidency, the transition of power is likely to be controlled by those who made the pre-emptive strike against him: [[Hamid al-Ahmar]] of Islah and the JMP, radical cleric [[Abdul Majid al-Zindani]], and Islamist-allied General [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]] (also called [[Ali Mohsen Saleh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{registration required|date=May 2011}} Fielding-Smith, Abigail; Khalaf, Roula (21 March 2011).

====Southern groups====
Southern secessionist groups said they were holding three Yemeni soldiers kidnapped towards the end of January. On 2 February, clashes in the south also resulted in three injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | date = 2 February 2011 | url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iny54OZvAJq5sX9zhloNLQxiGxvA?docId=CNG.4aae4371b956b57599c1a3203f206025.3f1 | title = Three Wounded in South Yemen Clashes | publisher = [[Agence France-Presse]] (via [[Google News]]) | accessdate = 16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of protesters in the north sees with interest the rise of the [[South Yemen Movement]], maybe hoping that the southern secessionists may overthrow the government.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====Al Qaeda====
On 6 March, [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the shooting of five soldiers two separate attacks during the ongoing protests. Four of the soldiers were killed in [[Marib province]] when the perpetrators opened fire on a passing military vehicle. Two of the soldiers were part of the [[Yemeni Republican Guard|Republican Guard]]. The other death was that of an army colonel who was shot as he went shopping in [[Zinjibar]], [[Abyan Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113685346945172.html |title=Yemeni Soldiers Killed in Attacks&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Five Dead in Suspected al-Qaeda Attacks as Protests Continue Against Saleh's Decades-Long Grip on Power | publisher = [[Al Jazeera English]] | date = 6 March 2011 |accessdate = 16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2011, AQAP declared an &quot;Islamic [[Emirate]]&quot; in the southern [[Abyan Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Craig, Iona | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-04-01-yemen01_ST_N.htm?csp=34news | title = Amid Region's Unrest, al-Qaeda Makes Inroads in Yemen | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 1 April 2011 | accessdate = 16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joint Meeting Parties====
On 2 March, six members of the JMP issued a five-point list of demands: right to demonstrate, investigations into violence, peaceful transition of government, time schedule within current year, and dialogue with those both inside and outside of Yemen.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/wordpress/?p=263 &quot;San'a Bulletin #4&quot;]. The Yemen Peace Project. 3 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April, the JMP issued a statement that any new regime, after Saleh's fall, would be a strong ally in the &quot;War on Terror&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&amp;SubID=3383&amp;MainCat=3 &quot; Opposition Assures Any 'New Regime Will Be Strong Ally in War on Terror'&quot;]. ''[[Yemen Post]]''. 4 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alliance of Yemeni Tribes====
{{main|Alliance of Yemeni Tribes}}
A group of anti-government tribes, most prominently the [[Hashid]] tribal federation, declared the formation of the Alliance of Yemeni Tribes on 30 July. The Alliance is headed by Sheikh [[Sadiq al-Ahmar]], the leader of the Hashid and a former ally of President Saleh, and is aligned with [[Yemen Army]] defectors under the leadership of General [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]]. In its first declaration, it vowed solidarity with the protest movement and warned the government that any attack on protesters or areas under the control of the Yemeni opposition would be seen as attacks on the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/World/Story/STIStory_696854.html|agency=Straits Times|date=31 July 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011|title=Yemeni tribes form coalition against Saleh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student Revolution====
The students have focused on secular demands for an end to corruption and oppression. Starting in February, there were concerns that Islah, part of the JMP political group, was attempting to co-opt the student protests. There were chants of âNo GPC, No Islahâ after al-Zindani's speech on 28 February, in which he renounced President Saleh and spoke of the return of the Islamic caliphate. There were also doubts about some of the government resignations being truly in support of the student protesters.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasinof, Laura (1 March 2011).  [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0301/Yemen-students-to-politicians-Don-t-hijack-our-revolution &quot;Yemen Students to Politicians: Don't Hijack Our Revolution&quot;].

On 13 March, a coordination council of the Sana'a University protestors presented a list of seven demands, starting with the removal of Saleh and the creation of a temporary presidential council made up of representatives drawn from Yemenâs four main political powers along with one appointed by the national security and military establishment. Many members of the Revolutionary Coalition of Youth for Peaceful Change (12 organizations) and the Organization of Liberal Yemeni Youth appear to be represented by this coordination counil.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Sakkaf, Nadia (14 March 2011).  [http://www.yementimes.com/defaultdet.aspx?SUB_ID=35747 &quot;Yemeni Youth Movements Consolidate&quot;].''[[Yemen Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March they sent a letter to US President Barack Obama, copying British PM David Cameron and EU President John Bruton, explaining their group, positions and proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Jane (22 March 2011).

[[Armies of Liberation]]. 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April, the [[Civil Coalition of Youth Revolution]] (CCYR), a Yemen-based civil movement which includes 52 alliances of revolutionary youth activists around Yemen representing more than 10,000 members, released its Statute Draft including its &quot;vision, revolution objectives, principles, duties, mechanisms and goals of the interim phase&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armiesofliberation.com/archives/2011/05/08/yemen-ccyr-declares-continuation-of-uprising-and-releases-statute/ Yemen: CCYR declares continuation of uprising and releases statute], ''[[Armies of Liberation]]'', 8 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Dialogue Committee====
On 20 March, the National Dialogue Committee issued a position paper and list of demands. Their members are the JMP, independents, some [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] members, and social figures including political, tribal and businessmen. It is headed by Mr. [[Mohammed Salem Basandwah]], an adviser to the president, and Sheik [[Hameed Al-Ahmer]] of Islah is its Secretary General.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Jane (20 March 2011).

[[Armies of Liberation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil Bloc====
On 24 March, the Civil Bloc, an umbrella group of civil society organisations, called for a transitional council of nine figures &quot;not involved with the corruption of the old regime&quot; to draw up a new constitution over a six-month period ahead of elections.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Cynthia; Ghobari, Mohammed 24 March 2011.
