According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' Noor al-Deen, like Abu Zubaydah, was sent to [[Morocco]] by the [[CIA]], so he too could be subjected to &quot;[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]&quot;

According to the ''Washington Post'' Noor al-Deen admired Abu Zubaydah, was guileless and unguarded to his interrogators and was the source of much of information analysts initially believed about him.
[[John Kiriakou]], a CIA officer who participated in the raid said:

:&quot;He was frightened - mostly over what we were going to do with him. He had come to the conclusion that his life was over.&quot;

Historian [[Andy Worthington]], author of ''[[The Guantanamo Files]]'', confirmed that Noor al-Deen had not been sent to Guantanamo.&lt;ref name=Fff2009-03-30&gt;

According to Worthington, Noor Al-Deen was the teenager whom [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Abdullah Almalki]] described as being held [[extrajudicial detention]] in Syria's [[Palestinian Branch]] military prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;kerry&quot;&gt;Pither, Kerry. &quot;Dark Days: The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror&quot;, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
