[[File:bundanghighbuilding01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The main entry to Bundang High School.]]
The academic effort consists of forty classrooms; a library; two computer labs; a computing center; a foreign language lab; a science seminar room; a general classroom; and three self-study library attachments.

===Administrative===
The administrative and staff-support effort consist of three personnel offices; six teacher offices; two radio broadcast rooms; a publishing center; a media-conference room; four conference rooms; a parent's conference room; a nurseâs ward; and a performance stage.

===Athletic===
The health and recreation effort consists of a 9,600 square-meter [[gym]]nasium; a golf-serving range; a hard-pack gravel pitch.  The gymnasium space is convertible to accommodate [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[badminton]], [[Taekwondo]], and [[gymnastics]].

==Schedule==
The school year begins in the first week of March and continues to the last week of December, recessing for one-month in mid-July.  Classes are 8:20 to 17:10 Monday to Friday, 8:20 to 11:30 Saturday (odd-weekly).  Weekday mandatory self-study is 18:00-21:00 following the 17:10-18:00 dinner break.

==Curricula==
Bundang offers a challenging curriculum coupled with extensive opportunities in after-school programs, the arts, athletics, and twenty-one student-interest groups.  The final two years of education students concentrate their coursework within the social sciences (ì¸ë¬¸ì¬í) or sciences (ìì°ê³¼í) option.  Approximately 60 percent of students follow the social sciences option, 40 percent the sciences.

Self-study is supported by the school until midnight every day.

The school's yearly magazine, the ''Bundang Post'', is student run and entirely written in the English language.

==School Seal==
[[File:bundanghighemblem 125.jpg|thumb|right|Bundang emblem.]]
The seal was adopted before the first school assembly in January 1992.  The emblem's margin is formed by the superposition of the Korean &quot;ã&quot; onto &quot;ã·&quot; (apocryphally shaped like a folder).  The left &quot;ladder&quot; is but in fact the Chinese character é« (ê³ , ''high''); the character deliberately stops above the top margin, which education promoters added to signify the school's ''height'' above the other area schools.  The phonetic inscription ããã´ã·ãã fills the lower-right in block letters.  The emblem is sealed by the bi-lingual incorporated fide: ë¶ë¹ê³ ë±íêµ  / íêµ­  / 1992 (''Bundang Godeung Hakgyo / Hanguk / 1992'').  Green symbolizes youth, bravery, and a pioneering spirit; silver symbolizes diligence, justice, and harmony; white symbolizes purity, peace, and intelligence.
