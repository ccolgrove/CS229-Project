The '''Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering''' is the college of [[engineering]] at [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. The engineering program has existed at Texas Tech University since 1925. Additionally, the Whitacre College of Engineering administers graduate engineering degree programs at the university's campus in [[Texas Tech University at Amarillo|Amarillo]], Texas. Many of the college's degree programs are accredited by [[ABET]]. The Whitacre College of Engineering is the first and, presently, only school in the world to offer a doctor of philosophy degree in wind science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://today.ttu.edu/2007/08/coordinating-board-approves-first-wind-science-and-engineering-doctorate/ | title=Coordinating Board Approves First Wind Science and Engineering Doctorate - News | publisher=Texas Tech University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the Whitacre College of Engineering announced that it would rename its petroleum engineering department the Bob L. Herd Department of Petroleum Engineering. Herd, a Texas Tech petroleum engineering alumnus and [[Tyler, Texas]] oil man, donated $15 million to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petroleum Engineering Receives $15 Million Gift | publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://today.ttu.edu/2008/08/petroleum-engineering-receives-15-million-gift/|accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department was ranked tenth in the nation in the April 2008 edition of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report.''&lt;ref name=&quot;4-tech-grad-programs-top-100&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://today.ttu.edu/2008/04/us-news-world-report-ranks-texas-tech-graduate-programs-among-best/. | title=U.S. News &amp; World Report Ranks Texas Tech Graduate Programs Among Best&quot;  | publisher=Texas Tech University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Texas Technological College, present day Texas Tech University, School of Engineering was created in the fall of 1925. At that time the school consisted of 313 students and two faculty members, and was housed in the textile engineering building, now the industrial engineering building.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web | title=About the College :: History | publisher=Texas Tech University College of Engineering | url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/coe/about/history.php | accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, the School of Engineering expanded and opened the west engineering building, now the electrical and computer engineering building.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt; The school's civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, and textile engineering programs were accredited by the Engineering Council for Professional Development in 1933. The chemical engineering and petroleum engineering programs were accredited in 1959 and 1960 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt; The chemical engineering building opened for classes in 1960. In the early 1970s the Pulsed Power Research Center was created for the purpose of plasma research.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot; /&gt;

On November 12, 2008, Texas Tech announced that they received a $25 million gift from AT&amp;T and friends of Ed Whitacre in honor of former CEO and Texas Tech alumnus Edward E. Whitacre Jr.  Additionally, the college announced that it will be renamed the Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Texas+Tech+Names+College+of+Engineering+After+Former+Regent+and+AT%26amp%3BT+CEO+Edward+E.+Whitacre+Jr./4149495.html&lt;/ref&gt;
