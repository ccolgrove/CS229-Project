'''NetSurf''' is an [[open source]] [[web browser]] which runs on a variety of platforms including [[RISC OS]], [[AmigaOS]] and [[Unix-like]] systems.  NetSurf has features that include [[tabbed browsing]], text selection and [[PDF]] export. Running on other platforms is also possible by building from source, with the developers intending to add further binaries when time can be found to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns-users-list 2011-01-20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2011-January/009869.html|title=Mac OS X port and other frontend news|accessdate=2011-01-22|first=Michael|last=Drake|date=2011-01-20|publisher=[[Pepperfish.net]]|quote=NetSurf has been ported to Mac OS X[...]We plan to make NetSurf binaries available for more platforms as time permits.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NetSurf project was started in April 2002 in response to a discussion of the deficiencies of the RISC OS platform's existing web browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconbar.com/forums/viewthread.php?threadid=374|title=Web browsers|publisher=The Icon Bar forums|date=April 2002|accessdate=2001-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the project's inception, development versions for RISC OS users were made available for download by the project's [[Build automation|automated build system]]. NetSurf was voted &quot;Best non-commercial software&quot; four times in Drobe Launchpad's annual RISC OS awards between 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drobe.co.uk/features/artifact1249.html|title=Best of 2004 awards results|date=31 December 2004|publisher=Drobe Launchpad|accessdate=15 February 2011|first=Chris|last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact1776.html|title=Best of 2006 awards results|accessdate=15 February 2011|date=31 December 2006|publisher=Drobe Launchpad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact2179.html|title=Best of 2007 awards results|accessdate=15 February 2011|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Drobe Launchpad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drobe.co.uk/article.php?id=2389|title=Drobe Awards 2008: The results|date=31 December 2008|accessdate=15 February 2011|publisher=Drobe Launchpad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
NetSurf's multi-platform core is written in [[ANSI C]], and implements most of the [[HTML|HTML 4]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS 2.1]] specifications using its own bespoke [[layout engine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutnetsurf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/about/ |title=About NetSurf |publisher=The NetSurf Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of version 2.0, NetSurf uses ''Hubbub'', an HTML parser that follows the work-in-progress [[HTML5]] specification.  As well as rendering [[GIF]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and [[BMP file format|BMP]] images, the browser also supports formats native to RISC OS, including Sprite, Draw and [[ArtWorks]] files.  {{As of|2010}}, NetSurf has no support for [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/documentation/progress |title=Development Progress |publisher=The NetSurf Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ports==

[[Image:NetSurf screenshot ubuntu.png|thumb|right|150px|GTK NetSurf running under [[Linux]]]]

Work on a GTK [[porting|port]] began in June 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://source.netsurf-browser.org/?rev=993&amp;view=rev |title=Subversion revision 993 |publisher=NetSurf Source Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid development and debugging.  It has since gained many of the user interface features present in the RISC OS version.  The browser is packaged with several distributions including [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[NetBSD]].

A native [[BeOS]]/[[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] port has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2008-August/007801.html|title=Announcement of AmigaOS and BeOS/Haiku ports|publisher=NetSurf Users mailing list}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amigabeos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NetSurf - BeOS Downloads|url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/downloads/beos/|accessdate=15 February 2011|archivedate=11 January 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfZn8qDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the GTK version was built for [[AmigaOS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amigaworld.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=26450&amp;forum=2|title=Could this Open Source Web Browser be easily ported for our needs?|publisher=Amigaworld.net - Forum|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Cygnix]] which provides an [[X11]] environment, a native AmigaOS port has also been developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;amigabeos&quot;/&gt; In January 2009, NetSurf was made available on [[MorphOS]], an operating system that is API-compatible with AmigaOS.&lt;ref name=&quot;MorphOS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morphzone.org/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6183&amp;forum=9 |title=Announcement of MorphOS version of NetSurf |publisher=MorphZone: The MorphOS Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work has started on a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] port, but as of September 2009 no official releases have been made.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsoc2009roundup&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2009-September/008959.html |title=Google Summer of Code Roundup |publisher=NetSurf Users mailing list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[framebuffer]] port was created in September 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutnetsurf&quot;/&gt;  Unlike the other ports, it does not use any GUI toolkit, but instead renders its own mouse pointer, scrollbars and other widgets.  The framebuffer front end has been used to create a web kiosk on embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8912553591.html |publisher=LinuxDevices |title=Tutorial: A web kiosk embeded system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the NetSurf Developers announced the release of what they expect to be the last release for [[RISC OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2010-January/009241.html |publisher=NetSurf Users mailing list |title=NetSurf at Wakefield Show 2010 |date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is at the Wakefield RISC OS show in April 2010. Team spokesman Michael Drake said at the time &quot;Realistically, the people qualified to maintain the RISC OS port are up to their necks in other stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iconbar.com/articles/Last_RISC_OS_version_of_NetSurf_announced/index1246.html |publisher=The Icon Bar |title=
Last RISC OS version of NetSurf announced |date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2011 saw the announcement of a [[Mac OS X]] port.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns-users-list 2011-01-20&quot; /&gt; At the time of the announcement, it has to be built from source.

Since February 20th, 2011, a port to the Atari 16/32 bit computers is available from http://freeshell.de/~monokrom/geeklog/index.php?topic=20110219230358215

==Releases==
After five years of development, the first stable version of the browser was released on 19 May 2007 to coincide with the Wakefield RISC OS show.  Version 1.0 was made available for download from the project's web site and the software was sold on CD at the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drobe.co.uk/article.php?id=1962 |publisher=Drobe Launchpad |title=NetSurf 1.0 is worth millions on paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of NetSurf 1.0 there have been two point-releases, which have largely comprised bug fixes.  In August 2007 and March 2008, these maintenance releases were made available for RISC OS and as a package in the [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]] repository on 15 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2007-August/006841.html |title=NetSurf 1.1 Announcement |publisher=NetSurf Users mailing list}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2008-March/007421.html |publisher=NetSurf Users mailing list |title=NetSurf 1.2 announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NetSurf 2.0 was released in April 2009 for RISC OS, Unix-likes (e.g. Linux), AmigaOS 4, BeOS and Haiku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/downloads/riscos/ |title=RISC OS NetSurf Downloads |publisher=The NetSurf Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/downloads/releases/ChangeLog.txt |title=NetSurf Change Log |publisher=The NetSurf Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 NetSurf 2.1 was released, with improvements to page layout and bug fixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/about/news |title=NetSurf News |publisher=The NetSurf Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Google Summer of Code==
NetSurf was accepted as a mentoring organisation into [[Google Summer of Code]] 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socghop.appspot.com/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2009 |publisher=Google Summer of Code 2009 |title=List of accepted organisations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects they ran included development of ''LibDOM'', the project's [[Document Object Model]], and improvement of NetSurf's user interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/developers/gsoc/ |title=NetSurf - Google Summer of Code Projects |publisher=The NetSurf Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interface work included moving previously RISC OS-only functionality to the multi-platform core, including bookmarks, global history, cookie management and page search features. A port to the Windows operating system was also started.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsoc2009roundup&quot;/&gt; In 2010 the NetSurf project did not apply to participate in Google Summer of Code due to the developers having other commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-dev-netsurf-browser.org/2010-March/001803.html |publisher=NetSurf Developer Mailing List |title=Google Summer of Code 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NetSurf also participated in Google Summer of Code in 2008 as a mentoring organisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/soc/2008/netsurf/about.html |publisher=Google Summer of Code 2008 |title=NetSurf Organization Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; running four projects. These included improving the GTK front end,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/soc/2008/netsurf/appinfo.html?csaid=2794A7C4A5D222D8 |title=GSoC project: Improved GTK front end |publisher=Google Summer of Code 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding paginated PDF export support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/soc/2008/netsurf/appinfo.html?csaid=8251210CF1E90869 |title=GSoC project: PDF plotter and printing improvements |publisher=Google Summer of Code 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the project's [[HTML 5]] compliant parsing library, ''Hubbub''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/soc/2008/netsurf/appinfo.html?csaid=4A19E24A0A8BC7C6 |title=GSoC project: Work on and integrate Hubbub |publisher=Google Summer of Code 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; All NetSurf development builds since 11 August 2008 have used ''Hubbub'' to parse HTML&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2008-August/007757.html |title=New HTML parser integrated into NetSurf |publisher=NetSurf Users mailing list}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is available for use in other projects under the [[MIT License|MIT license]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netsurf-browser.org/projects/hubbub |title=Hubbub project page |publisher=The NetSurf Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
