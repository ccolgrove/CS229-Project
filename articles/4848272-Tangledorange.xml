Trump renovated the [[Commodore Hotel New York|Commodore Hotel]] and created the [[Grand Hyatt New York|Grand Hyatt]] with the [[Pritzker family]].  He also renovated the [[Trump Tower (New York)|Trump Tower]] in New York City and several other residential projects. He later bought the [[Eastern Air Lines|Eastern Shuttle]] routes,&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|title=The Art of the Greater Fool: How the Shuttle Business Got Grounded|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74738263.html?dids=74738263:74738263&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=SEP+24%2C+1991&amp;author=ALLAN+SLOAN&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=The+Art+of+the+Greater+Fool%3A+How+the+Shuttle+Business+Got+Grounded&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=May 22, 2008|first=Allan|last=Sloan|date=September 24, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Atlantic City]] casino business, including acquiring the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort|Taj Mahal Casino]] in a transaction with [[Merv Griffin]] and [[Resorts International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Seven Acquisitive Executives Who Made Business News in 1988: Donald Trump â Trump Organization; The Artist of the Deal Turns Sour Into Sweet | last=Cuff | first=Daniel | date=December 18, 1988 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/27/business/seven-acquisitive-executives-who-made-business-1988-donald-trump-trump.html | accessdate=May 27, 2011 | work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1990, Trump threatened to sue [[Janney Montgomery Scott]], a [[stock brokerage]], whose [[stock analyst|analyst]] made negative comments on the financial prospects of Taj Mahal. The analyst refused to retract the statements, and the firm fired him. The firm denied being influenced by Trump's threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/27/business/analyst-who-criticized-trump-casino-is-ousted.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fG%2fGambling&amp;gwh=BA66E012E36D1D5C640C0B36A0A841BF | title=Analyst Who Criticized Trump Casino Is Ousted | work=New York Times | date=March 27, 1990 | last=Henriques | first=Diana | accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy for the first time in November 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/17/business/trump-47-million-short-gives-investors-50-of-his-prize-casino.html | title=Trump, $47&amp;nbsp;million Short, Gives Investors 50% of His Prize Casino | work=New York Times | date=November 17, 1990 | accessdate=May 27, 2011 | last=Hylton | first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analyst was awarded $750,000 by arbitration panel against his firm for his termination.

This expansion, both personal and business, led to mounting debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeMag&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972889,00.html|title=Trump Trips Up|date=May 6, 1991|work=TIME|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the news about him in the early 1990s involved his much publicized financial problems, creditor-led bailout, extramarital affair with [[Marla Maples]] (whom he later married), and the resulting divorce from his first wife, [[Ivana Trump]].

The late 1990s saw a resurgence in his financial situation and fame. In 2001, he completed [[Trump World Tower]], a 72-story residential tower across from the [[United Nations Headquarters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emporis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Emporis]]|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=100377|title=Trump World Tower| accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he began construction on [[Trump Place]], a multi-building development along the [[Hudson River]]. Trump owns commercial space in [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and [[condominium]]) tower on [[Columbus Circle]]. Trump currently owns several million square feet of prime [[Manhattan]] real estate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Forbes|url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/09/20/trump-wealth-biz_06rich400_0921trump.html|title=What is Trump Worth?|accessdate=July 4, 2008|date=September 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains a major figure in the field of real estate in the United States and a celebrity for his prominent media exposures.

===Early success (1968â89)===
Trump began his career at his father's company,&lt;ref name=parade&gt;{{cite news|title=In Step With: Donald Trump|publisher=Parade Magazine|date=November 14, 2004|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2004/edition_11-14-2004/in_step_with_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trump Organization, and initially concentrated on his father's preferred field of middle-class rental housing in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. One of Trump's first projects, while he was still in college, was the revitalization of the foreclosed Swifton Village [[apartment complex]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, which his father had purchased for $5.7&amp;nbsp;million in 1962. Trump became intimately involved in the project, personally flying in for a few days at a time to carry out landscaping and other low-level tasks. After $500,000 investment, Trump successfully turned a 1200-unit complex with a 66% vacancy rate to 100% occupancy within two years. The Trump Organization sold Swifton Village for $6.75&amp;nbsp;million in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korte|first=Gregory|title=Complex was troubled from beginning|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/09/01/loc_complex_was_troubled.html|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Trump moved to Manhattan, where he became convinced of the economic opportunity in the city, specifically large building projects in Manhattan that would offer opportunities for earning high profits, utilizing attractive architectural design, and winning public recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; Trump began by landing the rights to develop the old Penn Central yards on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]], then â with the help of a 40-year tax abatement by the financially strained New York City government, which was eager to give tax concessions in exchange for investments at a time of financial crisis â turned the bankrupt Commodore Hotel into a new Grand Hyatt.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTonWeb&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Time on the Web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/03/reviews/001203.03margolt.html|title=The House that Fred Built|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also instrumental in steering the development of the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center|Javits Convention Center]] on property he had an option on. The development saga of the Javits Convention Center brought Trump into contact with the New York City government when a project that he had estimated could have been completed by his company for $110&amp;nbsp;million ended up costing the city between $750&amp;nbsp;million and $1&amp;nbsp;billion. He offered to take over the project at cost, but the offer was not accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYSun&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Sun]]|url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/no-stadium-needed/11526|title=No Stadium Needed|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar opportunity would arise in the city's attempt to restore the [[Wollman Rink]] in [[Central Park]], a project started in 1980 with an expected 2Â½-year construction schedule that was still, with $12&amp;nbsp;million spent, nowhere near completion in 1986. Trump offered to take over the job at no charge to the city, an offer that was initially rebuffed until it received much local media attention. Trump then was given the job which he completed in six months and with $750,000 of the $3&amp;nbsp;million budgeted for the project left over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philly&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29BD2772C31D2&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Faster and cheaper, Trump finishes N.Y.C. ice rink| accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump was also involved with the old [[USFL]], a competitor to the NFL, as owner of the [[New Jersey Generals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/04/sports/sports-people-new-jersey-generalities.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE; New Jersey Generalities|accessdate=February 11, 2011|date=April 4, 1984|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Trump at one time acted as a financial advisor for [[Mike Tyson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D81730F931A25754C0A96E948260|title=Sports of The Times; Trump: Promoter Or Adviser?|accessdate=February 11, 2011|date=July 12, 1988|work=The New York Times|author=Anderson, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting [[Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks|Tyson's fight]] against [[Michael Spinks]] in Atlantic City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/sports/trump-gets-tyson-fight.html|title=Trump Gets Tyson Fight|accessdate=February 11, 2011|date=February 25, 1988|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial problems (1989â97)===
By 1989, the effects of the [[Early 1980s recession|recession]] left Trump unable to meet loan payments. Trump financed the construction of his third casino, the $1&amp;nbsp;billion [[Trump Taj Mahal|Taj Mahal]], primarily with high-interest [[high-yield debt|junk bonds]]. Although he shored up his businesses with additional loans and postponed interest payments, by 1991 increasing debt brought Trump to business bankruptcy&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeMag&quot;/&gt; and the brink of [[personal bankruptcy]]. Banks and [[Bond (finance)|bond]] holders had lost hundreds of millions of dollars, but opted to restructure his debt to avoid the risk of losing more money in court. The Taj Mahal re-emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50% ownership in the casino to the original bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates on the debt and more time to pay it off.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEED9133BF936A35753C1A967958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fT%2fTrump%2c%20Donald%20J%2e|title=Taj Mahal is out of Bankruptcy|accessdate=May 22, 2008|date=October 5, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 1992, the [[Trump Plaza (Atlantic City)|Trump Plaza Hotel]] was forced to file a prepackaged [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection plan after being unable to make its debt payments. Under the plan, Trump agreed to give up a 49% stake in the luxury hotel to [[Citibank]] and five other lenders. In return Trump would receive more favorable terms on the remaining $550+ million owed to the lenders, and retain his position as chief executive, though he would not be paid and would not have a role in day-to-day operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DC133CF931A25751C1A964958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fT%2fTrump%2c%20Donald%20J%2e|title=Trump Plaza Hotel Bankruptcy Plan Approved| accessdate=May 22, 2008|date=December 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1994, Trump had eliminated a large portion of his $900&amp;nbsp;million personal debt&lt;ref name=&quot;MagUSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Magazine USA| url=http://www.magazineusa.com/us/info/show.aspx?unit=originals&amp;doc=502|title=Donald Trump|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced significantly his nearly $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion in business debt. While he was forced to relinquish the [[Trump Shuttle]] (which he had bought in 1989), he managed to retain Trump Tower in New York City and control of his three casinos in Atlantic City. [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], which lent Trump the money to buy the West Side yards, his biggest Manhattan parcel, forced the sale of the tract to Asian developers. According to former members of the Trump Organization, Trump did not retain any ownership of the site's real estate&amp;nbsp;â the owners merely promised to give him about 30 percent of the profits once the site was completely developed or sold. Until that time, the owners of The West Side Yards gave him modest construction and management fees to oversee the development, and allowed him to put his name on the buildings that eventually rose on the yards because his well-known moniker allowed them to charge a premium for their condos.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestSideYards&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=What's He Really Worth|publisher=NY Times|date=October 23, 2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/business/yourmoney/23trump.html?pagewanted=6&amp;incamp=article_popular|accessdate=July 4, 2008|first=Timothy L.|last=O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump was elected to the [[Gaming Hall of Fame]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gaming Hall of Fame|url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/hof/index.html|publisher=[[University of Nevada Las Vegas]]|accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he combined his casino holdings into the publicly held [[Trump Entertainment Resorts|Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts]]. [[Wall Street]] drove its stock above $35 in 1996, but by 1998 it had fallen into single digits as the company remained profitless and struggled to pay just the interest on its nearly $3&amp;nbsp;billion in debt. Under such financial pressure, the properties were unable to make the improvements necessary for keeping up with their flashier competitors.

===Legal developments (2002â05)===
In January 2002, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] brought a financial-reporting case against Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc., alleging that it had committed several &quot;misleading statements in the company's third-quarter 1999 earnings release.&quot;  The matter was settled with the defendant neither admitting nor denying the charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Brings First Pro Forma Financial Reporting Case|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]]|date=January 16, 2002|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/headlines/trumphotels.htm|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on October 21, 2004, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts announced a restructuring of its debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump casinos file for bankruptcy|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=November 22, 2004|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6556470/|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan called for Trump's individual ownership to be reduced from 56 percent to 27 percent, with bondholders receiving stock in exchange for surrendering part of the debt. Since then, Trump Hotels has been forced to seek voluntary bankruptcy protection to stay afloat. After the company applied for Chapter 11 Protection in November 2004, Trump relinquished his CEO position but retained a role as Chairman of the Board. In May 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Company news: Trump delays emergence from bankruptcy by a week|work=New York Times|date=May 5, 2005|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91730F936A35756C0A9639C8B63|accessdate =May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company re-emerged from bankruptcy as [[Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts|Trump Entertainment Resorts Holdings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Resolution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Indiana Gaming Commission|url=http://www.in.gov/gaming/meetings/resolution/2005/2005-23-reso.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070627071835/http://www.in.gov/gaming/meetings/resolution/2005/2005-23-reso.pdf|archivedate=June 27, 2007|title=Indiana Gaming Commission on Trump Resorts' Bankruptcy|accessdate=July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence (1997â2007)===
Trump has several projects under way, with varying levels of success in their progress. The [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Honolulu)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;nbsp;â Honolulu]] seems to be a success. According to Trump, buyers paid non-refundable deposits, committing to purchase every unit on the first day they were made available. Construction of the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;nbsp;â Chicago]] seems to be proceeding as planned, although 30% of the units remain unsold. The [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Toronto)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;nbsp;â Toronto]] has had a series of delays and a height reduction. The [[Trump Tower (Tampa)|Trump Tower&amp;nbsp;â Tampa]] has been quite controversial because the initial sales were so successful that all deposits were returned in order to charge a higher price. Three years after construction of this controversial development began, construction has delayed and lawsuits have been filed. In [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, one Trump construction project was put on hold in favor of another ([[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Fort Lauderdale)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;nbsp;â Fort Lauderdale]]). Meanwhile, [[Trump Towers (Atlanta)|Trump Towers&amp;nbsp;â Atlanta]] is being developed in a housing market having the nation's second-highest inventory of unsold homes.&lt;ref name=SCPTTN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119517867398895020.html|title=Stalled Condo Projects Tarnish Trump's Name|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=May 22, 2008|date=November 16, 2007|first=Alex|last=Frangos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump was the first customer for the 2006 Cadillac DTS limosine after the President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2005/03/23/019243.html Donald Trump To Be The First Cadillac DTS Executive Limousine Customer].

===Financial crisis===
Sales for [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Chicago have been lagging.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Lender [[Deutsche Bank]] refused to let Trump lower the prices on the units to spur sales. Arguing that the financial crisis and resulting drop in the real estate market is due to [[Act of God|circumstances beyond his control]], Trump invoked a clause in the contract to not pay the loan. Deutsche Bank then noted in court that &quot;Trump is no stranger to overdue debt&quot; and that he had twice previously filed for bankruptcy regarding his casino operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Floyd Morris|title=Trump Sees Act of God in Recession|date=December 4, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/business/05norris.html?_r=1&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=donald%20trump&amp;st=cse|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump then initiated a suit asserting that his image had been damaged.

===Trump branding and  licensing===
Trump has succeeded in marketing the Trump name on a large number of products, including [[Trump Mortgage|Trump Financial]] (a mortgage firm), Trump Sales and Leasing (residential sales), [[Trump University]] (a business education company),{{Ref|trumpuni}} Trump Restaurants (Located in Trump Tower and consisting of Trump Buffet, Trump Catering, Trump Ice Cream Parlor, and Trump Bar), [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.gotrump.com GoTrump]{{Ref|gotrump}} (an online travel website), Donald J.

In 2011, Forbes reported that its financial experts had estimated the value of the Trump [[Brand equity|brand]] at $200&amp;nbsp;million. Trump disputes this valuation, saying that his brand is worth about $3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.forbes.com/kerenblankfeld/2011/04/28/donald-trump-on-his-brand-value-forbes-numbers-are-ridiculous/ | work=Forbes | first=Keren | last=Blankfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trump on Trump&quot; /&gt; For that reason, Trump does not own many of the buildings that display his name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trump on Trump&quot; /&gt;  According to ''Forbes'', this portion of Trump's empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562&amp;nbsp;million valuation. According to ''Forbes'' there are 33 licensing projects under development including seven &quot;condo hotels&quot; (the seven Trump International Hotel and Tower developments).

===Other ventures===

===''The Apprentice''===
[[File:Trump and Rodman 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Trump with ''Celebrity Apprentice'' star [[Dennis Rodman]]]]
In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the [[NBC]] [[Reality series|reality show]], ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises. The other contestants were successively &quot;fired&quot; and eliminated from the game. In 2004, Donald Trump filed a trademark application for the [[catchphrase]] &quot;[[You're fired]].&quot;{{Ref|tsg}}{{Ref|law}}{{Ref|cnn}}

For the first year of the show Trump was paid $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he is now paid a reported $3&amp;nbsp;million per episode, making him one of the highest paid TV personalities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2007, Trump received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his contribution to television (''The Apprentice'').

Along with British TV producer [[Mark Burnett]], Trump also put together ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]'', where well-known stars compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and &quot;firing&quot; losers.

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
Trump is a known [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] fan and friend of WWE owner [[Vince McMahon]]. He has hosted two [[WrestleMania]] events in the Trump Plaza and has been an active participant in several of the shows. Trump's Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was host to the [[World Bodybuilding Federation|1991 WBF Championship]] (which was owned by WWE, known at the time as the &quot;World Wrestling Federation.&quot;). Trump was interviewed by [[Jesse Ventura]] ringside at [[WrestleMania XX]]. He also appeared at [[WrestleMania 23]] in the corner of [[Bobby Lashley]] who competed against [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]] with WWE Chairman McMahon in his corner, in a hair versus hair match, with either Trump or McMahon having their head shaved if their competitor lost. Lashley won the match, and he and Trump both proceeded to shave McMahon bald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQPf3Cx-9eE |title=Vince shave by donald trump |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2009, as [[kayfabe|part of a storyline]], McMahon announced on ''[[WWE Raw]]'' that he had 'sold' the show to Donald Trump. Appearing on screen, Trump confirmed it and declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show in the amount of USD $235,000. McMahon &quot;bought back&quot; Raw on June 22, 2009. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  His [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance theme]] &quot;Money, Money&quot; was written by [[Jim Johnston (composer)|Jim Johnston]].

* Repeal of limits on campaign contributions, combined with outlawing [[soft money]] campaign contributions{{see also|Campaign finance reform in the United States}}
* Regarding [[universal health care]], Trump touted himself as &quot;a conservative on most issues, but a liberal on this one. Working out detailed plans will take time.

He speculated that [[Rudy Giuliani]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] could win the Republican and Democratic Presidential nominations, respectively, and voiced some support for either of them being elected President.

Regardless of this skepticism, Trump has quietly chosen to participate in the âPolitics and Eggsâ forum at the [[New Hampshire Institute of Politics]] at [[Saint Anselm College]], a popular spot for presidential candidates visiting New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/03/donald-trump-plans-new-hampshire-visit-in-june.html |title=Blogs.abdnews.com |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheduled visit is important because the event is taking place in mid June 2011, supposedly after Trump had been supposed to make his decision whether to or not to run.

On April 23, 2011, the New York-based TV station [[NY1]] reported that Trump had not voted in primary elections in New York City for a span of 21 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/137902/donald-trump-s-primary-voting-record-spotty--records-show |title=NY1.com |publisher=NY1.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning after the city's mayoral primary in 1989, an accusation he has denied.

====Statements regarding President Obama====
Speaking to an audience in Boca Raton, Florida on April 16, 2011, Trump contended that voter reaction to [[George W. Bush]]'s performance as U.S. President was the cause for the election of his successor, [[Barack Obama]], and further that Obama would probably be known as the worst president in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfnews13.com&quot;/&gt;

Trump has promoted [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about Obama's citizenship status]] in media appearances, and been criticized for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump, birther?|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51473.html#ixzz1GsPWRHLL|first=Kendra|last=Marr|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacNicol&gt;Glynnis MacNicol, [http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-birther-obama-muslim-video-2011-3 &quot;TRUMP: Maybe Obama's Missing Birth Certificate Says He's A Muslim&quot;], ''[[Business Insider]]'' March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[NBC-TV]] interview broadcast April 7, 2011, Trump said he was not satisfied that Obama had proven his citizenship.&lt;ref name=WashPost4711&gt;{{Cite news|title=Trump goes after Obama on US citizenship, says citizenship questions remain unanswered|date=April 7, 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=The Washington Post|separator=,|postscript=|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2011 NBC interview, Trump claimed he had sent people to Hawaii to investigate Obama's citizenship, commenting &quot;they cannot believe what they're finding.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-07/news/29412491_1_donald-trump-president-obama-hawaii|title=Donald Trump, wannabe President: I've sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's citizenship|date=April 7, 2011|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[Anderson Cooper 360Â°]]'' on [[CNN]], April 25, 2011, Trump said he wanted Obama to end the issue by releasing his long-form Certificate of Live Birth (distinct from the short-form Certification of Live Birth&amp;nbsp;â Hawaii's prima facie evidence of birth), adding, &quot;I've been told very recently ... the birth certificate is missing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/25/trump-claims-obama-birth-certificate-missing/|title=Trump claims Obama birth certificate 'missing'|date=April 25, 2011|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Birtherism: Where It All Began|url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53563_Page3.html |work=The Politico |date=April 22, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2011, the long-form of Obama's birth certificate was released by the [[White House]]. Obama said it should put the matter to rest; that the nation had more pressing problems to solve and could not afford to be &quot;distracted by side shows and carnival barkers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/27/obama-birth-certificate-r_n_854248.html Obama Birth Certificate Released By White House (PHOTO)].''Huffington Post'' April 27, 2011. Retrieved May 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Trump expressed pride at his role in the release of the long-form certificate in a press conference followup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20057854-503544.html Trump takes credit for Obama birth certificate release, but wonders &quot;is it real?&quot;] CBS News April 27, 2011. Retrieved May 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- In fairness to Trump, we might want to mention the killing of Bin Laden, as it may have also contributed to the poll drop --&gt;
Public Policy Polling described the events as &quot;one of the quickest rises and falls in the history of presidential politics&quot;, reporting:&lt;blockquote&gt;Trump really made hay out of the 'birther' issue and as the resonance of that has declined, so has his standing. In February we found that 51% of Republican primary voters thought Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Now with the release of his birth certificate only 34% of Republican partisans fall into that camp, and Trump's only in fifth place with that now smaller group of the electorate at 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2011/05/trump-collapses.html |title=Public Policy Polling â May 10, 2011 |publisher=Publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the ''[[Today Show]]'' on October 19, 2011, Trump stated that &quot;I could vote for anybody over President Obama. President Obama has been a total and complete disaster.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;{{cite news|last=Stump|first=Scott|title=Ignore 'Occupy' at parties' peril, says Trump|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44957300/ns/today-today_people/|accessdate=19 October 2011|newspaper=MSNBC|date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
