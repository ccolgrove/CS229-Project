'''Western Illinois University (WIU)''' is a public university founded in 1899 as Western Illinois State Normal School. Like many similar institutions of the time, Western Illinois State Normal School focused on teacher training for its relatively small body of students. As the normal school grew, it became Western Illinois State Teachers College. Today, Western Illinois University is composed of two campuses that provide a wide range of academic programs. The main campus is located in [[Macomb, Illinois|Macomb]], [[Illinois]], while Western Illinois University - Quad Cities is in [[Moline, Illinois]]. The Quad Cities new WIU campus is currently under construction along the [[Mississippi River]] and once it is completed it will be the only College along the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Hallwas, J. E. (1999). First Century: A Pictorial History of Western Illinois University. Macomb, IL: Western Illinois University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
Western Illinois University is composed of four academic colleges: Arts &amp; Sciences, Business &amp; Technology, Education &amp; Human Services, and Fine Arts &amp; Communication, in addition to an Honors College the School of Extended Studies, which includes nontraditional programs. The 17:1 faculty to student ratio maintained by WIU is among the best in the State of Illinois.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Ranked 413 among the best public and private colleges and universities, from the student's point of view in [[Forbes]].

The University also offers a Doctorate of Education in Educational Leadership (Ed. D.), which was established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/academics/&lt;/ref&gt;

The University offers 71 undergraduate majors over 51 degree programs and 13 pre-professional degrees at the undergraduate level. At the graduate level, 42 degree and certificate programs are offered. 95% of all courses are taught by full-time faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiu&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiu.edu/majors/|title=Western Illinois University Majors Offered|accessdate=August 28, 2007|publisher=Western Illinois University |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westernâs Cost Guarantee Plan is a four-year fixed rate for tuition, fees, room and board that remains in place as long as students are continuously enrolled. Western was one of the first institutions in America, and the first state university in Illinois, to offer the guarantee.[http://www.student.services.wiu.edu/admissions/prospective/guarantees-cost.asp] WIU's program served as a model for all other Illinois state universities through the state's &quot;Truth in Tuition&quot; program; however, Western is the only public university in Illinois that includes fees, room and board in its Cost Guarantee.[http://www.student.services.wiu.edu/admissions/prospective/guarantees-cost.asp] Western Illinois also offers the Cost Guarantee for graduate students enrolled in a degree program, as well as to transfer students earning an associate's degree. Those students who transfer to WIU the following semester upon completing their associate's degree will receive the previous year's cost guarantee rates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.student.services.wiu.edu/admissions/prospective/guarantees-cost.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

WIU also provides the FYE (First Year Experience) Program for all incoming freshmen. This program is designed to ease the transition from high school to college, and fosters the participation of FYE students in co-curricular events such as concerts, art exhibits, and guest lectures. In addition to their FYE program, WIU also provides a TYE (Transfer Year Experience) program to interested students. This program is aimed at introducing transfer students to the services and resources on campus within a residential setting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/fye/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illinois Centennial Honors College==
Western Illinois University is home to the Illinois Centennial Honors College, which was founded in 1983 in order to attract more adept students as freshman, as well as an avenue by which the most talented students at Western Illinois could distinguish themselves from other students at the university. Accordingly, the GPA admissions standard for the Illinois Centennial Honors College is nearly a full grade point higher (0.9) than the minimum GPA of any other college at the university, the second being the College of Business and Technology. Honors students complete a series of courses and projects unavailable to average students studying at Western Illinois, and are also eligible for a host of exclusive foundation scholarships.

Due to the intense nature of honors coursework, students vying for a spot in the Illinois Centennial Honors College should be prepared to dedicate additional time and effort to their schoolwork. Honors can be completed in many of the majors at Western Illinois, but there has not been a curriculum fashioned for every discipline. 

Consistent with its mission, the Macomb Honors Program provides a curriculum consisting of special tutorials, seminars, guided studies, and research projects, as well as opportunities to develop leadership and professional skills and participate in community and social services. A unique curriculum, honors faculty, and opportunities for leadership and service are integral to the honors experience. These are critical reasons to participate in the Honors Program for students seeking to maximize their collegiate years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/honors/&lt;/ref&gt;  

The prestige associated with the Illinois Centennial Honors College has led many to believe that graduates from the Honors Program receive preferential job placement, and applications to graduate schools are viewed more favorably than those of typical Western Illinois students.

==Library system==
[[File:WIU Malpass Library.jpg|thumb|left|Leslie F. Malpass Library]]
Five libraries make up the WIU Libraries system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/libraries/dean/&lt;/ref&gt;  The current Dean of Libraries is Phyllis C. Self, PhD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/PhyllisCSelf/41034&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by [[Gyo Obata]], Malpass Library stands at six levels high and 222,000 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/library/info/info_web.sphp?id=233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/libraries/events/trivia/2010/&lt;/ref&gt; Other WIU libraries include the Music Library, Physical Sciences Library, Curriculum Library, and the WIU-Quad Cities Library (Moline, Illinois) that was opened in the late 1990s to support WIU's growing presence in the Quad Cities. 

Western Illinois University Libraries house several archives and special collections that aid in documenting the history of the west-central Illinois region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/library/units/archives/&lt;/ref&gt;  The libraries are the home for the Center for Hancock County History, the Center for Icarian Studies, the Civil War Collection (documenting the western Illinois experience in the war), the Decker Press Collection and the Mormon Collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/library/units/archives/archives_web.sphp?id=102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/library/units/archives/collections/icarian/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/library/units/archives/collections/decker/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiu.edu/libraries/collections/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;  

The library's one millionth volume, ''[[The History of Joseph Smith by His Mother|Biographical Sketches of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and His Progenitors for Many Generations]]'', by [[Lucy Mack Smith]], was added in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiu.edu/library/events/mvc/] WIU Libraries -- Millionth Volume Digital Exhibit.

==History==
[[File:Shermanwide.jpg|thumb|right|Sherman Hall]]
Western Illinois University was founded in 1899. The land for the University was donated to the State of Illinois by Macomb's [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] (Illinois Lodge #17). Macomb was in direct competition with Quincy, Illinois and other candidates as the site for a &quot;western&quot; university. The Illinois legislature selected Macomb as the location. University administrators uncovered evidence of the Freemason's efforts on Macomb's behalf when they opened [[Sherman Hall (Western Illinois University)|Sherman Hall]]'s (the administration building) cornerstone during their centennial celebrations.

Sherman Hall served as the University's primary facility for many years, but as the University and its programs expanded, a need surfaced for further expansion. Today, the Macomb campus consists of 53 buildings over {{convert|1050|acre|ha|1}}. Sherman Hall is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Western's presence in the Quad Cities spans more than  40 years. In Fall 1960, the University offered its first undergraduate course in the Quad Cities.

==Folklore==
Simpkins Hall, home of the English and Journalism departments, has long been believed to be haunted by the ghost of an adolescent girl or boy, in a large part due to its former use as a training school. Simpkins is also said to be haunted by âHarold,â a former janitor or graduate assistant who lurks among the classrooms on the third floor and in the Writing Center. Students have reported hearing the disembodied sound of keys jingling, doors opening and closing, or a typewriter clicking, rattle the nerves of even the most seasoned educator. Another story circulating the hall is that of a woman who can be heard crying in the first floor restroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://trueillinoishaunts.com/haunted-places/colleges-and-universities/western-illinois-university/|title= Western Illinois University at the Legends and Lore of Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayliss, Tanner, Thompson, and Washington residents halls have their own ghost stories, all of which are based on unsubstantiated student deaths ranging from suicides to accidents. In Washington Hall, for instance, a girl supposedly ended her life after a fight with her boyfriend. According to the storytellers, the phone in her former room rings even though no one is on the line.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kleen, Paranormal Illinois (Atglen: Schiffer Books, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Acclaim==

Currently, ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'' ranks Western Illinois University as 49th among regional universities and 11th among public universities in the Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;USNews2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-midwest/top-public|title=US News and World Report Best Colleges 2011|accessdate=May 20, 2011|publisher=US News and World Report|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Western Illinois University has been repeatedly recognized as one of the âBest in the Midwest Collegesâ by The Princeton Review.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincetonReview&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeRankings.aspx?iid=1022617|title=Princeton Review Best Midwestern Colleges|accessdate=May 3, 2010|publisher=Princeton Review|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
