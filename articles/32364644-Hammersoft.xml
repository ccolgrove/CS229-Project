==History==

It was in 1986 that three educators thought of opening a school offering courses with their respective specialization. The Preschool, the intellectually challenged and the Hearing Impaired education respectively. The main goal of opening the Rizal Special Education Learning Center is to help educate pupils/students with special needs such as the hearing impaired, intellectually challenged, autistic, slow learners and fast learners. However, the need for regular atmosphere for eventual mainstreaming prompted the founders to open classes for regular pupils, thus, regular classes were opened with two grade levels every school year until Elementary Course was complete.

After nine years, it was observed that a lot of the graduate expressed their desires and sentiments to proceed with the secondary level in the same school. On the appeal of the parents, the concept was considered and realized.

It was then, in the school year 1995-1996 that the two levels in secondary Course were opened. The following year marked a new era in the history of also soared, hence, it became necessary to relocate from Rizal Sped, Davao City to the present site.

On January 18, 1996, the new building at Pardo de Tavera Street, Davao City, was inaugurated and upon the opening of the school year 1996-1997 all levels started to move classes in three thousand square meter campus. It was then, that the name of the school was changed to Rizal Special Education Learning Center.

At the commencement of school year 1997-1998, Rizal Special Education Learning Center entered into another milestone under the auspices of La Salle Supervision Office. The school became a De La Salle Consultancy School in school year 1998-1999 and in school year 1999-2000, the school became a [[De La Salle Supervised Schools | De La Salle Supervised School]] on probationary status. It was on February, 2002 that the school has satisfactorily met the standards and fulfilled all the requirements for De La Salle Supervised Accredited Status for level I and level II on June 2005. The Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines granted Level I status to RSELC for having satisfactorily met the standards and fulfilled all the requirements of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) on June 2006.
