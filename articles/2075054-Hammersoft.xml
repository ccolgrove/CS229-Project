'''Revision3''' is a [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] based [[Internet television|Internet television network]] that creates, produces and distributes [[web television]] shows on niche topics.

== Etymology ==
The company name refers to the evolution of video programming, according to founders [[Jay Adelson]] and [[David Prager]], starting with standard terrestrial [[broadcast television]] as ground zero. The first revision was [[cable television]], adding general interest channels, catering to the âmost common denominatorâ. The second revision was PC-based Internet video, independent films, no business model, no loyalty, no audience. The third revision or Revision3 is TV and Internet converged. iPods, TiVo, mobile, broadband enable mass, loyal audience to shift to on-demand, niche content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/micro-markets/?p=475 |title=Kevin Rose: âkill your televisionâ and join me at Revision3 |accessdate= |author=Donna Bogatin |date=2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shows==
===Production and distribution===
Some of the shows are produced and owned by Revision3 however most of Rev3's shows are produced independently. Revision3 only handles the distribution and marketing aspects of these shows but does not produce the content. In February 2008 Revision3 completed work on its own [[Television studio|studio]] where their own shows are recorded.

The shows are distributed through a wide range of platforms and distribution partners, including [[Virgin America]]'s [[In-flight entertainment|in-flight entertainment system]], [[CNET TV (online)|CNET TV]], [[iTunes]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], [[YouTube]], PyroTV, [[Miro (software)|Miro]], [[TiVo]], and [[Zune]]. The shows are distributed in wide variety of [[Video codec|formats]], including [[QuickTime]], [[Windows Media Video]] and [[Xvid]]. An embeddable [[Adobe Flash|Flash player]] is also available. Revision3 utilizes BitGravity's [[content delivery network]] for the distribution of the shows video files.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;

In September 2011, Revision3 programming began to air on [[cable television]] on the rebranded YouToo TV, the former [[American Life Network]].

# {{note|indie-xlr8rtv}} Produced by &quot;the editorial team of [[XLR8R|XLR8R magazine]]&quot;

==History==
The company was founded in [[Los Angeles, California]] by [[Jay Adelson]], [[Kevin Rose]] and [[David Prager]] in April 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revision3.com/about |title=About Revision3 |accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Huard]], [[Keith Harrison]], and [[Ron Gorodetzky]] were also involved. Most of them were previously employees of the [[television]] network [[TechTV]].

It began in July 2003 with a Podcast series called ''[[thebroken]]'', a videozine related to computer hacking featuring Rose and Huard. After TechTV merged with [[G4 (television)|G4]] and removed most of its technology related programming, Rose and Huard were inspired to create a new series, ''[[Systm]]'', in May 2005, which is geared toward âthe common [[geek]]â. Rose left his job as a host of the G4 series ''[[Attack of the Show]]'' (formerly ''[[The Screen Savers]]'') on May 27, 2005, to work full time for Revision3 Corporation. The now popular show ''[[Diggnation]]'', also starring Rose, followed in July 2005, forming the first three shows of the new network.

[[Alex Albrecht]] joined Revision3 on August 5, 2005 to co-host ''Diggnation'' with Rose and contribute to other projects while Prager focused on production and business development.

Rose announced on the September 16, 2006 episode of ''Diggnation'' that Keith Harrison had left Revision3 to &quot;do his own stuff&quot;.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

On September 27, 2006, Revision3 launched a new website alongside new shows: ''[[Revision3 Shows#Mysteries of Science Explained|Mysteries of Science Explained]]'', ''[[Revision3 Shows#Not Mainstream Typical Videos|Not Mainstream Typical Videos]]'', ''[[Revision3 Shows#PixelPerfect|PixelPerfect]]'', and ''[[Web Drifter]]''. ''Mysteries of Science Explained'' was cancelled after 2 episodes.

In November 2006, the ''Diggnation'' podcast accepted sponsorship from the [[Microsoft]] [[Zune]] and [[HD DVD]], and the March 8, 2007, episode was sponsored by [[IBM]].

It was announced on July 10, 2007, that [[Jim Louderback]] would become the new [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the Revision3 Corporation.  He previously worked as editor-in-chief for [[PC Magazine]], a publication of [[Ziff Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newteevee.com/2007/07/10/old-media-jumping-to-new-media/ |title=Old Media Jumping to New Media |accessdate=2008-01-05 |author=Liz Gannes |date=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was followed by [[Patrick Norton]] in August, 2007, who worked at Ziff Davis as 'head of podcasts' and host of the [[IPTV]] show ''[[DL.TV]]''.  At Revision3, he is now Managing Editor and the co-host of ''[[Systm]]'', ''[[Tekzilla]]'', and ''[[HD Nation]]''.  At ''DL.TV'', he was replaced by [[Roger Chang]] who in turn left DL.TV and Ziff Davis in December, 2007 to join Revision3.  Chang has joined Norton as co-producer of ''Systm'' and ''Tekzilla''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twit.tv/126 Roger Explains going to Revision3]&lt;/ref&gt;  All three had previously worked at [[TechTV]].

On January 2, 2008, Revision3 announced that the network delivered more than 25 million shows and over 103 million clips in 2007.  Also, a variety of leading consumer product companies signed advertising contracts with Revision3 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Internet TV Leader Revision3 Announces Record Year | publisher = BusinessWire |date=2008-01-02 | url = http://broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=267555 | accessdate = 2008-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revision3 launched new website design on January 18, 2008 featuring an updated layout and additional features that were not available on the previous website.

Revision3 is now located in a new studio, which was revealed in the behind the scenes video podcast, ''[[The Revision3 Gazette]]''.  The network released five new shows in the first quarter of 2008, ''[[Revision3 Shows#Best Of...|Best Of...]]'', ''[[Revision3 Shows#The Digg Reel|The Digg Reel]]'', ''[[Internet Superstar]]'', ''[[Revision3 Shows#popSiren|popSiren]]'', ''[[Revision3 Shows#Scam School|Scam School]]'', and so far two new shows in the second quarter, [[Social Brew]] and [[EPIC FU]].

On April 9, 2008, Revision3 announced that [[Veronica Belmont]] would be joining the Revision3 staff as co-host of ''Tekzilla''.

On April 21, 2008 on the 47th episode of ''Systm'', it was announced that Chief Engineer and co-host [[David Randolph]] had left for another job outside of Revision3.

On June 6, 2008 CEO [[Jim Louderback]] announced the cancellation of ''Social Brew'' after only four episodes. Previous to the announcement Revision3 employee Neha Tiwari was let go without notice.

On September 8, 2008, [[Hak5]] started being distributed on Revision3 show, being the first ever program on Revision3 not produced by Revision3 themselves.

On October 27, 2008 CEO [[Jim Louderback]] announced on the official Revision3 blog that three shows were canceled, ''[[PixelPerfect]]'', ''[[PopSiren]]'', and ''[[Internet Superstar]]'' and that Revision3 stopped their distribution agreement with ''[[EPIC FU]]'', and ''[[Wine Library TV]]''.

In January 2009 Revision3 debuted the pilot episode of a new show on the network entitled ''[[Sun Studios]]'' at the end of viewer surveys for the other shows.

On 9 March 2009, Revision3 picked up a show called ''[[CO-OP (video podcast)|CO-OP]]''. A show about [[video game]]s, produced and presented by Area 5 Media formerly from [[The 1UP Show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DiggReel-coop&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=CO-OP promotion video |url=http://revision3.com/diggreel/greentie/ |series=The Digg Reel |serieslink=The Digg Reel |credits= |network=Revision3 |airdate=2009-03-09 |number=61 |minutes=6:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2009, Revision3 launched a new show called ''[[JV's World]]'' to a great deal of controversy and viewer backlash after offensive and unprofessional comments{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} were made by the host, in response to negative community response to the debut episode.

On 11 May 2009, Revision3 launched a new show called ''[[ROFL]]'' which showcases stand up comedy from all over the world.

On 16 June 2009, Patrick Norton announced that [[Systm]] would no longer be a weekly show, instead becoming segments within his other show, [[Tekzilla]]. He also announced that he would be launching a new show in July called [[HD Nation]], which will be a show all about [[High-definition video|HD]] and [[Home Theatre]]. It will be co-hosted by [[Robert Heron (presenter)|Robert Heron]] who was a co-host on DL.TV, with Patrick Norton, and then remained host for 23 months after Norton left.

On 29 June 2009, former studio engineer David Randolph wrote on his personal blog about how he had been mistreated during the construction of the Revision3 [[studio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;davidrandolphblog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigorangecouch.com/?p=33 |title=OK I got that off my chest. |accessdate=2009-07-04 |last=Randolph |first=David |date=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post has since been removed from his website.

On 18 September 2009, Jim Louderback announced an additional 5 shows will be launched by November taking to total from 17 to 22,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR7Werg1PBQ&lt;/ref&gt; this was followed up on 23 September 2009 of a new video game show [[Bytejacker]] and its first scripted show (and sitcom) [[Web Zeroes]]. The other 3 shows in its new fall line up will be announced 'later this fall',&lt;ref&gt;http://revision3.com/blog/2009/09/23/the-first-new-fall-shows-bytejacker-web-zeroes/&lt;/ref&gt; with the cancellation of JVs World it is yet to be seen if it actually means 4 new shows will be released this fall, or if the figure of 22 shows was given before the decision was taken to cancel JVs World.

On 31 March 2010, Revision3 picked up a show called ''[[The Game Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://revision3.com/blog/2010/03/31/the-game-show-on-revision3-score/&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by Jim Festante, [[Nikole Zivalich]], and David &quot;Gweedz&quot; Guida, they track the happenings of the video game industry, serving up equal doses of entertainment and expert commentary (in between serving drinks). This was later dropped after it's parent company, TheStream.tv, went on a temporary hiatus.

On 28 June 2010, a new show [[GeekBeat.TV]] was begun featuring as host [[Cali Lewis]] formerly of [[GeekBrief.TV]]. The show covers new technology, gadgets, gizmos, and web sites.

On 2 August 2010, a new show called &quot;Dan 3.0&quot; began airing, which stars the YouTube star [[Dan Brown (YouTube)|Dan Brown]], doing tasks that his audience suggests. On 8 April 2011, after deciding to quit doing Dan 3.0, Dan changed the format of the show, keeping some elements of &quot;Dan 3.0,&quot; but also adding other elements from his older videos. After abandoning that idea, Dan started posting irregular vlogs before starting a new show called 'Delicious Steak' on 12 July 2011, which features vlogs and games he plays with his viewers.

On 26 April 2011, Revision3 added [[Epic Meal Time]] to their lineup on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;http://revision3.com/blog/2011/04/26/epicmealtime/&lt;/ref&gt; The show teaches how to prepare cuisine with an experimental food palette and alternative recipes. They garner millions of hits an episode and are now generally regarded as the most popular Revision3 show.

On May 17, 2011, Revision3 added SoldierKnowsBest, a well-known YouTube channel&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/soldierknowsbest&lt;/ref&gt; featuring Mark Watson's reviews of gadgets. Revision3 followed this up with adding TechnoBuffalo on June 13, 2011, another well-known YouTube channel&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/jon4lakers&lt;/ref&gt; which features the employees of tech blog TechnoBuffalo responding to viewer questions, reviewing mobile apps and talking about the latest tech rumours.

===MediaDefender Controversy===
In May 2008, Revision3's [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] [[Server (computing)|server]] was on the receiving end of a [[MediaDefender]] Denial of Service attack which brought down all of Revision3's servers and their email system.

===Revision3 Beta===
In September 2008, Revision3 started Revision3 Beta,&lt;ref&gt;http://revision3beta.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a &quot;talent-farming&quot; sub-network of unofficial shows headed by Martin Sargent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revision3 Beta announced&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newteevee.com/2008/09/27/martin-sargent-on-revision3s-new-beta-farm-team/ | title=Revision3 Beta announced | accessdate=2009-07-19 | author= | date= | work=Revision3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been axed due to lack of funds for the shows with no shows being promoted at this time to the full Revision3 lineup.&lt;ref&gt;http://revision3.com/forum/showpost.php?p=524756&amp;postcount=15&lt;/ref&gt; Some shows are still produced independently and are added to the revision3 beta website on occasion, however no new shows are being made.
