{{2000 SEC football standings}}
The '''2000 [[South Carolina Gamecocks]] football team''' represented the [[University of South Carolina]] in the [[Southeastern Conference]].  The Gamecocks were led by [[Lou Holtz]] in his second season as USC head coach and played their home games in [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in Columbia, SC.

Carolina played their way to one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history by going from a winless season in 1999, to an 8-win campaign in 2000, their first win vs. New Mexico State coming two years to the day since their last win, vs Ball State on September 2, 1998. The turnaround in conference was also one of the biggest in SEC history, going from 0-8 in 1999, to 5-3 in 2000 including a victory against a heavily favored Georgia team that ended the Gamecocks SEC losing streak. USC fans tore down the goalposts at Williams-Brice Stadium on both occasions in celebration. On New Year's Day 2001, the Gamecocks defeated [[2000 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in the [[2001 Outback Bowl|Outback Bowl]] in Tampa, Florida, and finished the season ranked #19 in the AP poll and #21 in the Coaches' Poll.
