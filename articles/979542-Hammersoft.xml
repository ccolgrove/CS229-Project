==History==
FenerbahÃ§e S.K. was founded in 1907 in [[KadÄ±kÃ¶y]], [[Istanbul]] as a football club by local men [[Ziya SongÃ¼len]] (then Nurizade Ziya [[Bey]]), [[Ayetullah Bey|Ayetullah]] [[Bey]] and Enver Necip Okaner (then Enver Necip [[Bey]]). This group of individuals founded the club secretly in order to keep a low profile and not get into any trouble with the strict [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. At that time the Sultan, [[Abdul Hamid II]], forbade the Turkish youth from setting up a club nor engaging in the game of football. SongÃ¼len was elected the first president of the club, Ayetullah Bey became the first General Secretary, and Okaner was given the post of the General Captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/kurumsaldetay.asp?ContentID=6 | title=TarihÃ§e | work=Fenerbahce.org | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lighthouse]] situated on the FenerbahÃ§e cape was a big influence on the design of the club's first emblem, which sported the yellow and white colors of [[daffodil]]s around the lighthouse. The kits were also designed with yellow and white stripes.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY&quot; /&gt; The emblem and colors of the club were changed in 1910 when [[Topuz Hikmet]] redesigned the badge and Ziya Bey changed the colors to yellow and navy, still seen today. FenerbahÃ§e's activities were kept in secrecy until a legislation reform in 1908, when, under a new law, all football clubs had to register to exist legally.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY&quot; /&gt; FenerbahÃ§e joined the Istanbul League in 1909, finishing fifth in their first year. The founding line-up included [[Ziya SongÃ¼len]], [[Ayetullah Bey|Ayetullah]] [[Bey]], Necip Okaner, Galip KulaksÄ±zoÄlu, Hasan Sami Kocamemi, Asaf BeÅpÄ±nar, Enver Yetiker, Åevkati Hulusi [[Bey]], Fuat HÃ¼snÃ¼ Kayacan, Hamit HÃ¼snÃ¼ Kayacan, and Nasuhi Baydar.&lt;ref name=HIST7&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/kurumsaldetay.asp?ContentID=7 | title=TarihÃ§e â 4.

[[File:Ziya songulen.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Ziya SongÃ¼len.]]
The [[Turkish Football Federation]] founded a national league in 1959. FenerbahÃ§e won the [[Turkish National League 1959|first tournament]], beating [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray S.K.]] 4â1 on aggregate.&lt;ref name=CHAMP1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/5859/tl.html |title=1959 Milli Lig |work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe |accessdate=2007-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, FenerbahÃ§e participated in the [[European Cup 1959â60|European Cup]] for the first time. They qualified through a 4â3 win over [[Csepel SC]]. They lost their first round game to [[OGC Nice]] 1â5 in a playoff game after drawing on aggregate.&lt;ref name=EURO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec195960.html | title=European Competitions 1959â60 | work=James M. Ross and [[RSSSF]] | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; FenerbahÃ§e became the most successful Turkish club of the 1960s. They were also runners-up three times.&lt;ref name=ARCHIVES&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/artl.html | title=Archives | last=Sivritepe | first=ErdinÃ§ | work=Turkish-soccer.com | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TSL&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tff.org/default.aspx?pageID=379 | title=TURKCELL SÃPER LIG SAMPIYONLUKLARI | work=TFF.org | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Balkans Cup 1966â67]] (a competition set up for Eastern European clubs from [[Albania]], Bulgaria, [[Greece]], Romania, [[Turkey]], and [[Yugoslavia]] that existed between the 1960â61 and 1993â94 seasons), FenerbahÃ§e won the cup after three matches against [[Greece|Greek]] club [[AEK Athens FC]], making them the first Turkish club to win a non-domestic competition. This success would remain unparalleled by a Turkish club until [[SarÄ±yer G.K.]] and [[Samsunspor]] won the cup many years later in the 1990s.

The 1970s saw Galatasaray win four more league titles. The decade also saw the first non-Istanbul club and a club outside of FenerbahÃ§e, [[Besiktas J.K.]], and [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray S.K.]] to win a league title. [[Trabzonspor]] went on to win four titles during the decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSL&quot; /&gt; FenerbahÃ§e won three titles in the 1980s, titles Galatasaray S.K. and Besiktas J.K. dominated the Turkish League during the 1990s, combining to win nine out of 10 ti FenerbahÃ§e's only Turkish League success during the 1990s came in the 1995â1996 season under [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ARCHIVES&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSL&quot; /&gt;
FenerbahÃ§e won the league in 2001, denying Galatasaray a fifth consecutive title. They followed up the next season with a runners-up place behind Galatasaray with new coach [[Werner Lorant]]. The [[SÃ¼per Lig 2002â03|next season]], however, did not go so well as FenerbahÃ§e finished in sixth place with [[Ariel Ortega]] in the squad.&lt;ref name=LIG1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/0203/1.html | title=2002â2003 1.SÃ¼per Lig | work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, that season is memorable to many FenerbahÃ§e fans due to a 6â0 win against arch-rivals Galatasaray in [[ÅÃ¼krÃ¼ SaracoÄlu Stadium]] on 6 November 2002.&lt;ref name=6-0&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahcecumhuriyeti.org/Film_Afisleri_6-0.asp | title=6 November Victory | work=fenerbahcecumhuriyeti.org | accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After firing Werner Lorant, they hired another German coach, [[Christoph Daum]]. Daum had previously coached in Turkey, winning the league with Besiktas J.K. in 1994â95. FenerbahÃ§e brought in players including [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]], [[Mehmet AurÃ©lio]], and [[Fabio Luciano]] as a rebuilding process. These new players lead FenerbahÃ§e to their fifteenth title and third star (one being awarded for every 5 league titles won by a club).&lt;ref name=LIG2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/0304/1.html | title=2003â2004 1.SÃ¼per Lig | work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SÃ¼per Lig 2004â05|next year]] was followed up by a narrow championship over Trabzonspor, winning the then record of sixteen Turkish First Football League championships.&lt;ref name=LIG3&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/0405/1.html | title=2004â2005 1.SÃ¼per Lig | work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; FenerbahÃ§e lost the title in the last week of the [[SÃ¼per Lig 2005â06|2005â06]] season to [[Galatasaray S.K.

On 11 January 2007, Fenerbahce S.K. was officially invited to [[G-14]].&lt;ref name=G14&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/eng/detay.asp?ContentID=652 | title=FenerbahÃ§e invited to G-14 | work=Fenerbahce.org | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; G-14 is an association which consists of top clubs worldwide.

So far, [[Zico]] is also the most successful manager of the team's history in the [[UEFA#Competitions|European arena]].
After successful scores both in local league of Turkey and international matches, [[Zico]] gained a new nickname from FenerbahÃ§e fans: ''Kral Arthur'' (meaning &quot;King Arthur&quot; in Turkish). Since 2000, FenerbahÃ§e S.K. improved the club's finances and facilities, bringing world stars to the club such as [[Haim Revivo]], [[Ariel Ortega]], [[Serhiy Rebrov]], [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]], [[Alex de Souza]], [[Stephen Appiah]], [[Nicolas Anelka]] and lately [[Mateja KeÅ¾man]], [[Roberto Carlos (footballer)|Roberto Carlos]], and [[Daniel GonzÃ¡lez GÃ¼iza|Dani GÃ¼iza]].

FenerbahÃ§e's [[2009â10 SÃ¼per Lig|2009â10]] season ended in shock as they lost the title on the last day. The FenerbahÃ§e players were told a draw would be enough towards the end of the match only to find out that other games went against their favour as [[Bursaspor]] beat [[BeÅiktaÅ J.K.|BeÅiktaÅ]] 2â1 to get the title. Despite the title loss, FenerbahÃ§e ended the season with the highest number of clean sheets (10), as well as the joint longest winning streak (8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/225/Tournaments/17/Seasons/1919|title=Turkish SÃ¼per Lig 2010 Streaks|publisher=WhoScored.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FenerbahÃ§e won a 18th  [[SÃ¼per Lig]] title in the [[2010â11 SÃ¼per Lig|2010â11]] season. The team were nine points behind the leaders after 16 games, but went on an unbeaten run of 17 wins and one draw from the last 18 games of the season and won the title with 82 points. [[Trabzonspor]] also finished on 82 points but finished second due head-to-head goal average in favor of FenerbahÃ§e.

&quot;The big three&quot; clubs of [[Istanbul]], [[BeÅiktaÅ J.K.]], FenerbahÃ§e S.K.  and [[Galatasaray S.K.]] have a century-long history of rivalry. FenerbahÃ§e-Galatasaray rivalry is the primary Istanbul derby and the most important rivalry in Turkish football.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The rivalry has led to violence among supporters on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Turkey to send anti-terror police to Leeds to protect Galatasaray | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/04/17/galatasaray_leeds000417.html| publisher=CBC| date = 11 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other top level Ä°stanbul derbies include the teams; [[Ä°stanbul BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅehir Belediyespor (football team)|Ä°stanbul BB]] and [[KasÄ±mpaÅa S.K.|KasÄ±mpaÅa]] although these teams pose a minor rivalry as the history and the nation-wide attention to the derbies among the big three is unmatched.

==Club crest and colours==
Since the club's foundation, FenerbahÃ§e has used the same badge, which has only undergone minor alterations.

It was designed by [[Hikmet Topuzer]], nicknamed Topuz Hikmet, who played as left winger, in 1910 and had made as [[Lapel pin|lapel pins]] by Tevfik Haccar TaÅÃ§Ä± (then Tevfik Haccar) in [[London]]. The emblem consists of five colours. The white section which includes the writing ''FenerbahÃ§e Spor KulÃ¼bÃ¼ â 1907 â'' represents purity and open heartedness, the red section represents love and attachment to the club and symbolises the [[Flag of Turkey|Turkish flag]]. The yellow section symbolises other ones' envy and jealousy about FenerbahÃ§e, while the navy symbolises nobility. The [[oak]] leaf which rises from the navy and yellow section shows the force and the power of being a member of FenerbahÃ§e. The green colour of the leaf shows the success of FenerbahÃ§e is imperative.&lt;ref name=EMBLEM&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/eng/kurumsaldetay.asp?ContentID=16 | title=Emblem | work=Fenerbahce.org | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hikmet Topuzer]] describes the story of the emblem as below:

{{cquote|After the change of the clubâs colours from yellow and white to yellow and navy, it was an issue to create an emblem with our new colours. My friends left the design of this emblem to me. Firstly, I brought together the colours of our national flag, red and white. Then drew a heart shape over the red and gave it a yellow and navy colour, adding an acorn leaf that represents resistance, power and strength. I wrote the club name and foundation date on the white section. When drawing our emblem, I tried to give this meaning: Serving the club with dependence from heart. The design was favored by my friends and our new emblem was made through the guidance of Tevfik Haccar, who was in Germany at time. After the [[Turkish alphabet|new alphabet]] was approved, the design was protected, but the club name on the emblem was changed to FenerbahÃ§e Spor KulÃ¼bÃ¼ â 1907 â.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMBLEM&quot; /&gt;}}
