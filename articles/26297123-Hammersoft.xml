[[USA Today]] reported that, &quot;half of the candidates to lead the Republican National Committee (RNC) are Southerners: current Chairman [[Mike Duncan]] of Kentucky, South Carolina Chairman [[Katon Dawson]] and former Tennessee chairman [[Chip Saltsman]]. Former Ohio secretary of State [[Ken Blackwell]] and former Maryland lieutenant governor Michael Steele are black. [[Saul Anuzis]], the Michigan GOP chairman, is a Harley-Davidson rider, an ex-union member and the son of an autoworker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Jill |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2009-01-04-gopchair_N.htm |title=Six-way race for GOP chairman heats up |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Barack the Magic Negro&quot; controversy===
For Christmas 2008, Chip Saltsman sent members of the Republican National Committee a music CD of songs intended to be political satire. The CD of 41 songs included one entitled &quot;[[David Ehrenstein]]'s '[[Barack the Magic Negro]]' &quot; set to the tune of &quot;[[Puff, the Magic Dragon]]&quot;. Its title was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column, written by Ehrenstein, who is partly of African-American descent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/general/a-considerable-town/david-ehrenstein-meet-david-ehrenstein/8574/ ''David Ehrenstein, Meet David Ehrenstein''], L.A. Weekly, April 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; that suggested President Barack Obama appealed to those who feel guilty about the nation's history of mistreatment of African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenstein, David, [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,3391015.story &quot;Obama the 'Magic Negro' &quot;], ''The Los Angeles Times'', March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Saltsman said the song, penned by his longtime friend [[Paul Shanklin]], a white conservative parodist songwriter, who performs it using his impersonation of Al Sharpton, &quot;should be easily recognized as satire directed at the Times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sinderbrand, Rebecca,
[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/12/26/rnc.obama.satire/index.html &quot;RNC chairman candidate defends 'Barack the Magic Negro' song&quot;], CNN, December 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opposing candidates, including incumbent RNC Chairman [[Mike Duncan]], criticized Saltsman; others, such as former Ohio Secretary of State [[Ken Blackwell]], defended Saltsman against the &quot;hypersensitivity in the press regarding matters of race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ben, [http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1208/Blackell_defends_Saltsman.html &quot;Blackwell defends Saltsman&quot;], ''Politico'', December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltsman responded by saying, &quot;Liberal Democrats and their allies in the media didn't utter a word about David Ehrenstein's irresponsible column in the ''Los Angeles Times'' last March. But now, of course, they're shocked and appalled by its parody on the Rush Limbaugh Show.  I firmly believe that we must welcome all Americans into our party and that the road to Republican resurgence begins with unity, not division. But I know that our party leaders should stand up against the media's double standards and refuse to pander to their desire for scandal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Saltsman, Chip, [http://www.chipsaltsman.com/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Blogs.View&amp;Blog_id=cc9ca87e-21b2-4120-ba35-f4427f284f22 &quot;The Media's Double Standards&quot;], ''ChipSaltsman.com'', December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservatives not currently seeking the RNC chairmanship, such as Former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and North Carolina [[Republican National Committee]]woman [[Ada Fisher]], have also criticized with regards to the issue. Gingrich stated in an e-mail message: &quot;There are no grounds for demeaning him (Obama) or for using racist descriptions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeParle, Jason, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/us/politics/28rnc.html &quot;G.O.P. Receives Obama Parody to Mixed Reviews&quot;], ''The New York Times'', December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The election was decided in late January after six rounds of voting, with Steele elected chairman by a majority vote of the 168 [[Republican National Committee members|committee members]].&lt;ref name=&quot;voices&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/12/rnc_race_ramps_up.html?hpid=topnews |title=RNC Field Sorts Itself Out |accessdate=2 January 2009 |last=Cillizza |first=Chris |date=December 11, 2008 |work=[[The Fix (blog)|The Fix]] |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003021842&amp;cpage=1| title = Republican Choose Michael Steele as Party Chairman| author = CQ Politics| date = January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://polipundit.com/index.php?p=20632| title = RNC Chairman Vote: Live Coverage| author = PollPundit.com| date = January 30, 3009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
