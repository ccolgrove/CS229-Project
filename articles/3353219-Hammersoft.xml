'''Catawba College''' is a private, coeducational [[liberal arts]] college in [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]], North Carolina, USA.  Founded in 1851 by the North Carolina [[wikt:classis|Classis]] of the Reformed Church in [[Newton, North Carolina|Newton]], the college adopted its name from its county of origin, [[Catawba County]], before moving to its current home of Salisbury in 1925.  

Today, Catawba College still holds loose ties with the successor to the [[Reformed Church]], the [[United Church of Christ]], and offers more than thirty undergraduate degrees.

In 2009, Catawba College was listed as 17th in the [[U.S. News and World Report]] in the category &quot;Best Baccalaureate Colleges in the South.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/2914 America's Best Colleges 2008: Baccalaureate Colleges in the South]. Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com. Retrieved on 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Catawba College has been consistently named as one of the &quot;361 Best Colleges&quot; by the [[Princeton Review]], and the school's theatre program is consistently rated as one of the top 10 in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/generalinfo.asp?listing=1022875&amp;LTID=1&amp;intBucketID=0&amp;destID= The Princeton Review Article on Catawba College]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009, ''[[In Tune Monthly]]'' named Catawba College one of the best music schools in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catawba.edu/news/archive/2008/09/09/intune2009.aspx|title=Catawba College Named One of Nation's Best Music Schools for 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Catawba College was founded by the North Carolina Classis of the [[Reformed Church in the United States]] in 1851.  The years following the opening of the college were years of growing prosperity for the school, but the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] changed this as funds and students became less available. During the war years, the College became an academy, operating as Catawba High School from 1865 until 1885, whereupon it resumed operations under its original charter as Catawba College.  After the Civil War ended, Catawba continued to make changes to itself, including becoming [[coeducational]] in 1890.  Even with the addition of women to the student body, the College struggled to overcome the depletion brought on by the war. Responding to the offer of a partially constructed dormitory-administration building and several acres of land in Salisbury, trustee, college, and church officials closed the campus in [[Newton, NC|Newton]] in 1923 and re-opened in [[Salisbury, NC|Salisbury]] in 1925.

The college is now affiliated with the [[United Church of Christ]], the successor to the [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]], itself the successor to the Reformed Church in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catawba.edu/about/history.asp|title=The History of Catawba College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shirley Peeler Richie Academy for Teaching===
As part of an ongoing emphasis on teacher education, Catawba announced the creation of the West Scholars Program in 2006.  The highly competitive program offers a substantial scholarship, up to $15,000 for North Carolina residents, in addition to &quot;leadership seminars, community, service, scholarly researched presentations&quot; and various other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catawba.edu/academic/teachereducation/academy/scholars.asp|title=Catawba's West Scholars}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the West Scholars, Catawba added the distinction of being one of only 18 institutions in North Carolina to offer a N.C. Teaching Fellows program for the 2009â2010 academic year.  Promoting education in North Carolina, the program offers a full tuition award to the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catawba.edu/news/archive/2008/04/14/fellows.aspx|title=Catawba College Selected as One of North Carolina's Campuses To Offer N.C. Teaching Fellows Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for the Environment===
The Center for the Environment was established in 1996 to educate students, faculty, staff and the public about environmental stewardship and sustainability. A catalyst for advancing sustainable solutions, it has assumed a leadership role in the region, serving as a model and lending its expertise on issues ranging from air and water quality to land preservation and sustainable development.  Since its inception, it has provided opportunities for students to work with community members in addressing issues of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerfortheenvironment.org www.centerfortheenvironment.org]. www.centerfortheenvironment.org. Retrieved on 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sustainable building that houses the Center, which opened in 2001, was hailed by the top state environmental official as âthe wave of the future in resource and energy efficiency.â Everything about the building â from site design to the environmentally friendly building materials and green furnishings, from energy and water conservation issues to recycling and waste management â is grounded in principles of sustainability. It is a three-dimensional incarnation of the Centerâs curriculum â an excellent teaching tool as well as an environmentally sound project. Adjacent to the Center is the collegeâs 187-acre ecological preserve which, along with its 300-acre wildlife refuge, gives Catawba students ample opportunities for analyzing ecosystems and learning about conservation management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerfortheenvironment.org/index.php/catawba-college-ecological-preserve.html|title=Catawba Wildlife Refuge / Ecological Preserve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Catawba's athletic teams compete in the [[NCAA Division II]] [[South Atlantic Conference]] as the Catawba College Indians; named after the Catawba Indian tribe that was native to the original location of the school.  

Catawba features 18 [[NCAA Division II]] sports teams.  The men's teams are Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Football, Golf, Lacrosse, Soccer, Tennis, and Swimming.  The women's teams are Basketball, Cross Country, Golf, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, and Volleyball.

The Catawba College football team holds the distinction of winning not only the inaugural, but 2nd annual Tangerine Bowl, now known as the [[Capital One Bowl]], without allowing the opposing teams to score a single point.  On Jan. 1, 1947, they defeated [[Maryville College]] 31â0 and on Jan. 1, 1948 they defeated [[Marshall University]] 7â0.

===Indians nickname===
In 2005, the NCAA cited Catawba College as a school with a  &quot;hostile&quot; and/or &quot;abusive&quot; nickname.  While the NCAA cannot force a school to change a nickname, it promised to deny post-season hosting privileges to schools in violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/05/sportsline/main762542.shtml|title=NCAA Takes Aim At Indian Mascots | work=CBS News | date=5 August 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the designation, Catawba College officials filled a formal appeal to continue use of the Catawba Indian mascot.  Citing the approval of the remaining members of the Catawba Indian tribe, the NCAA granted the appeal on the condition the college use the tribe specific nickname of the Catawba Indians when referring to the nickname as opposed to simply the &quot;Indians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2463164|title=NCAA says Catawba College can use Indians nickname}}&lt;/ref&gt;
