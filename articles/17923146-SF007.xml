A '''virtual drive''' in [[computing]] is a device that to the [[operating system]] appears to be an ordinary physical [[disk drive]], with disc images substituted for disc reading hardware through the use of software called a '''disk emulator'''. It may also be termed an electronic disk, [[RAM disk]], emulated disk, e-disk, pseudo-drive, super drive, hyperdrive or memory disk.

== Features ==
A virtual drive may emulate any type of physical drive, such as a [[hard drive]], [[tape drive]], [[USB flash drive|key drive]], [[floppy drive]], [[Compact disc|CD]]/[[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray Disc|BD]]/[[HD DVD]] or a [[network share]] among others. An emulated drive is typically created either in [[Random access memory|RAM]] for fast read/write access (known as a [[RAM disk]]), or on a hard drive. Typical uses of virtual drives include the mounting of [[disk image]]s of CDs and DVDs, and the mounting of virtual hard disks for the purpose of [[OTFE|on the fly disk encryption]] (&quot;OTFE&quot;).

Some operating systems such as [[Linux]]&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxhelp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.linuxhelp.net/linux_downloads/ |title= Linux ISO Images |publisher= LinuxHelp.net |accessdate= 2007-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mac OS X]]&lt;ref name=&quot;osx-dim&quot;&gt;Although OS X's built-in DiskImageMounter software does not emulate a physical drive&lt;/ref&gt; have virtual drive functionality built-in (see [[loop device]]), while others such as [[Microsoft Windows]] require additional software.

Virtual drives are typically read-only, being used to mount existing disk images which are not modifiable by the drive. However some software provides virtual CD/DVD drives which can produce new disk images; this type of virtual drive goes by a variety of names, including &quot;virtual burner&quot;.

===Backup===
Disk images may be created to avoid wear-and-tear on a physical disk, such as a CD or DVD, with the disk image mounted in a virtual drive when needed. Similarly, disk images can provide a backup copy of physical disks, in case the original is damaged, lost or stolen.

===Enhancement===
Using disk images in a virtual drive allows users to shift data between technologies, for example from CD optical drive to hard disk drive. This may provide advantages such as speed and noise (hard disk drives are typically four or five times faster than optical drives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/cd/perfAccess-c.html pcguide.com - Access Time]&lt;/ref&gt; and also quieter). In addition it may reduce power consumption, since it may allow just one device (a hard disk) to be used instead of two (hard disk plus optical drive).

Some [[audiophile]]s argue that music played from a hard drive is superior to the same music played directly from CD,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avguide.com/blog/do-hard-disk-drives-sound-better-cd AVguide - Blog - Do Hard-Disk Drives Sound Better than CD?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.6moons.com/industryfeatures/harddrive/harddrive.html 6moons.com - industry features: An Evolving Scenario - Audiophiles embrace Hard&amp;nbsp;Drives]&lt;/ref&gt; due for example to lower data error rates.

Virtual drives may also be used as part of emulation of an entire machine (a [[virtual machine]]).

===Software distribution===
After the spread of broadband, CD and DVD images became a common medium for [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxhelp&quot;/&gt; Applications for [[Mac OS X]] are often delivered online as an [[Apple Disk Image]] containing a file system that includes the application, documentation for the application, and so on.  Online data and bootable recovery CD images are provided for customers of certain commercial software companies.

Disk images may also be used to distribute software across a company network, or for portability (many CD/DVD images can be stored on a hard disk drive). Disk images may also be needed to transfer software to machines without a compatible physical disk drive.

=== Security ===
Virtual hard disks are most commonly used in [[OTFE|on the fly disk encryption]] (&quot;OTFE&quot;) software such as [[FreeOTFE]] and [[TrueCrypt]], where an encrypted &quot;image&quot; of a disk is stored on the PC. When you enter the disk's password, the disk image is &quot;mounted&quot;, and made available as a new drive letter on your PC. Files written to this virtual drive are written to the encrypted image, and never stored in [[cleartext]].

The process of making such an encrypted disk available for use is called &quot;mounting&quot;, the process of removing it is called &quot;dismounting&quot; or &quot;unmounting&quot;.

== Virtual burner ==
A '''virtual disk writer''' or '''virtual burner''' is a computer program that emulates an actual disc authoring device such as a CD writer or DVD writer. Instead of writing data to an actual disc, it creates a [[virtual disk image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phantom Burner Overview|url=http://www.phantombility.com/en/prod/phantomburner/|publisher=Phantombility, Inc|accessdate=19 July 2011|quote=Many people understand the benefits of using disc image files (like ISO) instead of real optical discs. It is cheaper, faster, and you don't need to worry about scratches or the storage of discs. However, not all burning software supports disc image file creation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual CD - The original for your PC|url=http://www.virtualcd.de/vcd/apps/overview/original.cfm?lg=0|work=Virtual CD website|publisher=H+H Software GmbH|accessdate=19 July 2011 |quote=A VCD virtual burner can be used with any Windows application just like a physical CD/DVD/BluRay burner. You can put together your choice of CD content, even video DVD material, and burn it on a virtual CD. This is a great way to test the results without wasting a physical blank.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A virtual burner, by definition, appears as a disc drive in the system with writing capabilities (as opposed to conventional disc authoring programs that can create virtual disk images), thus allowing software that can burn discs to create virtual discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual CD/DVD-Writer Device|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualmedia/|work=[[SourceForge]]|publisher=Geeknet, Inc.|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
