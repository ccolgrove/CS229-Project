{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==History==
===Early years===
Jet Airways was incorporated as an air taxi operator on 1 April 1992. It started commercial operations on 5 May 1993 with a fleet of four leased [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. In January 1994 a change in the law enabled Jet Airways to apply for scheduled airline status, which was granted on 4 January 1995. It began international operations from [[Chennai]] to [[Colombo]] in March 2004. The company is listed on the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]], but 80% of its stock is controlled by Naresh Goyal (through his ownership of Jetâs parent company, Tailwinds). It has 10,017 employees (as at March 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetairways.com/Cultures/en-US/India/Investor+Relations/Overview/ Jet Airways India | Know investment options, shareholding structure, listings &amp; stock codes]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naresh Goyal]] â who already owned Jetair (Private) Limited, which provided sales and marketing for foreign airlines in India â set up Jet Airways as a full-service scheduled airline to compete against state-owned [[Indian Airlines]]. Indian Airlines had enjoyed a monopoly in the domestic market between 1953, when all major Indian air transport providers were nationalised under the Air Corporations Act (1953), and January 1994, when the Air Corporations Act was repealed, following which Jet Airways received scheduled airline status.

===Air Sahara buyout===
In January 2006 Jet Airways announced that it would buy [[Air Sahara]] for [[US$]]500 million in an all-cash deal, making it the biggest takeover in Indian aviation history. It would have resulted in the country's largest airline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4626810.stm | title = Indian airline Jet Airways is to buy rival carrier Air Sahara in a deal worth $500 m (Â£284 m). |date=2006-01-19 | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the deal fell through in June 2006.

On 12 April 2007 Jet Airways agreed to buy out Air Sahara for INR14.5 billion (US$340 million). Air Sahara was renamed JetLite, and was marketed between a low-cost carrier and a full service airline. In August 2008 Jet Airways announced its plans to completely integrate JetLite into Jet Airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=25 Aug, 2008, 02.08AM IST, Mithun Roy,ET Bureau |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News_by_Industry/JetLite_may_merge_with_Jet_Airways/articleshow/3400790.cms |title=JetLite may merge with Jet Airways this year |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
In October 2008 Jet Airways laid off 1,900 of its employees, resulting in the largest lay-off in the history of Indian aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manju V, TNN, Oct 15, 2008, 09.00am IST |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Jet_Airways_lays_off_850_flight_attendants/articleshow/3596360.cms |title=Jet Air lays off 850 flight attendants |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the employees were later asked to return to work; Civil Aviation Minister [[Praful Patel]] said that the management reviewed its decision after he analysed the decision with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 Oct, 2008, 11.36AM IST,TNN |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Praful_takes_credit_for_reversal_of_Jet_layoffs/articleshow/3607311.cms |title=Praful takes credit for reversal of Jet layoffs |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?tp=on&amp;autono=48132 |title=Business-standard Jet Airways article |publisher=Business-standard.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 Jet Airways and rival [[Kingfisher Airlines]] announced an alliance which primarily includes an agreement on code-sharing on both domestic and international flights, joint fuel management to reduce expenses, common ground handling, joint utilisation of crew and sharing of similar frequent flier programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetairways.com/Cultures/en-US/Kuwait/About+Us/Press+Room/Press+Releases/9W_IT.htm Jet and Kingfisher form Alliance]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2009 Jet Airways launched its low-cost brand, Jet Konnect. The decision to launch a new brand instead of expanding the JetLite network was taken after considering the regulatory delays involved in transferring aircraft from Jet Airways to JetLite, as the two have different operator codes. The brand was launched on sectors that had 50% or less load factor with the aim of increasing it to 70% and above. Jet officials said that the brand would cease to exist once the demand for the regular Jet Airways increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2009/05/08/stories/2009050851921500.htm|title=Jet Airwaysâ low-fare service Konnect takes off today|publisher=The Hindu Business Line|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a PTI report, for the third quarter of 2010, Jet Airways (Jet+JetLite) had a market share of 26.9%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PTI, Oct 19, 2010 |url=http://business.rediff.com/report/2010/oct/19/lean-period-air-traffic-same-domestic-traffic-up.htm |title=Lean period air traffic same, domestic traffic up |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of passengers carried, thus making it a market leader in India, followed by [[Kingfisher Airlines]] with 19.9% .

====Effects of recession====
The recession forced Jet Airways to discontinue the following routes: [[Ahmedabad]]â[[London]], [[Amritsar]]â[[London]], [[Bangalore]]â[[Brussels]] and [[Mumbai]]â[[Shanghai]]â[[San Francisco]]. It also had to put an indefinite delay on its expansion plans. Jet Airways was forced to lease out seven of its ten [[Boeing 777#777-300ER|Boeing 777-300ER]]s to survive the financial crunch. Due to the recession all flights to [[North America]] were operated on an [[Airbus A330#A330-200|Airbus A330-200]] replacing the [[Boeing 777#777-300ER|Boeing 777-300ER]]s. It also had to sell a brand-new, yet-to-be-delivered Boeing 777-300ER in 2009 and had to defer all new aircraft deliveries by at least two years. The airline plans to restore the [[Mumbai]]-[[Shanghai]] route by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-14/jet-air-to-resume-india-china-service-amid-very-good-growth-.html Jet Air Will Resume India-China Service Amid Good Growth, Mahadevan Says - Bloomberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs and identity==
===Head office===
Jet Airways's head office is located in the Siroya Centre in [[Andheri]], [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.jetairways.com/EN/US/ContactUs/ContactUsRegisteredOffice.aspx Contact Us].&quot; Jet Airways. Retrieved on 19 September 2011. &quot;Jet Airways (India) Ltd. Siroya Centre, Sahar Airport Road, Andheri (East), Mumbai, Maharashtra 400099&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Jet Airways's head office was previously located in the S.M. Centre, a rented, unmarked six storey building in Andheri.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090604080723/http://www.jetairways.com/EN/US/ContactUs/ContactUsRegisteredOffice.aspx Registered Office].&quot; Jet Airways. Retrieved on 27 February 2010. &quot;Jet Airways (India) Ltd. S.M. Centre, Andheri-Kurla Road, Andheri (East), Mumbai 400059 India&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MeredithBeyond&quot;&gt;Meredith, Robyn. &quot;[http://www.forbes.com/global/2008/0407/016.html Beyond Airlines,Beyond India].&quot; ''[[Forbes]]''. 20 March 2008. Magazine dated 7 April 2008. Retrieved on 27 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Robyn Meredith of ''[[Forbes]]'' stated that the complex was &quot;as shabby as (Jet Airways CEO Nares) Goyal's home is posh&quot; and that the complex was &quot;In need of a fresh coat of paint&quot;. The complex was 15 minutes driving time from [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MeredithBeyond&quot;/&gt;

===Subsidiaries===
====JetLite====
''[[JetLite]]'' is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jet Airways. It was established as Sahara Airlines on 20 September 1991 and began operations on 3 December 1993 with two [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] aircraft. Initially services were primarily concentrated in the northern sectors of India, keeping Delhi as its base, and then operations were extended to cover all the country. Sahara Airlines was rebranded as Air Sahara on 2 October 2000. On 12 April 2007 Jet Airways took over Air Sahara and on 16 April 2007 Air Sahara was renamed as JetLite. JetLite operates a fleet of mixed ownedâleased [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]] aircraft and [[Bombardier CRJ-200]]ER.

====Jet Konnect====
'''Jet Konnect''' is the low-cost brand of [[India]]-based Jet Airways. It was launched on 8 May 2009, and shares the same airline designation as Jet Airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/jet-airways-launches-lowcost-service-jet-konnect/92012-7.html|title=Jet Airways launches low-cost service Jet Konnect|publisher=IBNLive.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates a mixed fleet of [[ATR 72-500]]s and [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]s.

The rationale for launching Jet Airways Konnect was to close down loss-making routes and divert the planes to more profitable routes with higher [[passenger load factor]]s. Jet already runs a low-cost airline named [[JetLite]]. According to Jet Airways, the decision to launch a low-cost brand instead of expanding the existing [[low-cost airline|JetLite]] was taken to avoid the regulatory delays associated with moving excess aircraft and assets from Jet Airways to JetLite, which have separate operating codes. Jet Konnect offers a no frills flight where meals and other refreshments have to be purchased on board. To identify if the flight is a full service or Konnect the flight numbers for Konnect are in the series 9W 2000-2999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2009/05/08/stories/2009050851921500.htm|title=Jet Airwaysâ low-fare service Konnect takes off today|publisher=The Hindu Business Line|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jet Airways plan to merge JetLite brand into Jet Konnect in the future.

Jet Airways' original livery was [[Navy Blue]], [[Light Grey]] and [[Chrome Yellow]]. The top and bottom of the aircraft were painted in light grey and had the flying sun logo in the navy blue background.
