The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[New York Giants]] season''' was the 85th season for the team in the [[National Football League]]. It was the team's final season in [[Giants Stadium]]; In 2010, the Giants moved into [[New Meadowlands Stadium]]. The Giants hoped to improve upon their 12â4 record, avenge their divisional round loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and make the playoffs for the fifth straight year. Despite starting 5â0 to begin the season, they went 3â8 in their next 11 games and finished 3rd in the [[National Football Conference East Division|NFC East]]. They were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 16. They played teams from the [[National Football Conference South Division|NFC South]] and [[American Football Conference West Division|AFC West]] as per the schedule rotation, as well as their regular games with their NFC East rivals. For head coach [[Tom Coughlin]], this was his 6th season as the coach of the Giants.

The Giants' season began on a down note, as punt returner/[[running back]] [[DJ Ware]] dislocated his elbow returning the opening kickoff. The injury bug would later notably strike first-round draft pick [[Hakeem Nicks]], who suffered a sprained foot in the fourth quarter and was carted off the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/giants/giant_youngsters_get_nicked_up_1OqsKyyZlTN5eTf7nWAVPP Giant Youngsters Get Nicked Up, [[New York Post]], accessed September 15, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wide receiver]] [[Mario Manningham]] caught the game's first touchdown in the second quarter; the 30-yard strike was worth more yardage than Manningham had totalled in the entire [[2008 New York Giants season|2008 season]]. Later in the quarter, Giants [[defensive end]] [[Osi Umenyiora]] returned a [[Jason Campbell]] fumble 37 yards for a touchdown, his first major play since returning from the knee injury that benched him for all of 2008. Just before halftime, Redskins [[Punter (American football)|punter]] [[Hunter Smith]] ran a fake [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] into the end zone to bring the halftime score to 17â7. The Giants did not score a touchdown in the second half, but two [[Lawrence Tynes]] field goals ensured that Campbell's late touchdown pass to [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]] would not spoil the Giants' final home opener at Giants Stadium.

The victory served as a sort of going-away party for the Giants, who now faced a rare three-game roadtrip for the first time since [[1994 New York Giants season|1994]].

===Week 2: at Dallas Cowboys===

In contrast to the teams' previous meeting, the grand opening of Cowboys Stadium (in front of the largest regular-season crowd in NFL history&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4490763&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines Dallas Cowboys set NFL regular-season attendance record vs. Giants, [[ESPN.com]], accessed September 21, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a fast-paced shootout. The first points in the Cowboys' new home were scored by Tynes, whose 30-yard field goal in the first quarter was his first of four on the night. The Cowboys responded by scoring their first points on the ensuing driveâa 2-yard run by running back [[Marion Barber III|Marion Barber]].

Giants rookie [[cornerback]] [[Bruce Johnson (American football)|Bruce Johnson]] scored his first career points returning a [[Tony Romo]] interception 34 yards. Cowboys [[tight end]] [[Jason Witten]] responded with a 1-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. Later, Giants [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Kenny Phillips]] caught an odd interception off Witten's foot, setting up [[quarterback]] [[Eli Manning]]'s 100th career touchdown passâa 22-yard strike to Manningham. Romo ran a [[quarterback sneak]] to open the scoring in the second half, but the Giants sent wide receiver [[Steve Smith (New York Giants)|Steve Smith]] into the end zone in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys punched in one more touchdown on a 7-yard [[Felix Jones]] run, but Tynes' 37-yard field goal as time expired was enough to postpone the Cowboys' first home win in Arlington and boost the Giants to 2â0.

The Giants lost two more notable players to injuries; [[defensive end]] [[Justin Tuck]] suffered a sprained shoulder and wide receiver [[Domenik Hixon]] sprained a knee. During the week, Phillips' season was brought to an end, as he was placed on [[injured reserve]] with patellofemoral [[arthritis]].

===Week 3: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers===

Playing in hot, humid Florida weather, the Giants scored on their first possession for the third week in a row. Jacobs' 6-yard run was also the Giants' first [[Glossary_of_American_football#R|red zone]] touchdown in eight trips this year. After that, the Giants never looked back. They held the Buccaneers to 18 total yards of offense and 0 first downs in the first half. Smith contributed with a 4-yard touchdown catch on the first play of the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, [[Sinorice Moss]]' first reception of the year was good for an 18-yard touchdown. The game ended with [[David Carr]] at quarterback for the Giants and [[Josh Johnson (American football)|Josh Johnson]] relieving Tampa Bay quarterback [[Byron Leftwich]], whom the Giants' defense held to just 22 passing yards on the day. The Giants had pitched their first shutout on the road since [[1983 New York Giants season|1983]].

The Giants were in control of the winless Chiefs from the opening kickoff, which [[Bryan Kehl]] recovered after a [[Jamaal Charles]] fumble. The Giants proceeded to score on their first possession for the fourth straight week, this time on a short pass to Smith. Smith himself went on to have a busy day, with 11 catches for 134 yards and a 25-yard touchdown in the second quarter as well. Nicks returned from his Week 1 injury and scored his first career touchdown, a 54-yard pass from Manning, in the fourth quarter. Late in the game, the Chiefs put up a brief flurry of offense; quarterback [[Matt Cassel]] threw touchdowns to tight end [[Sean Ryan (American football)|Sean Ryan]] and wide receiver [[Bobby Wade]] within a span of about five minutes. But the comeback fell short, and the Giants improved to 4â0.

Manning suffered a heel injury in the fourth quarter, and was forced to leave the game early. Initially concerned about a possible [[Achilles tendon]] injury, he was later diagnosed with [[plantar fasciitis]]; his start against the Raiders was to be a game-time decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/sports/football/06nfl.html|title=Test Shows Manning Has Inflammation in Foot |date=2009-10-05|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-06 | first=Lynn | last=Zinser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning ended up playing until late in the second quarter before handing over the reinsâand another Giants blowout leadâto Carr. The Giants extended their first-possession scoring streak to five games, sending [[Ahmad Bradshaw]] into the end zone for his first touchdown of the year. The Giants proceeded to score touchdowns on each of their next three drives as well: Bradshaw scored again on a 19-yard rush; Manningham caught a 30-yard touchdown pass to open the second quarter; and, following a red zone fumble by Oakland quarterback [[JaMarcus Russell]], Nicks added a 9-yard touchdown reception. In the third quarter, Carr himself ran 12 yards for his first rushing touchdown since leaving the [[Houston Texans]]. The Raiders were held to just 7 first downs on the day, their only touchdown coming on the heels of a [[muffed punt]] by Moss.

The win handed the Giants their first 5â0 start since their [[Super Bowl XXV|Super Bowl]]-winning year of [[1990 New York Giants season|1990]].

The Giants' first loss of the year came in this much-anticipated &quot;clash of unbeatens&quot; against a 4â0 New Orleans team. Manning's first NFL game in his hometown of New Orleans was also Saints tight end [[Jeremy Shockey]]'s first game against his former team.

The Giants' defense, which entered the game as the best in the NFL, gave up 493 total yards and 7 touchdowns to seven different Saints, including Shockey. Scoring touchdowns for the Giants were: Bradshaw, on a 10-yard run in the second quarter; Manningham, who caught a 15-yard pass later in the quarter; and Nicks, whose 37-yard reception from Carr earned him his first career 100-yard receiving game. But the Giants were unable to overcome their highest-scoring opponent since [[1999 New York Giants season|1999]].

Led by former Giant [[Kurt Warner]], the defending NFC champions took the field at Giants Stadium against a Giants team still reeling from their bad loss in New Orleans. The Giants scored first, sending Jacobs in for a 4-yard touchdown run following a [[Terrell Thomas]] interception. Later, Arizona running back [[Beanie Wells]] scored his first career touchdown on a 13-yard rush. Manning responded by throwing a 62-yard touchdown to Nicks for his longest reception of the year. In the second half, the Cardinals' [[Tim Hightower]] and [[Jason Wright]] scored touchdowns. But it was turnovers that decided this game; Manning's 3 interceptions were as many as he had thrown all season. The Giants scored only 3 points in the second half, ending the game on an interception to [[Antrel Rolle]].

The Giants notable streak of 38 consecutive starts by the same offensive line unit was ended here, as [[offensive tackle]] [[Kareem McKenzie]] missed the game with a groin injury. McKenzie returned the following week.

With the loss, The Giants fell to 5â2.

Trying to end a two-game losing streak, the Giants went in to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] for a crucial Week 8 game with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], as the divisional lead was up for grabs.

New York trailed greatly in the first quarter as Eagles fullback [[Leonard Weaver]] got a 41-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]]'s 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Brent Celek]] (with a blocked PAT). Philadelphia would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker [[David Akers]]. The Giants would get on the board as quarterback [[Eli Manning]] found tight end [[Kevin Boss]] on an 18-yard touchdown pass, but the Eagles continued their scoring as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[DeSean Jackson]] and a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jeremy Maclin]].

Philadelphia would begin the third quarter with an increase to their lead as Akers nailed a 35-yard field goal. New York tried to rally as kicker [[Lawrence Tynes]] booted a 35-yard field goal, followed by running back [[Ahmad Bradshaw]]. However, the Eagles would seal the win in the fourth quarter as running back [[LeSean McCoy]] got a 66-yard touchdown run.

With their third-straight loss, the Giants fell to 5â3.

This game was the much-hyped first-ever meeting between Manning and [[Philip Rivers]], the two quarterbacks drafted, then [[Manning-Rivers trade|traded]], during the [[2004 NFL Draft]].

The Chargers struck first, as Rivers connected with [[Vincent Jackson]] in the end zone to open the second quarter. Manning responded with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Smith that capped off a 16-play, 10:35 drive. In the third quarter, Rivers found tight end [[Kris Wilson (American football)|Kris Wilson]] in the end zone for Wilson's first touchdown since 2007. The Giants responded with a Tynes field goal and then an 8-yard touchdown to Boss. After a defensive stop by the Chargers that held the Giants to a field goal from the 4 yard line, Rivers led his team 80 yards in the final two minutes and threw Jackson the winning score with twenty-one seconds remaining on the clock. The Giants had lost despite controlling the ball for 37:47 and holding the Chargers to 34 rushing yards.

The 5â4 Giants had dropped four straight for the first time since [[2006 New York Giants season|2006]], and headed into their bye week.

The Giants had not beaten the Falcons at home in five tries since 1979, but it was a must-win game this time. The Giants were missing veteran linebacker [[Antonio Pierce]], who was nursing a bulging disc in his neck, and the Falcons' star running back [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] was also out with a [[high ankle sprain]].

The Giants took an early lead on Tynes' first-quarter field goal, but the Falcons responded with third-string running back [[Jason Snelling]]'s 7-yard touchdown run. Boss caught two touchdown passes in the second quarter, one of them from 28 yards out. In the third quarter, Snelling and Jacobs traded short touchdown runs. Giants fullback [[Madison Hedgecock]] opened the scoring in the fourth quarter by catching his first touchdown of the season, but Falcons receiver [[Eric Weems]] caught his second of the year on the ensuing drive. In a sort of dÃ©jÃ  vu moment for the Giants, another opponent's comeback took them right up until the final minute; tight end [[Tony Gonzalez (tight end)|Tony Gonzalez]] caught the tying touchdown with 35 seconds left in regulation. The Giants won the overtime coin toss, and then drove 45 yards to set up Tynes' winning field goal, ending the Giants' skid at 4 games.

Coming off their overtime win to the Falcons, the Giants flew for a Week 12 interconference game against the [[Denver Broncos]], their first [[Thanksgiving Classic|Thanksgiving game]] since 1992.

In the first quarter the Giants trailed early with kicker [[Matt Prater]] making a 26-yard field goal and then a 32-yard field goal in the second quarter. The Broncos kept on top with RB [[Knowshon Moreno]] making a 1-yard touchdown run. After that Matt Prater made a 47-yard field goal to end the half. In the third quarter the Giants replied with kicker [[Lawrence Tynes]] nailing a 39 then a 52-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter New York fell further behind with QB [[Kyle Orton]] making a 17-yard touchdown pass to WR [[Brandon Stokley]], and Prater making a 24-yard field goal.

With the loss, the Giants fell to 6â5.

The rematch of these division rivals was a must-win game for the Giants in a season where every game was quickly becoming a must-win game for the Giants. A win would keep alive the Giants' hopes of winning the NFC East.

Dallas receiver [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]] scored the game's first touchdown in the second quarter, on a 4-yard pass from Romo. Manning responded with a 21-yard shot to Nicks on the ensuing drive. On the Cowboys' next possession, Umenyiora picked up a [[Marion Barber III|Marion Barber]] fumble, which Jacobs later turned into a 1-yard touchdown run. In the third quarter, Romo found Williams in the end zone again, this time for 5 yards. But on the next play from scrimmage, Jacobs caught a 74-yard touchdown for the longest reception of his career. Another Giant set a personal record in the fourth quarter; Hixon's 79-yard punt return was the longest of his career, and it resulted in his second career return touchdown. In a late rally by the Cowboys, [[Miles Austin]] caught a 22-yard touchdown pass from Romo, but the ensuing [[onside kick]] resulted in a penalty on [[Sam Hurd]] for illegal touching and the Giants ran out the clock. The Giants had swept the Cowboys for the first time since [[2004 New York Giants season|2004]], and were now only one game behind in the division standings.

The winner of this Sunday Night showdown would assume first place in the NFC East (the Eagles outright, the Giants on tiebreakers). With two games against opponents with losing records approaching, it was crucial for the Giants to escape this one with a win.

The Eagles started things off right away, putting 14 points on the board before the Giants had run their fifth play from scrimmage. McNabb connected with Celek for a touchdown, and [[Sheldon Brown (American football)|Sheldon Brown]] returned a Brandon Jacobs fumble for six points on the ensuing drive. In the second quarter, Nicks caught the longest reception of his short career for a 68-yard touchdown. After DeSean Jackson responded by returning a [[Jeff Feagles]] punt 72 yards for a touchdown, the Giants were able to send Bradshaw into the end zone from the 3. Eagles backup quarterback [[Michael Vick]] was able to sneak in one more rushing touchdown before halftime. Jacobs opened the scoring in the second half with a 1-yard rush. After the teams traded turnovers, Manning got the ball into Hixon's hands for a 61-yard touchdown. But the Eagles responded on the very next play with a 60-yard touchdown to Jackson. Jackson's 176 receiving yards amounted to the best individual receiving performance against the Giants since [[2002 New York Giants season|2002]]. The Eagles struck again in the fourth quarter, this time on a run by fullback [[Leonard Weaver]] and a two-point conversion pass to [[Jason Avant]]. The Giants put another touchdown on the board (courtesy of Boss) in the last two minutes of the game, and got the ball back with 28 seconds left. But [[defensive end]] [[Darren Howard]] sacked Manning and forced a fumble, sealing the Eagles' first sweep of the Giants since [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|2004]].

The Giants had given up 85 points to the Eagles this year, the most they had ever given up to the Eagles in a single season in franchise history, including four playoff years where they met the Eagles a third time. The Giants' 38 points were also the most scored by a losing team since Week 2 of [[2008 NFL season|2008]].

The Giants needed wins to keep their playoff hopes alive, and this Monday night matchup against the underachieving Redskins seemed a prime opportunity.

The Giants' first two possessions ended in touchdown runs by Bradshaw of 3 and 4 yards. Later in the second quarter, Manning found Smith in the end zone for a 6-yard score. The normally-lackluster Giants defense succeeded in holding the Redskins to 2 first downs and no points in the first half. The Redskins opened the scoring in the second half with an 11-yard touchdown strike from Campbell to tight end [[Fred Davis (tight end)|Fred Davis]], but [[Graham Gano]]'s extra point was blocked by [[Fred Robbins]]. Manning responded by throwing receiver [[Derek Hagan]] his first touchdown as a Giant, a 23-yard pass. On the next play from scrimmage, Thomas intercepted a Campbell pass and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown. [[Quinton Ganther]], starting at running back in place of the injured [[Clinton Portis]], gave the Redskins another touchdown late in the third quarter, but could not get into the end zone on the two-point conversion attempt. Manning threw one more touchdown pass to Manningham in the fourth quarter, which boosted the Giants to their highest point total on the road since [[1954 New York Giants season|1954]]. The Giants were still very much in the playoff picture, and hoping for losses by the Cowboys and Packers.

This was the last game the Giants would ever play at the moribund Giants Stadium, but they had no time to be nostalgicâdefeating the same Week 16 opponent they faced last year would make their path to the postseason slightly easier.

The Panthers, starting [[Matt Moore (American football)|Matt Moore]] at quarterback in place of the injured [[Jake Delhomme]], quickly took control of the game, scoring on their first four possessions (a 38-yard [[John Kasay]] field goal; a 29-yard [[Jonathan Stewart]] touchdown run; a 22-yard [[Muhsin Muhammad]] touchdown catch; and a 2-yard catch for tight end [[Jeff King (American football)|Jeff King]]). Meanwhile, the Giants turned the ball over 3 times in the first half, and were shut out at halftime for the second time this season. In the third quarter, Carolina picked up where they left off, as Moore connected with Carolina's [[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] for a 27-yard score. The Giants finally got on the board on the ensuing drive, courtesy of a 40-yard Tynes field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Giants' Smith caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Manning, but a subsequent 2-point try failed. Carolina fullback [[Brad Hoover]]'s 1-yard scoring run later in the fourth sealed the game for the Panthers. The Giants left Giants Stadium the same way they had opened it 33 years earlier; with a demoralizing loss.

The loss, along with wins by the Cowboys and Packers this week, mathematically eliminated the Giants from the postseason, breaking their streak of 4 consecutive playoff appearances. Curiously, the last NFL game at Giants Stadium would not be a Giants game, but a Jets game; the Jets would play the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] at home on Sunday night in Week 17.

The Giants wrapped up their 2009 campaign against [[Brett Favre]], a quarterback they last saw on their way to [[Super Bowl XLII]]. This time, however, Favre led a convincing rout of the Giants, as they allowed 40 points to an opponent for the fifth time this season. Scoring touchdowns for Minnesota were former Giant [[Visanthe Shiancoe]], [[2010 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowlers]] [[Adrian Peterson]] and [[Sidney Rice]] (twice), and fullback [[Naufahu Tahi]]. A 1-yard touchdown run by Ware in the fourth quarter prevented the Giants from being shut out. [[Center (American football)|Center]] [[Shaun O'Hara]] was named to the Pro Bowl in the week leading up to the game.

The 2009 Giants became the eighth team since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to miss the playoffs after starting the season 5â0, and the first NFC team since the Vikings in [[2003 Minnesota Vikings season|2003]].
