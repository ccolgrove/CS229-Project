==History==
The land on which Maywood now stands had been populated by Native American tribes for centuries. The area that would later become Maywood was deeded in 1781 by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] monarchy to Spanish War veteran Manuel Nieto. When the settlement of Pueblo de Nuestra Senora de Los Angeles was recorded, it included the cow pasture (now Maywood) that eventually turned into a rancho.&lt;ref&gt;Ahrens, Edward A. &quot;City of Maywood&quot; pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, May Wood, a popular young woman who worked for the real estate corporation developing the {{convert|2,300|acre|km2}} ranch into home tracts, agreed to lend her name to the property. The development of Maywood later survived a bitter challenge to dissolve the prospective city in early 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Ahrens, Edward A., &quot;City of Maywood&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1924, Maywood's citizens voted to incorporate and about 300 people turned out for the dedication, including Miss May Wood. By 1924, the population of Maywood had reached 1,000. The city featured homes, stores and a movie theater. In the 1930s, gamblers were successfully removed from the city. Maywood Parks and Recreation built Maywood Park, had its beginnings in the 1930s, when a large meadow was turned into the present day baseball field. The Golden State Baseball Association made Maywood Park its home in the early 1950s.

The [[Chrysler Corporation]] had an auto assembly plant in Maywood from the 1920s until its closing in July 1971. It was located at 5800 Eastern Avenue at Slauson, and was generally referred to as the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; Plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chrysler Heritage: A Photographic History|last=Davis|first=Michael W.R.|year=2001|publisher=|isbn=0-7385-0779-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=btNBJdkw4joC&amp;dq=chrysler+history&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=in&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AvMpTLCUDIyJnQfymtR2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=12&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the city of Commerce was incorporated in 1961, that corner was annexed as were several in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varley.net/Pages/VarleyYarns/2%20Down%20a%20lazy%20concrete%20river/6%20Down%20a%20lazy%20concrete%20river%20-%20Five%20Towns.htm|title=Books|publisher=Varley.net|date=2007-07-23|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed A-29 Hudson

[[Willys]]-Overland  built its California factory in Maywood, California, in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2009/02/13/factories-and-dealerships-of-historical-los-angeles|title=Factories and dealerships of historical Los Angeles at Hemmings Blog â Classic and collectible cars and parts|publisher=Blog.hemmings.com|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 900 people were employed at the new $1.5 million assembly plant. Willys-Overland became the second automobile manufacturer to build a major plant in the city. After the United States entered World War II, automobile production for civilians was phased out and in November 1941, automobile assembly at Maywood was stopped. A great many automobile plants were retooled to manufacture war machinery and for three years during the war, the [[Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]] rented the plant building from Willys-Overland for that purpose. Equipment was installed for the manufacture of sub-assemblies for Hudson Bombers &lt;ref name=&quot;cj3a&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cj3a.info/cj3a/maywood.html|title=The Maywood Assembly Plant|publisher=Cj3a.info|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the war ended. Willys-Overland began to manufacture the first Jeeps (CJ-2As) for civilians in 1945. As the demand for Jeeps increased, the reconditioning of the plant back to automobile assembly began early in 1947 and by November, Willys was building &quot;West Coast&quot; CJ-2As. By the end of November, 108 Jeeps had been assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Toledo Times&lt;/ref&gt; Jeep Trucks and Station Wagons were incorporated into the West Coast Division's &quot;final assemblies&quot; production lines in 1948. The Maywood plant produced the entire CJ-3A model production duration and about 5% of all CJ-3As were assembled in California. In 1952, Willys-Overland introduced a new post-war model car, the Aero, and they were assembled in both Maywood and Toledo. The entire plant was shut down in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;cj3a&quot;/&gt;

Postwar Maywood was a flourishing blue-collar, multi-ethnic suburb of Los Angeles. There were plenty of industrial jobs in aerospace, food processing, auto and furniture manufacturing. But, the early 1970s saw these jobs disappear with the pressure of higher taxes, increased local and state regulation, and the desirability of cheaper land and labor in other markets. Maywood would change over the next two decades by the influx of Hispanic immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=37671|title=Welcome to Maywood, Mexico|publisher=Human Events|date=2010-06-25|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maywood officials were given notice in June 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun25&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-maywood-20100625,0,3217996.story|title=Maywood didn't meet insurer's conditions|author=Jeff Gottlieb and Ruben Vives|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the city would lose its insurance coverage unless they implemented a 20-point performance plan. Maywood also owed the California Insurance Authority $927,135 and had been making interest-only payments. Mainly because of the troubled history, including multiple lawsuits, and the dubious reputation of the Maywood Police Department,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/01/local/me-maywood1|title=Maywood employs police officers with a history of trouble|author=Matt Lait and Scott Glover|date=April 1, 2007|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cityâs Liability and Workers Compensation insurer, notified the city in August 2009, that it would cancel its coverage effective July 1, 2010. When the city was unable to find coverage elsewhere, it disbanded its police department, laid off all city employees, except for the city manager, city attorney and elected officials, and contracted with other agencies to provide all municipal services.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayme&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerra|first=Hector|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-me-maywood-20100810,0,7786763.story|title=Bell salary scandal: Maywood leaders may try to fire Bell|publisher=latimes.com|date=2010-08-10|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An outside audit found that Maywood was losing approximately $620,000 annually from its $10 million general fund budget &lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun23&quot;/&gt; under the previous seven-year contract with nearby [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;finance.yahoo.com&quot;/&gt; because they had neglected to bill Cudahy for administration, vehicle maintenance or insurance.

Perez said that negotiations disintegrated in February, after Philips resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun25&quot;/&gt;

Councilman Felipe Aguirre said, &quot;We don't want to file for bankruptcy. We don't want to disappear as a city.&quot; Aguirre said filing for bankruptcy was not an option for Maywood because its problems were related specifically to insurance coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun23&quot;/&gt;  Several cities in the state have said that they are close to bankruptcy because of the sharp drop in sales and property tax revenues caused by the deepest recession in decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun23&quot;/&gt; During a heated City Council meeting in June 2010, opponents of the plan accused council members of mismanaging the city by failing to maintain insurance coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun23&quot;/&gt;  Under the plan adopted by the City Council that night, council members would continue to be paid to set policy, but all services would be contracted out. &quot;You single-handedly destroyed the city,&quot; Lizeth Sandoval, the city treasurer, told the City Council. Sandoval, a city employee spoke out as a private citizen, and was laid off as part of the cuts.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat_jun23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/la-maywood-m,0,1212634.story |title=Maywood (Los Angeles, California): Maywood (Los Angeles, California) News and Photos|publisher=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Maywood officials stopped short of filing for bankruptcy or even giving up the city's municipal status, the city still faces a serious problem with a huge deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.cityofmaywood.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmaywood.com|title=City of Maywood|publisher=City of Maywood|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city did keep a few employees as independent contractors when they outsourced most city functions to Bell and police duties to the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayme&quot;/&gt; In September 2010, the troubled nearby city of [[Bell, California|Bell]] agreed to cancel the contract to handle the day-to-day operations of neighboring Maywood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://outside.in/maywood-ca/tags/Bell%20Fallout#881175176 Bell Fallout news in Maywood, California|Outside.in local topics|alt4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Maywood has been overrun with political crises â from recalls to a city clerk accused of trying to contract a hit man to kill Councilman Aguirre.
