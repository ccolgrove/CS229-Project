The [[President of India]] is the [[head of state]] and first citizen of [[India]]. The President is also the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Military of India|armed forces of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot; /&gt; Although the president is vested such powers by the constitution of India, the position is largely a ceremonial role and the executive powers are ''de facto'' exercised by the [[Indian Cabinet Ministers|Cabinet Ministers]] and [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc patil&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/newsenglish/witn/2007/07/070725_india_president.shtml |title=India gets first woman president since independence |accessdate=30 November 2008 |publisher=BBC News  |date=25 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post of President is known in Hindi as ''Rashtrapati'' ({{lang-hi|à¤°à¤¾à¤·à¥à¤à¥à¤°à¤ªà¤¤à¤¿}}), a [[Sanskrit]] [[neologism]] meaning &quot;lord of the realm&quot;. The President is elected by an [[electoral college]] composed of elected members of the parliament houses, [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]], and also members of the [[Vidhan Sabha]], the state legislative assemblies.&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot; /&gt;

There have been 12&amp;nbsp;Presidents of India since the introduction of the post in 1950. The post was established when India was declared as a republic with the adoption of the [[Indian constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_3475000/3475569.stm |title=1950: India becomes a republic |accessdate=6 January 2009 |publisher=BBC News  |date=26 January 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these twelve, three acting presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. [[V. V. Giri|Varahagiri Venkata Giri]] became acting president in 1969 following the death of [[Zakir Hussain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]], who died in office. Giri was elected President a few months later. He remains the only person to have held office both as a president and acting president. The President may remain in office for a tenure of five years, as stated by article 56, part V, of the constitution of India. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the vice president assumes office. By article 70 of part V, the parliament may decide how to discharge the functions of the president where this is not possible, or in any other unexpected contingency.&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/Art1-242%20(1-88).doc |title=The Constitution of India |accessdate=4 January 2009 |format=.doc |publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, is the only person to have held office for two terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;selecting next&quot; /&gt;

Seven presidents have been members of a political party before being elected. Six of these were active party members of the [[Indian National Congress]]. The [[Janata Party]] has had one member, [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]], who later became president. Two presidents, [[Zakir Hussain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]] and [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]], have died in office. Their vice-presidents functioned as acting president until a new president was elected. Following Hussain's death, two acting presidents held office until the new president, [[Varahagiri Venkata Giri]], was elected. Varahagiri Venkata Giri himself, Hussain's vice president, was the first acting president. When Giri resigned to take part in the presidential elections, he was superseded by [[Muhammad Hidayatullah]] as acting president.&lt;ref name=&quot;resign&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=2ee3bdc7-6ec2-409a-a4d5-48294361d566&amp;MatchID1=4875&amp;TeamID1=1&amp;TeamID2=3&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1229&amp;PrimaryID=4875&amp;Headline=Shekhawat+will+not+resign+to+contest+poll |title=Shekhawat will not resign to contest poll |accessdate=4 January 2009 |author=Shekhar Iyer |work=Hindustan Times |location=India |date=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current President is [[Pratibha Patil]], who was elected as the 12th President of India in 2007.

==Presidents==
This list is numbered based on Presidents elected after winning an Indian Presidential election. The terms of [[V. V. Giri|Varahagiri Venkata Giri]], [[Muhammad Hidayatullah]], and [[Basappa Danappa Jatti]], who have functioned as [[acting president]]s, are therefore not numbered. The President of India does not represent any political party, and the ''Political party'' column below indicates the party (if any) that the president was a member of before being elected. The colours used in the table indicate the following:

*The symbol (*) with a light brown background indicates an [[acting president]].
