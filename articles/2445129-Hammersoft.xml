''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' is a series of [[action role-playing game]]s developed and published by [[Square Enix]] (formerly [[Square Co.|Square]]). It is the result of a collaboration between Square and [[Disney Interactive Studios]]. ''Kingdom Hearts'' is a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] of various [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] settings based in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|universe]] made specifically for the series. The series features a mixture of familiar Disney and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' characters, as well as several new characters designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GS-CompanyLine&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=2761861|author=Gerstmann, Jeff|date=2001-05-17|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|title=E3 2001: Square announces Disney RPG for PS2|accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which includes many of the Disney characters' official voice actors.

The series centers around the main character Sora's search for his friends and his encounters with Disney and ''Final Fantasy'' characters on their worlds. Players primarily control Sora, though there are numerous characters who join Sora's party as [[Non-player character|computer controlled members]]. The majority of the characters were introduced in the first game, ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. Several new characters were introduced in the sequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', which also features alternative versions of previous characters created from Sora's memories. ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'' added more Disney and ''Final Fantasy'' characters, as well as introduced new antagonists.

Various types of merchandise modeled after the characters' likeness have been produced, including figurines and jewelry. The characters have garnered praise from several video game websites and magazines for the quality of their voice acting and visual style. Comments focused on the accurate presentation of Disney characters, the unique visual style of Square Enix characters, how well all the characters blended together, and the consistent quality performances from voice actors.

==Creation and influences==
[[File:KH-Character-ConceptArt.jpg|thumb|Early concept art of Riku, Kairi, and Sora, original characters created for the series]]
The ''Kingdom Hearts'' series is directed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], who also works as the character designer of the games. Nomura has stated that unlike working with ''Final Fantasy'' characters, keeping the main character Sora alive and interesting over multiple games is a challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;NI-TechTV&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/TechTv| title=Nomura Interview TechTv| publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| accessdate=2007-07-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609050907/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/TechTv &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;NI-PS.comEur&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=Playstation.com Europe - E3 Interview| url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/Playstation| publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| accessdate=2007-09-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070418212412/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/Playstation &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Disney gave Nomura freedom in the characters and worlds used for the games, he and his staff tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;NI-TechTV&quot;/&gt; When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insider-KHU-NI&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.khinsider.com/content/view/42/41/| title = KHU Interview w/Tetsuya Nomura| publisher=Kingdom Hearts Insider| accessdate=2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of specific ''Final Fantasy'' characters was based on the opinions of fans and the development staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGamer-NI&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| author=Boulette, Bryan| url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| publisher = RPGamer| title=Nomura Divulges Kingdom Hearts II Details| accessdate=2007-07-23| date=2005-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts|''Kingdom Hearts'' universe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NI-1UP-1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=Tetsuya Nomura 1st 1UP Interview| url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/1UP-1| publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| accessdate=2007-09-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610203227/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/1UP-1 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the background work of such characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-NI-Dengeki2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/Dengeki-2| publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| title=Dengeki - Kingdom Hearts 2 Progress Report| accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070608020051/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/Dengeki-2 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Kingdom Hearts II'', he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGamer-NI&quot;/&gt; Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura did this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He stated that with speculation, even though a game may get old, people can still be happy with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-NI-KHIIU&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania - Tetsuya Nomura Interview| url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/KH2U| publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| accessdate=2007-08-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710094227/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/KH2U &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is an original character created by Tetsuya Nomura for the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS-CompanyLine&quot;/&gt; Nomura has stated that Kairi's name can be interpreted as &quot;sea&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;ScenarioMysteries&quot;/&gt; the Japanese [[on'yomi]] pronunciation of sea is {{Nihongo|''kai''|æµ·}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-Riku&quot;/&gt; She is voiced by [[Risa Uchida]] in the Japanese version of the series.

She is fourteen years old at the beginning of the main series.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-Instructions&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Square Co.]] |year=2002 |title=Kingdom Hearts Instruction Booklet |publisher=Square Co., Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Destiny Islands is destroyed by the Heartless, Kairi's heart enters Sora's while her body falls into a deep sleep. Upon learning her identity as a Princess of Heart and the location of her heart, Sora gives up his heart in order to release hers and restore it back into her body. Soon after, Kairi finds Sora's Heartless and restores him back to human form. Kairi later gives Sora her lucky charm, which Sora promises to return. After Sora seals the door to Kingdom Hearts, Kairi is separated from him and left behind on the reforming Destiny Islands where she awaits his return.

During ''Chain of Memories'', NaminÃ©'s memory-altering powers break the memories in Sora's heart as well as those of all his friends, leading Kairi to lose her memories of him. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Kairi gradually remembers Sora as his own memories are restored, and writes him a letter which she sends out to sea in the hopes that it will find its way to him. Later, Kairi is kidnapped by [[Organization XIII#Axel|Axel]], who hopes to use Kairi to lure Sora to him. However, [[Organization XIII#SaÃ¯x|SaÃ¯x]] takes Kairi from Axel and imprisons her and Pluto in a jail cell in the World That Never Was. She escapes her cell with the help of NaminÃ©, and they are saved from SaÃ¯x by Riku, who she recognizes despite his guise as Xehanort's Heartless, Ansem. Riku gives her the {{Nihongo|Destiny's Embrace|ãã¹ãã£ãã¼ãã¬ã¤ã¹||lit. &quot;Destiny Place&quot;}} Keyblade, which she uses to fight off the Heartless that SaÃ¯x summons. Kairi reunites with Sora, and along with Donald, Goofy and King Mickey, they face and defeat Xemnas. Kairi then returns with Sora and Riku to Destiny Islands where they receive a letter from King Mickey. Soon afterwards, Sora resolves to go on another journey to find Terra, Aqua and Ven. Kairi loans him her lucky charm again.

===Riku===
{{Nihongo|Riku|ãªã¯}} is Sora's and Kairi's best friend and one of the main characters. He is an original character created by Tetsuya Nomura for the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS-CompanyLine&quot;/&gt; Nomura has stated that Riku's name can be interpreted as &quot;land&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;ScenarioMysteries&quot;/&gt; the Japanese [[on'yomi]] pronunciation of land is {{Nihongo|''riku''|é¸}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-Riku&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-Sora&quot;/&gt; Riku is voiced by [[Mamoru Miyano]] in the Japanese version and by [[David Gallagher]] in the English version. As a child, he is voiced by [[Eiji Shima]] in the Japanese version and [[Ty Panitz]] in the English version. He is playable in the second story mode of ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' and is a world-specific ally to the world that never was in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. In ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', Riku is playable in the multiplayer mode and also serves as the final boss in the game's story mode. He also acts as Sora's main rival in combat.

As a young boy in ''Birth by Sleep'', Riku becomes curious about going to other worlds and gaining the strength needed to protect his friends, which leads him to being chosen by [[#Terra|Terra]] to inherit the power of the Keyblade. By the beginning of the main series, now fifteen years old, Riku goes with the darkness as their world is attacked by the Heartless. Separated from his friends, Riku ends up at [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Hollow Bastion|Hollow Bastion]] where [[#Maleficent|Maleficent]] finds him, thus giving him the Soul Eater. Under her influence, Riku turns on Sora and searches for a way to help Kairi.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-Riku&quot;/&gt; Riku eventually becomes possessed by Ansem, Seeker of Darkness, with his heart sent to the realm of darkness where he meets King Mickey and helps him and Sora seal the door to the realm of darkness.

In ''Chain of Memories'', through DiZ, Riku awakens in the basement levels of Castle Oblivion and begins climbing to the ground floor. Along the way, Riku confronts the remaining darkness in his heart and a replica of himself that is created by Vexen; he also encounters Ansem the Wise in his DiZ guise, who has been overseeing his progress. After being reunited with Mickey, Riku reaches the main floor where he finds NaminÃ© as she attends to a sleeping Sora. Riku chooses to find a balance between his light and darkness, allowing him to defeat what remained of Ansem, Seeker of Darkness within him. Soon after, Riku joins DiZ to ensure Sora is restored in peace. While capturing Roxas in order to make Sora complete again, Riku uses the power of darkness to capture him at the cost of becoming a physical manifestation of Ansem, Seeker of Darkness.&lt;ref&gt;'''Riku:''' All right. You've left me with no other choice. / '''Roxas:''' What? / '''Riku:''' I have to release the power in my heartâthe dark power that I've been holding back. Even...if it changes me forever. [...] I have accepted it. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days|developer=Square Enix, h.a.n.d.|publisher=Square Enix, Disney Interactive Studios |date=2009-09-29 |platform=Nintendo DS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trapped in that form, Riku helps Sora in secret, ashamed of his appearance and gaining the {{Nihongo|Way to the Dawn|ã¦ã§ã¤ãã¥ã¶ãã¼ã³}} Keyblade. Riku returns to his original form when Ansem the Wise's machine to digitally seal away Kingdom Hearts malfunctions and self-destructs,which also causes Riku to lose his dark powers. Joining Sora, they battle and defeat Xemnas. In the end, he returns to Destiny Islands and remained there for a year before Sora receives a letter from Mickey explaining the fates of Terra, Ventus, and Aqua. Now teaming up with Sora, Riku goes on a quest to complete the Mark of Mastery to become a Keyblade Master in preparation for his eventual battle against Master Xehanort.

===Donald Duck===
{{Main|Donald Duck}}
Donald Duck is the court wizard of Disney Castle, King Mickey's majordomo, and one of Sora's two [[sidekick|partners]] throughout the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-StrategyGuide&quot;/&gt; He is voiced by [[KÅichi Yamadera]] in the Japanese version and by [[Tony Anselmo]] in the English version. Donald is a short-tempered, powerful magician on a quest to find King Mickey Mouse. In ''Kingdom Hearts'', he and Goofy embark on a journey to carry out the missing kingâs orders to follow the Keyblade wielder. Initially, he only seems to care for Sora as an asset to track down King Mickey, telling a white lie to him about being able to locate his missing friends in order to convince him to accompany them;&lt;ref&gt;'''Goofy:''' Hey, why don't ya come with us? We can go to other worlds on our vessel. / '''Sora:''' I wonder if I could find Riku and Kairi... / '''Donald Duck:''' Of course. / '''Goofy:''' Are you sure? / '''Donald Duck:''' Who knows? But we need him to come with us to help us find the king. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square | publisher = Square Electronic Arts| date= 2002-11-15 |platform= PlayStation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he eventually grows to deeply care for him as a friend. At the end of ''Chain of Memories'', he, Sora, and Goofy are put to sleep for a year while their memories are fixed by NaminÃ©.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoM-Sleep&quot;&gt;'''NaminÃ©:''' I'm sorry. It's the only way. You have to choose, Sora. You can lose your memories of this castle and reclaim your old memories... or keep your memories here and give up the memories that you've lost. / '''Sora:''' I have to choose? / '''NaminÃ©:''' Yes. / '''Sora:''' Put me back the way I was. / ... / '''Donald:''' We have to sleep in these to get our memories back? / '''NaminÃ©:''' You'll be fine.

Sora's Wisdom Form uses Donald in order to activate the form. In ''358/2 Days'', Donald is playable in the multiplayer mode.

===Goofy===
{{Main|Goofy}}
Goofy is the captain of the Royal Knights of Disney Castle and the second of Sora's two partners throughout the series. Goofy is voiced by [[YÅ« Shimaka]] in the Japanese version and by [[Bill Farmer]] in the English version. Despite his position as a knight, Goofy dislikes using weapons, instead wielding a simple shield, and prefers to avoid fighting whenever possible. The Goofy of ''Kingdom Hearts'' retains his trademark clumsiness and simple-mindedness, but is an eternal optimist who takes life in stride. He has surprisingly accurate intuitive skills, often noticing things that others miss. Under the kingâs orders, he accompanies Donald on the quest to find the key.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-StrategyGuide&quot;/&gt; At the end of ''Chain of Memories'', he, Sora, and Donald are put to sleep for a year while their memories are fixed by NaminÃ©.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoM-Sleep&quot;/&gt; In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', he awakens with his friends and continues to fight the Heartless along with the Nobodies and Organization XIII. Sora's Varlor Form uses Goofy in order to activate the form. In ''358/2 Days'', Goofy becomes playable in the multiplayer mode.

===King Mickey===
{{Main|Mickey Mouse}}
King Mickey is the ruler of [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Disney Castle|Disney Castle]] and by extension, Disney Town.&lt;ref name=&quot;KHII-Instructions&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author = [[Square Enix]]|year = 2006|title = Kingdom Hearts II Instruction Booklet|publisher = Square Enix}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is voiced by [[Takashi Aoyagi]] in the Japanese version of the series and is voiced in English by [[Wayne Allwine]] in ''Kingdom Hearts'', ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'' and [[Bret Iwan]] in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]''. Mickey's inclusion in the series was initially restricted to a small cameo for only one scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insider-KHU-NI&quot;/&gt; The larger role he played in the sequels first required the approval of Disney.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-NI-KHIIU&quot;/&gt; In ''Birth by Sleep'', Mickey was a student under Yen Sid and met Ansem the Wise while helping out Terra's group with the Star Seeker Keyblade. By the time ''Kingdom Hearts'' begins, when the Heartless began to invade other worlds, Mickey left his world to discover the cause. While he had Donald and Goofy find and protect the Keyblade Master, Mickey was on a mission of his own to uncover the plot of Organization XIII that ultimately leads to obtaining a new Keyblade called Kingdom Key D from within the realm of darkness, using it to seal Kingdom Hearts with Sora. In ''Chain of Memories'', he helps Riku in spirit at first, but then returns from the dark realm thanks to DiZ to help directly. Donning a cloak of darkness in unity with Riku, Mickey continues to uncover the Organization's plan in secret before helping Sora directly. He is only playable in certain boss battles in ''Kingdom Hearts II''; if Sora and his friends are defeated, King Mickey will step in to fight in Sora's place until he is able to revive Sora, as the game forbids King Mickey from defeating a boss on his own. In the aftermath of Xemnas' defeat, Mickey returns to his world, only to go on another adventure in the events of the mobile game ''Kingdom Hearts coded'' where he learns the fates of Terra, Aqua and Ven as he contacts Sora to help them.

===Ansem the Wise===
{{Nihongo|Ansem the Wise|è³¢èã¢ã³ã»ã |Kenja Ansemu}} is an original character created for the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series. He first appeared in the &quot;Reverse/Rebirth&quot; mode of ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' under the disguise of a mysterious man named {{Nihongo|DiZ|ãã£ãº|Dizu}} and appeared again in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. The name &quot;DiZ&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Darkness in Zero&quot;. Ansem is voiced by [[GenzÅ Wakayama]] in the Japanese version of the series and in English by [[Christopher Lee]] in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', and [[Corey Burton]] in ''Kingdom Heats Re:Chain of Memories'' and ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep''.

Ansem was formerly a respected sage and ruler of the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Hollow Bastion|Radiant Garden]]. As a researcher, Ansem studied the heart and delved into the many secrets of the worlds. He and his apprentice [[#Xehanort|Xehanort]] believed that darkness could spread into and take control of the heart. After meeting with King Mickey and learning his research may be connected with a current crisis happening in other worlds, Ansem ceased the experiments. He later found his report on the experiments was given new entries by Xehanort, now using the name Ansem as his own. Ansem's apprentices then betrayed him and banished him to a world of nothingness before ending up in the Realm of Darkness, losing his memory in the process. In time, however, Ansem regained his memories and took on the name DiZ. From that point on, until he cleared his name and had his revenge, DiZ wore concealing red robes and covered most of his face with red bandages.

In ''Chain of Memories'', he helps guide Riku through his encounters in Castle Oblivion. Soon after Riku joins in his campaign, DiZ convinces NaminÃ© to move Sora, Donald, and Goofy to Twilight Town for safekeeping as they regain their lost memories, which DiZ oversees throughout ''358/2 Days''. When the restoration process comes to a standstill, DiZ orders Riku to forcefully retrieve Roxas, Sora's Nobody, who he then places inside a virtual Twilight Town, allowing the process to continue. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', NaminÃ© begins to act on her own and Riku declines to help him in his revenge. As he observes the lengths that Riku is willing to go to in order to help Sora, including taking on the physical form of Xehanort's Heartless, DiZ loses his lust for revenge and grows regretful of his actions. Once Sora awakens and embarks on his new quest, he does not function as DiZ wants, and all of his plans fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;'''Ansem the Wise:''' I made so many plans. But when Sora became an acting force, they all fell apart. All my research amounted to nothing, compared to that one boy's heart. {{cite video game |title=Kingdom Hearts II |developer=[[Square Enix]] |publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the World That Never Was, he reveals himself to Mickey while attempting to digitally seal away Kingdom Hearts. However, the hearts prove unpredictable and begin to overload the machine, and Ansem chooses to sacrifice himself in order to help defeat the Organization. After apologizing to Roxas for his mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;'''Ansem the Wise:''' Sora, it's all up to you now. And RoxasâI doubt you can hear meâbut... I am sorry. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the machine self-destructs, and Ansem is consumed in the blast which disrupts the power contained in Kingdom Hearts and restores Riku to his true form. As revealed in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', the explosion sends Ansem to the Realm of Darkness once more with only his memories of Sora and his relation to him intact. There he meets Aqua at the shores of a dark ocean and tells her about Sora and how he may be the means for Ansem to redeem himself for his actions.

===Jiminy Cricket===
{{main|Jiminy Cricket}}
Jiminy Cricket travels with Sora, Donald, and Goofy as the chronicler of their travels, recording information about people, places and events in his journals.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoM-StrategyGuide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Minnie:''' Oh, and to chronicle your travels, he will accompany you. / '''Jiminy:''' Over here! Cricket's the name. Jiminy Cricket, at your service. {{cite video game| title=Kingdom Hearts| developer=Square| publisher=Square Electronic Arts| date=2002-11-15| platform=PlayStation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jiminy is originally from the same world as Geppetto and Pinocchio, where he acted as Pinocchio's conscience. Despite making only a few appearances, he plays a major role in both ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|Chain of Memories]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded|coded]]''. He is voiced by [[Kaneta Kimotsuki]] in Japanese, and by [[Eddie Carroll]] in English until his death in 2010, after which he is voiced by [[Phil Snyder]].

===NaminÃ©===
{{Nihongo|NaminÃ©|ããã|Namine}} is Kairi's Nobody when her heart left her body and entered Sora's body. She is an original character created for the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series. She has the ability to change or erase the memories of Sora and those close to him by rearranging and creating new links between them, and is called a witch because of it.&lt;ref&gt;'''Larxene:''' The girl you've been trying to protect all this time...is really a manipulative witch who shackles peoples' hearts! {{cite video game |title=Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories |developer=[[Square Enix]] |publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2008-12-02 |platform=PlayStation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''NaminÃ©:''' I'm a witch with power over Sora's memories and those around him. / '''Roxas:''' A witch? / '''NaminÃ©:''' That's what DiZ called me. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; NaminÃ© is voiced by Iku Nakahara in the Japanese version of the series and is voiced in English by [[Brittany Snow]] in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and by [[Meaghan Jette Martin]] in all subsequent appearances.

NaminÃ© first appears in ''Chain of Memories'' when she's talking to Larxene, she mentions that she is the shadow of Kairi, being held hostage by Organization XIII. Under orders from the Organization, she alters Sora's memories to remember her as a close friend from Destiny Islands. When [[Organization XIII#Axel|Axel]] releases NaminÃ© under his own agenda, she reveals herself and the truth to Sora. NaminÃ© gives Sora some hints of who is really his friend (which is Kairi) by transforming into Kairi. When Marluxia is defeated, NaminÃ© puts Sora, Donald, and Goofy to sleep for a year in order to give them back their memories. Until then Sora's mission is to sleep in order to get his memories back. .&lt;ref name=&quot;CoM-Sleep&quot;/&gt; NaminÃ© also saves Riku in &quot;Reverse/Rebirth&quot; from [[Organization XIII#Zexion|Zexion]] by teaching him not to fear the darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-NI-KHIIU&quot;/&gt; In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', NaminÃ© is revealed to be a &quot;special Nobody&quot; born from Kairi's heart when it left Sora's body. When Sora took his own heart with the dark Keyblade, his body and soul were used to create not only Roxas, but NaminÃ© as well. NaminÃ© is the only human Nobody who is not a member of Organization XIII. Since Kairi had no darkness in her heart NaminÃ© became a Nobody of light. When Kairi's heart was in contact with Sora's body it gave NaminÃ© powers that can affect Sora and those around him. Despite DiZ's orders, NaminÃ© visits Roxas in the virtual Twilight Town to help him discover his true identity. Though she outlived her purpose in Sora's restoration, Riku entrusted NaminÃ¨ to the now rogue Axel after DiZ gave him orders to destroy her. While Kairi was stuck in the Organization's dungeon, NaminÃ© comes and helps her escape. After meeting with Roxas once more through Sora after Xemnas's apparent defeat, she opens a portal to lead Sora and his friends go home and she fuses with Kairi to complete her.

But during the events of ''Kingdom Hearts coded'', it was revealed that NaminÃ© created a copy of herself within Jiminy's Journal to contact Mickey and reveal to him Sora's ties to Terra, Aqua, and Ven before dissolving upon fulfilling her objective. NaminÃ© also briefly appears in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', shown drawing a picture of Sora sitting alone on a Paopu tree in his ''Kingdom Hearts II'' attire on Destiny Islands, as she says his name.

===Roxas===
{{Main|Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)}}
{{Nihongo|Roxas|ã­ã¯ãµã¹|Rokusasu}} is Sora's Nobody who was created when Sora became a Heartless to save Kairi.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-Sora&quot;/&gt; &quot;Roxas&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Sora&quot; with an X.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS-TGS07&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tgs.gamespot.com/story.html?sid=6179212 |author=Boyes, Emma |date = 2007-09-20 |title=TGS '07: Three new Kingdom Hearts games coming |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first featured in the secret trailer &quot;Another Side, Another Story&quot; while wearing the Organization's cloak, though he was unnamed and his face was hidden under a hood.

{{Main|Terra (Kingdom Hearts)}}
{{Nihongo|Terra|ãã©|Tera}} is an original character created by Tetsuya Nomura. He first appears as one of the main protagonists of ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'', originally wielding the {{Nihongo|Earthshaker|ã¢ã¼ã¹ã·ã§ã¤ã«ã¼}} Keyblade. He is voiced by [[RyÅtarÅ Okiayu]] in the Japanese version of the game and [[Jason Dohring]] in English. His name means &quot;earth&quot;, from Latin, both it and his Keyblade follow the &quot;land&quot; theme he represents alongside Riku.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScenarioMysteries&quot;/&gt; Terra is raised and trained by Master Eraqus alongside Aqua and Ventus, developing a strong sibling-like bond and sharing his dream of becoming a Keyblade Master with them. He becomes troubled upon learning that the darkness in his heart is too strong, for which he is denied the Mark of Mastery.&lt;ref name=&quot;WF-Nov5-I&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Weekly [[Famitsu]]| publisher = [[Enterbrain]]| date = 2009-11-05| pages = 266â267| author = Famitsu Staff| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is thus easily manipulated by Xehanort, who encourages him to embrace and channel his darkness into power. Throughout Terra's story, attack and defense is his main fight style.

===Ventus===
{{Main|Ventus (Kingdom Hearts)}}
{{Nihongo|Ventus|ã´ã§ã³ãã¥ã¹|Ventusu}}, also known as {{Nihongo|Ven|ã´ã§ã³}}, is an original character created by Tetsuya Nomura who first appears as one of the main protagonists of ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' and the character that the player directly controls in one of the scenarios of the game which also involves him exploring his true identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Nomura Discusses Kingdom Hearts| url = http://psp.ign.com/articles/824/824305p1.html| author = Gantayat, Anoop| date = October 2, 2007| publisher = [[IGN]]| accessdate = January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bears an extremely striking resemblance to Roxas, both of whom are voiced by [[KÅki Uchiyama]] in Japanese and [[Jesse McCartney]] in English. His name means &quot;wind&quot; in Latin; both it and his {{Nihongo|Wayward Wind|ãã¬ãã·ã¥ããªã¼ãº||lit. &quot;Fresh Breeze&quot;}} Keyblade have a &quot;sky&quot; theme similar to that of Sora's. Throughout Ventus's scenario, speed is his main fighting style, which explains why he holds the Wayward Wind in a reverse grip.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScenarioMysteries&quot;/&gt;

===Aqua===
{{Main|Aqua (Kingdom Hearts)}}
{{Nihongo|Aqua|ã¢ã¯ã¢|Akua}} is an original character created by Tetsuya Nomura. She first appears in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' and is the only female main protagonist of that game. She is voiced by [[Megumi Toyoguchi]] in the Japanese version and [[Willa Holland]] in the English version. Her name means &quot;water&quot; in Latin which carries a water theme similar to that of Kairi, whose name means &quot;sea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScenarioMysteries&quot;/&gt; Aqua is a level-headed and serious person, but often worries about her friends. She is also a very creative and outgoing girl as well. Her Keyblade is called {{Nihongo|Rainfell|ã¬ã¤ã³ãã©ã¼ã«||lit &quot;Rainfall&quot;}}. Throughout Aqua's story magic is her main fighting style.

===Master Eraqus===
{{Nihongo|Master Eraqus|ãã¹ã¿ã¼ã»ã¨ã©ã¯ã¥ã¹|MasutÄ ErakÅ«su}}&lt;ref name=&quot;WF-Nov5&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Weekly [[Famitsu]]| publisher = [[Enterbrain]]| date = 2009-11-05| pages = 262â263| author = Famitsu Staff| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an original character created by Tetsuya Nomura. He appears in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' as one of the few remaining Keyblade Masters who trained alongside Master Xehanort, who he considers to be a friend in a relationship similar to that of old classmates.&lt;ref name=&quot;WF-Nov5&quot;/&gt; He oversees the power of light in all worlds from the Land of Departure, and acts as both a teacher and caring father figure of Terra, Aqua, and Ventus. He is voiced by [[Makio Inoue]] in the Japanese version of the game, and by [[Mark Hamill]] in the English version.

Eraqus is strongly biased in the existence of darkness in favor of light, darkness to be a malevolent force that needs to be destroyed, which leads him to deny Terra the Mark of Mastery upon sensing darkness in his heart. He also strictly forbids Ventus from leaving the Land of Departure, fearing Xehanort will use him to create the Ï-blade. He sends Terra and Aqua to deal with the appearance of the Unversed and the disappearance of Master Xehanort; he also requests Aqua to watch over Terra to ensure he doesn't succumb to darkness, as well as to retrieve Ventus after he chases Terra to other worlds. When Ventus confronts him over this and confirms his fears, Eraqus attempts to foil Xehanort's plan by destroying Ventus. He is stopped by Terra and, after battling and losing to his student, is struck down by Xehanort and fades away, leaving behind his Keyblade, the {{Nihongo|Master Keeper|ãã¹ã¿ã¼ã­ã¼ãã¼}}, which Aqua later uses to replace her own Keyblade. However, the game's secret ending reveals that Eraqus has hidden his own heart within Terra, allowing Terra to resist Xehanort's influence after being possessed by him. An additional boss modeled after Eraqus's armor, called the {{Nihongo|Armor of the Master|ã¢ã¼ãã¼ã»ãªãã»ã¶ã»ãã¹ã¿ã¼|ÄmÄ obu za MasutÄ}}, appears in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix'' in the Mirage Arena.

His name is an anagram of &quot;Square,&quot; the first name of the developer, [[Square Enix]]. Early speculation of his name showed it as being &quot;Master Erauqs,&quot; which is Square, only reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;WF-Nov5-I&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = éæå²ä¹æ°ç¬å ã¤ã³ã¿ãã¥ã¼ï¼ TGSãµãã©ã¤ãºæ åã®åå®¹ã«è¿«ã - ãã¡ãé.com | url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1227992_1124.html | author = [[Famitsu]] | date = September 28, 2009 | publisher = [[Famitsu]] | accessdate = June 18, 2011 | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also bears a striking resemblance to ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Who Does This New Kingdom Hearts Character Look Like? | url = http://kotaku.com/5382223/who-does-this-new-kingdom-hearts-character-look-like | author = Brian Ashcraft | date = October 15, 2009 | publisher = [[Kotaku]] | accessdate = June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is shown to be an acquaintance and friend of both Master Eraqus and Master Xehanort. Though he is retired, his wisdom still serves as a source of information for Mickey, Terra, Aqua, Ventus, Sora, Donald and Goofy, demonstrated when he informs Eraqus of the threat of the Unversed and Sora of the dangers of the Heartless, the Nobodies and Organization XIII. Upon discovering that due to the destruction of &quot;Ansem&quot; and Xemnas, Xehanort has returned and will pave way for the return of Master Xehanort, Yen Sid intends to put Sora and Riku through a Mark of Mastery Exam in order to make them into full-fledged Keyblade Masters to defeat Master Xehanort once and for all. He is voiced by [[Corey Burton]] in the English version and [[Takashi Inagaki]] in the Japanese version.
His name reversed makes Disney (Dis Ney).

==Main antagonists==
===Xehanort===
{{Nihongo|Xehanort|ã¼ã¢ãã¼ã|ZeanÅto}} is an original character and the primary antagonist of the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series. His name without the &quot;X&quot; is an anagram of &quot;No Heart&quot;, &quot;A Throne&quot; and &quot;Another&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-NI-KHIIU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| year=2005| editor=Studio BentStuff| title=Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania| publisher=[[Square Enix]]| language=Japanese| isbn=4-7575-1621-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xehanort, a student of Ansem the Wise, becomes increasingly obsessed with the study of hearts so he can regain some of his lost memories. To that end, he sacrifices his body in the process,&lt;ref&gt;'''Ansem Report 10:''' My path is set. I shall seek out the wielder of the Keyblade, and the princesses.

As the leader of [[Organization XIII]] and master of the power of nothingness, Xemnas controls the Nobodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot;/&gt; He is defeated by Sora and Riku in the World That Never Was.

In the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', it is revealed that Xehanort was originally {{Nihongo|Master Xehanort|ãã¹ã¿ã¼ã»ã¼ã¢ãã¼ã|MasutÄ ZeanÅto}}, an elderly Keyblade Master obsessed with the mysteries behind the Keyblade War. He pits his former apprentice [[Ventus (Kingdom Hearts)|Ventus]] against [[#Vanitas|Vanitas]] to forge the Ï-blade in order to open the door to Kingdom Hearts and begin another war, hoping to uncover the secrets of the first. He also manipulates [[Terra (Kingdom Hearts)|Terra]] into becoming a warrior of darkness with the intention of merging his own heart with a suitable, younger body that will allow him to survive long enough to see his plan come to fruition. Though he succeeds in possessing Terra, creating the current incarnation of Xehanort, the unforeseen creation of the Lingering Will, made from Terra's mind inhabiting his armour, leads to his defeat. He is later defeated again by Aqua, which leaves him in his amnesic state while found by Ansem the Wise. 

Twelve years later, as shown in the secret ending of ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]'', with the destruction of both &quot;Ansem&quot; and Xemnas, Yen Sid realizes that Xehanort has been revived. 

Xehanort and &quot;Ansem&quot; are voiced by [[Akio Ohtsuka|Akio Åtsuka]] in the Japanese version of the series and [[Richard Epcar]] in all English versions after ''Kingdom Hearts'', &quot;Ansem&quot; being voiced in the first game by [[Billy Zane]].

===Maleficent===
{{Main|Maleficent}}
Maleficent is an evil fairy from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', voiced by [[Toshiko Sawada]] in the Japanese version and by [[Susanne Blakeslee]] in the English version. She is originally from the world Enchanted Dominion, encountering Terra and his group after Master Xehanort reveals to her the existence of the Princesses of Heart in ''Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep''. She recruits Terra's help in cursing Princess Aurora in return for her helping him find Master Xehanort, but her plans are derailed by Aqua and Ven, who know of her treachery. In the end, Maleficent is defeated in battle by Aqua, but she flees and is not seen again for a year. By the time of ''Kingdom Hearts'', Maleficent has rallied a group of [[Disney Villains]] who seek to harness the power of darkness within Kingdom Hearts. Upon Riku's arrival to Hollow Bastion, she gives him the &quot;Soul Eater&quot; and later the power to control the heartless. Xehanort's Heartless unlocks her heart which transforms her into her dragon form. Sora defeats her but she is resurrected in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', where she primarily seeks a new base of operations with [[#Pete|Pete]] so she can obtain Kingdom Hearts. She also wants her revenge against Sora, but to that end, she ends up helping him on two occasions in order to stop Organization XIII from interfering with her plans. With the apparent destruction of Organization XIII, Maleficent resumes her quest for revenge on Sora and confronts a digital version of him in ''Kingdom Hearts coded'', but entering the Data world made by Jiminy's Journal proves to be a major error, as she is almost erased completely from existence along with Pete when the debugging of the Journal is completed, but she is rescued by the Data Riku.

===Organization XIII===

Pete is voiced by [[TÅru Åhira]] in the Japanese version and by [[Jim Cummings]] in the English version.&lt;ref name=&quot;KHII-GSTechInfo&quot;/&gt; Pete is first introduced in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', absent from the first two games because he was traveling to other worlds to build a Heartless army for Maleficent. He was originally a steamboat captain from Disney Castle until the events of ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', where he causes mischief in Disney Town in his Captain Justice and Captain Dark personas. Eventually, this leads to Queen Minnie banishing him to another dimension for his evil ways. However, he is freed by Maleficent and vows to help her conquer the worlds.&lt;ref&gt;'''Goofy:''' We sure do! Pete's been causin' trouble for ages!

At the end of ''Kingdom Hearts II'', he and Maleficent hold the Heartless at bay in the World that Never Was to help Sora reach and defeat Xemnas. In ''Kingdom Hearts coded'', while infiltrating Disney Castle, he somehow ends up inside the Digital world made from Jiminy Cricket's journal, and summons Maleficent for them to take it over, create more Heartless and release them into the real world to further their original plan. But this proves to be their downfall when the journal is ready to be erased: the Data Sora attempts to retrieve both Pete and Maleficent from the data world before they vanish, but is too late and they are apparently erased completely from existence. However it is later revealed that they were rescued by the Data Riku through a &quot;rift in the data&quot;.

He is also the source of the Unversed, which are spawned from his emotions to carry out his will. He wields a Keyblade called {{Nihongo|Void Gear|ã´ã©ã¤ãã®ã¢}} in a stance similar to Riku's, and wears a full-body suit resembling Riku's &quot;dark mode&quot; costume, concealing his face behind a black, rounded mask. Despite his similarities to Riku, his physical appearance is identical to that of Sora, but he looks different with black hair and golden yellow eyes compared to Sora's brown hair and blue eyes. [[Tetsuya Nomura]] says this is because Sora connected his heart to Ventus's to supplement his missing darkness, and adds that Vanitas's appearance would have been identical to any other character who would do the same. His name is derived from the Latin word for &quot;emptiness,&quot; which sounds similar to Ventus's name. In addition, the kanji for {{Nihongo|&quot;emptiness&quot;|ç©º}} is shared with the word &quot;sky,&quot; which further connects Vanitas to Sora. Vanitas shares Sora's Japanese and English voice actors, [[Miyu Irino]] and [[Haley Joel Osment]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbs&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=ã­ã³ã°ãã  ãã¼ã ãã¼ã¹ ãã¤ ã¹ãªã¼ã ã¢ã«ãã£ããã¢|trans_title=Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania|year=2010 |isbn=978-4757527881 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanitas exists for the purpose of fighting with Ventus so that their hearts of pure darkness and light, respectively, can merge and forge the Ï-blade. Noting Ventus's weakness, Vanitas goads him into following his friend Terra and pits him against the Unversed to strengthen him, all while monitoring his strength and progress. He also makes several attempts on Aqua's life, deeming her to be an obstacle to Master Xehanort's plans. He merges with Ventus during the final battle at the Keyblade Graveyard, though Ventus' consciousness prevents the Ï-blade's completion. Vanitas fights Ventus in a metaphysical battle within Ventus's mind while simultaneously possessing his body and fighting Aqua and Mickey, wielding the Ï-blade during both fights. Ventus and Aqua both defeat Vanitas and destroy the Ï-blade, vanquishing him and the Unversed. A secret boss in the game known as the {{Nihongo|Vanitas Remnant|ã´ã¡ãã¿ã¹ã®æå¿µ|Vanitasu no Shinen|lit. &quot;Vanitas Sentiment&quot;}} or Vanitas's Lingering spirit, in the English version, appearing identical to Vanitas with a grayscale Void Gear and armor, and bearing the Unversed emblem on his helmet. He was added to the game due to positive fan response to the secret boss battle of ''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbs&quot;/&gt;

==Reception==
Overall, the characters within the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series have been well received and have garnered praise for the quality of their voice acting as well as their visual style. [[IGN]], [[GameSpy]], and ''[[Game Informer]]'' all praised the animation quality of the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-Review&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=IGN: Kingdom Hearts Review| publisher=IGN| date=2002-09-16| url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/371/371125p1.html| accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KH2gamespy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=Kingdom Hearts II (PS2)| url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/kingdom-hearts-ii/698896p1.html| publisher=[[GameSpy]]| author=Villoria, Gerald| date=2006-03-28| accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200210/R03.0731.1541.35640.htm?CS_pid=280415| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011045931/http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200210/R03.0731.1541.35640.htm?CS_pid=280415| archivedate=2007-10-11| title=Kingdom Hearts Review| publisher=[[Game Informer]]| author=Reiner, Andrew| accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's David Smith's impressions of the characters were very positive, referring to them as an &quot;engaging cast&quot;, and stating the &quot;characters' acting is helped immensely by the facial expressions and body&quot;. The design of the characters created specifically for ''Kingdom Hearts'' was seen as the highlight of the first game, stating &quot;the majority of its best visual moments are based on original designs&quot;. One complaint he expressed was &quot;the odd bit of cheating with the lip-synching, where textured facial features are substituted for full 3D animation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-Review&quot;/&gt; GameSpy stated the Disney characters &quot;slide perfectly into Square's visual style&quot;, and complemented the realistic characters from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', describing them as &quot;remarkably accurate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH2gamespy&quot;/&gt;

[[GameSpot]] commented the first game created a &quot;fascinating world&quot; using the Disney and ''Final Fantasy'' characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH-COMgamespot&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/kingdomheartschainofmemories/review.html| author=Massimilla, Bethany| date=2004-12-09| publisher=[[GameSpot]]| title=Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Review| accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaming Age commented the combination of ''Final Fantasy'' and Disney characters worked very well and outweighed any design problems in the game. For the third game, they stated Square Enix &quot;captured the look and mannerisms of the various Disney characters&quot; very well.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA-KHII&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=Review - Kingdom Hearts II| url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/reviews/review.pl?sys=ps2&amp;game=kingdomhearts2| author=Faylor, Chris| publisher=Gaming Age| accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpy stated the inclusion of the Disney and Square Enix characters was handled well.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH2gamespy&quot;/&gt; The main character Sora has also received press comments. In January 2007, Sora was listed the 4th biggest dork of 2006 by ''Game Informer'', citing the Atlantica singing portions of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI#165&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|date= January 2007|title= Top 10 Dorks of 2006|periodical=[[Game Informer]]|publisher= Cathy Preston|issue= 165|page= 58 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN listed him as a possible character in ''[[Super Smash Bros.
