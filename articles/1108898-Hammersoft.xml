==History==
The Group began with the opening of its flagship property, [[Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong|The Mandarin]], in Hong Kong in 1963, which soon built up a reputation for luxurious service. In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company. The Group's intention was to &quot;expand into Asia and operate hotels that would reflect the standard of service synonymous with [their] property in [[Hong Kong]].&quot;&lt;ref name=pkcorpinfo/&gt;

In 1974 the company's hotel interests expanded further through the acquisition of a 49% interest in [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Bangkok|The Oriental, Bangkok]]. The Oriental, built in 1876, was already a legendary property and acknowledged as one of the world's great hotels. Through the management of both The Mandarin in Hong Kong and The Oriental, Bangkok, the Group was in an unusual position of having two &quot;flagship&quot; hotels whose names were among the best in hospitality.&lt;ref name=pkcorpinfo/&gt;

In 1985, the Company rationalized its corporate structure by combining these two properties under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The [[Stock Exchange of Hong Kong]] under the name of &quot;Mandarin Oriental International Limited.&quot; Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Hong Kong, manages the activities of the Groupâs hotels.&lt;ref name=pkcorpinfo/&gt;

Today, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group operates, or has under development, 41 hotels representing over 10,000 rooms in 27 countries, with 18 hotels in Asia, 12 in The Americas and 12 in Europe and North Africa. In addition, the Group operates, or has under development, 13 Residences at Mandarin Oriental, connected to the Groupâs properties.&lt;ref name=pkcorpinfo/&gt;
