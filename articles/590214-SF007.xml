==History==
===Foundation===
The company was founded in 1988 in [[Los Angeles]] by Steve Chang (å¼µææ­£, Chang Ming-cheng), his wife, Jenny Chang, and her sister, Eva Chen (é³æ¡æ¨º).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.trendmicro.com/us/about/company/index.html |title=Company Overview - Trend Micro USA |publisher=Us.trendmicro.com |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after establishing the company, its founders moved headquarters to [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=117&amp;CtNode=1354&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Trend Micro took over a Japanese software firm to form Trend Micro Devices and established headquarters in Japan. It then made an agreement with CPU maker [[Intel]] under which it produced an anti-virus product for local area networks (LANs) for sale under Intelâs name. Intel paid royalties to Trend for sales of LANDesk Virus Protect in the United States and Europe, while Trend paid royalties to Intel for sales in Asia. In 1993, [[Novell]] began bundling the product with its network operating system.&lt;ref&gt;http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=117&amp;CtNode=1354&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the two companies agreed to a two-year continuation of the agreement in which Trend was allowed to globally market the ServerProtect product under its own brand alongside Intel's LANDesk brand.

==Products==
===Consumer products===
The 2011-2012 range of products are [[Titanium Internet Security]], [[Titanium Maximum Security]] and [[Titanium Security for Netbooks]] as well as [[SafeSync|Trend Micro SafeSync]] and [[Online Guardian]]. 

There are also various versions for mobile devices, including [[Trend Micro Titanium Tablet Security for Android]], [[Mobile Security Personal Edition]], [[Smart Surfing for iPhone]] and [[SafeSync Mobile]].

The company also offers a variety of free tools to diagnose and mitigate security issues including [[HouseCall]], [[CWShredder]], [[Smart Surfing for the iPhone]], [[ThreatWatch App for iPhone]], [[RUBotted]], Rootkit Buster and [[HijackThis]].

===Small business products===
Trend Micro offers Worry-Free Business Security and InterScan Messaging Hosted Security for small businesses.

===Enterprise products===
The 2010 Trend Micro Enterprise products include OfficeScan, InterScan Web Security, InterScan Messaging Security, and Deep Security. Trend Micro acquired the [[OSSEC]] project along with its acquisition of Third Brigade, and has promised to keep it open source and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ossec.net/main/trend-micro-to-acquire-third-brigade|title=Trend Micro to Acquire Third Brigade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==
In June 2008, Trend Micro introduced Trend Micro [[Smart Protection Network]], a cloud-client content security infrastructure designed to protect customers from [[web threat]]s, such as [[data stealing malware]]. This combines in-the-cloud technologies with other client-based AV technologies to reduce dependency on conventional pattern file downloads on the endpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/security/208700393;jsessionid=LMHNO53QPXUT5QE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN|title=Trend Micro Releases New 'Smart Protection Network'|author=Stefanie Hoffman}}&lt;/ref&gt; AVTest.org results from December 2009 testing show Trend Micro Office Scan ahead of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.trendmicro.com/us/trendwatch/core-technologies/competitive-benchmarks/avtest/index.html |title=Competitive Benchmark Tests â AV-Test.org - Trend Micro USA |publisher=Us.trendmicro.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Website administrators however report abusive behavior from the Trend Micro Network that is displaying [[malware]] characteristics. Reported behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_216.104.15.138 |title=Project Honeypot |publisher=Project Honeypot |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates security risks for users of [[Trend Micro Internet Security]] who access internet banking facilities.

Trend Micro is suing [[Barracuda Networks]] for the latter's distribution of [[ClamAV]] as part of a security package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linux.com/feature/126851 | title=Trend Micro patent claim provokes FOSS community, leads to boycott | publisher=Linux.com | date=2008-02-11 | accessdate=2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trend Micro claims that Barracuda's use of ClamAV infringes on a [[software patent]] for filtering viruses on an [[Gateway (computer networking)|Internet gateway]]. The [[free software community]] has responded in part by calling for a [[boycott]] of Trend Micro. The boycott is backed by the [[Free Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/boycottTrendMicro.html | title=Boycott Trend Micro | publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] | date=2008-02-11 | accessdate=2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
