'''Gary Lewis''' (born '''Gary Stevenson''' on 30 November 1958) is a Scottish actor. He has had parts in ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' and ''[[Three and Out]]'', as well as a major role in the television [[docudrama]], ''[[Supervolcano (docudrama)|Supervolcano]]''.

==Early life==
Born and raised in the tough [[Easterhouse]] area of Glasgow, Lewis has described in interviews the dichotomy of his upbringing: his parents stressed the value of education, yet his formal studies were left wanting. When he left school, he lacked a sense of purpose, taking a job as a road-sweeper to earn a living. Later, Lewis found employment in the local library. Encouraged by his brother, an English teacher at a Glasgow secondary school (Stonelaw High School), he read voraciously and thought about pursuing a career as an actor.

==Acting career==
===Theatre===
Although he had pursued amateur theatrics, Lewis was 32 when he committed to acting, joining [[Robert Carlyle]]'s newly formed Raindog Theatre. His career received a boost when he was befriended by actor-director [[Peter Mullan]] whom he met at a socialist lecture.

===Film===
Mullan hired Lewis for a role in the short ''Close'' which began filming in 1991 but took some three years to complete. By that time, both actors had appeared in ''[[Shallow Grave]]'' (1994). Lewis went on to act in Mullan's subsequent shorts ''Good Day for the Bad Guys'' (1995) and the award-winning ''Fridge'' (1996).

Lewis joined director [[Kenneth Loach]]'s unofficial stock company lending support to his two mentors in separate films: with Carlyle, he co-starred in ''Carla's Song'' (1996), while he played a recovering alcoholic alongside Mullan in ''My Name Is Joe'' (1998). In between, Mullan cast him as the over-righteous, somewhat dimwitted elder sibling Thomas in ''Orphans'' (1997), an examination of a [[dysfunctional family]]. He went on to co-star with [[Max Beesley]] in ''The Match'' (1999; released on video in USA in 2001) before landing his international breakthrough part as the father of a young boy who wants to become a ballet dancer in ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' (2000). Lewis delivered a multi-layered turn as a man coping with grief over the death of his wife, a violent strike that threatens his livelihood and the struggles of raising two sons. The actor rounded out his banner year teaming with Irish actor [[Sean McGinley]] in ''What Where'', a 12-minute short film of Samuel Beckett's play, and supporting Michael Caine as a boxing coach who may or may not have been involved in a murder in ''Shiner'' (screened at the [[San Sebastian Film Festival]]).

In 2008, Lewis starred in the film ''[[Ecstasy (2007 film)|Ecstasy]]''  based on ''The Undefeated'' from [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling novel [[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]].

Lewis starred in British comedy ''[[Three and Out]]'' released on 25 April 2008.

===Television===
Lewis has appeared in the Scottish comedy ''[[Rab C Nesbitt]]'' and the criminal drama shows ''[[Taggart]]'' and ''[[Prime Suspect, series 7]]''.

In 2010 Lewis appeared as [[Adam Ingram (Labour politician)|Adam Ingram]] in the [[Channel 4]] drama ''[[Mo (film)|Mo]]'' a biopic of former [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Mo Mowlam]], a role that saw him nominated for a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA Television Award]] in the category of [[British Academy Television Awards 2010|Best Supporting Actor]].

In 2011 Lewis appeared in episode five of new BBC drama ''[[Outcasts]]'' playing Patrick Baxter. He also appeared as the enigmatic wizard Alator in episode seven of the fourth season of BBC fantasy drama ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]''.
