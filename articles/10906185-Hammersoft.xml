Vincent Smith believed that the [[Pratihara]] dynasty, which ruled a large kingdom in northern India from the 6th to the 11th centuries, and has been mentioned as &quot;Gurjara-Pratiharas&quot; in an inscription, was certainly of Gurjara origin. Smith also stated that there is possibility of other [[Agnikula]] [[Kshatriya]] clans being of same origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;horace_glossary_punjab_nwfp&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

They keep cows, buffalo, goats and sheep for milk products.The Gujars lead a technologically simple life in close harmony with its natural environment.
In [[Rajasthan]], some members of the Gurjar community resorted to violent protests over the issue of [[Reservation in India|reservation]] in 2006 and 2007.

Recently, the current generation boys &amp; girls have started doing well in the field of education as well. Villages like Bhagout, Bhaidapur, Shaklpura, Dagarpur &amp; Jawli have started progressing mainly because they are granting good education to their children.

====Van Gujjars====
The [[Muslim Gujjar (Uttar Pradesh)|Van Gujjars]](&quot;forest Gujjars&quot;) are found in the Shivalik hills area of North India. The Van Gujjars follow Islam, and they have their own clans, similar to the Hindu [[gotra]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessline_outside_jungle&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a pastoral semi-nomadic community, practising [[transhumance]]. In the winter season, the Van Gujjars migrate with their herds to the Shiwalik foothills, and in summer, they migrate to pastures high up in the mountains. The Van Gujjars have had conflicts with the forest authorities, who prohibited human and livestock populations inside a reserved park, and blamed the Van Gujjar community for poaching and timber smuggling.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessline_outside_jungle&quot;/&gt; After the creation of the [[Rajaji National Park]] (RNP), the [[Muslim Gujjar (Uttar Pradesh)|Van Gujjars]] in Deharadun were asked to shift to a resettlement colony at Pathari near Hardwar. In 1992, when the Van Gujjars returned to the foothills, the RNP authorities tried to block them from the park area. The community fought back and finally the forest authorities had to relent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
