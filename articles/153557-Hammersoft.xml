''' Philip David Charles''' &quot;'''Phil'''&quot; '''Collins''', [[Royal Victorian Order|LVO]] (born 30 January 1951)&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births MAR 1951 5e 137 EALING â Philip D. C. Collins, mmn = Strange&lt;/ref&gt; is&lt;!--Please Don't replace with &quot;was&quot;, as Collins is not dead--&gt; an English singer-songwriter, drummer, pianist and actor best known as a drummer and vocalist for British [[progressive rock]] group [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and as a solo artist.

Collins sang the lead vocals on several chart hits in the United Kingdom and the United States between 1978 and 1994, either as a solo artist or with Genesis. His singles, often dealing with lost love, ranged from the drum-heavy &quot;[[In the Air Tonight]]&quot;, dance pop of &quot;[[Sussudio]]&quot;, piano-driven &quot;[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)|Against All Odds]]&quot;, to the political statements of &quot;[[Another Day in Paradise]]&quot;.

Collins's professional music career began as a drummer, first with [[Flaming Youth (band)|Flaming Youth]] and then more famously with Genesis. In Genesis, Collins originally supplied backing vocals for front man [[Peter Gabriel]], singing lead on only two songs: &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; from 1971's ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' album and &quot;More Fool Me&quot; from ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'', which was released in 1973. Following Gabriel's departure in 1975, Collins became the group's lead singer.

His solo career, heavily influenced by his personal life, brought both him and Genesis [[List of best-selling music artists|commercial success]]. According to [[Atlantic Records]], Collins's total worldwide sales as a solo artist, as of 2000, were 150&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Phil Collins Celebrates TESTIFY with Weekend Today Performance and NYC In-Store&quot;, Atlantic Records press release. 15 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Collins has won numerous music awards throughout his career, including seven [[Grammy Awards]], five [[Brit Awards]]âwinning Best British Male three times, an [[Academy Award]], and two [[Golden Globes]] for his solo work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/phil-collins Brit Awards: Phil Collins] Brits.co.uk.

Retrieved 24 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Genesis in 2010.

Collins is one of only three recording artists (along with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Michael Jackson]]) who have sold over 100&amp;nbsp;million albums worldwide both as solo artists and (separately) as principal members of a band.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of best-selling music artists]] for information and references of sales figures.&lt;/ref&gt; When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, Collins had more top 40 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart during the 1980s than any other artist.&lt;ref name=Top&gt;{{Cite news |first= John |last= Anderson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Pop Notes |url= |work=Newsday  |publisher=|date= 7 January 1990 |accessdate=23 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Collins was ranked the 22nd most successful artist on the &quot;[[Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists|The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-artists-20.shtml | title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart 50th Anniversary |work=Billboard| accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Collins was born in [[Chiswick]], London, England, the son of June, a theatrical agent, and Greville Philip Austin Collins, an insurance agent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/49/Phil-Collins.html |title=Phil Collins Biography (1951-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; though official records state his mother to be Winifred M. Strange.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Marriages SEP 1934 3a 706 BRENTFORD â Grevelle Collins to Winifred M. Strange&lt;/ref&gt; He was given a toy drum kit for Christmas when he was five. Later, his uncle made him a makeshift one that he used regularly. As Collins grew older these were followed by more complete sets bought by his parents.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Ray.

==Early career==
His professional training began at fourteen when he entered Barbara Speake Stage School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesis-music.com/face1.htm Face Value] at the Official Genesis Biography. Retrieved 10 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He began a career as a [[child actor]] and model, and won his first major role as [[The Artful Dodger]] in the London production of ''[[Oliver!]]''. He was an extra in [[The Beatles]]' ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', one of hundreds of screaming teenagers during the TV concert sequence and seen fleetingly in a close-up. He was also in ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' as one of the children who storms the castle at the end of the movie, but it was cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chittybangbang.com/chittybangbang-film.html Film details] at chittybangbang.com. Retrieved 21 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He also auditioned for the role of Romeo in ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1968),&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; a role won by fellow Artful Dodger actor, [[Leonard Whiting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_o/oliver.htm |title=The Guide to Musical Theatre |publisher=The Guide to Musical Theatre |date= |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Collins was among the last three finalists for the role of I.Q. on the American children's television show ''[[The Bugaloos]]'' (he lost out to English actor/musician [[John McIndoe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0570551|John McIndoe}}. Retrieved 17 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the beginnings of an acting career, Collins continued to gravitate towards music. While attending [[Chiswick Community School]] he formed a band called The Real Thing and later joined The Freehold. With the latter group, he wrote his first song titled &quot;Lying Crying Dying&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewitt official UK site bio&quot;&gt;Hewitt, Alan. [http://www.philcollins.co.uk/biog1.htm Biography] at Collins' official website (UK). Retrieved 9 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins's first record deal came as drummer for [[Flaming Youth (band)|Flaming Youth]] who released a single album, ''[[Ark 2]]'' (1969). A [[concept album]] inspired by the recent media attention surrounding the moon landing, ''Ark 2'' (with [[Ronnie Caryl]], Brian Chatton and Gordon (Flash) Smith), failed to make much commercial success despite positive critical reviews. ''[[Melody Maker]]'' featured the album as &quot;Pop Album of the Month&quot;, describing it as &quot;adult music beautifully played with nice tight harmonies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; The album's main single, &quot;From Now On&quot;, failed on the radio. After a year of touring, band tensions and the lack of commercial success dissolved the group. In 1970, the 19-year old Collins played percussion on the [[George Harrison]] song &quot;[[All Things Must Pass|The Art of Dying]]&quot;. Harrison credited him in the liner notes to the remastered CD version of the album released in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgeharrison.com/atmp/ The Official George Harrison website]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis era==
{{Main|Genesis (band)}}
In 1970, Collins answered a ''[[Melody Maker]]'' [[classified advertising|classified ad]] for &quot;...a drummer sensitive to [[acoustic music]], and acoustic [[twelve-string guitar]]ist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis placed the ad after having already lost three drummers over two albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;billbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?&amp;cr=artist&amp;or=ASCENDING&amp;sf=length&amp;pid=4704&amp;kw=Genesis &quot;Genesis&quot; Biography], Billboard.com. Accessed 16 January 2006. ]&lt;/ref&gt; The audition occurred at the home of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s parents. Prospective candidates performed tracks from the group's second album, ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970). Collins arrived early, listened to the other auditions while swimming in Gabriel's parents' pool, and memorised the pieces before his turn.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Genesis-Land-of-confusion-single-cover.jpg|thumb|The music video for &quot;[[Land of Confusion]]&quot; featured the members of Genesis in puppet form, with the single cover (parodying the ''[[With the Beatles]]'' album and using puppets from the satirical TV show ''[[Spitting Image]]'').]]

Collins won the audition. ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' was released a year later. Although his role remained primarily that of drummer and backing vocalist for the next five years, he twice sang lead vocals: once on &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; (from ''Nursery Cryme'') and once on &quot;More Fool Me&quot; (from ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'').

In 1974, while Genesis were recording the concept album ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', [[Brian Eno]] (who is credited with &quot;Enossification&quot; for electronic vocal effects on the track &quot;Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging&quot;) needed a drummer for his album ''[[Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson117&quot;&gt;Thompson, 2004. p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Collins was sent to fill the gap, and played drums in lieu of payment for Eno's work with the band.

In 1975, following the final tour supporting the album ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'', Gabriel left the group to pursue a solo career. Collins became lead vocalist after a lengthy but ultimately fruitless search for Gabriel's replacement (where he sang back up with the over 400 hopefuls that reportedly auditioned).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/collins_phil/artist.jhtml |title=Phil Collins &amp;#124; Music Videos, News, Photos, Tour Dates, Ringtones, and Lyrics |publisher=MTV |date= |accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, the group recruited former [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[King Crimson]] drummer [[Bill Bruford]] to play drums during live shows, although Collins continued to play during longer instrumental sections. Bruford's drumming can be heard on the track &quot;[[The Cinema Show]]&quot; on the live album ''[[Seconds Out]]''. He was soon replaced by ex-[[Frank Zappa]] band member [[Chester Thompson]], who became a mainstay of the band's live line-up. Collins, however, continued to play drums on all of the band's studio recordings.

The first album with Collins as lead vocalist, 1976's ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]'', reached the American Top 40, and peaked high as #3 on the UK charts. Said ''Rolling Stone'', &quot;Genesis has managed to turn the possible catastrophe of Gabriel's departure into their first broad-based American success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Kris. [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/genesis/albums/album/215190/rid/5941181/ ''A Trick of the Tail'' review]. ''Rolling Stone''. 20 May 1976. Retrieved 10 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the recording of Genesis's next album ''[[Wind and Wuthering]]'' guitarist Steve Hackett left the group to pursue his own solo career. The group decided to continue as a trio for recording with [[Mike Rutherford]] playing guitar and bass in the studio, although the lineup was regularly augmented by Chester Thompson and American guitarist [[Daryl Stuermer]] for concert tours.

Collins simultaneously performed in a jazz fusion group called [[Brand X]]. The band recorded their first album, ''[[Unorthodox Behaviour]]'', with Collins as drummer, but because Genesis was Collins's priority, there were several Brand X tours and albums without him. Collins credits Brand X as his first use of a drum machine as well as his first use of a home [[8-track tape]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philcollins.co.uk/brandxgigs.htm Official Brand X biography] from the Phil Collins website. Retrieved 14 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins also performed on [[Steve Hackett]]'s first solo album, ''[[Voyage of the Acolyte]]'', on which he sang lead vocals and played drums.

As the decade closed, Genesis began a shift from their [[progressive rock]] roots and toward more accessible, radio-friendly pop-rock music. The album ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'' featured their first UK Top 10 and US Top 40 single, &quot;[[Follow You Follow Me]]&quot;.

In the 1980s, while Collins developed as a songwriter and established a parallel career as a solo artist, Genesis recorded a series of highly successful albums including ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'', ''[[Abacab]]'', ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]'', and ''[[Invisible Touch]]''. The latter album's title track reached #1 on the American ''Billboard'' singles chart, the only Genesis song to do so. The group received an MTV &quot;Video of the Year&quot; nomination in 1987 for the single &quot;[[Land of Confusion]]&quot; (which featured puppet caricatures created by the British satirical team ''[[Spitting Image]]'') but lost out to Peter Gabriel's solo hit, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MTV.com.

Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewitt official UK site bio&quot; /&gt; The last studio album with him as the lead singer was 1991's ''[[We Can't Dance]]''. He and Gabriel reunited with other Genesis members in 1999 to re-record &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; for Genesis's ''[[Turn It on Again: The Hits]]''. When in the mid-2000s discussions of a possible Genesis reunion arose, Collins stated that he would prefer to return as the drummer, with Gabriel handling the vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Corinne.

Retrieved 14 January 2006. {{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[Turn It On Again: The Tour]] was announced for 2007, with the Collins/Rutherford/Banks line-up.

In March 2010, [[Phish]] guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]] was asked to pay tribute to Genesis, one of his favourite bands, upon being inducted into the [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]]. In addition to Anastasio's speech, Phish appeared and performed two Genesis songs, &quot;[[Watcher of the Skies]]&quot; and &quot;[[No Reply At All]]&quot;. Collins and his Genesis band-mates (minus Peter Gabriel) attended the ceremony but they did not perform.

==Solo career==
===Early solo recordings (1981â1983)===
The dominant theme running through Collins's early solo recordings (although never specifically mentioned in his songs) was the acrimonious breakdown of his first marriage and then-recent divorce. Two songs he wrote on the Genesis album ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'', &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot;, and the Top 20 hit &quot;Misunderstanding&quot;, dealt with failed relationships. One year earlier, he had played drums and sung backing vocals on [[John Martyn (singer)|John Martyn]]'s ''[[Grace and Danger]]'', an album whose main theme is also marriage break-up. With the recording of his first solo album, ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'', Collins attributed his divorce as his main influence,&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, F. ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits''. Billboard Books, New York. 2003. p.604. ISBN 0-8230-7641-5&lt;/ref&gt; as can be inferred from songs such as &quot;[[If Leaving Me Is Easy]]&quot;.
{{listen

 | title = &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;
 | description = &quot;[[In the Air Tonight]]&quot; from ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981), was the first single of Collins' solo career.}}
Collins made his live debut as a solo performer, appearing at the invitation of producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] at the [[Amnesty International]] benefit show, ''The Policeman's Other Ball'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]] in London in September 1981, performing two songs from ''Face Value'' including &quot;[[In the Air Tonight]]&quot; and &quot;The Roof is Leaking&quot; accompanying himself on piano. ''Face Value'' became a surprise international success topping the charts in at least seven countries and hitting the top ten of the [[Billboard 200]] eventually going triple-platinum in the US. Hits from the album included &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, &quot;[[I Missed Again]]&quot; and &quot;If Leaving Me Is Easy&quot;. In 1982, he produced [[ABBA]] member [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Frida]]'s solo album, ''[[Something's Going On]]'', which helped to spawn the title track, &quot;[[I Know There's Something Going On]]&quot;, which became a hit.

Much like ''Face Value'', many of the songs from Collins's 1982 follow-up album, ''[[Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)|Hello, I Must Be Going!]]'', came from Collins's marital problems with his first wife such as &quot;[[I Don't Care Anymore]]&quot; and &quot;Do You Know and Do You Care&quot;. Collinsâs early albums had a dark presence, usually heavy on the drums. Regarding ''Face Value'', he says, &quot;I had a wife, two children, two dogs, and the next day I didn't have anything. So a lot of these songs were written because I was going through these emotional changes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, D. ''Turn It On Again: Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, and Genesis'', Back Beat Books. San Francisco. 2004. p.181. ISBN 0-87930-810-9&lt;/ref&gt; There were occasional poppier influencesâ''Face Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, for example, was a jazzy remake of a Genesis song he co-wrote. ''Face Value'' was a critical and multi-platinum success, and saw Collinsâs profile increase further. ''Hello, I Must Be Going!'' gave him a UK #1 for his cover of [[The Supremes]]' &quot;[[You Can't Hurry Love]]&quot;. The album went triple-platinum in the United States, like its predecessor. The Supremes' cover was his first Top 10 US hit (it also hit the Top 10 of Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart). The album also reached #2 on the UK album chart, spending well over a year there.

Two years before, Collins had played drums on Peter Gabriel's third self-titled record (often referred to as ''[[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|Melt]]''), the first record to feature the &quot;[[gated reverb]]&quot; sound, which was used on the song &quot;Intruder&quot;. Gabriel reportedly &quot;didn't want any metal on the record&quot; and asked Collins to leave his cymbals at home, to concentrate on the sound of his kit more heavily than usual. Studio engineer [[Hugh Padgham]] augmented the drum sound by using a microphone normally intended for studio communication rather than recording and feeding it through a signal processor called a [[noise gate]]. This allowed the reverberation added to the drums to be suddenly cut off before it naturally decayed. The result was the arresting &quot;gated reverb&quot; which became Collins signature sound. This was the same 'big drum sound' used on such songs as &quot;[[In The Air Tonight]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mama (Genesis song)|Mama]]&quot; by Genesis, and Frida's &quot;There's Something Going On&quot;.

Collins changed his musical style with the release of the ballad, &quot;[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]&quot;, which was the theme song to [[Against All Odds (film)|the movie of the same name]] in 1984. The more pop-friendly and radio-accessible single became Collins's first solo single to reach number-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Later that year, Collins contributed to production on [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] singer [[Phillip Bailey]]'s debut album, ''[[Chinese Wall (album)|''Chinese Wall'']]'', collaborating with Bailey on the hit duet, &quot;[[Easy Lover]]&quot;. Collins featured on [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s &quot;[[Do They Know It's Christmas]]&quot;, he played drums and sang on the song. Collins released his most successful album, ''[[No Jacket Required]]'', in early 1985. It contained the hits &quot;[[Sussudio]]&quot;, &quot;[[One More Night (Phil Collins song)|One More Night]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Lose My Number]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Take Me Home (Phil Collins song)|Take Me Home]]&quot;, as well as the less known yet equally robust &quot;Who Said I Would&quot;, and &quot;Only You Know and I Know&quot;. The album featured [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Helen Terry]] and ex-bandmate [[Peter Gabriel]] as backing vocalists. He also recorded the successful song &quot;[[Separate Lives]]&quot;, a duet with [[Marilyn Martin]], and an American number one, for the movie ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]''. Collins had three American number one songs in 1985, the most by any artist that year.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, John. ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''. Billboard Books, New York. 2000. pp.143â144. ISBN 0-8230-7690-3&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Jacket Required'' went on to win several [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] awards including Album of the Year.

''No Jacket Required'' received criticism that the album was too safe, despite its upbeat reviews and commercial success. A positive review by David Fricke of ''Rolling Stone'' ended, &quot;After years on the art-rock fringe, Collins has established himself firmly in the middle of the road. Perhaps he should consider testing himself and his new fans' expectations next time around.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fricke, D. [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/philcollins/albums/album/245563/rid/5941462/ ''No Jacket Required'' review]. ''Rolling Stone''. 9 May 1985. Retrieved 8 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sussudio&quot; also drew criticism for sounding too similar to [[Prince (artist)|Prince]]'s &quot;1999&quot;, a charge that Collins did not deny.&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, p.611.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the album went straight to #1 in the US and UK. In 1985, Collins was invited by Bob Geldof to perform at the [[Live Aid]] charity event. Collins had the distinction of being the only performer to appear at both the UK concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and the US concert at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium|JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. He accomplished this by performing early in the day at Wembley as both a solo artist and alongside [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], then transferring to a [[Concorde]] flight to the US enabling him to perform his solo material, and drum for [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Eric Clapton]] in Philadelphia. While being a guest on major artists' hit recordings, Collins continued to enjoy solo success even while on tour with Genesis, besides from his number-one duet with Marilyn Martin in 1986, Collins would score two more hits from movies with the singles, &quot;[[Two Hearts (song)|Two Hearts]]&quot; (1988) and &quot;[[Groovy Kind of Love]]&quot; (1988), the latter two from the soundtrack of his feature film, ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]''.

In 1989, Collins produced another successful album, ''[[...But Seriously]]'', featuring the anti-[[homelessness]] anthem &quot;[[Another Day in Paradise]]&quot;, with [[David Crosby]] on backing vocals. (Collins later went on to co-write, sing and play on the song &quot;Hero&quot; on Crosby's 1993 album ''[[Thousand Roads]]''.) &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; went to Number 1 on the [[Billboard Charts]] at the end of 1989 and won Collins a Grammy for Record of the Year (1990). In the process, it became the last #1 US pop hit of the 1980s. The album ''...But Seriously'' became the first #1 US album of the 1990s. Other songs included &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot; (#4 US, #15 UK), &quot;[[Do You Remember? (Phil Collins song)|Do You Remember?]]&quot; (not released in the UK, but a #4 hit in the US), and &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot; (the latter featuring Clapton on guitar) (#3 US, #7 UK). Songs about [[apartheid]] and homelessness demonstrated Collinsâs turn to politically-driven material. This theme recurred on his later albums. A live album, ''[[Serious Hits... Live!]]'', followed.

===Later solo work and Genesis reunion (1993â2008)===
Collins's record sales began to drop with the 1993 release of ''[[Both Sides]]'', a largely experimental album that, according to Collins, included songs that &quot;were becoming so personal, so private, I didn't want anyone else's input&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring a less polished sound and fewer up-tempo songs than his previous albums, ''Both Sides'' was a significant departure. Collins used no backing musicians, performed all the vocal and instrumental parts at his home studio, and used rough vocal takes for the final product. The album was not well received by radio. Its two biggest hits were &quot;Both Sides of the Story&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot;. Collins worked on the album completely independently of his record company, and took them by surprise when he delivered them a completed album that they were unaware he was making.

Collins officially parted ways with Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career (Genesis would produce one album without Collinsâ''[[...Calling All Stations...]]''âbefore going on hiatus). Collins attempted a return to pop music with ''[[Dance into the Light]]'', which ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewed by saying that &quot;(e)ven Phil Collins must know that we all grew weary of Phil Collins&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, David. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,294844_4_0_,00.html ''Dance into the Light'' review]. ''Entertainment Weekly''. 1 November 1996. Retrieved 10 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It included minor hits such as the title track and [[The Beatles]]-inspired &quot;It's in Your Eyes&quot;. Although the album went Gold in the US, it sold considerably less than his previous albums. Despite this, the subsequent tour regularly sold out arenas.

In 1996, Collins formed [[The Phil Collins Big Band]]. With Collins as drummer, the band performed [[jazz]] renditions of various Collins and Genesis hits. The Phil Collins Big Band did a world tour in 1998 that included a performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. In 1999, the group released the CD ''[[A Hot Night in Paris]]'' including big band versions of &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, &quot;Sussudio&quot;, and the more obscure &quot;The Los Endos Suite&quot; from ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]''.

A compilation album ''[[Hits (Phil Collins album)|...Hits]]'' was released in 1998 and sold very well, returning Collins to multi-platinum status in America. The album's sole new track, a cover of the [[Cyndi Lauper]] hit &quot;[[True Colors (song)|True Colors]]&quot;, received considerable play on US Adult Contemporary stations while peaking at #2.&lt;ref name=&quot;billchart&quot;&gt;''Billboard'' magazine, [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=4332&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=555318 Phil Collins Chart History]. Retrieved 13 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Collins's earlier hits (e.g. &quot;I Missed Again&quot;, &quot;If Leaving Me Is Easy&quot;, etc.) and other successes were not included in this compilation.

Collins's next single, &quot;[[You'll Be in My Heart]]&quot;, from the Disney animated movie ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'', spent 19 weeks at #1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart â the longest time ever up to that point. The song won Collins an [[Academy Award for Best Song]]. It was his third nomination in the songwriters category, after being nominated in 1985 and 1989. Collins was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], on 16 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hwof.com/star/recording/phil-collins/333 Phil Collins: The Hollywood Walk of Fame] Retrieved 2010-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phil Collins Barcelona.jpg|thumb|left|Collins performing in [[Barcelona]], Spain in July 2004]]

In 2002 Collins released ''[[Testify (Phil Collins album)|Testify]]''. [[Metacritic]]'s roundup of album reviews found this record to be the worst-reviewed album at the time of its release, though it has since been &quot;surpassed&quot; by three more recent releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;metacritic&quot;&gt;Metacritic, [http://www.metacritic.com/music/bests/ All-Time High and Low Scores]. Retrieved 17 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The album's &quot;[[Can't Stop Loving You]]&quot; (a [[Leo Sayer]] cover) was yet another #1 Adult Contemporary smash hit for Collins. ''Testify'' sold 140,000 copies in the United States by year's end, although a successful worldwide tour followed.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year Collins accepted an invitation to drum for the &quot;house band&quot;  at a concert celebrating [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Golden Jubilee]].  In 2003 announced his last solo tour&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hear-it.org/page.dsp?page=2649 Hear-it.org]. Retrieved 13 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; â the &quot;First Final Farewell Tour&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the multiple farewell tours of other popular artists. In 2006 he worked with [[Disney]] on a Broadway production of ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'', a musical which received generally mixed reviews. In 2007 Collins reunited with his Genesis bandmates [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and [[Mike Rutherford]] for [[Turn It On Again: The Tour]], a tour of Europe and North America. During the tour Genesis performed at the [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth]] concert at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Following the band's performance, presenter [[Jonathan Ross]] had to apologise to viewers watching the televised version as Collins had used a swear word while singing &quot;[[Invisible Touch (song)|Invisible Touch]]&quot;.

===''Going Back'' and retirement (2009â2011)===
In October 2009, it was reported that Collins was to record a [[Going Back (album)|Motown covers album]]. He told a German newspaper, &quot;I want the songs to sound exactly like the originals&quot;, and that the album would feature up to 30 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=9314_Phil_Collins_To_Record_Motown_Covers_Album |title=Phil Collins To Record Motown Covers Album &amp;#124; undercover.com.au, Music, News, Entertainment |publisher=Undercover.com.au |date=24 October 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, Chester Thompson said that the album had been completed and would be released some time soon. He also revealed that Collins managed to play the drums on the album despite the adverse effects of his recent spinal operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FC_gwdMTgM |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first solo album Collins had recorded which consisted entirely of songs written by other people.

''[[Going Back (album)|Going Back]]'' was released on 13 September 2010, entering the UK charts at number 4, rising to number one the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11416660 |title=BBC Entertainment News | date=27 September 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early summer 2010, Collins played six concerts entirely dedicated to the music from ''Going Back''. These included a special programme, ''Phil Collins: One Night Only'', which was broadcast on [[ITV1]] on 18 September 2010.

As of January 2011, Collins has spent 1,730 weeks in German music charts â 766 weeks of them with Genesis albums and singles and 964 weeks with solo releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-control.de/phil-collins-1730-wochen-in-den-charts.html |title=Phil Collins: 1.730 Wochen in den Charts - media control |publisher=Media-control.de |date=2011-01-24 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing health problems and other concerns, Collins announced on 4 March 2011 that he was taking time off from his career, prompting widespread reports of his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8360584/Phil-Collins-calls-time-on-music-career.html | title=Phil Collins calls time on music career | newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 March 2011 | accessdate=4 March 2011 | location=London | first=Murray | last=Wardrop}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, on 7 March, his UK representative told the press, &quot;He is not, has no intention of, retiring.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomeo, Joey.

==Drums and other equipment==
Phil Collins uses [[Gretsch]] drums and [[Sabian]] cymbals.
Drums (all single headed concert toms except for the snare): 20&quot; Bass Drum, 18&quot; Floor Tom, 16&quot; Floor Tom, 15&quot; Mounted Tom, 12&quot; Tom, 10&quot; Tom, 8&quot; Tom, 14&quot;x4&quot; Snare, 14&quot; Phil Collins Special.

Until 1986, Collins played [[Paiste]] and [[Zildjian]] cymbals. Other drums he's used over the years are [[Premier Percussion|Premier]], [[Noble &amp; Cooley]], [[Pearl Drums|Pearl]], [[Simmons (electronic drum company)|Simmons]] and [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] drums. He uses a Ludwig Speed King pedal and Pro Mark sticks.

Other instruments which have become synonymous with Collins's sound (particularly in his post-1978 Genesis and subsequent solo career) include the [[Roland CR-78]] and [[Roland TR-808]] drum machines, [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]] synthesizer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Films, theatre and television==
The majority of Collins's film work has been through music. Four of his seven American number one songs came from film soundtracks, and his work on Disney's ''Tarzan'' earned him an Oscar. Collins even sang German, Italian, Spanish and French versions of the Tarzan soundtrack for the respective film versions. Collins's acting career has been brief. As a child, he appeared in three films, although two of the films were for brief moments as an extra. Besides the aforementioned ''A Hard Day's Night'' (1964), Collins's first lead role was in a children's film ''[[Calamity the Cow]]'' (1967).

Collins wrote and performed the title song to ''[[Against All Odds (film)|Against All Odds]]'' in 1984. The song became the first of his seven American number one songs and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song. Collins was not invited to perform the song at that year's presentation, although he was in the audience as the song's composer. Collins had arranged his US tour to accommodate the possibility of appearing on the telecast in the event his song was nominated for an Oscar. It is believed that the producers of that year's Academy Awards show were not aware of his prominence as a musical performer. A note to Collins's label from telecast co-producer [[Larry Gelbart]] explaining the lack of invitation stated, &quot;Thank you for your note regarding ''Phil Cooper'' (emphasis added). I'm afraid the spots have already been filled&quot;. Collins instead watched [[Ann Reinking]] perform his song.&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, p.586.&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time afterwards, he would introduce his performance of &quot;Against All Odds&quot; at his concerts by saying: &quot;Miss Ann Reinking's not here tonight, so I guess I'll have to sing my own song&quot;.

As a vocalist, Collins sang [[Stephen Bishop (musician)|Stephen Bishop]]'s composition &quot;Separate Lives&quot; for the film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' (1985) as a duet with [[Marilyn Martin]]. The single of the recording became another number one hit for Collins. The song itself was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song (a category that honours the composer, not the vocalists). Bishop's song had parallels to some of the songs on Collins's first two albums. Writer [[Stephen Bishop (musician)|Stephen Bishop]] noted that he was inspired by a failed relationship and called &quot;Separate Lives&quot; &quot;a song about anger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, p.624.&lt;/ref&gt; When the song was being nominated for an Academy Award, in interviews about the original snub by the Academy for &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, Collins would jokingly say &quot;the hell with him â I'm going up too,&quot; referring to if Bishop's song were to win the award.&lt;ref name=Dallas&gt;{{Cite news |first= Stephen |last= Williams |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= A Phil Collins Special And `Miami Vice' on Record |url= |work=Newsday  |publisher=|date= 4 October 1985 |accessdate=22 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins's first film role since becoming a musician came in 1988 with ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' about the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]], which took place in England in the 1960s. The movie received good reviews and Collins contributed four songs to the film's soundtrack. His rendition of &quot;[[Groovy Kind of Love]]&quot;, originally a 1966 single by [[The Mindbenders]], with lyrics by [[Toni Wine]] and music by [[Carole Bayer Sager]], but with the melody of the Rondo section of Muzio Clementi's &quot;Sonatina in G major&quot;, op. 36 no. 5 reached number one. The film also spawned the hit single &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, which he wrote in collaboration with legendary [[Motown]] songwriter [[Lamont Dozier]]; the two artists would go on to win a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe for Best Original Song]] and receive an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination in the same category, the second such honour for Collins; &quot;Big Noise&quot;, written by Phil Collins and Lamont Dozier, which included Collins on vocals (although the song was not released as a single, an instrumental version of this song appeared as the [[B-side]] to the single version of &quot;A Groovy Kind Of Love&quot;.) The final song, &quot;[[Loco In Acapulco]]&quot;, was another collaboration between him and Dozier, with the vocals performed by the legendary Motown group [[The Four Tops]]. Movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] said the role of Buster was &quot;played with surprising effectiveness&quot; by Collins, although the film's soundtrack proved more successful than the movie did.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, R. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19881125/REVIEWS/811250301/1023 ''Buster'' review]. 25 November 1988. Retrieved 10 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MukLukBalto.jpg|thumb|left|Collins provided the voices to both Muk and Luk in the 1995 animated feature ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]''.]]

Collins had cameo appearances in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991) and the AIDS docudrama ''[[And the Band Played On (film)|And the Band Played On]]'' (1993). He starred in 1993's ''[[Frauds (film)|Frauds]]'', which competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;festival-cannes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2570/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Frauds |accessdate=18 August 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supplied voices to two animated features: Amblin's ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]'' (1995) and Disney's ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]'' (2003). A long-discussed but never completed project was a movie titled ''[[The Three Bears]]''; originally meant to star him alongside [[Danny DeVito]] and [[Bob Hoskins]], he often mentioned the film, though an appropriate script never materialised.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G. A. [http://www.philcollins.co.uk/penthouse93.htm ''Penthouse'' interview], 1993. Retrieved 13 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins performed the soundtrack to the animated film ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999) for [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Collins won an [[Academy Award]] for &quot;[[You'll Be in My Heart]]&quot;, which he performed at that year's telecast as well as during a Disney-themed [[Super Bowl]] halftime show. The song, which he also recorded in Spanish among other languages, became his only appearance on Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;billchart&quot;/&gt; Disney hired him, along with [[Tina Turner]], in 2003 for the soundtrack to another animated feature film, ''[[Brother Bear]]'', and had some airplay with the song &quot;Look Through My Eyes&quot;.

On television, he twice hosted the ''Billboard Music Awards''. He also appeared in an episode of the series ''[[Miami Vice]]'', entitled &quot;Phil the Shill&quot;, in which he plays a cheating con-man. He also guest starred in several sketches with ''[[The Two Ronnies]]''. Most recently, he had a cameo appearance on the television series ''[[Whoopi]]''.

In 2001, Collins was sought out by the satirist Chris Morris, and appeared in the [[Brass Eye]] '[[Paedophile]] Special' endorsing a spoof charity called '[[Nonce (slang)|Nonce]] Sense'. At one point Collins, dressed in a matching baseball cap and t-shirt emblazoned with the name of this fictitious charity, stares into the camera and declares: &quot;I'm talking Nonce-sense.&quot;

In 2005, Collins's work on ''[[Brother Bear]]'' was expanded as Disney used the song &quot;Welcome&quot; as the theme for [[Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams]], the main parade celebrating the 50th Anniversary of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]].

In 2006 Disney's ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'' was adapted for Broadway. Collins contributed 11 new songs and instrumental pieces, and was deeply involved in the production. Unlike the movie, where Collins sang all the material, the characters sang on stage.

[[File:Philcollinsvcs.PNG|thumb|right|Phil Collins as he appears in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]'']]

Collins made an appearance as himself in the 2006 [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]'', set in 1984. He appears in three missions in which the main character must save him from a gang that is trying to kill him, the final mission occurring during his concert, where the player must defend the scaffolding against saboteurs while Phil is simultaneously performing &quot;In The Air Tonight.&quot; After this, the player is given the opportunity to watch this performance of 'In the Air Tonight.' &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot; was also featured in the soundtrack of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]'' and it was also featured in the movie ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters]]'', the 2009 movie ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' and the 2007 ''[[Gorilla (Cadbury)|Gorilla]]'' commercial for Cadbury's [[Dairy Milk]] chocolate. The advertisement also helped the song re-enter the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart at number three in July 2008, the following week reaching number one, beating its original 1981 #6 peak. Phil Collins had several ties to the hit show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' with 5 songs used in the course of the series as well as having starred in the episode &quot;Phil The Shill.&quot;

Phil Collins was portrayed in the hit cartoon ''[[South Park]]'' in the episode &quot;[[Timmy 2000]]&quot; holding his Oscar throughout, referring to his 1999 win for &quot;[[You'll Be In My Heart]]&quot;, which defeated &quot;[[Blame Canada]]&quot; from [[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]].  He was seen again in the episode &quot;[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime]]&quot;.

Phil Collins appears briefly in the Finnish animated sitcom ''[[Pasila]]'' in the episode &quot;Phil Collins Hangover&quot;. The music of this episode is a pastiche of Phil Collins' &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Fortune===
Collins was estimated to have a fortune of Â£115 million in the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' of 2011, making him one of the 20 richest people in the British music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/celebrity/article.html?in_article_id=532417&amp;in_page_id=181 | title= The top 50 richest people in music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court case===
{{Main|Phillip Collins Ltd v Davis}}
On 29 March 2000, Phil Collins launched a case against two former musicians from his band to recoup $780,000 (Â£500,000) in royalties that were overpaid. Louis Satterfield, 62, and Rahmlee Davis, 51, claimed their contract entitled them to 0.5 per cent of the royalties from ''[[Serious Hits... Live!]]'', a live album recorded during Collins's [[Seriously, Live! World Tour]] tour in 1990. Their claim was they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/phil-collins-sues-backing-band-to-reclaim-overpaid-royalties-723775.html | title= Phil Collins sues backing band to reclaim 'overpaid' royalties' | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Kate | last=Watson-Smyth | date=30 March 2000 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of asking for a return of what Collins considered overpayment, he sought to recoup the funds by withholding future royalties to Satterfield and Davis, which amounted to less than an annual sum of $20,000 (Â£12,500) each.

On 19 April 2000, the British High Court ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins. The amount that Collins was seeking was halved, and Satterfield and Davis (who originally brought the suit forward in California) would not have to repay any of it. The judge agreed with Collins's argument that Satterfield and Davis should have been paid for only the five tracks on which they performed, including the hit &quot;[[Sussudio]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/phil-collins-wins-claim-he-overpaid-musicians-721046.html | title= Phil Collins wins claim he overpaid musicians' | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Kate | last=Watson-Smyth | date=20 April 2000 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health problems===
Collins reported [[hearing impairment|losing his hearing]] in his right ear in 2000 due to a viral infection. In September 2009, it was reported that Collins could no longer play drums, due to a recent operation to repair dislocated vertebrae in his neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1212596/I-play-drums-says-Phil-Collins.html |title=I can never play the drums again, says Phil Collins &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=The Daily Mail |location=UK |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A statement from Collins on the Genesis band website said, &quot;There isn't any drama regarding my 'disability' and playing drums.  Somehow during the last Genesis tour I dislocated some vertebrae in my upper neck and that affected my hands.  After a successful operation on my neck, my hands still can't function normally.  Maybe in a year or so it will change, but for now it is impossible for me to play drums or piano.  I am not in any 'distressed' state; stuff happens in life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-music.com/news/news.php?uid=466 |title=Statement from Phil Collins |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091026045746/http://www.genesis-music.com/news/news.php?uid=466|archivedate=26 October 2009|publisher=Genesis-music.com |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Collins was appointed a [[Royal Victorian Order|Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order]] in 1994 in recognition of his work on behalf of the [[Prince's Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/53696/supplements/4 Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood], Supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' no. 53696, 11 June 1994, p.4. Accessed 10 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins has stated he is a supporter of [[animal rights]] and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA). In 2005, he donated an autographed drumstick in support of PETA's campaign against [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/c-philcollins.asp |title=Phil Collins | publisher=Kentucky Fried Cruelty |date= |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins also has a lifelong interest in [[the Alamo]].  He has collected hundreds of artefacts related to the famous 1836 battle in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Texas, narrated a light and sound show about the Alamo, and spoken at related events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michels|first=Patrick|title=Remembering the Alamo with Phil Collins|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2010/05/phil_collins_at_dallas_histori.php|publisher=Dallas Observer|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins has often been mentioned erroneously in the British media as being a supporter of the [[UK Conservative Party|Conservative Party]] and an opponent of the [[UK Labour Party|Labour Party]]. This derives from the famous article in ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', printed on the day of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 UK general election]], titled &quot;[[It's The Sun Wot Won It|If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights]]&quot;, which claimed that Collins was among several celebrities who were planning to leave Britain in the event of a Labour victory.{{Cn|date=November 2011}} Shortly before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]] (when Collins was living in Switzerland), [[Noel Gallagher]] is reported as saying: &quot;Vote Labour. If you don't and the Tories get in, Phil is threatening to come back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/observermusic/2007/10/the_10_rightwing_rockers.html | accessdate=11 October 2009 | work=The Observer | title=The 10: right-wing rockers|date= 13 October 2007|first=Luke|last=Bainbridge | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Collins has since stated that although he did once claim many years earlier that he might leave Britain if most of his income was taken in tax, which was [[UK Labour Party|Labour Party]] policy at that time for top earners, he has never been a [[UK Conservative Party|Conservative Party]] supporter and he left Britain for Switzerland in 1994 purely because he met a woman who lived there.  He said of Gallagher: âI donât care if he likes my music or not. I do care if he starts telling people Iâm a wanker because of my politics. Itâs an opinion based on an old misunderstood quote.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3808340.ece | title= Phil Collins casually serves notice of his retirement | work=The Times | location=London | first=Pete | last=Paphides | date=25 April 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his claim that he did not leave Britain for tax purposes, he was one of several super-rich figures living in tax havens who were singled out for criticism in a report by the charity [[Christian Aid]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tax-evasion-costs-lives-of-56m-children-826252.html | title= Tax evasion 'costs lives of 5.6m children' | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Sean | last=O'Grady | date=12 May 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioned about his politics by [[Mark Lawson]] in an interview broadcast in 2009, Collins said: &quot;My father was Conservative but it wasn't quite the same, I don't think, when he was alive. Politics never loomed large in our family anyway. I think the politics of the country were very different then.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Mark. &quot;Mark Lawson talks to... Phil Collins&quot;, BBC Four, 4 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins founded the '''Little Dreams Foundation''' in February 2000, which aims to &quot;realise the dreams of children in the fields of sports and art&quot; by providing future prodigies aged 4 to 16 years with financial, material, and mentoring support with the help of experts in various fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ldf.cc/EN/fondation/mot.html | title= Little Dreams Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins supports the South African charity The Topsy Foundation, which provides relief services to some of South Africa's most under-resourced rural communities through a multi-faceted approach to the consequences of HIV and AIDS and extreme poverty. He donates all royalties earned in South Africa to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thebody.com/content/art11481.html | title= Musician Phil Collins Donates Nearly $54,000 in South African Royalties to AIDS Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.budapestreport.com/2010/09/17/phil-collins-gives-money-away/ | title= Phil Collins gives money away | work=Budapest Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins is a patron of the charity Children in Hunger, a small UK based charity working to combat child poverty in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.metro.co.uk/news/46156-stars-line-up-to-scrawl-over-phil-collins#ixzz1KIfz0E2q | title= Stars line up to scrawl over Phil Collins | work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
