{{Expert-subject|Politics|date=April 2010}}
According to the &quot;[[Democracy Index]]&quot; (published by the ''[[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist]]'', a [[United Kingdom|British]] journal), the country in the [[Middle East]] with the highest Democracy Index score is [[Israel]], with a score of 7.48, corresponding to the status of &quot;flawed democracy&quot;; the only one in the region.
The next highest scores of countries of in the region are held by [[Lebanon]] (5.82) and [[Turkey]] (5.73), classified as &quot;hybrid regimes&quot;. Also in the &quot;hybrid regimes&quot; category are the [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Iraq]]. The remaining countries of the Middle East are categorized as [[authoritarian regime]]s, with scores below 2 held by [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].

Theories are diverse on the subject. Revisionist theories argue that democracy is incompatible with [[Islam]]ic [[Muslim culture|culture]] and values,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''What Went Wrong?: The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East''&lt;/ref&gt; others put forward the development in the conceptualisation of political practices. They argue that the lack of a clear cut difference between religion and the state stifles democracy in the region. On the other hand, &quot;post-colonial&quot; theories (such as those put forth by Edward Said) for the relative absence of [[liberal democracy]] in the Middle East are diverse, from the long history of imperial rule by the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[British Empire|Britain]] and [[French colonial empires|France]] and the contemporary political and military intervention by the [[United States]], all of which have been blamed for preferring authoritarian regimes because this simplifies the business environment, while enriching the governing elite and the companies of the imperial countries. Other explanations include the problem that most of the states in the region are [[rentier state]]s, which experience the theorized [[resource curse]].

The mainstream advances the innovative approach adopted by political actors in interpreting religious texts which underpins that a gradual political opening is more efficient to reach democracy. As claims about the impact of civil society in the democratization process was put forward by the political economy approaches, the post-positivist interpretation stresses the importance to consider the interplay between culture, identity and discourse in framing Middle East politics.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, N. ''Identity,Culture and Democratization:The Case of Egypt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, this article traces the history and assesses the current state and future prospects of democracy, democratic tendencies, and democratic movements in all countries in the broadly-defined Middle East region.

==Current state==
In light of resistance to democracy in much of the Arab world, observers such as [[Samuel Huntington]] have advocated the notion of a &quot;clash&quot; between Arab and Western civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Clash of civilizations Samuel P Huntington, ISBN 074323149X&lt;/ref&gt; This resistance even led to arguments such as &quot;Arab exceptionalism,&quot; a phase that prescribes that Arab nations are immune to economic modernization and democratization, or that these concepts form part of the &quot;clash&quot;. Huntington attributes to &quot;non-rational&quot; Islamic revivalism and Shi'a fundamentalism the lower likelihood of democratic development in Islamic countries.

Nevertheless, there are a number of pro-democracy movements in the Middle East.  A prominent figure in this movement is [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] who advocates and campaigns for democracy in Egypt and the wider region, working with the Ibn Khaldun Centre for Development Studies&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun Centre for Development Studies  http://www.eicds.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and serving on the Board of Advisors for the [[Project on Middle East Democracy]].

When asked about his thoughts regarding the current state of democracy in the region he said:

{{quote|People's memories... have become tuned or conditioned to thinking that the problems in the Middle East must be a chronic condition, not that they are only 30 years old, and not realizing that the reason for the current state of the Middle East was first, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and two, the Cold War.

The Cold War made the United States and other western democracies look the other way when it came to political oppression and allowed them to deal with tyrants and dictators.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Saad Eddin Ibrahim. March, 2005. http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.2/ibrahim_interview.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Middle East Forum]], a think tank based in Philadelphia, recently published their table for measurement of democracy within Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref&gt;The Middle East Forum, http://www.meforum.org/article/970#_ftn23&lt;/ref&gt; Their contention is that little has changed, post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]], 2001, and if anything the &quot;[[War on Terror]]&quot; has enabled many regimes to stifle democratic progress. The results showed very little progress from 1999-2005. The report even states that this pattern may be counter-productive to US interests, with Islamism being the only viable opposition to regimes in many Middle Eastern countries. As an additional measure of US attitudes towards the issue of Middle Eastern democratization, on 14 December 2006, the US Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice&lt;ref&gt;Rice discusses Middle East Democracy http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2006/ioi/061219-rice-democracy.html&lt;/ref&gt; stated that democracy in the Middle East was ânon-negotiable.â The reaction to this statement was positive from some; it was considered a warning by others {{Weasel-inline|date=March 2009}}.

Middle East scholar Louise Fawcett notes how the United Nations Development Programme's ''Arab Human Development Report 2002'', drafted by Western-educated Arab intellectuals, is modelled &quot;on universal democratic principles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L. (2005) ''International Relations in the Middle East'' Gosport: Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-926963-7  p 123&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fawcett argues that &quot;Constitutional democracy is viewed not only as an intrinsic good by the putative globalisers who drafted this Report; it is also an instrumental necessity if the region is to stop stagnating and begin to catch up with the rest of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L(2005) ''International Relations in the Middle East'' Gosport: Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-926963-7  p 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of democratic process varies widely from country to country.  A few countries, such as Saudi Arabia, do not claim to be democracies; however, most of the larger states claim to be democracies{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, although this claim is in most cases disputed{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

===Arab Socialism===
A number of [[republic]]s embracing [[Arab Socialism]], such as [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]], regularly hold [[election]]s, but critics assert that these are [[single-party state]]s or unfair [[dominant-party system]]s and not full [[multi-party system]]s. Most importantly they do not allow citizens to choose between different candidates for presidency election.&lt;ref&gt;[[Egypt]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Syria]]&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of modern Egypt has always given the president a virtual monopoly over the decision making process, devoting 30 articles (15 percent of the whole constitution) to presidential prerogatives. According to the constitution, the Egyptian president's powers are equivalent to those of the [[prime minister]] in parliamentary systems and to the president of the French [[Fifth Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MENA DEVELOPMENT REPORT&quot;&gt;MENA DEVELOPMENT REPORT, &quot;Better Governance for Development in the Middle East and North Africa&quot; The World bank, Washington, D.C. 2003,pg 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yemen]], [[Lebanon]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]], while also partly accepting this ideology, are generally considered more democratic than other states that do so, but the power of institutions in the latter two are limited by the domination of Syria and Israel, respectively.

===Absolute monarchy===
[[Absolute monarchy]] is more common in the Middle East than elsewhere, and even a number of kingdoms with parliaments have been claimed to fall broadly under this category. [[Saudi Arabia]] and most other kingdoms on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (except [[Yemen]]){{citation needed|date=March 2011}} are usually considered absolute monarchies. When one looks at the Arab states of the Middle East in comparison to countries around the world, the endurance of their authoritarian systems seems extraordinary. Although personalistic regimes have fallen throughout sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the Middle East displays a wealth of similarly corrupt dictatorships that remain in power. Yet long periods of political continuity in the region also contain significant episodes of contestation between rulers and proponents of change.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Prepstein Posusney, Michele Penner Angrist, eds. &quot;Authoritarianism in the Middle East: regimes and resistance&quot;[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], London, 2005,pg, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional monarchy===
[[Constitutional monarchy]] can be said to be at least partly embraced in some countries that are generally considered more democratic.  [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Morocco]], and [[Bahrain]] are examples of this category.

===Islamic governments===
The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 resulted in an electoral system (an Islamic Republic with a constitution), but the system has a limited democracy in practice. One of the main problems of [[Iran]]'s system is the consolidation of too much power in the hands of the [[Supreme Leader]] who is elected by [[Assembly of Experts]] for life (unless the [[Assembly of Experts]] decides to remove him which has never happened). Another main problem is the closed loop in the electoral system, the elected [[Assembly of Experts]] elect the [[Supreme Leader|Supreme Leader of Iran]], who appoints the members of the [[Guardian Council]], who in turn vet the candidates for all elections including the elections for [[Assembly of Experts]]. However some elections in Iran, as the election of city councils satisfies free and democratic election criteria to some extent. In other countries, the ideology (usually out of power) has fostered both pro-democratic and anti-democratic sentiments.  The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] is a moderate democratic Islamist party that has come to power in traditionally secular [[Turkey]].  Its moderate ideology has been compared to [[Christian Democracy]] in Europe.  The [[United Iraqi Alliance]], the winner of the recent elections in Iraq, is a coalition including many religious parties.

===Iran===
====History of political systems====
Historically Iranians were ruled by an [[absolute monarchy]] for [[History of Iran|several thousand years]], at least since the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550 B.C.E.) until the [[Constitutional Revolution of Iran|Constitutional Revolution]] in the early 20th century. The Constitutional Revolution in 1906 replaced the [[absolute monarchy]] with a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Persian Constitution of 1906|constitution]] went under several revisions during the following decades. During [[World War II]] Iran stayed neutral but in 1941 the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] (the [[USSR]] and [[Great Britain]]) [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|invaded]] Iran and replaced the Iran's Shah [[Reza Pahlavi]] (who was perceived as being pro-German) with his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] to protect their access to Iranian oil, and to secure routes to ship western military aid to the Soviet Union. [[Iran]]'s parliamentary government led by Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] was toppled in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'Ã©tat|1953 coup d'Ã©tat]] by royalist forces supported and funded by [[CIA]] and [[MI6]] after [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] nationalized Iranian oil. Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] became the preeminent leader in Iran, and instated [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] from military as the new Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Amin saikal and Albrecht Schnabel, &quot;Democratization in the Middle East&quot; United Nations University Press New York, 2003, pg.70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States]] considered Shah a close ally and Iran as its main base in the [[Middle East]]. Shah also tried to modernize Iran's economy and westernize Iran's culture. These and other policies contributed to alienating nationalists, leftists, and religious groups.

The monarchy was overthrown in the 1979 by the [[Iranian Revolution]], after which [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] was elected as Iran's [[Supreme Leader]] according to the new [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran]] which was adopted by a referendum in the same year. The constitution was modeled on the 1958 constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]] by the [[1st Assembly of Experts|Assembly of Experts for Constitution]] (who were elected by direct popular vote). The constitution received above 98% support in the [[Iranian Islamic Republic referendum, March 1979|1979 referendum]]. After [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s death, the [[Assembly of Experts]] (which is made of Islamic scholars elected by direct vote) appointed [[Ali Khamenei]] as the new [[Supreme Leader]]. The constitution was also amended through a [[Iranian constitutional referendum, 1989|referendum]] in 1989 with 97% support a few months before [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] passed away increasing the powers of [[Supreme Leader]]. Iran holds regular national elections by universal suffrage for all citizens (regardless of race, religion, or sex, who are of voting age) for electing the [[President of Iran|President]], members of [[Consultative Assembly of Iran|Parliament]], [[Assembly of Experts]], [[City and Village Councils of Iran|City and Village Councils]] where political parties support candidates.

====Issues with the current political system====
The current [[Islamic Republic of Iran|system of Iran]] was designed to allow Iranians to decide their future by themselves without being oppressed by authorities, but in practice only allows a limited democracy. One of the main problems of [[Iran]]'s system is the consolidation of too much power in the hands of the [[Supreme Leader]] who is elected by [[Assembly of Experts]] for life (unless the [[Assembly of Experts]] decides to remove him which has never happened). The powers of [[Supreme Leader]] under the [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] is almost unlimited and unrestricted in practice. This combined with the view that he is the representative of God held by some religious groups, being the head of the security and armed forces, and controlling the official state media (the radio and television are restricted to state radio and television) makes him immune from any kind of criticism and unchallengeable. Critics of the system or [[Supreme Leader]] are punished severely. Critical newspapers and political parties are closed, social and political activists like writers, journalists, human right activists, university students, union leaders, lawyers, and politicians are jailed for unreasonably long periods for making simple criticism against the [[Supreme Leader]], the Islamic Republic system, [[Islam]] and [[Shia]] doctrines, the government, and other officials. They have been even threatened by death sentence (though all such verdict in recent years have been dropped in higher courts in recent years) and some have been assassinated by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Ministry of Intelligence]] and militias in the past (no such case has been reported in recent years).

Another main problem is the closed loop in the electoral system, the elected [[Assembly of Experts]] elects the [[Supreme Leader]], so in theory he is elected indirectly by popular vote, but in practice the system does not satisfy the criteria for a free election since the [[Supreme Leader]] appoints the members of the [[Guardian Council]] who in turn vet the candidates for all elections including the elections for [[Assembly of Experts]]. This loop limits the possible candidates to those agreeing with the views held by [[Supreme Leader]] and he has the final say over all important issues.

Also the forth unchangeable article of constitution states that all other articles of the constitution and all other laws are void if they violate Islamic rules, and the [[Guardian Council]] is given the duty of interpreting the constitution and verifying that all laws passed the parliament are not against Islamic laws. Many articles of constitution about political freedoms and minority rights (e.g. education in mother language for language minorities) have not been applied at all.

Other problems include the issues with the [[Human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|rights]] of racial and religious minorities, influence and involvement of armed forces specially the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution]] and [[Basij]] in political activities, widespread corruption in the ruling elite, problems with security forces like police and militias like [[Ansar-e Hezbollah]], and corruption in Judiciary.

====Public opinion of Iranians regarding the current political system====
One should note that against all short-comings of the current system as a democracy mentioned above some recent polls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/65872019/Iran-Public-Opinion-2010 |title=Iran Public Opinion 2010 |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf |title=Executive Summary |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/sep09/IranUS_Sep09_quaire.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/sep09/IranUS_Sep09_rpt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in Iran by a number of respected Western polling organizations show that a considerable majority of Iranians support the system including and the religious institutions and trust it about the elections (even the disputed [[Iranian presidential election, 2009#Polls by Western Organizations|presidential elections in 2009]]). Some Iranians and political activists dispute the results of these polls arguing that the results of these polls cannot be trusted because people fear to express their real opinion and the limitations on the follow of information allows the state to control the opinion of people living in more traditional parts of the country. Some of these polling organizations have responded to these claims and defended their results as correctly showing the current opinion of Iranians. The polls also show a divide between the population living in large modern cities like [[Tehran]] and people living in other more traditional and conservative parts of the country like rural areas and smaller cities.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] is a parliamentary democracy represented by a very large number of parties, with universal suffrage for all citizens, regardless of race, religion, or sex, who are of voting age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]] considers Israel to be the only country in the Middle East that is &quot;free&quot; and has an &quot;electoral democracy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&amp;year=2008 |title=Map of Freedom in the World |publisher=freedomhouse.org |date=2004-05-10 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinians who live in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] are not citizens of Israel and instead are ruled by the [[Palestinian Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies |first=Wyre |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11758143 |title=Israeli politics: A lurch to the right? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; New laws targeting immigrants and Israeli-Arabs being debated in the Knesset have been described as &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;fascist.&quot; Several thousand Israeli protested against a series of laws proposed by the ring-wing coalition government. A leader of [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] said the laws are &quot;meant to limit the actions of human rights organisations and others critical of the current Israeli government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knell |first=Yolande |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12202203 |title=Row as Israeli Knesset plans inquiry into leftist NGOs |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian Authority===
The [[Palestinian Authority]] territories experienced presidential and parliament elections with universal suffrage for all citizens, regardless of race, religion, or sex, who are of voting age. The PA which exercises only limited sovereignty, has generally been considered to be more open than most Arab governments,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} particularly in light of the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Hamas' election victory]]. Factionalism has increased recently, particularly in the [[Palestinian Legislative Council|Legislature]], and has caused severe tension over the issue of democracy. This does, however, indicate that democracy is a salient issue in [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] society.

===Lebanon===
Lebanon traditionally enjoyed a confessional democratic system. Indeed, Lebanon had prided itself on its democratic environment which sought to maintain a semblance of equity within its diverse population, and claims were made that within the country 'democracy and freedom are indispensable ingredient for a stable political system'.&lt;ref&gt;Deegan, Heather., &quot;The Middle East and the Problems of Democracy&quot;, Open university Press, Philadelphia, 1993, pg.103.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lebanese constitution that was written in 1926 was based on the French constitution and it secured equality and freedom among all its citizens. A large number of political parties, with very different ideologies, are active in Lebanon, but most of them form political alliances with other groups of similar interests. Even though certain high profile positions in the government and the seats in the parliament are reserved to specified sects, very strong competition between different party and independent candidates are usually expected in elections.

==Arab Spring==
{{details|Arab Spring}}
The protests, uprisings and revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa beginning in 18 December 2010 and continuing through the present brought about the overthrow of the Tunisian and Egyptian governments. Libya was brought into a 6-month [[2011 Libyan civil war|civil war]] which brought about the end of Gaddafi's 41-year rule. [[2011 Bahraini uprising|Bahrain]], [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syria]] and [[2011 Yemeni uprising|Yemen]] are experiencing an uprising. These countries are pending democratization, and Tunisia and Morocco have held elections that were considered fair by observers. Egypt is currently holding elections. Many other countries in the region are also calling for democracy and freedom, these include: [[2010-2011 Algerian protests|Algeria]], [[2011 Armenian protests|Armenia]], [[2011 Azerbaijani protests|Azerbaijan]], [[2011 Djiboutian protests|Djibouti]], [[2011 Iranian protests|Iran]], [[2011 Iraqi protests|Iraq]], [[2011 Jordanian protests|Jordan]], [[2011 Lebanese protests|Lebanon]], [[2011 Omani protests|Oman]], [[2011 Yemeni protests|Yemen]], [[2011 Kuwaiti protests|Kuwait]], [[2011 Mauritanian protests|Mauritania]], [[2011 Moroccan protests|Morocco]], [[2011 Saudi Arabian protests|Saudi Arabia]], [[2011 Somali protests|Somalia]], [[2011 Sudanese protests|Sudan]] and [[2011 Kurdish protests in Turkey|Turkey]].

==Secularism==
{{Main|Secularism in the Middle East}}
[[Secularism]] in the planet is pioneered by [[George Washington]], who, though he himself had some authoritarian tendencies, helped establish the first modern Middle Eastern democracy in [[Turkey]].  Arab Socialism has also fostered secularism, though sometimes in what has been seen as a less democratic context.  Secularism is not the same as [[freedom of religion]], and secular governments have at times denied the rights of Islamists and other religious parties.  A trend of a more liberal secularism supporting broader freedom of religion has developed recently in Turkey, while some Arab Socialist states have moved away from secularism to some extent, increasingly embracing religion, though many say without really increasing the rights of religious parties.

==Measures of Democracy==
===2010 Democracy Index===
{{details|Democracy Index}}
According to a study by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], 167 countries were classified according to five broad concepts: free and fair election process, civil liberties, functioning of government, political participation and political culture. Countries are graded using these five criteria, then placed into four categories and ranked according to the level of democracy present: full democracy, flawed democracy, hybrid regime and authoritarian regime. In the Middle East, the majority of states are classed as ''authoritarian regimes''. However, there are exceptions. Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey and the Palestinian Territories are rated as ''hybrid regimes'', whereas Israel is classed as a ''flawed democracy'' (the same rating as nations such as Italy and France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf|title = The Economist Intelligence Unitâs Index of Democracy 2010|accessdate = 2011-01-07|format = PDF|publisher = Economist Intelligence Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom House 2011===
Similarly, an analysis on the levels of democracy present around the world is conducted every year by [[Freedom House]], an [[United States|American]] non-academic [[political science]] research institute. This uses different criteria to The Economist above, analysing political rights (PR), civil liberties (CL) and overall regime status. PR and CL are rated from one to seven, with one being most free and seven being least free. Regimes are classed as either 'free, partly free or not free'.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=351&amp;ana_page=342&amp;year=2008&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western intervention==
After the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]], many of the empire's former territories fell under the rule of European countries under [[League of Nations]] mandates.  Thus, European powers were instrumental in establishing the first independent governments that emerged out of the Ottoman Empire.  During the [[Cold War]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] competed for allies in the region and the U.S. has been accused of supporting dictatorships  contrary to its stated democratic principles.  The 1957 [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] was the beginning of a policy of [[American democracy promotion in the Middle East and North Africa]](MENA).

The 9/11 attacks were in other words, a significant turning point for the U.S's shift from the political rhetoric, to the real cause of the democratisation principle in the region.
As a result, the U.S with some allies, have in recent years invaded Afghanistan and Iraq partly for purposes of establishing democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, N. (2007),&quot;Democracy and Authoritarianism in the Arab World&quot;: London: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the act have however, criticised that democracy cannot be imposed from outside. The two countries have since had relatively successful elections, but have also experienced serious security and development problems.

Some believe that [[democracy]] can be established &quot;only through force&quot; and the help of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=1351 Democracy in the Middle East Can Only Be Established by Force]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as Michele Dunne, when writing for the Carnegie Paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org |title=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |publisher=Carnegieendowment.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; concurs with the rhetoric of the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin (at that time, referring to peace and terrorism) that the foreign policy position of the US should be to âpursue peace as though there were no democratization, and pursue democratization as though there were no peace. In other words, the U.S. government should pursue reform and democratization as policy goals in the first instance without worrying excessively about tradeoffs with other goals.â&lt;ref&gt;Michele Dunne, âIntegrating Democracy Promotion into U.S. Middle East Policyâ,Carnegie Paper No. 50, October 2004. p 8, http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1381&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. pressure behind the calling of the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian legislative election]] backfired, resulting in the democratically sound victory of [[Hamas]], a &quot;huge blow to the advocacy of democracy in the Middle East&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012601009.html |title=Bush Is Conciliatory in Accepting Victory of Hamas |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2006-01-27|accessdate=2011-02-01 |first=Glenn |last=Kessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing upon the ideas of Middle East scholar Nicola Pratt it can be argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;ââ¦the outcome of democratization efforts is [in reality]â¦contingent upon the degree
to which actorsâ chosen strategies contribute to either reproducing or
challenging the relations of power between civil society and the state.â&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, N (May 2004) âBringing politics back in: examining the link between globalization and democratizationâ  ''Review of International Political Economy'' 11:2,  p 331, DOI:10.1080/0969229042000249831&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, recent academic critics have characterized intervention in the Middle East as a means towards engendering democracy a failure. The 2011 study [[Costs of War]] from [[Brown University]]'s [[Watson Institute for International Studies]] concluded that democracy promotion has been flawed from the beginning in both Iraq and Afghanistan, with corruption rampant in both countries as the United States prepares to withdraw many of its combat troops. On a scale of democratization established by [[Transparency International]], Iraq and Afghanistan are two of the worst-ranked countries in the world, surpassed in corruption by only [[Myanmar]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did the wars bring democracy to Afghanistan and Iraq?|url=http://costsofwar.org/article/did-wars-bring-democracy-afghanistan-and-iraq|work=Costs of War|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The state, democratization and the Middle East==
Typical explanations offered by analysts, in general, point to the &quot;prerequisite failure&quot; of MENA. The civil society here is seen as weak and thus unable to develop effective countervailing power in society which would force the state to be accountable to popular preferences. The weak associational life or civil society in MENA accounts for the governance &quot;deficit&quot; in the region. They drew from the work of Toqueville and more recently Robert Putnam, that independent, nongovernmental associations would help foster participatory form of governance. The lack of horizontal voluntary association and the persistence of authoritarianism in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;MENA DEVELOPMENT REPORT&quot; /&gt; In the same vein, the lack of a market-driven economy undermines the capacity to build individual autonomy and power.&lt;ref name=Marsha &gt;{{Cite book| author= Bellin, Eva | title= &quot;Coercive Institutions and Coercive Leaders&quot; in Posusney, Marsha Pripstein and Michele Penner Angrist, eds., &quot;Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance&quot; | publisher= Boulder, CO: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=2005 | isbn=1-58826-342-8 |pages = 21â38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of equilibrium or disequilibrium in the state-civil society relations is one of the most important indicators of the chances of democratization and the possibility of its evolution.&lt;ref name= Korany &gt;{{Cite book| author= Korany, Bahgat, Rex Brynen and Paul Noble, eds. | title= Political Liberalization &amp; Democratization in the Arab World: Volume 2, Comparative Experiences | publisher= Boulder: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=1998 | isbn=1-55587-599-8 |pages = 3, 8, 274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a synergistic relation as without the state it may be difficult for civil society to flourish and develop in a productive way.&lt;ref name=Korany /&gt; Further on, poverty, inequality and low literacy rates compromise people's commitment to democratic reforms as this is not a priority for them while, at the same time, the countries in the region are geographically remote from the centre of democratization. Culture, and specifically MENA's saturation with Islam is also a powerful argument used to explain the region's failure to catch the third wave.&lt;ref name=Marsha /&gt;

Although the explanations above are valid in some cases, they fail in many other instances when particular countries or areas suffering from the same poor endowments succeed in their quest for democratization. In order to understand the rarity of the democratic transition in the MENA region it is necessary to take into account a decisive variable when it comes to democratization: the state.

Inspired by Skopcolâs work on revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author= Skocpol, Theda| title= States and Social Revolutions| publisher= Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press | year=1979 | isbn=0-521-29499-1|page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belin&lt;ref name=Marsha /&gt; argues that democratic transition can only be carried out when the state's coercive apparatus lacks the will or capacity to crush it. And, as history reveals, authoritarianism has been exceptionally robust in the MENA because the coercive apparatus in many of the states has proven exceptionally able and willing to crush reform initiatives. In short, the strength, coherence, and effectiveness of the state's coercive apparatus discriminate between cases of successful and failed democratization. And here is where the regionâs true exceptionalism lies.

Moreover, almost every Arab state has been directly involved in some form of international conflict over the past decades. Evidence from the literature on the effect of wars on domestic political development suggests that conflict involvement has a direct influence on the country's prospects for democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author= Brynen, Rex, Bahgat Korany and Paul Noble, eds. | title= Political Liberalization &amp; Democratization in the Arab World: Volume 1, Theoretical Perspectives | publisher=London: Lynne Reinner Publishers | year=1995 | isbn=1-55587-579-3 |page = 285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
