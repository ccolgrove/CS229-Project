The '''ArkansasâOle Miss football rivalry''' is an American [[college football]] rivalry between the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team of the [[University of Arkansas]] and the [[Ole Miss Rebels football]] team of the [[University of Mississippi]].  Although the rivalry currently exists predominantly between the respective programs' [[American football|football]] teams, all men's and women's sports teams of both universities play on an annual basis because the two universities both compete in the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) Western Division.  The football teams first met in 1908, and have played each other annually since 1981.  Overall, Arkansas currently leads the football series at 31â25â1, which includes two wins by Ole Miss in post-season bowl games, the 1963 and 1970 Sugar Bowls.

==History==
The rivalry between Arkansas and Ole Miss developed partially due to geography. Besides being neighboring states in the [[southeastern United States]], from the University of Arkansas' perspective, the University of Mississippi is closer in terms of distance than any other Southeastern Conference school. Arkansas has played Ole Miss more than any other SEC opponent. &lt;ref&gt;[http://mcubed.net/ncaaf/series/ark/series2.shtml mcubed.net : NFL : Arkansas : Series records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre 1980s===
The teams were first scheduled to meet each other in 1906, but due to a cancellation, the two teams began play against one another in a 1908 contest in which Arkansas won by a score of 33â0. Arkansas and Mississippi played many times sporadically in the following years. In addition to several single years of playing each other, the two teams played each other from 1940â47 and 1952â62 on an annual basis. The Razorbacks and Rebels also met twice in the [[Sugar Bowl]] played in [[New Orleans]], in 1963 and 1970; Both contests were won by Ole Miss. Especially in the early years, the teams often met in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to play the game, besides the normal Arkansas and Mississippi game sites.

===1980s to present===
Since 1981, the two teams have played each other annually in football. The games have generally alternated yearly between a site in Mississippi ([[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], or more recently [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]]) and a site in Arkansas ([[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], or more recently [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]), except for one time in 1995 when the game was played in Memphis, Tennessee.  Since Arkansas joined the [[Southeastern Conference]] in 1991 (first football season was 1992; previously a member of the [[Southwestern Conference|SWC]]), the two teams have played annually as both conference and Western division rivals.

===Recently (2000s)===
In 2001, Arkansas and Ole Miss had an NCAA record seven-overtime game in Oxford, MS. Arkansas has had the overall advantage since 2000, winning 8 games to 4 for Ole Miss.

==Houston Nutt controversy==
Upon the conclusion of the [[2007 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|2007 regular season]], Arkansas Razorbacks coach [[Houston Nutt]] was forced to resign amid several [[Controversy|controversies]] and allegations that had arisen. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/stewart_mandel/02/22/arkansas.nutt/index.html SI.com â Writers â Stewart Mandel: Nutt faces heat in truly bizarre Arkansas soap opera â Thursday February 22, 2007 6:10PM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/18321489/ SN: Time for Nutt to bolt Arkansas â College football â MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hours later, he was announced as the head coach of the Ole Miss Rebels football team&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3129559 ESPN â Nutt agrees with Ole Miss hours after resigning from Arkansas â College Football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, replacing [[Ed Orgeron]] who had been fired after three consecutive losing seasons. 

Ole Miss and Arkansas met in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] on October 25, 2008 with identical 3â4 records. This marked Nutt's first return to the University of Arkansas campus as an opposing coach. Nutt led his Rebels to a 23â21 victory over the Razorbacks. The long-standing rivalry has become more interesting because of his association with both universities.

{{See also|1908 Arkansas_Razorbacks football team}}

The very first meeting between the two teams was a 1908 contest in which Arkansas won by a score of 33â0. The teams were first scheduled to meet each other in 1906, but due to a cancellation, the 1908 contest was the first meeting.

====1914 â Contentious result====
Arkansas lists the 1914 contest as a forfeit by Ole Miss because Ole Miss used an ineligible player. Ole Miss denies the allegation of using an ineligible player and therefore lists the contest by the recorded on the field winning score of 13â7 in favor of Ole Miss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/102210aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://arkansas.scout.com/2/318482.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://olemisssports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/111304aaj.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the two school's official records for the overall series shows a one game difference. As of the 2010 Arkansas win, Ole Miss lists the series as 30â26â1 in favor of Arkansas while Arkansas lists the series as 31â25â1 in Arkansas' favor.

After the timeout, fans swear Bell signaled that the kick was good as soon as Green connected with the ball. Fans also swear that the kick was no good. Fighting broke out all around the stadium and because of this, the annual series between the two schools was played the next year in Jackson and then was canceled until the two teams renewed the series in 1981.
