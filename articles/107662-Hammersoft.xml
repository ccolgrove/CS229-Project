'''Monterey Park''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of [[downtown Los Angeles]]. The city's motto is &quot;Pride in the past, Faith in the future&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMP&quot;&gt;http://www.ci.monterey-park.ca.us/&lt;/ref&gt; Monterey Park is part of a cluster of cities, along with [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], [[Temple City, California|Temple City]], [[Rosemead, California|Rosemead]], [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], and [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]] in the west [[San Gabriel Valley]], with a growing [[Asian American]] population, making up 66.9% of its resident population at 2010; 47.7% of its residents are of [[Chinese people|Chinese descent]], the largest concentration of [[Chinese American]]s of any [[municipality]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacsla.org/API_demographics.html |title=PACS &amp;#124; Asian Pacific Family Center &amp;#124; Asian Youth Center &amp;#124; Chinatown Service Center &amp;#124; Korean Youth and Community Center &amp;#124; Search to Involve Pilipino Americans |publisher=Pacsla.org |date=2005-04-26 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the city had a total population of 60,269.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMP&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
For at least seven thousand years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Verdugo_HS/classes/multimedia/intro.html |title=introduction |publisher=Lausd.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the land was populated by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] ([[Gabrielino]]) Native Americans.   The Tongva lived in dome like structures with thatched exteriors, an open smoke hole for ventilation and light at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Verdugo_HS/classes/multimedia/house.htm |title=Housing |publisher=Lausd.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both sexes wore long hair styles and tattooed their bodies. During warm weather the men wore little clothes but the women would wear minimal skirts made of animal hides. During the cold weather they would wear animal skin capes and occasionally wore sandals made from hide of yucca fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Verdugo_HS/classes/multimedia/cloth.html |title=clothing |publisher=Lausd.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the arrival of the Spaniards, [[Old World]] diseases killed off many of the Tongva, and by 1870 very few Native-Americans had survived. In the early 19th century the area was part of the [[Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel]] mission system and later, the [[Rancho San Antonio (Lugo)|Rancho San Antonio]].

===1860sâ1960s===
Following the Civil War, an Italian, Alessandro Repetto, purchased {{convert|5,000|acre|km2}} of the rancho and built his ranch house on the hill overlooking his land, about a half-mile north of where Garfield Avenue crosses the Pomona Freeway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmontebello.com/about/default.asp |title=About Montebello |publisher=City of Montebello |date=1920-10-19 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; not far from where the [[Southern California Edison|Edison]] substation is now located on Garfield Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;ci.monterey-park.ca.us&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.monterey-park.ca.us/index.aspx?page=1079 |title=City of Monterey Park : History of Monterey Park |publisher=Ci.monterey-park.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this time, Richard Garvey, a mail rider for the U.S. Army whose route took him through [[Monterey Pass]], a trail that is now Garvey Avenue, settled down in the King's Hills.  Garvey began developing the land by bringing in spring water from near the Hondo River and by constructing a {{convert|54|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|0}} dam to form Garvey Lake located where  Garvey Ranch Park is now.  To pay for his development and past debts, Garvey began selling portions of his property.  In 1906, the first subdivision in the area, Ramona Acres (named after the developer's daughter, who would also later inspire the title of the novel ''[[Ramona]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-17/local/me-12794_1_san-bernardino-freeway|title=L.A. Scene / The City Then and Now|last=Cecilia|first=Rasmussen|date=January 17, 1994|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was developed north of Garvey and east of Garfield Avenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ci.monterey-park.ca.us&quot;/&gt;

In 1916, the new residents of the area initiated action to become a city when the cities of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]], and [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] proposed to put a large sewage treatment facility in the area.  The community voted itself into cityhood on May 29, 1916, by a vote of 455 to 33.  The City's new Board of Directors immediately outlawed sewage plants within city boundaries and named the new city [[Monterey Park]].  The name was taken from an old government map showing the oak-covered hills of the area as Monterey Hills.  In 1920, a large area on the south edge of the city broke away and the separate city of [[Montebello, California|Montebello]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montebellochamber.org/History.aspx |title=Chamber History |publisher=Montebellochamber.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, the white and Spanish-surname settlers were joined by Asian residents who began farming potatoes and flowers and developing nurseries in the Monterey Highlands area.  They improved the Monterey Pass Trail with a road to aid in shipping their produce to Los Angeles.  The nameless pass, which had been a popular location for western movies, was called Coyote Pass by Pioneer Masami Abe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ci.monterey-park.ca.us&quot;/&gt;

In 1926, near the corner of Atlantic and Garvey Boulevards, [[Laura Scudder]] invented the first sealed bag of potato chips. In an effort to maintain quality and freshness, Laura's team would iron sheets of wax paper together to form a bag. They would fill these bags with potato chips; iron the top closed, and then deliver them to various retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laurascudders.com/History |title=Laura Scudder's |publisher=Laurascudders.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real estate became a thriving industry during the late 1920s with investors attracted to the many subdivisions under development and increasing commercial opportunities. One such development was the Midwick View Estates by Peter N. Snyder, a proposed garden community that was designed to rival [[Bel Air, California|Bel Air]] and [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].  Known as the &quot;Father of the East Side&quot;, Mr. Snyder was a key player in the vast undertaking in the 1920s of developing the East Side as part of the industrial base of Los Angeles.  His efforts to build Atlantic Boulevard, his work with the East Side organization to bring industry to the East Side, and his residential and commercial development projects along Atlantic Boulevard (Gardens Square, Golden Gate Square, and the Midwick View Estates) were a major influence to the surrounding communities.  The focal point of the Midwick View Estates was &quot;Jardin del Encanto&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;El Encanto,&quot; a Spanish style building that was to serve as the administration building and community center for Midwick View Estates, and an amphitheater to be nestled into the hillside above Kingsford Street.  Although the amphitheater was never built, the observation terrace from which viewers could look down to Jardin del Encanto and the fountain with cascading water going down the hillside in stepped pools to De La Fuente remains and is now known as Heritage Falls Park or &quot;the Cascades.&quot;  The Great Depression brought an abrupt end to the real estate boom, as well as the Midwick proposal.  From the late 1920s, the City had little development for nearly two decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;ci.monterey-park.ca.us&quot;/&gt;

The end of World War II resulted in a revived growth trend with explosive population gains during the late 1940s and 1950s.  Until this time, the population was concentrated in the northern and southern portions of the city, with the Garvey and Monterey Hills forming a natural barrier.  With the renewed growth, many new subdivisions were developed, utilizing even the previously undeveloped central area to allow for maximum growth potential.  A series of annexations of surrounding land also occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;ci.monterey-park.ca.us&quot;/&gt;

===1970sâpresent===
[[Image:Montereypark.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Downtown Monterey Park, California]]
Beginning in the 1970s, well-educated and affluent [[Asian Americans]] began settling in the west [[San Gabriel Valley]], primarily to Monterey Park.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, John. ''The Politics of Diversity: Immigration, Resistance, and Change in Monterey Park, California ''. Temple University Press, 195. p. 80.Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The city council subsequently tried and failed to pass English-only ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianweek.com/052496/LittleTaipei.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 the City Council of Monterey Park approved drafting of a proposal that would require all businesses in Monterey Park to display [[English language]] identification on business signs.&lt;ref&gt;Arax, Mark. &quot;Stronger Rules on English in Signs Pushed by Council.&quot; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. December 5, 1985. [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-05/news/ga-633_1_sign-ordinance 1]. Retrieved on March 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1980s, Monterey Park was also referred to as &quot;[[Little Taipei]]&quot; or affectionately,  &quot;The Chinese Beverly Hills&quot; by a local Chinese-language newspaper, &quot;Asian Week&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://asianweek.com/052496/LittleTaipei.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;at-usa.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.at-usa.com/California/Localities/M/Monterey_Park/ |title=Monterey Park, California (CA) @USA |publisher=At-usa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many businesses from [[Chinatown, Los Angeles]] began to open up stores in Monterey Park.  In the 1970s and 1980s, many affluent ''[[Mainlander#Chinese mainlanders (Taiwan)|waisheng ren]]'' [[Taiwan]]ese immigrants moved abroad from Taiwan and began settling into Monterey Park. [[Mandarin Chinese]] dialect was predominant in the city during that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;temple.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Timothy P. |last=Fong |url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/997_reg_print.html |title=The First Suburban Chinatown |publisher=Temple University|isbn=9781566392624 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, immigrants from [[Mainland China]] and [[Vietnam]] began moving into Monterey Park.  By the 1990 census, Monterey Park became the first city with an Asian descent majority population in the continental United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;at-usa.com&quot;/&gt; Timothy P. Fong, a professor and director of Asian American studies at [[California State University, Sacramento]], describes Monterey Park as the &quot;First Suburban Chinatown&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;temple.edu&quot;/&gt;

In the 1980s, the second generation Chinese Americans generally moved out of the old Chinatown and into the San Gabriel Valley suburbs, joining the new immigrants from Taiwan and Mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raulareyes.com/Site/Monterey_Park.html/ San Gabriel Valley Tribune&lt;/ref&gt;
From that time, with a combined influx of Vietnamese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong immigrant students at the time, [[Mark Keppel High School]], constructed during the [[New Deal]] era and located in [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]], but also serving most of [[Monterey Park]] and portions of [[Rosemead]], felt the impact of this new immigration as the student population increased dramatically, leading  to overcrowding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkhs.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=62613&amp;type=d&amp;termREC_ID=&amp;pREC_ID=97013 |title=Mark Keppel High School |publisher=Mkhs.org |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many students are second- or third-generation Asian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;www.hks.harvard.edu/aapr/doc/tsai76-98.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the Japanese community called: Nisei, (second-generation), Sansei,  (third-generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7859632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the City of Monterey Park passed an ordinance declaring a moratorium on new building, in an attempt to regulate the rapid growth the city experienced as a result of the influx of Asian immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Alfred Pong |url=http://www.asianweek.com/052496/LittleTaipei.html |title=The Chinese Beverly Hills |publisher=Asianweek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the potential loss of business revenue was recognized,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/48018067/The-First-Suburban-Chinatown&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Monterey Park went through a lot of upheaval that a lot of people regret.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quan, Douglas. &quot;[http://www.pe.com/localnews/rivcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_D_asian07.25558b4.html Some in Chino Hills nervous about ethnic shift].&quot; ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]''.

Since early 1990s, the Taiwanese are no longer the majority in the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;at-usa.com&quot;/&gt; and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the national language of China,  is now rapidly displacing [[Cantonese]] as the most widely spoken dialect in many Chinese businesses of Monterey Park. Cantonese, a dialect from southern China  has dominated the Chinatowns of North America for decades, but Mandarin is the  most common language of the latest Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Kirk | last=Semple | title=In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin | date=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howardwfrench.com/archives/2006/01/07/cantonese_is_losing_its_voice_speakers_of_the_spicy_tongue_that_can_make_words_of_love_sound_like_a_fight_are_having_to_learn_its_linguistic_kin_the_mellower_mandarin/&lt;/ref&gt; The construction boom of shopping centers has declined, but recent plans for redevelopment may change that. High property values and overcrowding in Monterey Park &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ci.monterey-park.ca.us/index.aspx?page=726&lt;/ref&gt; have contributed to a secondary movement away from Monterey Park. Furthermore, a great many established, wealthy Taiwanese immigrants have since relocated out of Monterey Park and northward to wealthier cities of [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], [[Temple City, California|Temple City]], [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]], and eastward to [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]], [[Hacienda Heights, California|Hacienda Heights]],  [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] and  [[Rowland Heights, California|Rowland Heights]], sometimes  called the &quot;New Little Taipei&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/99jan/chinese.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chinese-speaking businesses were established in these suburbs to accommodate this shift in demographics. This path follows the [[White Flight]] of the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;/&gt; Development of new buildings in Monterey Park had come to a virtual standstill,  there are still numerous Chinese-oriented businesses in Monterey Park and  there are significant redevelopment plans, now in process.

==Business==
The Chinese-dominated business district, between Garfield Avenue and Garvey Avenue, is called &quot;Downtown Monterey Park&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ci.monterey-park.ca.us/index.aspx?page=1811&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, Lincoln Plaza Hotel was built to predominately service tourists from Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Monterey Park has many choices of Hong Kong fusion cafes, there are several Cantonese seafood restaurants, as well as  restaurants offering [[Mainland Chinese]] fare.  As the activity of Taiwanese immigrant activity shifted to [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]] and [[Rowland Heights, California|Rowland Heights]] in the 1980s and 1990s, few Taiwanese restaurants have opened in the city.

The city's business interests are represented by the local [[Chamber of Commerce]]. The Chamber offices are located in the historic [[El Encanto]] - a building originally intended to be used as a land sales office. The Chamber is staffed during regular business hours and offers a variety of services for its members and the public. The Chamber is run by a [[Board of directors]]. The current president of the chamber is Vincent D. Chang, an attorney. The immediate past-president was Ronald Lee, a jeweler. The Chamber host regular networking opportunities such as a monthly Business-to-Business luncheon. Recently, the Chamber revived the &quot;Miss Monterey Park&quot; Pageant.
