'''Avalon''', or '''Avalon Bay''', is the only [[city|incorporated city]] on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]] of the [[Channel Islands of California|California Channel Islands]], and the southernmost city in [[Los Angeles County]]. Besides Avalon, the only other center of population on the island is the small [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] town of [[Two Harbors, California|Two Harbors]]. The population was 3,728 at the 2010 census.

Avalon was first settled in pre-modern times by members of the [[Tongva people|Gabrielino/Tongva]] tribe. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, several different developers tried to develop Avalon into a [[Resort town|resort destination community]], but most went bankrupt. In 1919, [[William Wrigley, Jr.]] gained control of Avalon. Wrigley oversaw much of the development of Avalon, including the construction of the landmark [[Catalina Casino]].

The city remains primarily a [[Resort town|resort community]]. Most of the waterfront is dominated by tourism-oriented businesses. The older parts of the town on the valley floor consist primarily of small houses and two and three-story buildings in various traditional architectural styles.  There are also several large apartment complexes nestled in the hills on either side of the valley, so that they are not obvious in most postcard photos of Avalon.

==History==
===Pre-European settlement===
Prior to the modern era, Avalon Bay was inhabited by people of the [[Tongva people|Gabrielino/Tongva]] tribe. In addition to Catalina Island, the Tongva occupied present-day Los Angeles County, northern Orange County, and San Clemente Island. The island was a major source of [[soapstone]] to the Tongva, who used the material to make stone vessels for cooking.&lt;ref name=Kroeber&gt;{{cite book

Their biggest villages, most likely, were located at Avalon Bay, as well as at the Isthmus and Emerald Bay.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  By the 1830s, the entire island's native population had either died off, or had migrated to the mainland to work in the missions or as ranch hands for the many private land owners.&lt;ref name=otte&gt;{{cite web | last= Otte |first = Stacey |last2 = Pedersen |first2 = Jeannine | year = 2004 | title = Catalina Island History | url = http://www.catalinamuseum.org/history.html | work = A Catalina Island History in Brief | publisher  =Catalina Island Museum | accessdate = January 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early developers===
In the 1840s, the Mexican governor [[Pio Pico]] gave the island of Catalina as a grant to Don Jose Corruvias of Santa Barbara. The island traded hands dozens of times in the ensuing years. In 1864, during the Civil War, it was occupied by Union troops, who built and occupied [[Camp Santa Catalina Island]] for most of that year. Federal commanders planned to use the island as an Indian reservation for the tribes they were fighting in northwestern California and as a coastal fortification. It was finally acquired in the 1860s by [[James Lick]], whose estate maintained control of the island for approximately the next 25 years.&lt;ref name=Williamson&gt;{{cite journal

The first owner to try to develop Avalon Bay into a resort destination was [[George Shatto]], a real estate speculator from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Shatto purchased the island for $200,000 from the Lick estate at the height of a [[real estate]] [[Boom and bust|boom]] in [[Southern California]] in 1887. Shatto created the settlement that would become Avalon, and can be credited with building the town's first hotel, the original Hotel Metropole, and pier.&lt;ref name=Gelt&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; His sister-in-law Etta Whitney came up with the name ''Avalon'', which was pulled as a reference from [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s poem &quot;[[Idylls of the King]]&quot;, about the legend of [[King Arthur]]. {{quote|Mr. and Mrs. Shatto and myself were looking for a name for the new town, which in its significance should be appropriate to the place, and the names which I was looking up were 'Avon' and 'Avondale,' and I found the name 'Avalon,' the meaning of which, as given in Webster's unabridged, was 'Bright gem of the ocean,' or Beautiful isle of the blest.'|Etta Whitney&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt;}} Shatto laid out Avalon's streets, and introduced it as a vacation destination to the general public. He did this by hosting a real estate auction in Avalon in 1887, and purchasing a steamer ship for daily access to the island. In the summer of 1888, the small pioneer village kicked off its opening season as a booming little resort town. Despite Shatto's efforts, in a few years he had to default on his loan and the island went back to the Lick estate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[Image:Avalonbaybig.jpg|thumb|left|Avalon Bay around 1910, before the construction of the casino]]The sons of [[Phineas Banning]] bought the island in 1891 from the Lick estate and established the Santa Catalina Island Company to develop it as a resort. The Banning brothers fulfilled Shatto's dream of making Avalon a resort community. They built a dance pavilion in the center of town, made additions to the Hotel Metropole and steamer-wharf, built an aquarium, created the Pilgrim Club (a gambling club for men only). They also improved the standard of Avalon's beach by erecting a sea-wall and adding &quot;spoonholders&quot; or covered benches, building a bath house. For additional habitation, the Bannings erected close to one hundred tents throughout Avalon's canyon (often called &quot;tent cities&quot;). These tents were created so that if the expense of a hotel was too much, a visitor could rent out a tent for the bargain price of $7.50 per week. To this day, many homes in Avalon are still in possession of the same tents that stood in that spot over a century ago.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Just as the Bannings were anticipating the construction of a new, Hotel Saint Catherine, their efforts were set back on November 29, 1915, when a fire burned half of Avalon's buildings, including six hotels and several clubs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The Bannings refused to sell the island in hopes of rebuilding the town, starting with the Hotel Saint Catherine. The hotel would be located on Sugarloaf Point, the unique, picturesque, cliff bound peninsula at the north end of Avalon's harbor. It was blasted away to begin the construction of the hotel with its annex being in Descanso Canyon. These plans failed due to lack of funding and, in the end, the hotel was built in Descanso Canyon. Due to debt related to the 1915 fire and a decline in tourism due to [[World War I]], the Bannings were forced to sell the island in 1919 in shares.&lt;ref name=otte/&gt;

===Wrigley ownership===
[[image:WM. Wrigley, Jr. LC-DIG-ggbain-29898.jpg|thumb|William Wrigley, Jr. took control of Avalon in 1919]]
In February 1919, chewing gum magnate [[William Wrigley, Jr.]] bought a controlling interest in Santa Catalina Island and its associated properties from the Banning Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

When Wrigley bought the island, the ''Hermosa II'' and the ''[[S.S. Cabrillo]]'' were the only steamships that provided access to the island. In order to encourage growth, Wrigley purchased an additional steamship, the ''S.S. Virginia''. With some adjustments, it was renamed the ''S.S. Avalon''. He also foresaw the design of another steamship, the ''[[S.S. Catalina]]'' which was launched on the morning of May 3, 1924. These steamships would deliver passengers to Catalina for many years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the 1920s, in an effort to generate tourism in Avalon, Wrigley tried to convince [[Gertrude Ederle]], who had just become famous as the first woman to swim across the [[English Channel]], to swim from Catalina to the mainland.  She declined, so he launched the 1927 Wrigley Ocean Marathon: offering $25,000 to the first person to cross the channel and $15,000 for the first finisher of &quot;the fair sex.&quot;  Out of a field of 102, only one man completed the swim, Canadian swimmer George Young, who finished 15 hours and 44 minutes after the start.  The two women who came the closest were awarded $2,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;  Catalina's steamships were expropriated for use as troop transports, the U.S. Maritime Service set up a training facility in Avalon, the Coast Guard had training at Two Harbors, the Army Signal Corp maintained a radar station in the interior, and the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (a precursor to the [[CIA]]) did training at Toyon Bay.&lt;ref name=otte/&gt;

In September 1972, 26 members of the [[Brown Berets]], a group of [[Chicano]] activists, travelled to Catalina and planted a Mexican flag, claiming the island for all Chicanos. They asserted that the [[Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty]] between [[Mexico]] and the [[USA]] did not specifically mention the Channel Islands. The group camped outside of Avalon and were viewed as a new tourist attraction. Local Mexican-Americans provided them with food after they used up their own supplies. After 24 days a municipal judge visited the camp to ask them to leave. They departed peaceably on the tourist boat, just as they had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 04583035 | pages = B1 | last = Martinez | first = Al

===Post-Wrigley era===
[[Image:Catalina Island Casino.jpg|thumb|right|The Catalina Casino, 2007]]
In 1975, [[Philip Wrigley]] deeded the Wrigley shares in the Santa Catalina Island Company to the [[Catalina Island Conservancy]] that he had helped create. The Conservancy now stewards 88 percent of the island, primarily outside of the City of Avalon. The mission of the Catalina Island Conservancy is to be a responsible steward of its lands through a balance of conservation, education and [[recreation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} So far, the successes include the opening of California's first permanent [[desalination plant]] in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The Santa Catalina Island Company maintains control of much of its resort properties and operations within the City of Avalon.

Due to its location on Catalina Island, it is the southern-most city in [[Los Angeles County]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|2.8|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}} on land and {{convert|.3|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}} on water.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Avalon has a very mild subtropical climate with warm temperatures year-round.  The [[National Weather Service]] maintained a cooperative station at the Avalon Pleasure Pier from 1909 through 1988.  Based on those records, average January temperatures are a maximum of {{convert|61.9|F|C|sp=us}} and a minimum of {{convert|46.6|F|C|sp=us}} and average July temperatures are a maximum of {{convert|72.1|F|C|sp=us}} and a minimum of {{convert|60.3|F|C|sp=us}}.  The temperature reaches {{convert|90|F|C|sp=us}} or higher on an average of only 1.0 day and drops to {{convert|32|F|C|sp=us}} or lower on an average of only 0.1 day annually.

==Cityscape==
[[Image:Avalon-Catalina-Island.jpg|thumb|left|Avalon harbor, 2004]]
The City of Avalon is oriented around Avalon Bay. Being a [[Resort town|resort community]], much of the city infrastructure is oriented toward a tourist-based economy. The harbor and beaches form the center of the town's activity. The Cabrillo Mole, located at the south end of the harbor, acts both as a breakwater and the main docks for the cross-channel passenger boats.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Many of the commercial businesses dedicated to serving visitors are located along the Crescent Street [[pedestrian mall]], which runs just behind the three main beaches of Avalon Bay. The pedestrian walkway is adorned throughout with decorative pavers, fountains, palm trees, and a decorative serpentine [[seawall]]. Many of these features were introduced to Avalon during an extensive re-design undertaken by [[Philip K. Wrigley]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=otte/&gt; Extending out into the center of the harbor is the green Pleasure Pier. The north end of the harbor is dominated by the [[Catalina Casino]]. Built in a style described as a cross between [[Art Deco]] and [[Mediterranean Revival]], the Casino serves as Avalon's most distinctive landmark.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Outside of the bay and just north of the Casino is Descanso Beach, a private beach run by the Santa Catalina Island Company. At the farthest north end of town are the Hamilton Cove condominiums, a gated community consisting mostly of second homes. South of the bay is Lovers Cove dive park, a marine reserve frequented by both snorkelers and the classic [[glass-bottom boat]] tours. Further south still is Pebbly Beach, an industrial area home to the heliport and Pebbly Beach Generating Station where Avalon gets its power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Most of the residential units in Avalon are tucked away off of the beachfront, either in the flat lands further back into the canyon or on the hills that constitute the sides of Avalon Valley. Many of the major municipal amenities are located even further into the canyon, including City Hall, the fire station, the Catalina Island Medical Center, and Avalon Schools. The [[Wrigley Botanical Gardens|Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens]] are located at the farthest end of town away from the bay.&lt;ref&gt;

In February 2011, water regulators cited the city for letting tens of thousands of gallons of sewage reach the ocean in six spills since 2005. A report in June 2011 by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] listed Avalon as having one of the 10 most chronically polluted beaches in the United States.The beach fails state health standards so often that warning signs are posted much of the summer. The pollution is caused by the city's sewer system, made of century-old clay and metal pipes.  By 2011, city had spent $3.5 million testing and rehabilitating sewer lines, but the water was no cleaner. It is now planning a $5.1 million project to clean, repair and replace miles of sewer lines and make improvements at its sewer plant.{&lt;ref&gt;{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-avalon-water-20110710,0,4895779,full.story |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Avalon's dirty little secret: its beach is health hazard |author=Tony Barboza |date=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catalina Airport]] (FAA Identifier: AVX), also known as Airport-in-the-Sky, was built in 1946 and is located at (NAD83 rounded from FAA-provided coordinates): {{Coord|33|24|17|N|118|24|59|W}}, {{convert|7|mi|km}} northwest of Avalon. The {{convert|3250|ft|m|sp=us}} runway sits on a mountaintop, {{convert|1602|ft|m|sp=us}} above sea level.  Until the time of the airport's construction, the only air service to the island was provided by [[seaplane]]s.  Fixed-wing flights pay a $25 landing fee as of January 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Several [[helicopter]] companies serve the city, with the most landing at the Pebbly Beach Heliport, located south of Avalon Bay.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Intracity===
[[image:Avalon houses.jpg|thumb|Two examples of &quot;autoettes&quot; in Avalon, a [[Mini]] and a [[golf cart]] ]]

There is no regular vehicle ferry service to Avalon. Instead, the main method of transportation within the city is by small gasoline or electric powered motorcars referred to as &quot;autoettes.&quot; These include numerous [[golf carts]] and similarly sized vehicles. Vehicles under {{convert|55|in|cm|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|120|in|cm|sp=us}} long, and less than {{convert|1800|lbs|kg|sp=us}} may qualify as an autoette.  Any resident may acquire an autoette permit with the restriction of one permit per household. It is very difficult for a private citizen to get a permit to have a [[full-size vehicle]] in Avalon. The permit is issued to the individual as opposed to a specific vehicle, is surrendered when residency on the island ends, and is not transferable except through petition before the city council. Only one new vehicle permit is issued for every two permits that become ineligible to be renewed or are voluntarily surrendered. For purposes of vehicle registration, [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] is divided into two classifications: within Avalon and &quot;Interior&quot; (areas outside the city limits). The city has its own strict permit program with which local vehicle owners must comply, in addition to the usual requirements imposed by the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
