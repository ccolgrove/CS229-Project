'''Arkansas''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Arkansas.ogg|Ë|Ér|k|Én|s|ÉË}} {{respell|AR|kÉn-saw}})&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Daniel. (1997) ''English Pronouncing Dictionary'', 15th ed. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-45272-4&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Southern United States|southern region]] of the [[United States]]. Its name is an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] name of the [[Quapaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. Arkansas shares borders with six states (clockwise: N:[[Missouri]]; E: [[Tennessee]], [[Mississippi]]; S: [[Louisiana]]; SW: [[Texas]]; W: [[Oklahoma]]), and its eastern border is largely defined by the [[Mississippi River]]. Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the [[The Ozarks|Ozarks]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]], which make up the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]], to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], located in the central portion of the state.

==Toponym==
The name &quot;Arkansas&quot; derives from the same root as the name for the [[State of Kansas]]. The [[Kaw (tribe)|Kansa]] tribe of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] are closely associated with the [[Sioux]] tribes of the [[Great Plains]]. The word &quot;Arkansas&quot; itself is a [[French language|French]] pronunciation (&quot;Arcansas&quot;) of a [[Quapaw]] (a related &quot;Kaw&quot; tribe) word &quot;akakaze&quot; meaning &quot;land of downriver people&quot; or the [[Sioux language|Sioux]] word &quot;Akakaze&quot; meaning &quot;people of the south wind&quot;. The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881, after a dispute between the two U.S. Senators from Arkansas. One wanted to pronounce the name {{IPAc-en|Ér|Ë|k|Ã¦|n|z|É|s}} {{respell|ar|KAN|zÉs}} and the other wanted {{IPAc-en|Ë|Ér|k|Én|s|ÉË}} {{respell|AR|kÉn-saw}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot;&gt;The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[State of Arkansas]] on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|Ë|Ér|k|Én|s|ÉË}}, {{IPAc-en|Ér|Ë|k|Ã¦|n|z|É|s}}, and several other variants. In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution, now Arkansas Code 1-4-105 ([http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm official text]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation sould be determined for use in oral official proceedings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final &quot;s&quot; silent, the &quot;a&quot; in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;man&quot; and the sounding of the terminal &quot;s&quot; is an innovation to be discouraged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Citizens of the [[State of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en|Ér|Ë|k|Ã¦|n|z|É|s|_|Ë|r|Éª|v|Ér}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the state legislature officially declared the possessive form of the state's name to be ''Arkansas's''.&lt;ref&gt;Gambrell, John. [http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/mar/13/senate-gives-support-possessive-form-arkansas/ &quot;Senate gives support to possessive form of Arkansas.&quot;] ''[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]]'', March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mississippi River]] forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in [[Clay County, Arkansas|Clay]] and [[Greene County, Arkansas|Greene]] counties where the [[St. Francis River]] forms the western boundary of the [[Missouri Bootheel]], and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2546 Arkansas State Boundaries] from the [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/ Encyclopedia of Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas shares its southern border with [[Louisiana]], its northern border with [[Missouri]], its eastern border with [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]], and its western border with [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]].

Arkansas is a land of lakes and rivers, thick forests and fertile soil. The [[Arkansas Delta]] is a flat landscape of [[River delta|rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding]] of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.

The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as [[Crowley's Ridge]]. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from 250 to {{convert|500|ft|m}} above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.

Northwest Arkansas is part of the [[Ozark Plateau]] including the [[Ozark Mountains]], to the south are the [[Ouachita Mountains]], and these regions are divided by the [[Arkansas River]]; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. These mountain ranges are part of the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]] region, the only major mountainous region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/4106/about/HotSpringsOffice.htm |title=Managing Upland Forests of the Midsouth|publisher=United States Forestry Service |accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tapestry.usgs.gov/physiogr/physio.html|title=A Tapestry of Time and Terrain: The Union of Two Maps â Geology and Topography|publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point in the state is [[Mount Magazine]] in the [[Ouachita Mountains]]; it rises to {{convert|2753|ft|m}} above sea level.

Arkansas is home to many [[List of caves in Arkansas|caves]], such as [[Blanchard Springs Caverns]].
More than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool making sites, many of them Pre-Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters, have been catalogued by the State Archeologist. Arkansas is currently the only U.S. state in which [[diamond]]s are minedâalthough by members of the public with primitive digging tools for a small daily fee, not by commercial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craterofdiamondsstatepark.com/history/ |title=Crater of Diamonds: History of diamonds, diamond mining in Arkansas |publisher=Craterofdiamondsstatepark.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/gemstones/united-states-diamond-production.shtml |title=US Diamond Mines â Diamond Mining in the United States |publisher=Geology.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (near [[Murfreesboro, Arkansas|Murfreesboro]]).

Arkansas is home to a dozen Wilderness Areas totaling around {{convert|150000|acre|km2}}. These areas are set aside for outdoor recreation and are open to hunting, fishing, hiking, and primitive camping. No mechanized vehicles are allowed in these areas, some of which are rarely visited and can provide a good experience of feeling as if you are the only person to have ever stepped foot there.

===Climate===
Arkansas generally has a [[humid subtropical climate]], which borders on [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state. Generally, Arkansas has hot, humid summers and cold, slightly drier winters. In [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], the daily high temperatures average around {{convert|93|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} with lows around {{convert|73|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} in the month of July. In January highs average around {{convert|51|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and lows around {{convert|32|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}. In [[Siloam Springs, Arkansas|Siloam Springs]] in the northwest part of the state, the average high and low temperatures in July are {{convert|89|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|67|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and in January the average high and lows are {{convert|44|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|23|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about {{convert|40|and|60|in|mm}}; somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocs.orst.edu/pub/maps/Precipitation/Total/States/AR/ar.gif Average Annual Precipitation â Arkansas]. Spatial Climate Analysis Service, [[Oregon State University]]. Published 2000. Last Retrieved 2007-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is common, more so in the north half of the state, which usually gets several snowfalls each winter. This is not only due to its closer proximity to the plains states, but also to the higher elevations found throughout the Ozark and Ouachita mountains. The half of the state south of Little Rock gets less snow, and is more apt to see ice storms, however, sleet and freezing rain are expected throughout the state during the winter months, and can significantly impact travel and day to day life. Arkansas' all time record high is {{convert|120|F|C}} at [[Ozark, Arkansas|Ozark]] on August 10, 1936; the all time record low is {{convert|-29|F|C}} at [[Pond, Arkansas|Pond]] on February 13, 1905.

Arkansas is known for extreme weather. A typical year will see thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]], Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. A few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a [[tropical cyclone|tropical system]] which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.

{{Main|History of Arkansas}}
The first European to reach Arkansas was the [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]], a veteran of Pizarro's conquest of Peru who died near Lake Village on the Mississippi River in 1542 after almost a year traversing the southern part of the state in search of gold and a passage to China. Arkansas is one of several [[U.S. states]] formed from the territory purchased from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the [[Illinois language|Illinois]] tribe's name for the [[Quapaw]] people, who lived downriver from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302b&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=7800 |title=Linguist list 14.4 |publisher=Listserv.linguistlist.org |date=2003-02-11 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes who lived in Arkansas before moving west were the Quapaw, [[Caddo]], and [[Osage Nation|Osage]] nations. In their forced move westward (under U.S. [[Indian removal]] policies), the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period.

The [[Territory of Arkansas]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot;/&gt; was organized on July 4, 1819. On June 15, 1836, the State of Arkansas was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the 25th [[U.S. state|state]] and the 13th [[slave state]]. Planters settled in the Delta to cultivate cotton; this was the area of the state where most enslaved African Americans were held. Other areas had more subsistence farmers and mixed farming.

Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence from Mexico; it sent troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] to the Texas border involved the town in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1835â36. Some evidence suggests [[Sam Houston]] and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=165 |title=Old Washington State Park Conserves Town's Heyday |first=Jim |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fighting began, a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battle fields.

When the [[Mexican-American War]] began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor Thomas S. Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here, where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.

The state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the Mississippi Delta. This was where enslaved labor was used most extensively, as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the Upper South. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia]. Retrieved March 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas refused to join the [[Confederate States of America]] until after [[United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for troops to respond to the Confederate attack upon [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], [[South Carolina]]. The State of Arkansas declared its secession from the [[United States|Union]] on May 6, 1861. While not often cited in historical accounts, the state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the [[American Civil War]]. Arkansans of note who contributed to the Civil War included Confederate Major General [[Patrick Cleburne]]. Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate division commanders of the war, Cleburne was often referred to as &quot;The Stonewall of the West.&quot; Also of note was Major General [[Thomas C. Hindman]]. A former United States Representative, Hindman commanded Confederate forces at the [[Battle of Cane Hill]] and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]].

Under the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress restored Arkansas to the Union in June 1868. The Reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage while disenfranchising former Confederates (mostly Democrats), a public education system, and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The state came under almost exclusive control of [[Radical Republicans]], (those who emigrated from the North being derided as &quot;[[carpetbaggers]]&quot; by ex-Confederates based on allegations of corruption), led by newly elected Governor [[Powell Clayton]], marking a time of great upheaval and racial violence in the state between state militia and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |title=Brooks-Baxter War â Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified re-enfranchising former Confederates.

In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)

After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Some early 20th century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Baker, ''Minority Settlement in the Mississippi River Counties of the Arkansas Delta, 1870â1930'', Arkansas Preservation Commission [http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Minority_Settlement.pdf], accessed 14 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].

In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 they amended the state constitution to include a [[poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, and forced them from electoral rolls.

By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] were passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&amp;issue_id=36&amp;page=3

Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of [[Germans|German]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the [[Prairie]], and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Catholic and the Slovaks were Lutheran. The Irish were mostly [[Protestant]] from [[Ulster]].

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown ''v.'' Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']] in 1954, the [[Little Rock Nine]] brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=723 |title=Little Rock Nine â Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Clinton]], the 42nd [[President of the United States]], was born in [[Hope, Arkansas]]. Before his presidency, Clinton served as the 40th and 42nd [[Governor of Arkansas]], a total of nearly 12 years.

The [[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]], including the [[UAMS Medical Center]], is included in the State of Arkansas' numbers, and would rank in the top ten if listed separately.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEDC&quot;/&gt;

===Aquaculture===

The state also ranks third in terms of [[channel catfish]] [[aquaculture]], with about {{convert|19200|acre|km2}} under catfish farming in 2010. The peak of catfish farming in the state was in the year 2002, when {{convert|38000|acre|km2}} were under farming.  In 2007, the stateâs catfish producers generated sales of $71.5 million â 16 percent of the total U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/CatfProd//2000s/2002/CatfProd-02-07-2002.pdf] from USDA NASS&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas was the first state to develop commercial catfish farms in the late 1950s. The number of catfish farms in the state grew through the 1990s as farmers entered the catfish business as a way to provide additional income during a time of low prices for cotton and soybeans. Banks loaned money to support what they saw as a stable source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arfb.com/news_information/ark_agri/2008v5i2/catfish.aspx] Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
[[File:Map of Arkansas.png|215px|thumb|right|A map of Arkansas with county boundaries drawn]]
Arkansas imposes a [[state income tax]] with six brackets, ranging from 1.0% to 7.0%. The first $9,000 of military pay of enlisted personnel is exempt from Arkansas tax; officers do not have to pay state income tax on the first $6,000 of their military pay. Retirees pay no tax on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], or on the first $6,000 in gain on their pensions along with recovery of [[cost basis]]. Residents of [[Texarkana, Arkansas]] are exempt from Arkansas income tax; wages and business income earned there by residents of [[Texarkana, Texas]] are also exempt. Arkansas's gross receipts ([[sales tax|sales]]) tax and compensating ([[use tax|use]]) tax rate is currently 6%. The state has also mandated that various services be subject to sales tax collection. They include wrecker and towing services; dry cleaning and laundry; body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis; pest control; security and alarm monitoring; self-storage facilities; boat storage and docking; and pet grooming and kennel services.

Along with the state sales tax, there are more than 300 [[Tax|local taxes]] in Arkansas. Cities and counties have the authority to enact additional local sales and use taxes if they are passed by the voters in their area. These local taxes have a ceiling or cap; they cannot exceed $25 for each 1% of tax assessed. These additional taxes are collected by the state, which distributes the money back to the local jurisdictions monthly. Low-income taxpayers with a total annual household income of less than $12,000 are permitted a sales [[tax exemption]] for [[electricity]] usage.

Sales of [[alcoholic beverage]]s account for added taxes. A 10% supplemental mixed drink tax is imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages (excluding [[beer]]) at [[restaurant]]s. A 4% tax is due on the sale of all [[mixed drink]]s (except beer and [[wine]]) sold for &quot;on-premises&quot; consumption. A 3% tax is due on beer sold for off-premises consumption.

[[Property tax]]es are assessed on real and personal property; only 20% of the value is used as the tax base.

The Democratic Party holds [[majority]] status in the [[Arkansas General Assembly]]. A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This is rare in the modern [[Southern United States|South]], where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential electionânative son [[Bill Clinton]]âwhile every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years. The state voted for [[John McCain]] in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points, making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004. (The others were Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and West Virginia.)&lt;ref&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Election-state-04-08.png&lt;/ref&gt; Obama's relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]]'s failure to win the nomination{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters. However, the Democratic presence remains strong on the state level; in 2006, Democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a Democratic sweep that included the [[Democratic Party of Arkansas]] regaining the governorship, and in 2008, freshman Senator Mark Pryor was re-elected with nearly 80% of the vote against Green candidate [[Rebekah Kennedy]] with no Republican opposition.{{Citation needed|old data?|date=July 2011}}

Most Republican strength lies mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected two Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]] and [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]. The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic Legislature in the country, after [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts]], [[Hawaii State Legislature|Hawaii]], and [[Connecticut General Assembly|Connecticut]]. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being [[Florida]] and [[Virginia]]) during the first decade of the 21st century.

Although Democrats have an overwhelming majority of registered voters, Arkansas Democrats tend to be slightly more conservative than their national counterparts, particularly outside Little Rock. Arkansas' Democratic congressman is a member of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military, and socially conservative than the center-left Democratic mainstream. Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the [[Arkansas Constitution]] Arkansas is a [[right to work state]], its voters passed a ban on [[same-sex marriage]] with 75% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful with legislation on its books banning [[abortion]] in the event ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' is ever overturned.

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.

Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are [[term-limited]] to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term. Arkansas governors served two-year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years, effective with the 1986 general election. Statewide elections are held two years after presidential elections.

Some of Arkansas's [[county (United States)|counties]] have two [[county seat]]s, as opposed to the usual one seat. The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state. The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county. Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.

Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law (AR-kan-saw).&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot;/&gt;

Article 19 (Miscellaneous Provisions), Item 1 in the [[Arkansas Constitution]] is entitled &quot;Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness,&quot; and states that &quot;No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court.&quot; However, in 1961, the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'' (1961), held that a similar requirement in [[Maryland]] was unenforceable because violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the US Constitution. The latter amendment, per current precedent, makes the [[United States Bill of Rights|federal Bill of Rights]] binding on the states. As a result, this provision has not been known to have been enforced in modern times, and it is understood that it would be struck down if challenged in court.

==Metropolitan areas==
The [[Little Rock-North Little Rock-Pine Bluff Combined Statistical Area]] had 877,091 people in the 2010 census. It is the largest in Arkansas.

The [[Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metropolitan area]] is increasingly important to the state and its economy. The US Census showed the population of the MSA to be 463,204 in 2010 (up from 347,045 in 2000), making it one of the fastest growing areas in the nation.
