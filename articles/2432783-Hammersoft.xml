'''Hebrew literature''' consists of ancient, medieval, and modern writings in the [[Hebrew language]].  It is one of the primary forms of [[Jewish literature]], though there have been cases of literature written in Hebrew by [[non-Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Palestinian literature and culture'', by Ami Elad, 37ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Hebrew literature was produced in many different parts of the world throughout the medieval and modern eras, while contemporary Hebrew literature is largely [[Israeli literature]].

==Ancient Hebrew literature==
Beyond comparison, the most important such work is the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]).

The [[Mishna]], compiled around 200 CE, is the primary rabbinic codification of laws as derived from the [[Torah]]. It was written in [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], but the major commentary on it, the [[Gemara]], was largely written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].  Many works of classical [[midrash]] were written in Hebrew.

==Medieval Hebrew literature==
Many works of medieval [[rabbinic literature]] were written in Hebrew, including: [[Torah commentaries]] by [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], [[Rashi]] and others; codifications of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], such as [[Maimonides]]' [[Mishneh Torah]], the [[Arba'ah Turim]], and the [[Shulchan Aruch]]; and works of [[Musar literature]] (didactic ethical literature) such as [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]'s ''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (''The Duties of the Heart'').  Many works of medieval [[philosophical]] literature such as the ''[[Guide to the Perplexed]]'' and ''[[Kuzari|The Kuzari]]'', as well as many works of fiction, were written in Judeo-Arabic.  One work of fiction which was written in Hebrew was the &quot;Fox Fables&quot; by [[Berechiah ben Natronai ha-Nakdan]], Hebrew fables which resemble [[Aesop's fables]].

Much medieval Jewish poetry was written in Hebrew, including liturgical [[piyyutim]] in  Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries by Yose ben Yose, [[Yanai (Payetan)|Yanai]], and [[Eleazar Kalir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12632.html Encyclopedia Judaica]&lt;/ref&gt;  These poems were added to the Hebrew-language liturgy.  This liturgy was compiled in book form as &quot;the siddur&quot; by rabbis including [[Amram Gaon]] and [[Saadia Gaon]]. 

Later Spanish, Provencal, and Italian poets wrote both religious and secular poems; particularly prominent poets were [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Yehuda Halevi]].

==Modern Hebrew literature==
In addition to writing traditional [[rabbinic literature]] in Hebrew, modern Jews developed new forms of fiction, poetry, and essay-writing, which are typically called &quot;Modern Hebrew Literature.&quot;

===Eighteenth Century===
[[Moses Hayyim Luzzatto]]'s allegorical drama &quot;La-Yesharim Tehillah&quot; (1743) may be regarded as the first product of modern Hebrew literature.  It has been referred to as &quot;a poem that in its classic perfection of style is second only to the Bible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=L#ixzz12fP4eUpB&lt;/ref&gt;  Luzzatto's pupil in Amsterdam, [[David Franco Mendes]] (1713â92), in his imitations of [[Jean Racine]] (&quot;Gemul 'Atalyah&quot;) and of [[Metastasio]] (&quot;Yehudit&quot;), continued his master's work, though his works are not as respected as were Luzzatto's.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=L#ixzz12fP4eUpB&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the eighteenth century, the [[Haskalah]] (Jewish enlightenment) movement worked to achieve [[Jewish emancipation|political emancipation for Jews in Europe]]. [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s translation of the Hebrew Bible into [[German language|German]] inspired interest in the Hebrew language that led to the founding of a quarterly review written in Hebrew. Other periodicals followed. Poetry by [[Naphtali Hirz Wessely]] such as &quot;Shire Tif'eret,&quot; or &quot;Mosiade,&quot; made Wessely, so to speak, poet laureate of the period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=L#ixzz12fP4eUpB&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth Century===
In nineteenth-century Galicia, poets, scholars, and popular writers who contributed to the dissemination of Hebrew and to the emancipation of the Jews of Galicia included: 
*[[Nachman Krochmal]] (1785â1840), a philosopher, theologian, and historian.
*[[Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport]] (1790â1867), a rabbi, poet, and biographer
*[[Isaac Erter]] (1792â1841), a satirical poet whose collection of essays, &quot;Ha-Tzofeh le-Bet Yisrael,&quot; is one of the purest works of modern Hebrew literature, attacking [[Hasidic]] superstitions and prejudices in a vigorous and classical style.
*[[Meir Halevy Letteris]] (1800â1871), a lyric poet also known for his adaption of [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust]]'' into Hebrew.

In [[Amsterdam]], a circle of Hebrew-language literary artists emerged in the nineteenth century, including the poet [[Samuel Molder]] (1789â1862).

[[Prague]] became an active center for the [[Haskalah]] in the nineteenth century, and the best known among the [[Haskalah]] writers there was Jehudah Loeb Jeiteles (1773â1838), author of witty epigrams (&quot;Bene ha-Ne'urim&quot;) and of works directed against [[Hasidism]] and against [[superstition]].  

In [[Hungary]], Hebrew-language authors included Solomon Lewison of Moor (1789â1822), author of &quot;Melitzat Yeshurun&quot;; [[Gabriel SÃ¼dfeld]], a poet who was the father of [[Max Nordau]]; and the poet [[Simon Bacher]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=L&lt;/ref&gt; A notable Jewish author in [[Romania]] during the nineteenth century was the physician and writer Julius Barasch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=268&amp;letter=B&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jews of the nineteenth-century who wrote in Hebrew included I. S. Reggio (1784â1854), Joseph Almanzi, Hayyim Salomon, Samuel Vita Lolli (1788â1843).  Another figure of note was [[Rachel Morpurgo]] (1790â1860), who was one of the few female writers in the [[Haskalah]] movement, and whose poems have been described as characterized by &quot;religious piety and a mystic faith in Israel's future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=L&lt;/ref&gt;  The best known Italian writer was [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] (1800â65) was the first modern writer to introduce religious [[romanticism]] into Hebrew and to attack northern rationalism in the name of religious and national feeling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=L&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent Hebrew writers in the [[Russian empire]] in the nineteenth century included: 
*the poet and mathematician Jacob Eichenbaum (1796â1861)
*the Haskalah leader [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn]]
*[[Kalman Schulman]] (1826â1900), who introduced the romantic form into Hebrew
*the [[Romantic poetry|romantic poet]] [[Micah Joseph Lebensohn]] (1828â52)
*the  [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] author [[Mordecai Aaron Ginzburg]], known as &quot;the father of prose&quot;
*Lithuanian poet [[Abraham Baer Lebensohn]], known as the &quot;father of poetry,&quot; whose poems &quot;Shire Sefat Kodesh&quot; were extraordinarily successful.
*[[Abraham Mapu]] (1808â67), the creator of the Hebrew novel, whose historical romance &quot;Ahabat Tziyyon&quot; exercised an important influence on the development of Hebrew.
The poet [[Judah Leib Gordon]], also known as &quot;Leon Gordon&quot; (1831â1892), was a well-known [[satirical]] poet who has been characterized as &quot;an implacable enemy of the [[Rabbis]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=L&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth Century===
As [[Zionism|Zionist]] settlement in [[Palestine]] intensified at the start of the twentieth century, Hebrew became the shared language of the various Jewish immigrant communities. [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] in particular worked to adapt Hebrew to the needs of the modern world, turning to Hebrew sources from all periods to develop a language that went beyond the sacred and was capable of articulating the modern experience.

[[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] (1873â1934) was one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew poets and came to be recognized as [[Israel]]'s [[national poet]].  Bialik contributed significantly to the revival of the [[Hebrew language]], which before his days existed primarily as an ancient, scholarly tongue. His influence is felt deeply in all modern Hebrew literature.  Bialik, like other great literary figures from the early part of the 20th century such as [[Ahad Ha-Am]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky|Tchernichovsky]], spent his last years in Tel Aviv, exerting a great influence on younger Hebrew writers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/literature/FinalEdit_Literature_TO_HebrewLit.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

The foundations of modern [[Israel]]i writing were laid by a group of literary pioneers from the [[Second Aliyah]] including [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], [[Moshe Smilansky]], [[Yosef Haim Brenner]], [[David Shimoni]] and [[Jacob Fichman]]. In contrast, [[Yitzhaq Shami]], was a native of Palestine, and he holds a unique place in Hebrew literature, since his work is also recognized as Palestinian literature. In 1966, [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon|Agnon]] won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] for novels and short stories that employ a unique blend of biblical, Talmudic and modern Hebrew.

[[translation|Literary translators]] into [[Modern Hebrew]], most notably [[Leah Goldberg]] among others, also contributed a great deal to Israeli-Hebrew literature through bringing international literature and literary figures into Hebrew circles through translation. [[Leah Goldberg|Goldberg]] herself was also noted for being a prolific writer and pioneer of Israeli children's literature as well.

==Contemporary Hebrew literature==
{{main|Israeli literature}}
A new generation of Hebrew writers emerged with the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. This new generation included the novelists [[Aharon Megged]], [[Nathan Shaham]], and [[Moshe Shamir]], and the poets [[Yehudah Amichai]], [[Amir Gilboa]], and [[Haim Gouri]]. The novels ''My Michael'' (1968) and ''Black Box'' (1987) by [[Amos Oz]] and ''The Lover'' (1977) and ''Mr. Mani'' (1990) by [[A. B. Yehoshua]] describe life in the new state. These works also explore topics such the as [[Generation gap|conflict between parents and children]] and the rejection of some once-sacred ideals of [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]]. 

Many Hebrew writers in the late twentieth century dealt with [[the Holocaust]], women's issues, and the [[Arab-Israeli conflict|conflict between Israelis and Arabs]]. Another topic was the tension between Jews of European origin, the [[Ashkenazim]], and Jews of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean origin, the [[Mizrahim]] and [[Sephardim]].
 
Modern Hebrew authors include [[Ruth Almog]], [[Aharon Appelfeld]], [[Yitzhak Ben-Ner]], [[David Grossman]], [[Amalia Kahana-Carmon]], [[Etgar Keret]], [[Savyon Liebrecht]], [[Sami Michael]], [[Yaakov Shabtai]], [[David Shahar]], [[Meir Shalev]], and [[Tseruyah Shalev]].
 
Hebrew poets include [[David Avidan]], [[Maya Bejerano]], [[Erez Biton]], [[Yitzchak Laor]], [[Dan Pagis]], [[Dalia Ravikovitch]], [[Ronny Someck]], [[Meir Wieseltier]], and [[Yona Wallach]]. 

Contemporary Israeli authors whose works have been translated into other languages and attained international recognition are [[Ephraim Kishon]], [[Yaakov Shabtai]], [[A. B. Yehoshua]], [[Amos Oz]], [[Irit Linur]], [[Etgar Keret]] and [[Yehoshua Sobol]].

Today thousands of new books are published in Hebrew each year, both translations from other languages and original works by Israeli authors.
