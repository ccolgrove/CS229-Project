The '''Battle of Aanandapuram ''' was a land battle fought between the [[Military of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Military]], [[58 Division (Sri Lanka)|58 Division]], [[53 Division (Sri Lanka)|53 Division]] and [[Task Force 8 (Sri Lanka)|Task Force 8]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) for the control of the last stronghold held by the LTTE. This battle is a part of the [[Northern Theater of Eelam War IV|Northern Theater]] of [[Eelam War IV]] during the [[Sri Lankan civil war]]. The battle was fought in the Annadapuram area of Puthukkudiyirippu AGA Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbsjeyaraj.com&quot;&gt;[http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/315]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Build up==
Since the start of the northern offensive on 2008 the Srilanka Army had been steadily progressing in multiple fonts. As the LTTE was limited with the  both the sufficient man &amp; fire power was gradually withdrawing towards the North East part of the country. Finally they were confined to a small littoral strip of territory located between the A-35 highway (Paranthan-Mullaitheevu road) Nanthikadal and Chalai lagoons on one side and the Indian ocean on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.lk/img/20090404_Map02.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soldiers numbering more than 50,000 from five divisions and three task forces have besieged the LTTE. The tigers have been trying desperately to break out of this encirclement and drive the forces back. Against this backdrop the LTTE planned to launch a massive counter-offensive against the armed forces. The idea was to conduct a carefully planned operation that would deliver a crippling blow to the security forces.

==The Battle==
This was an extremely decisive battle in [[2008â2009 Sri Lankan Army Northern offensive]]. LTTE lost most of its major leaders in a single battle and this was the first time such a thing happened in its history.
