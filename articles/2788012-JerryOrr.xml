This article is a brief overview of both events.

'''The strike of 1892''' had its roots in the first pay cut by the Bunker Hill Mining Company in 1887. Immediately after the reduction in wages miners organized the first union at Wardner on November 3, 1887. &lt;br /&gt;The response to that violence, disastrous for the local miners' union, became the primary motivation for the formation of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) the following year.

'''The confrontation of 1899''' resulted from the miners' frustrations with mine operators that paid lower wages; hired Pinkerton or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] operatives to infiltrate the union; and routinely fired any miner who held a union card.

[[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]] area miners organized into several local unions during the 1880s. Mine owners responded by forming a [[Mine Owners' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Mine operators found a reduction in wages the easiest way to mitigate increased costs. The operators also increased miners' work hours from nine to ten hours per day, with no corresponding increase in pay.

In 1892, the miners declared a strike against the reduction of wages and an increase in work hours. Soon every inbound train was filled with replacement workers. But groups of armed, striking miners would frequently meet them, and often persuaded the workers not to take the jobs during a strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheritage.com&quot;&gt;&quot;Shoot-Out In Burke Canyon,&quot; American Heritage Magazine, Earl Clark, August 1971, Volume 22, Issue 5, http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1971/5/1971_5_44.shtml Retrieved March 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The silver-mine owners responded by hiring [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]] and the [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel Detective Agency agents]] to [[Labor spies|infiltrate the union and suppress strike activity]].&lt;ref&gt;From Blackjacks To Briefcases &amp;mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Two mines settled and opened with union men, and these mine operators were ostracized by other mine owners who didn't want the union. But two large mines, the Gem mine and the Frisco mine in [[Burke-Canyon]], were operating full scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheritage.com&quot;/&gt;

An undercover Pinkerton agent, soon-to-be well-known lawman [[Charlie Siringo]], had worked in the Gem mine. Siringo began to report all union business to his employers. Siringo was suspected as a spy when the MOA's newspaper, the ''Coeur d'Alene Barbarian'', began publishing union secrets.

On Sunday night, July 10, there was gunfire at the Frisco mine. The miners claimed the guards fired first, the guards accused the miners. The union men eventually sent a box of [[black powder]] down the [[flume]] into one of the mine buildings. The building exploded, killing one company man and injuring several others. The union miners fired into a remaining structure where the guards had taken shelter. A second company man was killed, and sixty or so guards surrendered. Union men marched their prisoners to the union hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheritage.com&quot;/&gt;

Minutes after the explosion at the Frisco mine, miners searched for Siringo, but didn't find him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briefcases 2003, pages 78-79&quot;&gt;From Blackjacks To Briefcases &amp;mdash; A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a more deadly fight broke out at the nearby Gem mine. A man crossing a footbridge was killed, probably by union fire. Company forces evacuated the Gem mine, and hundreds of union men converged on the Bunker Hill mine at [[Wardner, Idaho|Wardner]]. This mine was also evacuated. About 130 non-union miners were disarmed and expelled from the area.

The violence provided the mine owners and the governor with an excuse to declare Martial Law,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Wyman 1910, page 170&quot;&gt;Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 170.&lt;/ref&gt; and bring in six companies of the [[Idaho National Guard]] to &quot;suppress insurrection and violence.&quot; Federal troops also arrived, and they confined six hundred miners in [[Bullpen#Response_to_labor_unrest_.28United_States.29|bullpen]]s without any hearings or formal charges. Some were later &quot;sent up&quot; for violating injunctions, others for obstructing the United States mail.&lt;ref&gt;Labor's Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, 1908, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military rule lasted for four months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Wyman 1910, page 170&quot;/&gt;

On May 15, 1893, in Butte, Montana, the miners formed the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) as a direct result of their experiences in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Briefcases 2003, pages 78-79&quot;/&gt;

==Coeur d'Alene confrontation of 1899==

{{Main|Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899}}

The profitable [[Bunker Hill Mining Company]] at [[Wardner, Idaho]] had employed [[Labor spies|Pinkerton labor spies]] to identify union members. The company fired seventeen union members.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 250 angry union members seized a train in [[Burke, Idaho|Burke]] and rode it to [[Wardner, Idaho|Wardner]], and dynamited a $250,000 mill of the Bunker Hill mine.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck&amp;mdash;The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; A non-union miner and a union miner were killed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Idaho governor's request, President [[William McKinley]] sent the U.S. army. One thousand men were herded into an old barn. Conditions remained primitive, and three prisoners died.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emma F. Langdon|Emma Langdon]], a union sympathizer, charged in a 1908 book that Idaho Governor [[Frank Steunenberg]] received $35,000 from the mine operators.&lt;ref&gt;Labor's Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, 1908, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; J. Anthony Lukas later recorded in the book ''Big Trouble'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1899, when the state needed money for the Coeur d'Alene prosecutions, the [[Mine Owners' Association]] had come up with $32,000&amp;mdash;about a third of it from Bunker Hill and Sullivan&amp;mdash;handing $25,000 over to Governor Steunenberg for use at his discretion in the prosecution. Some of this money went to pay [attorneys].&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 351.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the miners, never having been charged with any crime, were eventually allowed to go free, while others were prosecuted. The mine owners developed a permit system aimed at excluding union miners from employment.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 146-148.&lt;/ref&gt;
