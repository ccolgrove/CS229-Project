The '''[[Southern Illinois Salukis]]''' [[college basketball|basketball]] team represents [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], [[Illinois]]. The Salukis compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]]. The Salukis are currently [[coach (basketball)|coached]] by [[Chris Lowery]] who led the team to the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] in 2004 thru 2007. Lowery was the youngest [[head coach]] in the NCAA tournament in 2004 thru 2007. In 2008 the Salukis finished the regular season at 17-14 and advanced to the NIT, where they defeated Oklahoma State University before falling to Arizona State University in the second round. 


==History==
Prior to joining the NCAA, the Salukis competed in the [[NAIA national men's basketball championship|NAIA men's basketball]] level. Appearing 5 times, with a combined tournament record of 8 wins and 5 loses. Most notable tournament appearances came in [[1945 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1945]] in which the Salukis finished 4th, and then the following year in the [[1946 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1946]] tournament, the Salukis won the whole thing. The Salukis would not place again in the following 3 tournament appearances in [[1947 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1947]], [[1948 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1948]], [[1960 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1960]].

In 1967, SIU, led by guard [[Walt Frazier]] who went on to be named one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]], won the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. At the time, the tournament was considered much more prestigious than it is today. The Salukis were members of the College Division, the equivalent of Division II, and were therefore ineligible to compete for the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]].

In 1977, future NBA player [[Mike Glenn]] led the Salukis to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]].

From 1993 to 1995, SIU advanced to three straight [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]. Prior to that, the Salukis participated in the [[National Invitation Tournament]] for four consecutive years from 1989-1992.

Part of the SIU Saluki men's basketball team's 2003 season was chronicled in [[MTV]]'s ''True Life: I Am A College Baller''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Shadowbox Films: | date = 2007 | url = http://www.shadowboxfilms.com/stills_baller_01.html | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saluki men's basketball team garnered national attention by advancing to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]] in [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2002]] and [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007]]. 

In 2006-2007 year, the Salukis reached their highest position in the AP Coaches Poll and the ESPN/USA Today Poll with a position of #11, before dropping to #14 after losing the MVC to Creighton prior to entering the NCAA tournament.

After achieving success at SIU, former coaches [[Bruce Weber (coach)|Bruce Weber]] and [[Matt Painter]] accepted head coaching positions at schools in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]]. Weber took over at [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Illinois]] in 2003 and Painter - an alumnus of and former basketball player at [[Purdue University]] - accepted the [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Boilermakers]]' offer to become top assistant and designated successor to [[Gene Keady]] in 2004, becoming head coach in March 2006.

In 2009, the Salukis lost long time assistant coach to the head coach ranks.  Coach Rodney Watson, following 21 seasons as the backup in Carbondale, accepted the head coaching position at the [[University of Southern Indiana]] in Evansville, IN.  In his first season with the Screamin Eagles, Watson has led his team to a 23-0 record at the NCAA Div II powerhouse, who he took over despite a one year post-season ban as part of the transgressions of the former coaching staff.
