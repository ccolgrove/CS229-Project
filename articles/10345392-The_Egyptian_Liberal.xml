'''Wadah Khanfar''' (ÙØ¶Ø§Ø­ Ø®ÙÙØ±) was the Director General of the [[Al Jazeera]] Network.  He has been ranked by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' as the first in the 100 Most Creative People in Business (2011) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/most-creative-people/2011/wadah-khanfar-al-jazeera&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the most âPowerful People in the Worldâ  by ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/20/power-09_Wadah-Khanfar_3C0V.html | work=Forbes | title=#54 Wadah Khanfar | date=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his tenure Al Jazeera went from a single channel to a media network with multiple properties including the Al Jazeera Arabic channel, Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera Documentary, Al Jazeera Sport, Al Jazeeraâs news websites, the Al Jazeera Media Training and Development Center, the Al Jazeera Center for Studies, Al Jazeera Mubasher (Live), and Al Jazeera Mobile.

On 20 Sep 2011, he stepped down as the head of Al Jazeera Network.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/09/201192012481969884.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/sep/20/al-jazeera-wadah-khanfar-replaced | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ian | last=Black | title=Al-Jazeera boss Wadah Khanfar steps down to be replaced by Qatari royal | date=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and student life==
Khanfar (Youcef Yamma) was born in the [[Israeli]] town of [[Rama]] in 1966 to Arabic family immigrated from the village of Khanfar in south of yemen nearly 200 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+world's+50+most+influential+Arabs%3A+it+is+no+easy+task+in+a+region...-a0201711301 |title=The world's 50 most influential Arabs: it is no easy task in a region raising its profile on an almost daily basis to select the 50 most influential people and, of course, unlike the richest or even the most powerful, such a list must by its very nature remain fairly subjective.

The short answer might be &quot;with difficulty&quot;. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;democracynow1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/3/31/al_jazeera_chief_wadah_khanfar_on |title=Al Jazeera Chief Wadah Khanfar on Obama's Expansion of the Afghan War, US Policy in the Middle East and the Role of Independent Voices in the Media |publisher=Democracynow.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a Bachelor's degree in Engineering between 1985 and 1990 at the [[University of Jordan]] and went on to complete a post-graduate degree in [[Philosophy]], a Diploma in [[African Studies]] from [[Sudan International University]] and an Honors Degree in [[International Politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thepeninsulaqatar.com/component/content/article/349-qatar-newsarchive/114420.html |title=At Jazeera~ we stand by the truth: Khanfar &amp;#124; Qatar News |publisher=Archive.thepeninsulaqatar.com |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Khanfar started a student's union that soon spread to several other universities &lt;ref name=&quot;arabianbusiness1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhoyrul |first=Anil |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/property/article/501973-wadahs-world/page/3/3?template=properties&amp;tmpl=index |title=Wadah Khanfar: Wadah's world |publisher=Arabianbusiness.com |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started an inter-university dialogue group amongst students constituted from a range of political backgrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianbusiness2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/gcc-s-most-admired-executives-wadah-khanfar-88597.html |title=GCC's Most Admired Executives-Wadah Khanfar |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date=2009-12-06 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989 the student's union was playing an active role in debating the future of the democratic process, and Khanfar started making a name for himself as a charismatic and natural leader,&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianbusiness1&quot;/&gt; helping to organize forums, protests, festivals and demonstrations for student rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianbusiness2&quot;/&gt;

==Journalism==
===Africa===
When Al Jazeera was established in 1996, Khanfar was doing graduate study for his International Politics and African Studies qualifications in [[South Africa]] and was a researcher and consultant in Middle Eastern economics and political affairs. He was asked by the channel to provide analysis on African affairs, then became correspondent in South Africa until 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;democracynow1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/newswar/war_interviews.html |title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . News War . Interview With Wadah Khanfar, Director General, Al Jazeera |publisher=PBS |date=1996-11-01 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
In 2001 and 2002 he reported on [[Afghanistan]] from [[New Delhi]]. Al Jazeera was unable to get its own correspondent back into the northern territories controlled by the [[Northern Alliance]] on the eve of the war, so New Delhi was used, India having a strong Northern Alliance diplomatic presence. As the [[Taliban]] regime was collapsing, Al Jazeera's presence in [[Kabul]] was threatened by problems including US fire&lt;ref name=&quot;tbsjournal1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Fall03/stop_press.html |title=TBS 11: Arab Gulf, Arab Satellites |publisher=Tbsjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/03/26/08 |title=Transcript of &quot;Al Jazeera Now&quot; (March 26, 2010) |publisher=On The Media |date=2010-03-26 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concerns from journalists and diplomats that the then bureau chief and correspondent, [[Tayseer Allouni]] had become compromised as a partisan of the Taliban cause. Khanfar was brought in to replace Allouni as Kabul bureau chief and restored working relations with the new authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;tbsjournal1&quot;/&gt;

===Iraq===
During the [[Iraq war]] he reported from [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]]-controlled territory in the north&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccas.georgetown.edu/90631.html |title=Wadah Khanfar, Director General of Al Jazeera, to Deliver 2010 Symposium Keynote Address - Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) - Georgetown University |publisher=Ccas.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'ath regime]], he became Al Jazeera bureau chief in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tbsjournal1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20031029-0852-qatar-al-jazeera.html |title=Wadah Khanfar named as the network's manager |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the channel was widely perceived as playing to popular pro-Baathist and anti-[[Coalition of the willing|Coalition]] Arab sentiment, despite being represented at the Coalition's Central Headquarters and having an Al Jazeera correspondent embedded within coalition forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tbsjournal1&quot;/&gt; US Defence Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and Deputy Defence Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]] publicly criticized Al Jazeera, Rumsfeld calling the channel's reporting &quot;vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable...&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Get your FREE! Nation User Name |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/war-al-jazeera |title=The War on Al Jazeera |publisher=The Nation |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Wolfowitz claimed the station was &quot;inciting violence&quot; and &quot;endangering the lives of American troops&quot; in Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoclearinghouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4284.htm |title=Robert Fisk:Al-Jazeera Accuses US of Harassment in Row Over &quot;Bias&quot; |publisher=Informationclearinghouse.info |date=2003-07-30 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This public criticism came amid attacks on Al Jazeera from US forces, including the shelling of a hotel in [[Basra]] on 8 April 2003 used solely by the channel's correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Deans |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/apr/02/broadcasting.iraq1 |title=Al-Jazeera's Basra hotel bombed &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; MediaGuardian |publisher=Guardian |date= 2003-04-02|accessdate=2011-05-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a week later, US forces bombed the station's Baghdad offices wounding one cameraman and killing a correspondent, [[Tariq Ayoub]]&lt;ref name=&quot;infoclearinghouse&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Steele in Amman |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/apr/09/iraq.guardianobituaries |title=Tareq Ayyoub &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2003-04-09|accessdate=2011-05-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the same day that two [[Reuters]] journalists were killed when a US tank shell struck their office in the [[Palestine Hotel]]. In July, Khanfar wrote an open letter to [[Paul Bremer]], the US proconsul in Iraq responding to his assertion that television stations or newspapers guilty of &quot;incitement to violence&quot; would be shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoclearinghouse&quot;/&gt; Khanfar wrote that his offices and staff had been subject to &quot;strafing by gunfire, death threats, confiscation of news material, and multiple detentions and arrests, all carried out by US soldiers&quot;, asserting that the channel's coverage had been consistently harassed for unfavourable reporting during the Ba'athist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoclearinghouse&quot;/&gt; He also said that because Al Jazeera at that time was only available in Arabic, reliance on the channel's coverage came &quot;from second-, third- and fourth-hand sources - half-truths and total falsehoods that make the rounds in Washington, Baghdad and elsewhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baghdadbulletin.com/pageArticle.php?article_id=157 |title=Independent Iraq news |publisher=Baghdad Bulletin |date=2003-08-31 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Al Jazeera executive==
Khanfar became Managing Director of the Al Jazeera Channel in 2003 and Director General of the Al Jazeera Network in 2006. He spoke at the 2011 [[TED (conference)|TED Conference]] on the ongoing [[Middle East protests]].&lt;ref&gt;TED.com (2011). [http://www.ted.com/talks/wadah_khanfar_a_historic_moment_in_the_arab_world.html Wadah Khanfar: A historic moment in the Arab world]. Retrieved May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2011, Khanfar announced on his official Twitter page that he was 'moving on' from Al Jazeera after leading the channel for 8 years.

==Criticism==
[[Al Jazeera]] has been criticized by a range of people on a number of issues. A common criticism leveled at the organization is that stories and events occurring in Qatar, where the organization is based and whose government funds the channel, were slanted or never mentioned at all.

Wadah Khanfar has been accused by some of a pro-[[Islamist]] bias.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated82&quot;&gt;Ferjani, Riadh, Middle East Journal of Culture and Communication, Volume 3, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 82-100(19). p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to these accusations in a 2007 interview with ''[[The Nation]]'', Khanfar said: &quot;Islam is more of a factor now in the influential political and social spheres of the Arab world, and the networkâs coverage reflects that. Maybe you have more Islamic voices [on the network] because of the political reality on the ground&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated82&quot;/&gt; In June 2007, Hafez Al-Mirazi, Al-Jazeeraâs [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] Bureau Chief, denounced what he saw as the station's &quot;Islamist drift&quot;, and singled out Khanfar in particular, saying: &quot;From the first day of the Wadah Khanfar era, there was a dramatic change, especially because of him selecting assistants who are hardline [[Islamists]].&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated82&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Iraq War]], Al Jazeera broadcast a report that American troops had raided [[Najaf]] and detained the religious leaders of the [[Shia]] Islamic community, which turned out to be false. Khanfar defended the blunder as an honest mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Culture wars: the Arabic music video controversy&quot;, American Univ in Cairo Press, 2005, (p. 126)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Udeid Air Base]] which served as a logistics hub for U.S. operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].
[[As Saliyah Army Base]], the largest pre-positioning facility of U.S. equipment in the world, served as the forward command center for [[CENTCOM]] personnel during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], and [[Israel]] trade office in [[Qatar]]. Khanfar is also criticized to favor and be biased towards the [[Hamas]] political party in the [[Palestinian Territories]], as oppose to the [[Palestinian Authority]] run by [[Fatah]].

==WikiLeaks==
In September 2011, the non-profit [[whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]] released a cache of [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked diplomatic cables]] highlighting U.S. activities overseas. Several of the cables implicated Khanfar in unduly influencing Al Jazeera's news coverage of the [[War in Iraq]] at the behest of U.S. embassy officials in [[Qatar]]. In one instance, the cables suggested that Khanfar removed images of wounded Iraqi civilians from an Al Jazeera report following pressure by the U.S. embassy. They also suggested that Khanfar was anxious to keep his behind-the-scenes collaboration secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/world/middleeast/after-disclosures-by-wikileaks-al-jazeera-replaces-its-top-news-director.html After Disclosures by WikiLeaks, Al Jazeera Replaces Its Top News Director], ''The New York Times'', 20 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resignation==
In September 2011, Khanfar announced to his staff and publicly on the micro-blogging platform [http://twitter.com/#!/khanfarw/status/116129259717795841 Twitter] that he will be resigning. In an emotional farewell to [[Al Jazeera]] staff he cites that the decision had been in his mind for sometime and that the target of establishing [[Al Jazeera]] as a global media leader has been met. This is also the theme of an interview broadcast on Al Jazeera where he addresses and refutes suggestions that Wikileaks and pressure from USA may have influenced his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==First visit to the United States==
In July 2009, Khanfar was invited to the United States by leading political and media think tanks including the [[Middle East Institute]], [[New America Foundation]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and [[George Washington University]]. This was the first time that a Director General from Al Jazeera has visited the US.  During the visit Khanfar also met with senior officials and advisors at the [[White House]], [[United States Department of State]] and [[the Pentagon]] and perhaps signals a change in the inner circles of the government to dialogue with Al Jazeera under the new administration of President [[Barack Obama]]. On the visit to the US, Khanfar appeared on the ''[[Charlie Rose Show]]'', [[NPR]]âs [[Diane Rehm]] show, and presented at the [[Paley Center for Media]].

Khanfar spoke at the 2011 [[TED Conference]] on the ongoing civil uprisings in the [[Arab Spring]].
