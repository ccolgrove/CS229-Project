'''Gnus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|É¡|áµ|Ë|n|uË|z}}) is a message reader running under [[GNU]] [[GNU Emacs|Emacs]] and [[XEmacs]]. It supports reading and composing both [[Usenet|news]] and [[e-mail]].

Gnus blurs the distinction between news and e-mail, treating them both as &quot;articles&quot; that come from different sources. News articles are kept separate by group, and e-mail can be split into arbitrary groups, similar to folders in other mail readers. In addition, Gnus is able to use a number of [[World Wide Web|web]]-based sources as inputs for its groups.

Note that, as with ''GNU'', the ''g'' in ''Gnus'' is always pronounced.

== Features ==
Some Gnus features:
* simple or advanced mail splitting (automatic sorting of incoming mail to user-defined groups)
* incoming mail can be set to expire instead of just plain deletion
* custom posting styles (e.g. From address, .signature etc.) for each group
* virtual groups (e.g., directory on the computer can be read as a group)
* an advanced message scoring system
* user-defined hooks for almost any method (in emacs lisp)
* many of the parameters (e.g., expiration, posting style) can be specified individually for all of the groups

Gnus can also be integrated into the Big Brother Database to handle contacts in a highly automated fashion.

Some people{{Who|date=March 2009}} say there is no feature (or something similar) in any [[Email client|MUA]] Gnus doesn't have â or if there isn't one ready, it can be done &quot;easily&quot; with few lines of emacs lisp.

To quote the Gnus Manual:

:''&quot;You know that Gnus gives you all the opportunity you'd ever want for shooting yourself in the foot. Some people call it flexibility. Gnus is also customizable to a great extent, which means that the user has a say on how Gnus behaves. Other newsreaders might unconditionally shoot you in your foot, but with Gnus, you have a choice!&quot;'' [http://www.gnus.org/manual/gnus_215.html#SEC215]

Note that the composition of HTML email messages (as users of more [[WYSIWYG]] editors may be used to) is not included by default, as this is not counted as a &quot;feature&quot; in the Unix-based setting where Gnus would typically be used.

== History ==
'''Gnus''' is a [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] of GNUS, which ceased to be developed in 1992, by Masanobu Umeda. In autumn&lt;!-- See the old Gnus FAQ: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/gnus-faq/ --&gt; 1994, [[Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen]] started the rewrite under the name ''(ding)'' which is a [[recursive acronym]] for ''ding is not Gnus'', intending to produce a version for which the interface and configuration would work almost exactly the same, but the internals would be completely revamped and improved.

=== Versions ===
The following versions have been released since then:
* Gnus 5 ((ding) Gnus) â November [[1995]]
** Gnus 5.1 rebranded 5.0.13 bundled with GNU Emacs 19.30/19.31&lt;ref name=&quot;faqs.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/gnus-faq/ |title=Gnus (Emacs Newsreader) FAQ |publisher=Internet FAQ Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gnus 5.2 (September Gnus) â May [[1996]]
** Gnus 5.3 rebranded 5.2.38 bundled with GNU Emacs 19.32 and all later versions of GNU Emacs 19.x&lt;ref name=&quot;faqs.org&quot;/&gt;
* Gnus 5.4 (Red Gnus) â January 25, 1997
** Gnus 5.5 rebranded 5.4 bundled with GNU Emacs 20.1 (September 17, 1997) and also included in XEmacs 20.4
* Gnus 5.6 (Quassia Gnus) â March 8, 1998
* Gnus 5.8 (Pterodactyl Gnus) â December 3, 1999
* Gnus 5.10 (Oort Gnus) â May 1, 2003
** Gnus 5.11 rebranded 5.10 bundled with GNU Emacs 22.1 (June 2, 2007)
* Gnus 5.13 (included in [[GNU Emacs]] 23.1 (July 29, 2009) from No Gnus branch)

The named versions (whose first letters run backwards in the alphabet) are development versions, of &quot;[[Development stage#Alpha|alpha]]&quot; quality.

The current development version which will be released as Gnus 5.12 was begun on Jan 4, 2004 and is called ''No Gnus''.

The odd version numbers, like 5.3 and 5.5 are for the Gnus versions bundled with [[GNU]] [[Emacs]]. The even version numbers are the unbundled releases. So for example, Gnus 5.5 is similar to Gnus 5.4, but bundled with Emacs 20.1.
