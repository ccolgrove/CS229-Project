The '''[[2007 NFL season|2007]] [[Green Bay Packers]] season''' was the franchise's 89th overall and 87th season in the [[National Football League]]. The Packers finished the regular season with an impressive 13-3 record. They received a [[Bye (sports)|bye]] for the first round of the [[NFL playoffs, 2007â08|playoffs]], won their divisional round playoff game, and lost in the [[NFC Championship]] game to the eventual [[Super Bowl]] champion [[New York Giants]]. This was the last season for quarterback [[Brett Favre]] as a Green Bay Packer.

This season also marked the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Packers' home stadium of [[Lambeau Field]]. The Packers' tenure at Lambeau, now at 52 seasons, is the longest in NFL history at a single stadium, breaking the [[Chicago Bears]]' previous record of 50 seasons at [[Wrigley Field]] (1921â1970).

== Offseason ==
On February 2, 2007, [[Brett Favre]] announced that he would return for the 2007 season.  &quot;I am so excited about coming back,&quot; the 37-year-old quarterback said on the website of ''[[The Sun Herald]]'' in [[Biloxi]], [[Mississippi]]. He also commented, &quot;We have a good nucleus of young players. We were 8-8 last year, and that's encouraging.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;returnNFL.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/GB/9970509 | title  =  Packers' Favre to play in 2007 | publisher = NFL.com | date = 2007-02-02 | accessdate = 2007-02-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203235520/http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/GB/9970509  |archivedate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;returnPackers.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://packers.com/news/releases/2007/02/02/1/ | title = Favre to return in 2007 | publisher = Packers.com | date = 2007-02-02 | accessdate = 2007-02-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070204013335/http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2007/02/02/1/  |archivedate = 2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;returnSunHerald&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sunherald.com/fmld/sunherald/16607933.htm | title = Favre to play in 2007 | work = The Sun Herald | date = 2007-02-02 | accessdate = 2007-02-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ted Thompson, Green Bay's general manager, confirmed the news, saying, &quot;The Packers are excited by his decision and look forward to a successful 2007 campaign.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tedthompson&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/GB/9970509 | title = Favre to return for 17th season | publisher = NFL.com | date = 2007-02-02 | accessdate = 2007-02-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203235520/http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/GB/9970509  |archivedate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be, however, Brett Favre's last season with the Packers.

=== 2007 NFL draft ===
The [[2007 NFL Draft]] occurred on April 28-29. The Packers picked 16th overall, selecting [[defensive tackle]] [[Justin Harrell]] in the first round.&lt;ref name=&quot;draftorder&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nfldraftcountdown.com/features/draftorder.html | title = 2007 NFL Draft Order | publisher = NFLDraftCountdown.com | accessdate =  2007-02-03| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wiT7Q1YY | archivedate = 2011-02-23| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, the Packers were in talks with [[Oakland Raiders]] wide receiver [[Randy Moss]] at the behest of Brett Favre.&lt;ref name=&quot;mosstrade&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/sports/16655406.htm | title = Randy Moss would fit with Favre and Packers | publisher = mercurynews.com | work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | last = Hunt | first = Michael | date = 2007-02-08 | accessdate = 2007-02-11| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wiT8ByM9 | archivedate = 2011-02-23| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Packers had made the move to acquire the 30 year-old [[wide receiver]], the trade would no doubt have been a controversial one, as Moss has a long and storied history with the Green Bay franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;mosstrade&quot; /&gt; While Moss's salary was high, Green Bay, at the time, reportedly had $24 million of cap space, and could have absorbed his contract easily.&lt;ref name=&quot;mosstrade2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nfl.com/news/story/9988414 | title = With games over, it's down to business | last = Kirwan | first = Pat | publisher = NFL.com | date = 2007-02-13 | accessdate = 2007-02-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070220000304/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9988414  |archivedate = 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors were put to an end on 29 April 2007, when Oakland dealt Moss to New England for a 4th round draft pick.&lt;ref name=&quot;mossNE&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nfl.com/nflnetwork/story/10156954 | title = Raiders send WR Moss to Patriots | publisher = NFL.com | last = Schefter | first = Adam | date = 2007-04-29 | accessdate = 2007-04-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070501031922/http://nfl.com/nflnetwork/story/10156954  |archivedate = 2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days following the NFL draft, Favre was upset concerning Green Bay's inability to acquire Moss.&lt;ref name=&quot;upsetFavre&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/6805790?MSNHPHMA | title = Favre asked for trade after draft | last = Glazer | first = Jay | publisher = Fox Sports | date = 2007-05-14 | accessdate = 2007-05-15| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wiT8l4BS | archivedate = 2011-02-23| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favre was reportedly so upset that his agent requested that the Packers trade him.&lt;ref name=&quot;upsetFavre&quot; /&gt; Coach Mike McCarthy was able to calm Favre down over the phone, and Favre eventually admitted that while he wanted to win, he did not want to be traded in order to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;upsetFavre&quot; /&gt;

The Packers began their season at home against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. In the first quarter, Green Bay's [[Jarrett Bush]] recovered the Eagles' [[Greg Lewis (wide receiver)|Greg Lewis]]'s muffed punt in the end zone for a touchdown. The contest was tied in the closing minutes but the Eagles again muffed a punt return, setting up a 42-yard game-winning kick from Packers rookie kicker [[Mason Crosby]]. This was the only game the Packers did not score an offensive touchdown.

Playing a close game until the fourth quarter, the Packers took a commanding lead late in the game (racking up 21 points in the final fifteen minutes) and winning the game 35-13. Early in the 4th quarter, Favre capped off a drive with a pass to the outside of the endzone to Donald Lee, and then followed it up with a 10-yard pass to Donald Driver by the goalpost for a score after the Giants fumbled the ensuing kickoff deep in their own territory. In the victory, Brett Favre threw for 286&amp;nbsp;yards and 3 touchdowns and gave him his 149th career win as a starter, the most by any [[quarterback]] in NFL history, surpassing [[John Elway]]. Favre was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for games played September 16-17.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlayeroftheWeek&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2007/09/19/5/ | title = Brett Favre Named NFC Offensive Player Of The Week | publisher = Packers.com | accessdate =  2007-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071226181953/http://packers.com/news/releases/2007/09/19/5/ |archivedate = 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike McCarthy was voted the Motorola NFL Coach of the Week.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoachoftheWeek&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2007/09/21/2/ | title = Mike McCarthy Named NFL Coach Of The Week  | publisher = Packers.com | accessdate =  2007-10-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080115161607/http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2007/09/21/2/ |archivedate = 2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With just over two minutes remaining in the game and San Diego leading 21-17, Favre found wide receiver [[Greg Jennings]] for a 57-yard catch-and-run across the middle of the field for the go ahead score. On the Chargers ensuing drive, linebacker Nick Barnett intercepted a [[Philip Rivers]] pass and returned it to the San Diego 1-yard line setting up the Packers final score and a 10 point lead.

Coming off a record-setting divisional road game against the Vikings, the Packers went home for a Sunday night divisional clash with their arch-nemesis, the [[Chicago Bears]]. This would be the 174th meeting between the two teams.

In the first quarter, Green Bay got off to a fast start by capping off the game's opening drive with rookie RB [[DeShawn Wynn]] getting a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears tied the game with RB  [[Cedric Benson|Cedric Benson's]] 10-yard TD run. The Packers would end the first half with QB [[Brett Favre]] completing a 41-yard TD pass to WR [[Greg Jennings]], along with rookie kicker [[Mason Crosby]] converting a 37-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, Chicago crept closer with kicker [[Robbie Gould]] converting a 44-yard field goal. Green Bay responded with Crosby kicking a 37-yard field goal, yet the Bears pulled to within three as QB [[Brian Griese]] completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE [[Greg Olsen (American football)|Greg Olsen]]. In the fourth quarter, Chicago erased their deficit completely with Gould's 36-yard field goal and Griese's 34-yard TD pass to TE [[Desmond Clark]].

With a turnover-plagued loss (5 turnovers on the night), the Packers fell to 4-1. Also, with two interceptions, Favre tied QB [[George Blanda]] at 277 for the most career interceptions.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web  | last = Walter  | first = David | title = Mistakes hurt Packers in first loss of the season | url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=/nfl/news/ABN4106874.htm | accessdate = 2006-04-30 }} {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also of note, [[Brady Poppinga]] intercepted a pass in the fourth quarter, extending the streak of at least one Packer interception per game for the 11th consecutive game.

Following their bye week, the Packers flew to Denver to take on the Broncos on [[Monday Night Football]].

In the second quarter, rookie kicker [[Mason Crosby]] converted a 19&amp;nbsp;yard field goal, followed by a 26&amp;nbsp;yard field goal, and the Packers took a 13-7 lead into halftime.

In the third quarter, Broncos kicker [[Jason Elam]] converted a 45&amp;nbsp;yard field goal to cut Green Bay's lead to 3 points. In the fourth quarter, after getting the ball back with 2:27 remaining in the game, Cutler led a drive that began on the Bronco seven yard line down the length of the field to the Green Bay four yard line. On a 3rd and 1 Cutler attempted a quarterback draw to win the game, but [[Ryan Pickett]] stopped Cutler for no gain on the play. With no time outs remaining Elam and the kicking unit ran onto the field and converted a field goal to tie the game on the final play of the quarter.

[[Greg Jennings]] called heads and won the overtime coin toss, allowing Green Bay to receive the ball to begin overtime. On the first play, Favre threw an 82&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass to Jennings, who had outrun Bronco cornerback [[DrÃ© Bly]] for the catch.
