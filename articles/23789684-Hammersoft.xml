'''Disney Channel''' is a  [[Bulgarian language]] children's television channel that began broadcasting on September 19, [[2009]] (as announced in a TV promo), after replacing [[Jetix (Central and Eastern Europe)|Jetix CEE]]. &lt;!--The launch date is expected to be sometime in September 2009 (as is for the [[Disney Channel Romania|Romanian version]])&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;http://standard.money.ro/articol_102854/disney_channel_is_to_be_launched_in_romania_in_september.html ''Disney Channel is to be launched in Romania in September'', Money.ro, 2009-07-13&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, even though no exact date has been stated.--&gt; Like all new [[Central and Eastern Europe|CEE]] Disney Channels, it will be operated under a formal agreement by Jetix Europe NV to lease its channels to sister company, Disney Channels EMEA (in both of which Giorgio Stock is part of the company management).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waidev2.com/php/PDFS/STUDIO_v2_Asset_Library/3490---PDF.pdf ''Jetix Europe NV - Extraordinary General Meeting - Minutes of Meeting'', 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Like Jetix CEE, Disney Channel will be distributed in Bulgaria by [[Media Link]], who will also provide translation for the channel's series.
==Founding and history==

The channel was founded in 1999 as [[Fox Kids]] Central and Eastern Europe, following the 1996 start of the UK channel of the same name (now [[Disney XD (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney XD]]). Fox Kids' programming consisted mostly of older shows from [[Fox Children's Productions]], which were aired in the [[US]] Fox Kids block, and shows from its co-owners, [[Saban International]]. Saban also supplied the channel with the series from the [[Marvel animated universe]]. Most Bulgarian operators made it available in 1999, often with Russian audio. Later, they mostly switched to the English track.

Meanwhile, in 2000 a new Bulgarian channel [[bTV]] owned by [[News Corporation]] at that time launched and had a [[Fox Kids]] block, which aired on weekday afternoons and weekend mornings. In 2004 the Fox Kids block was renamed to Jetix. The block was removed in 2008, although bTV still airs shows from Jetix, but not part of any block.

In 2001, [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced its intention to buy Fox Kids' majority owner, [[Fox Family Worldwide]], along with [[Haim Saban]]'s entertainment companies, which in turn partly owned Fox Family. After the deal, new original programming got less than before, as Saban's animation studio was not bought by Disney and was split off as a separate company - [[SIP Animation]]. In 2002, Disney created the [[Jetix]] brand, set to replace Fox Kids (the name of which was related [[20th Century Fox]]). However, it only appeared in Europe in 2004 as a block on all Fox Kids channels. Finally, on January 1, 2005 all channels were re-branded to Jetix.

After [[Robert Iger]] became Disney's new chief executive officer, the company started to rename some of its properties in order to focus more on its key brands - [[Disney]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and perhaps [[ESPN]]. Maybe as a result of this, in [[2008]] Disney announced it would close its US [[Toon Disney]] channel, along with its [[Jetix]] programming block, and replace it with Disney XD - a new channel aimed at a different audience (boys aged from 6â14 years) with more action-oriented shows. After [[Disney XD]] successfully launched on February 13, 2009 in the US, the [[Disney-ABC Television]] Group re-branded Jetix France to Disney XD on April 1, 2009 and it was expected to be rolled out to other European territories in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney XD&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 2009, however, Disney announced that the Jetix channel in certain countries (namely [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Bulgaria]]) will be renamed to [[The Disney Channel]], marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. An exact date was not mentioned but it was expected that the change would happen by the end of [[2009]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney Channel&quot;&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=18685 Jetix to become Disney] - ''Broadband TV News'', by Chris Dziadul, published and retrieved: 2009-05-26&lt;/ref&gt; The first Disney Channel promos, which appeared on Jetix CEE on July 8, simply said &quot;coming soon&quot;, but on August 2, new promos appeared that stated the launch date as September 19, 2009. It was also announced to the media a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novini.dir.bg/2009/08/04/news4868275.html Disney Channel ÑÑÑÐ³Ð²Ð° Ð² ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¾Ñ 19 ÑÐµÐ¿ÑÐµÐ¼Ð²ÑÐ¸] Ekip News/news.dir.bg, 2009-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian and Romanian versions of the Disney Channel broadcast as a single video feed with two different audio channels for each language. At the commercial break ident it shows just the Romanian word for &quot;commercials&quot;:&quot;RECLAME&quot;, without showing the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] word for commercials : Ð ÐÐÐÐÐÐ. ,like the Central Europe version of Disney Channel, where it shows first:&quot;REKLAMA&quot;, then&quot;REKLÃM&quot;. Before rebranding, it was showing &quot;RECLAME&quot;, then &quot;Ð ÐÐÐÐÐÐ&quot; on Jetix. On May 1, 2011 Disney Channel adopted new look and logo and it was announced that the [[Playhouse Disney ]] block will be rebranded to [[Disney Junior]] on June 1 2011.

==Shows==

This version of Disney Channel (similarly to the Central European one) aims to air mostly new content produced by Disney Channels Worldwide and selected programs from Disney XD, since that channel is still unavailable in the area. It also airs a selection of animated series produced after 2002. Since the launch, the remaining Jetix animated series have been pushed to the night timeslot, with [[H2O: Just Add Water]] being the only past Jetix series to air regularly during daytime.
