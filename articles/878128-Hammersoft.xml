He played in [[Major League Baseball]] as a [[catcher]] for the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1977â1986), [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (1987â1988), [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (1989â1992), [[Seattle Mariners]] (1992), [[Cleveland Indians]] (1993), [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (1994), and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Parrish at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/parrila02.shtml Lance Parrish at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded as one of the best catchers in the 1980s, for both his offensive and defensive play.&lt;ref name=&quot;''They Earned Their Stripes: The Detroit Tigers' All-Time Team. Honoring a Detroit Legend''&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=5BRxw4nSqXUC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=lance+parrish&amp;lr=&amp;rview=1&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=lance%20parrish&amp;f=false ''They Earned Their Stripes: The Detroit Tigers' All-Time Team. Honoring a Detroit Legend'', Detroit News, Sports Publishing LLC, 2001, ISBN 1582613656, 9781582613659]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major League career==
Parrish was drafted as a [[third baseman]] by the Detroit Tigers in the first round of the [[1974 Major League Baseball draft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebaseballcube.com/draft/1974.shtml 1974 Major League Baseball Draft at The Baseball Cube]&lt;/ref&gt; While playing for the [[Lakeland Tigers]] in the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]], he was converted to a catcher.&lt;ref name=&quot;''They Earned Their Stripes: The Detroit Tigers' All-Time Team. Honoring a Detroit Legend''&quot;/&gt; He reached the major leagues in [[1977 Detroit Tigers season|1977]] on a part time basis, and by [[1979 Detroit Tigers season|1979]] he had replaced [[Milt May]] as the team's regular catcher. In 1979, he also played winter baseball in Puerto Rico with the [[Mayaguez Indians]]. Parrish hit for a .286 [[batting average]] along with 24 [[home run]]s and 82 [[runs batted in]] during the [[1980 Detroit Tigers season|1980]] season to earn his first American League [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team berth, as well as winning his first [[Silver Slugger Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Parrish at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;

Parrish's most productive offensive season was [[1982 Detroit Tigers season|1982]] when he posted a .284 [[batting average]] with 32 [[home run]]s and 87 [[runs batted in]], winning another Silver Slugger Award in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Parrish at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He followed that in [[1983 Detroit Tigers season|1983]] with 27 home runs and 114 runs batted in, earning his third Silver Slugger Award, as well as winning his first [[Gold Glove Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Parrish at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Parrish was an integral member of the world championship-winning [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|1984]] Detroit Tigers team. Batting as the [[Batting order (baseball)|clean-up hitter]], he produced 33 home runs and 98 runs batted in, adding another Silver Slugger Award as well as a second Gold Glove Award to his credentials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Parrish at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He also caught [[Jack Morris]]' [[no-hitter]] on April 7 of that season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1984/B04070CHA1984.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Tigers led the [[American League East|American League Eastern Division]] season from start to finish, then defeated the [[1984 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] in the [[1984 American League Championship Series]], before winning the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DET/1984-schedule-scores.shtml 1984 Detroit Tigers schedule and results at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1984_ALCS.shtml 1984 American League Championship Series at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1984_WS.shtml 1984 World Series at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After ten years with the Tigers, Parrish signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as a [[free agent]] before the [[1987 Philadelphia Phillies season|1987]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=parrila02 Lance Parrish Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillies made their slogan for the season &quot;Lance us a Pennant.&quot; He quickly fell out of favor with the Philadelphia fans and media in his second season there as a result of poor offensive output, ranking near the bottom of full time major league players in 1988 with a .215 batting average. Afterwards, he played three seasons and parts of a fourth with the California Angels before ending his career with short stints for the Mariners, Indians, Pirates and Blue Jays. Parrish was also with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in spring training 1993, but he failed to make the squad as rookie [[Mike Piazza]]'s performance showed the club that Piazza was ready to be a starting major-league catcher. Parrish also signed to return to the Tigers in 1994, but his contract was purchased by the Pirates before he ever got back to the majors with Detroit. He signed with the Royals in 1995 but was traded to Toronto before he appeared in any major league games with Kansas City. He signed once again with Pittsburgh in 1996, but did not make the team.
