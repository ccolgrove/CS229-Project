== Versions ==
The FastStone Image Viewer was first released in [[2004]] by FastStone Soft. Since then, a new stable version of the program has been released every few weeks to few months.

Since version 3.1, a multilingual version has been available, supporting [[Chinese language|Simplified and Traditional Chinese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]],  [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

This Windows program is provided in three forms: as a normal-install executable, a zip file of the same, or as a fully portable no-install zip file.

According to FastStone, version 2.7 and all previous releases have been found to be using improperly licensed images and icons, and as a result, FastStone requested that version 2.7 and older copies of FastStone Image Viewer cease to be used, with all licenses updated to version 2.8 for both free and commercial versions. This announcement was made on their web site the same date that version 2.8 was posted.

== Issues ==
* As of version 4.2, resizing of animations (i.e. animated GIFs) is not supported. Thus they can only be viewed at 100% scale, this includes thumbnails.
* When the program starts, a delay may occur as the thumbnail view is managed, more so the first time when the thumbnail cache database is built.
* [[Unicode]] is unsupported.
