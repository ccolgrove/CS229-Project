'''Win4Lin''' was a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[software]] application for [[Linux]] which allowed users to run a copy of [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows 95|95]], [[Windows 98|98]], [[Windows Me|Me]], [[Windows 2000|2000]] or [[Windows XP|XP]] applications on their [[Linux]] desktop.&lt;ref&gt;http://win4lin.com/wp/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The system worked by acting in a similar way to a [[virtual machine]], in that it provides an environment for the Windows operating system to run, and as such one must have a copy of Windows to use with it.

The Win4Lin application in essence displayed a window on a Linux desktop which contained the Windows desktop environment. As an alternative, the Windows environment could be run full screen, outside of the desktop environment to save on desktop real estate.

Win4Lin was designed with business users in mind, and as such, did not support features such as [[MIDI]], in favor of support for [[Microsoft Office]]-style application compatibility.

==History==
Win4Lin was based on [[Merge_(software)|Merge]] software developed by engineers at [[Locus Computing Corporation]], founded by [[Gerald J. Popek]] and others in 1982, which was later taken over by a company called [[Platinum Technology]]. 'Merge' was originally developed to run [[DOS]]/[[Windows 3.1]] under UNIX System V Release 2 on an AT&amp;T 6300+ personal computer that contained an [[Intel 80286]] processor.   AT&amp;T announced availability on October 9, 1985, referring to the bundled Merge software as [[SimulTask]].  Later Merge was enhanced to make use of the [[virtual 8086 mode|VM86 mode]] provided by the [[Intel 80386]] processor; that version was offered with [[Microport]] SVR3 starting in 1987, and subsequently with [[SCO Group|SCO Unix]].

The Merge technology was then bought by a company called [[DASCOM]] which was in turn bought by [[IBM]]. A company called TreLOS was then spun off that continued the development of the virtual machine software and created Win4Lin. TreLOS and LastFoot.com merged in [[2000]] to form '''NeTraverse''', Inc.

In early 2005 the assets of NeTraverse were purchased to form '''Win4Lin Inc.''' which introduced '''Win4Lin Pro Desktop''' - this was based on a 'tuned' version of [[QEMU]], and '''KQEMU''' and it hosted [Windows NT]-versions of Windows.  In June 2006, Win4Lin released '''Win4VDI for Linux''' based on the same code base.  Win4VDI for Linux served Microsoft Windows desktops to thin clients from a Linux server.


Win4Lin Pro used &quot;full&quot; virtualization, whereas Win4Lin 9x was an example of [[paravirtualization]]. Many users reported that the 9x version ran windows software at near-native speed, even on quite low-powered machines, such as Pentium-IIs.

Virtual Bridges discontinued support for '''Win4Lin 9x''' in 2007.  The product Win4Lin Pro Desktop, itself, ceased to be supported in March 2010.  [[Virtual Bridges]] now sells a VDI product, [[Virtual Bridges VERDE|VERDE]] with antecedents in Win4VDI for Linux.
