'''Kananginak Pootoogook''' (1 January 1935 - 23 November 2010), was an [[Inuit|Inuk]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[printmaking|printmaker]] who lived in [[Cape Dorset]], [[Nunavut]]. He died as a result of complications related to surgery for [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2010/11/25/north-pootoogook-obit.html|title=Inuit artist Kananginak Pootoogook dies|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Pootoogook was born at a traditional Inuit camp called [[Ikerasak]], near Cape Dorset, Nunavut (then in the [[Northwest Territories]]) to Josephie Pootoogook, leader of the camp, and Sarah Ningeokuluk. The family lived a traditional lifestyle hunting and trapping while living in an ''[[igloo|iglu]]'' in the winter and a sod house in the summer and did not move into their first southern style house until 1942. In 1957 Pootoogook married Shooyoo, moved to Cape Dorset and began work for [[James Archibald Houston|James Houston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tgam&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = The guiding voice of Cape Dorset artists chronicled the Inuit past | author = Sandra Martin | url = http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20101204.OBKANANGINAKPOOTOOGOOKATL//TPStory/Obituaries | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | publisher = Phillip Crawley | location = Toronto, Canada | date = 4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Pootoogook did some carving, made prints and [[Lithography|lithographs]] for other artists. At the same time he was a leader in setting up the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative, the first Inuit owned [[Cooperative|co-op]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorsetfinearts.com/about2.html West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative]&lt;/ref&gt; now part of the [[Arctic Co-operatives Limited]] and served from 1959 until 1964 as the president. Although Kananginak had worked with his father, Josephie, in 1959, it was not until the 1970s that Kananginak began work as a full time artist producing drawings, carvings and prints. According to Terry Ryan, former Co-op manager, Pootoogook was both influenced by and an admirer of the works of his uncle, photographer and historian [[Peter Pitseolak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tgam&quot;/&gt;

The World Wildlife Commission released a limited edition set in 1977 that included four of Pootoogook's images and in 1980 he was elected to the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]. In 1997 Pootoogook built a {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}} [[inukshuk]] in Cape Dorset for former [[Governor General of Canada]], [[RomÃ©o LeBlanc]]. The inukshuk was dismantled and shipped to [[Ottawa]] and with the assistance of his son, Johnny, it was rebuilt at [[Rideau Hall]] and unveiled on 21 June, [[National Aboriginal Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tgam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rideau&quot;&gt;[http://archive.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=92 The Unveiling of an Inuksuk at Rideau Hall]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pootoogook had several exhibitions and showings of his work. In 2010, he went to [[Vancouver]] for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] and to open a showing of his work at the Marion Scott Gallery. He also had a showing of his work, his first solo exhibition at a public institution, at the [[Museum of Inuit Art]] in [[Toronto]] from February to May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miamuseum.ca/pdf/April2010Newsletter.pdf Museum of Inuit Art]&lt;/ref&gt; He also received a 2010 [[National Aboriginal Achievement Awards|National Aboriginal Achievement Award]] in the arts category from the [[National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tgam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naaf.ca/node/2752 2010 National Aboriginal Achievement Award recipients announced]&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on his final, and unfinished, drawing of a Peterhead owned by his father, he was struck by coughing spells, which he declared was cancer. Along with his wife, Shooyoo, he flew to Ottawa, staying at the Larga Baffin home, and was diagnosed with lung cancer. In October 2010, he underwent surgery and did not recover. He died 23 November 2010 in Ottawa.  He is survived by his wife, seven children and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and is buried in Cape Dorset.&lt;ref name=&quot;tgam&quot;/&gt;
