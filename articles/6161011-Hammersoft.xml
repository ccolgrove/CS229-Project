The '''Florida Gators football''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[American football]].  The Florida Gators compete in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA) and the Eastern Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  They play their home games in [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Will Muschamp]].  The Gators have won three national championships and eight SEC titles in the 106-season history of their varsity football program.
{{TOClimit|3}}
== Overview ==

The University of Florida (then known as the &quot;[[History of the University of Florida|University of the State of Florida]]&quot;) first fielded an official [[varsity (sports)|varsity]] football team in the fall of [[1906 Florida Gators football team|1906]], when the newly consolidated university moved to its new campus in Gainesville.  Since then, the Gators football program has evolved from its very humble origins, and has achieved notable successes.  The Gators have played in thirty-eight bowl games; won three national championships ([[1997 Sugar Bowl|1996]], [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|2006]], and [[2009 BCS National Championship Game|2008]]), and eight [[Southeastern Conference]] championships ([[1991 Florida Gators football team|1991]], [[1993 Florida Gators football team|1993]], [[1994 Florida Gators football team|1994]], [[1995 Florida Gators football team|1995]], [[1996 Florida Gators football team|1996]], [[2000 Florida Gators football team|2000]], [[2006 Florida Gators football team|2006]], [[2008 Florida Gators football team|2008]]); and produced eighty-two first-team [[All-American]]s, forty-two [[National Football League]] (NFL) first-round [[NFL Draft|draft]] choices, and three [[Heisman Trophy]] winners.  Since 1990, the Gators have won more games (210) than any other college football team in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as &quot;Division I-A&quot;).&lt;ref name=stassen20&gt;Stassen.com, [http://football.stassen.com/cgi-bin/records/calc-wp.pl?start=1990&amp;end=2010&amp;rpct=30&amp;min=5&amp;se=on&amp;by=Win+Pct  I-A Winning Percentage 1990&amp;ndash;2010 (21 years)].  Retrieved January 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gators have played their home games in [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at Florida Field]] located on the university's campus since 1930.  The stadium was first known as Florida Field, but the name was changed in 1989 to honor [[Ben Hill Griffin]], an alumnus of the university and a major benefactor of its Florida Gators sports programs.  Since the 1990s, the stadium has also been widely known by its nickname: &quot;the Swamp.&quot;

Since 1906, twenty-three different men have served as the head coach of the Florida Gators, including three who were later inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] for their coaching success.  The [[2011 Florida Gators football team|2011 season]] will be the Gators' first under current head coach [[Will Muschamp]].

The University of Florida was one of the founding members of the Southeastern Conference in 1932, and it is one of the twelve current members of the SEC.  Since the SEC expanded from ten to twelve universities in 1992, and instituted divisional play in football, the Florida Gators football team has competed in the SEC Eastern Division.  

Florida plays an eight-game SEC football schedule.  Five of these contests pit the Gators against the other members of the SEC Eastern Division: [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]], [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] and [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]].  The conference schedule is filled out with an annual game against [[Louisiana State Tigers football|Louisiana State]] and two additional foes from the SEC Western Division on a rotating basis.  (Until 2003, the Gators also played [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] every season with only one Western Division team in rotation.)

Key conference rivalries include the [[Florida vs. Georgia Football Classic]] in which Florida and Georgia play annually in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] (usually around [[Halloween]]), the [[Florida-Tennessee rivalry|matchup with Tennessee]] (usually in mid-September), and an inter-divisional rivalry with their permanent SEC Western Division foe, LSU (in early to mid-October).

In addition to the conference foes, the Gators face in-state rival [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] at the end of the regular season.  The two teams' emergence as perennial football powers in the 1980s and 1990s helped build the [[Florida-Florida State rivalry]] into a game that has often held national title implications.  Before 1988, in-state rival [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] was also an annual opponent, but due to expanded conference schedules, Florida and Miami have met only three times in the regular season and twice in bowl games since 1988.  The remaining dates on Florida's regular season schedule are filled with various non-conference opponents that vary from year to year.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The modern University of Florida was created in 1905 when the [[Florida Legislature]] enacted the [[Henry Holland Buckman|Buckman Act]], which abolished all of the State of Florida's existing publicly-supported educational institutions and consolidated the academic programs of four of them in the new &quot;[[History of the University of Florida|University of the State of Florida]]&quot;, a [[land-grant university]] for white men.

Two of the new university's predecessor institutions fielded football teams before 1905: the [[East Florida Seminary]] in Gainesville and the [[Florida Agricultural College]] (later renamed the University of Florida at [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]]) had teams in the late 1890s and early 1900s, and actually played each other in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;McEwen, Tom, ''The Gators: A Story of Florida Football'', The Strode Publishers, Huntsville, Alabama, p. 363 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 22, 1901, Florida Agricultural College and the private [[Stetson College]] (now Stetson University) assembled teams for a match in [[Jacksonville]] that would be Florida's first known intercollegiate football game.  This game sparked considerable interest in intercollegiate football in the state, and as a result several other colleges organized teams of their own, including the East Florida Seminary and [[History of Florida State University|Florida State College]] (now [[Florida State University]]).&lt;ref name=Kabat23&gt;Ric A. Kabat, &quot;[http://brokert10.fcla.edu/DLData/CF/FullText/fhq_70_1.txt  Before the Seminoles: Football at Florida State College, 1902&amp;ndash;1904], ''Florida Historical Quarterly'', vol. LXX, no. 1, p. 33 (July 1991).  Retrieved November 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Florida State College (FSC) fielded a successful team from 1902 to 1904; after FSC was reorganized by the Buckman Act as the new college for white women in 1905, the Florida State College football team was discontinued.  However, of all the players from these earlier teams, only tackle William Gibbs of the 1905 Lake City team made the transition to the new university's team in Gainesville in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;McEwen, ''The Gators'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New university, humble beginnings: 1906&amp;ndash;1919 ===

[[Image:Gators1907.jpg|thumb|left|The 1907 University of Florida football team.]]

In 1905, the Florida Legislature passed the [[History of the University of Florida|Buckman Act]], which reorganized the state's entire system of higher education.  As a result, the former University of Florida at Lake City (which had been known as &quot;Florida Agricultural College&quot; until 1903) and the East Florida Seminary were merged with two other institutions to create the new University of the State of Florida for white male students.  The university operated for one school year (1905&amp;ndash;1906) in [[Lake City, Florida]], while the first buildings were constructed on the new campus in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].

The as-yet un-nicknamed state university football team began varsity play when the new Gainesville campus opened in September 1906.  The first football coach was [[Jack Forsythe]], who had previously coached the Florida State College football team before the Buckman Act reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;Kabat, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forsythe led the new Florida team for three winning seasons, including a 6&amp;ndash;0 win over the [[Rollins College#Athletics|Rollins College Tars]] in their first game.  The official name of the new university was shortened to the &quot;University of Florida&quot; in 1909, and [[George E. Pyle|George Pyle]] became the new head coach of the [[1909 Florida Gators football team|1909 Florida football team]].  Some time during these early years, the Florida sports teams adopted their orange and blue team colors, purportedly representing a combination of the blue and white of the old [[History of the University of Florida|Florida Agricultural College]] and the orange and black of the old [[History of the University of Florida|East Florida Seminary]], two of the university's predecessor institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For partial football records of Florida Agricultural College and the East Florida Seminary, please see College Football Data Warehouse, [http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/incomplete_data/year_by_year_discontinued.php?teamid=1115  Florida Agriculture College Records by Year] and [http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/incomplete_data/year_by_year_seminary.php?teamid=987  East Florida Seminary Records by Year]. Retrieved August 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910s saw the team face many of their current rivals and regular opponents for the first time.  The newly-named Gators met the [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina Gamecocks]] for the first time and played the Gamecocks to a 6&amp;ndash;6 tie in 1911.  The [[1911 Florida Gators football team|1911 Gators]] went on to defeat The Citadel, Clemson and the College of Charleston, declared themselves to be the &quot;champions of South Carolina,&quot; and finished their season 5&amp;ndash;0&amp;ndash;1&amp;mdash;the only undefeated football season in the Gators' history.  When the [[1912 Florida Gators football team|1912 Gators]] joined the now-defunct [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA) in time for the 1912 season, they faced the [[1915 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] in the teams' first contest; the [[1915 Florida Gators football team|1915 Gators]] played the [[1915 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]] for the first time; and the [[1916 Florida Gators football team|1916 Gators]] met the [[1916 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1916 Alabama Crimson Tide]] in their first game.

=== The Roaring Twenties: 1920&amp;ndash;1929 ===

The [[1922 Florida Gators football team|1922 Gators]] joined the [[Southern Conference]], following their regional rivals' departure from the SIAA a year earlier.  Major [[James Van Fleet]]&lt;ref&gt;Van Fleet was an active duty U.S. Army officer who was also the senior officer of the university's [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) program.  As a regimental commander, he participated in the [[D-Day landings]] in [[Normandy, France]] during [[World War II]], and later became a division and corps commander under General [[George Patton]].  During the [[Korean War]], Van Fleet commanded the U.S. Eighth Army, following [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[Matthew Ridgway]].  He retired as a four-star general in 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; coached the 1923 and 1924 teams to their first taste of national notoriety, finishing 6&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;2 and 6&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;2.&lt;ref name=cfbdwfloridarecord19201924&gt;College Football Data Warehouse, [http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/florida/yearly_results.php?year=1920  Florida Yearly Results: 1920&amp;ndash;1924].

McKethan Stadium#Stadium namesakes|Carl &quot;Tootie&quot; Perry]], the Gators' center and first All-[[Southern Conference|Southern]] selection in 1920 and 1921, and lineman Max &quot;Goldie&quot; Goldstein, one of the first Gators to play professional football.

Coach [[Charlie Bachman]] led the Gators to greater national recognition.  Bachman had attended [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] from 1914 to 1916, where he was an All-American [[guard (American football)|guard]] for the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish football]] team in 1916, and, in 1918, had also played for the legendary Great Lakes Naval Station football team.  Bachman's 1928 and 1929 Gators squads finished 8&amp;ndash;1 and 8&amp;ndash;2, respectively,&lt;ref&gt;College Football Data Warehouse, [http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/florida/yearly_results.php?year=1925  Florida Yearly Results: 1925&amp;ndash;1929].

Led by the &quot;Phantom Four&quot; backfield of [[Carl Brumbaugh]], Rainey Cawthon, [[Clyde Crabtree]] and [[Royce Goodbread]], the 1928 Gators set a new national scoring record of 336 points.  The 1928 team also produced the Gators' first-ever first-team [[All-American]], [[end (American football)|end]] [[Dale Van Sickel]], who later became Florida's first member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], inducted in 1975.&lt;ref name=cfhofvansickel&gt;College Football Hall of Fame, Hall of Famers, [http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=20069  Dale Van Sickel].

=== Depression, war and football: 1930&amp;ndash;1949 ===

The University of Florida joined the new [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) in December 1932, along with twelve other member schools from the Southern Conference, including [[University of Alabama|Alabama]], [[Auburn University|Auburn]], [[University of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Georgia Tech]], [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[Louisiana State University|Louisiana State]], [[University of Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State]], [[Sewanee: The University of the South|Sewanee]], [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[Tulane University|Tulane]], and [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]].  University of Florida president [[John J. Tigert]], a former All-Southern [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] on the Vanderbilt football teams of 1901&amp;ndash;1903, was instrumental in the organization of the new conference and served four separate terms as the SEC president.  Tigert was also responsible for the construction of the Gators' first and only permanent stadium, [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|Florida Field]], in 1930.

Gator alumnus [[Dennis K. Stanley|Dutch Stanley]] replaced Bachman as coach in 1933, the first SEC football season.  Stanley, who was only 26 years old, had been a stand-out [[End (American football)|end]] on the great 1928 Gators team.  He brought an all-Gator-alumni coaching staff to the program, and the Gators experienced a brief two-year revival after two consecutive losing seasons under Bachman in 1931 and 1932.  Stanley's Gators posted 5&amp;ndash;3&amp;ndash;1 and 6&amp;ndash;3&amp;ndash;1 records in 1933 and 1934, but faltered with a 3&amp;ndash;7 tally in 1935.

The 1930s and 1940s were generally not kind to the Gators.  After posting a six-win season in 1934, Florida did not win more than five games in a season until 1952.

Dutch Stanley resigned under fan pressure following the 1935 season, and was replaced by [[Josh Cody]] as head coach.  Cody was a former star tackle for [[Dan McGugin]]'s great [[Vanderbilt Commodores football]] teams of 1915, 1916 and 1919, and was the only three-time All-American in the history of Commodores football.  Cody had previously coached the [[Clemson Tigers football]] team to a 29&amp;ndash;11&amp;ndash;1 record from 1927 to 1930, but had returned to his alma mater to be the head coach of the [[Vanderbilt Commodores basketball]] team and serve as an assistant football coach under the legendary McGugin.  Perhaps Cody's finest moment as the Gators' head coach was the team's 7&amp;ndash;0 upset of the second-ranked [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College Eagles]] in Boston in 1939.  In four seasons, however, Cody recorded a 17&amp;ndash;24&amp;ndash;2 tally.  Once again, a coach who showed great promise on paper was not able to lead the Gators from the football wilderness, and Cody left Gainesville to accept an assistant coach position at [[Temple University]].

[[Thomas Lieb|Tom Lieb]] replaced Josh Cody as coach in 1940.  Lieb was a former All-American [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame football]] player and then protege assistant coach under [[Knute Rockne]].  Notably, he was also a bronze medalist in the [[discus throw]] in the [[1924 Summer Olympics]].  Lieb had been the de facto head coach during the Irish's 1929 national championship season, while Rockne spent most of the season recovering from illness.  Despite Gator fans' early hopes for Lieb's Gators and his &quot;Notre Dame system,&quot; however, the Gators posted a disappointing 20&amp;ndash;26&amp;ndash;1 record in five seasons.  Lieb's best season was probably his first in 1940, as the Gators celebrated victories over and their second first-team All-American, end [[Fergie Ferguson Award|Fergie Ferguson]], in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;''Gator Football 2008 Media Guide'', [http://www.gatorzone.com/football/media/2008/pdf/139.pdf  Florida All-Americans]. Retrieved August 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World War II]] years of 1942 to 1945 witnessed the withdrawal of most of the university's able-bodied students, followed by their enlistment in the U.S. military.  Florida did not field a team for lack of available players in 1943.

Returning war [[veteran]]s arrived in force on the Gainesville campus in the fall of 1946, and [[Raymond Wolf|Bear Wolf]], the pre-war head coach of the [[North Carolina Tarheels football]] team, replaced Lieb as head coach.  Unfortunately, the Gators football program slid even further under Wolf, posting a 13&amp;ndash;24&amp;ndash;2 record in four seasons.  The first season for Wolf was disastrous: the 1946 Gators finished 0&amp;ndash;9&amp;mdash;the worst football season in Gators history.  Wolf's Gators never had a winning season, but there were bright spots.  The iconic cheerleader, [[Mr. Two Bits]], attended his first home game during the 1946 season, and began his personal sixty-year tradition of leading Gator fans in the &quot;two bits&quot; cheer at Florida Field.  Gators running back [[Chuck Hunsinger]] rushed for 2,017 yards in 1948 and 1949.  Hunsinger ran for 174 yards and three touchdowns against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]] in the Gators 28&amp;ndash;7 victory in November 1949, but Wolf's contract was not renewed after the 1949 season.  Gator veterans of Wolf's tenure ironically dubbed it the &quot;Golden Era.&quot;

=== Woodruff era: 1950&amp;ndash;1959 ===

The Gators achieved a measure of respectability under coach [[Bob Woodruff (American football)|Bob Woodruff]] during the 1950s.  Woodruff was an eccentric who was a master of X's and O's and employed unusual methods to train and motivate his players.  As a former [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]] football player and a disciple of legendary Volunteers coach [[Robert Neyland]], Woodruff emphasized defense, field position and the kicking game to the exclusion of a more wide-open offensive scheme.  The Gators peaked under Woodruff during the [[1952 Florida Gators football team|1952 season]], when they posted an 8&amp;ndash;3 record, received their first official post-season bowl invitation, and defeated the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa Golden Hurricane]] 14&amp;ndash;13 in the [[Gator Bowl]] on New Year's Day 1953.  The 1952 Gators also produced Florida's third first-team All-American, tackle Charlie LaPradd, one of the two team captains.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FF0eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OcgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6248,3141409&amp;dq=associated+press+all-american&amp;hl=en  LaPradd Is Thrilled By His Selection to All America],&quot; ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'', p. 7 (December 6, 1952).  Retrieved March 21, 2010.  Note the article mistakenly states that LaPradd was the Gators' second first-team All-American, when, in fact, he was the third.&lt;/ref&gt;  Woodruff never again equaled the success of his 1952 Gators team, but his ten-year tenure as coach was notable for a 6&amp;ndash;4 record against the rival Georgia Bulldogs, four Associated Press final football poll top-twenty rankings, and the fact that only two of his ten Gators teams finished with losing records.  Woodruff finished his Gators career with a combined record of 53&amp;ndash;42&amp;ndash;6.

=== Pell-Hall era: 1979&amp;ndash;1989 ===

[[Charley Pell]] became the Gators' head coach in 1979, and brought the Gators respectability on the field, and scandal and disgrace off it.  Though he began his career with an 0&amp;ndash;10&amp;ndash;1 season in 1979, the Gators posted a then-NCAA-record turn-around with an 8&amp;ndash;3 season in 1980.  Pell went 33&amp;ndash;15 after the winless opening season, but he was fired by university president [[Marshall Criser]] during the 1984 season after Pell and his staff were charged with 107 NCAA major infractions.  Offensive coordinator [[Galen Hall]] replaced Pell after the third game of the season,&lt;ref&gt;Jack McCallum, &quot;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135916/index.htm  Gatorgate May Be The Real Gatoraid],&quot; ''Sports Illustrated'' (November 19, 1984). Retrieved March 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and rallied his players after a 1&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1 start to win eight straight games to finish 9&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1.

Prior to the 1990s, the 1984 team was considered by many sports commentators to be the finest Gators squad ever.  The offense was especially potent behind an offensive line dubbed &quot;The Great Wall of Florida&quot; (Phil Bromley, [[Lomas Brown]], Billy Hinson, [[Crawford Ker]], Scott Trimble and [[Jeff Zimmerman (American football)|Jeff Zimmerman]]) that paved the way for [[John L. Williams]] and [[Neal Anderson]] to run the ball and for freshman quarterback [[Kerwin Bell]] to lead the team to its first-ever SEC football championship.  [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship#National Champions (Year-by-Year)|Several polls]] ranked the Gators as the best team in the nation after the conclusion of the 1984 season, but the team was ineligible for a bowl game because of the newly-imposed NCAA probation.  To the shock and dismay of the team and fans, the SEC university presidents voted to retroactively vacate the Gators' 1984 championship in the spring of 1985.

[[Galen Hall]] coached the team from the fourth game of 1984 until 1989, and matched the 9&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1 record in 1984 with another 9&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1 season in 1985.  Again, the 1985 Gators posted the best record in the SEC, but were ineligible for the conference title because of the NCAA probation imposed in 1984.  Arguably, the greatest individual player of Hall's tenure was All-American running back [[Emmitt Smith]], who set numerous Gators rushing records from 1987 to 1989.  Unfortunately, Hall had his own NCAA infractions scandal, primarily involving paying his assistant coaches from his own pocket and allegedly paying the child support-related legal expenses of one of his players,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/s/2001/1126/1284780.html  Dishing out the discipline:SEC],&quot; ESPN.com (November 26, 2002).

=== Spurrier era: 1990&amp;ndash;2001 ===

Despite their prior successes, the Gators had never been considered a national power, having never officially won a conference championship in eighty-three seasons of play.  Things changed in [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990]]: Steve Spurrier returned to Gainesville as the Gators' Head Ball Coach.  In the debut game of Spurrier's Gators, they blew past the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]] 50&amp;ndash;7.  In their second game, they came from behind to beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 17&amp;ndash;13 in Tuscaloosa.  Since Spurrier's return in 1990, the Gators football team has been the winningest Division I (FBS) program.&lt;ref name=stassen20/&gt;

In Spurrier's first season, the Gators finished first in the SEC for the third time ever, but were again ineligible for the SEC title because of lingering NCAA probation.  They won their first official SEC championship in 1991, fifty-nine seasons after joining the SEC as a charter member.  The Gators played for the conference championship in the first-ever [[1992 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]] in 1992, but lost 28&amp;ndash;21 to the eventual national champion [[1992 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]].  Spurrier's Gators rebounded, however, and won the next four [[SEC Championship Game]]s (1993&amp;ndash;1996), leading Spurrier to quip as the Gators posed for their championship photo that &quot;this is our annual team picture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Auman &amp; Keith Niebuhr, &quot;[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/01/08/Sports/Spurrierisms.shtml  Spurrierisms],&quot; ''St. Petersburg Times'' (January 8, 2002). Retrieved September 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Spurrier also became the Gators' all-time winningest coach in 1996, surpassing Ray Graves' seventy career wins as Florida coach.

The Gators had their first unbeaten and untied regular season in [[1995 Florida Gators football team|1995]], but were denied a national championship in the [[1996 Fiesta Bowl]], losing to the [[1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] 62&amp;ndash;24.

Most of the Gators' offense returned in [[1996 Florida Gators football team|1996]], and  would end up setting dozens of UF's scoring records, as they rolled over most of their opponents to start the season 10&amp;ndash;0.  The top-ranked Gators faced the second-ranked and also undefeated Florida State Seminoles in [[Doak Campbell Stadium]].  Keyed by several blocking errors on offense and special teams, the Gators fell seriously behind in the first quarter, nearly rallying to win, but fell short, and left [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] with a disappointing 24&amp;ndash;21 loss.  But the pieces fell into place for Florida, as they beat the [[1996 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the [[1996 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], 45&amp;ndash;30, and Texas upset [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the inaugural [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]] to clear the path for fourth-ranked Florida to become the best available opponent for the Seminoles in the Sugar Bowl.  To have a shot at a national title, the Gators needed [[1996 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] to beat second-ranked [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]] in the Rose Bowl, which they did on the final play of the game, thus setting up the Sugar Bowl as the national championship game.  The Gators seized the opportunity, as [[Heisman trophy]]-winning quarterback [[Danny Wuerffel]] garnered game MVP honors in a 52&amp;ndash;20 rout of the Seminoles.

The following season, the [[1997 Florida Gators football team|1997 Gators]] looked like they would reload for another title, beating highly-ranked Tennessee at home in September to regain the top spot in the polls.  But the team struggled midway through their schedule, losing to [[1997 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] on the road and the [[1997 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]] in Jacksonville, after dominating both teams the previous year.  The Gators finished the season in [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|The Swamp]], as the tenth-ranked Gators upset their rivals, the top-ranked [[Florida State Seminoles]], in a 32&amp;ndash;29 thriller that featured two last-minute lead changes.

=== Zook era: 2002&amp;ndash;2004 ===

On January 2, 2002, [[Steve Spurrier]] resigned as the head coach of the Gators, and ten days later became the head coach of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Washington Redskins]].  Florida athletic director [[Jeremy Foley]] initiated a coaching search that focused on [[Denver Broncos]] head coach [[Mike Shanahan]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/98612771.html?dids=98612771:98612771&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+08%2C+2002&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Florida+Sets+Its+Sights+On+Broncos%27+Shanahan&amp;pqatl=google  Florida Sets Its Sights on Broncos' Shanahan],&quot; ''The Washington Post'', p.

After two consecutive five-loss seasons and an embarrassing upset by the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State Bulldogs]], Zook was fired midway through the [[2004 Florida Gators football team|2004]] season, but was allowed to finish out the regular season.  In Zook's final game, the Gators beat Florida State to give them their first win at Doak Campbell Stadium since 1986.  Defensive coordinator [[Charlie Strong]] served as the interim head coach for the [[2004 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]] against Miami, becoming the first [[African-American]] to serve as the head football coach at Florida and the second in SEC history. 

Athletic director Jeremy Foley again set out to find a new head coach for the Gators.  With the benefit of an extra month to work with, he targeted a much higher profile replacement for Zook&amp;mdash;the 2004 ''[[Sporting News]]'' Coach of the Year, [[Urban Meyer]], the head coach of [[Utah Utes football|Utah Utes]].  After a period of intense competition against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] for his services, Meyer chose to accept the position at the University of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Alden, &quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sec/2004-12-03-florida-meyer_x.htm  Urban Meyer jilts Notre Dame, heads for Florida],&quot; ''USA Today'' (December 23, 2004).

=== Meyer era: 2005&amp;ndash;2010 ===

Urban Meyer was announced as Florida Football's new head coach in December 2004.  His first season in [[2005 Florida Gators football team|2005]] was an improvement at 9&amp;ndash;3, including an Outback Bowl win against the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa Hawkeyes]].  Although the Gators managed to defeat all three of their biggest rivals (Tennessee, [[2005 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2005 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]]) for only the fourth time in school history, they missed out on a chance to play in the [[2005 SEC Championship Game|SEC title game]] after a late-season upset loss to Spurrier's new team, [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]].

In [[2006 Florida Gators football team|2006]], the Gators completed a 13&amp;ndash;1 season during which their sole loss was to the [[Auburn Tigers]] 17&amp;ndash;27.  In their final regular season SEC game, the Gators' managed a slender 17&amp;ndash;16 victory when Jarvis Moss blocked a fourth quarter field goal by the [[South Carolina Gamecocks]].  The Gators defeated the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] in the SEC Championship Game, winning their first SEC title since 2000.  The Gators played in the [[2007 BCS Championship Game]] on January 8, 2007, and, led by quarterback [[Chris Leak]], beat the No. 1 ranked [[2006 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State Buckeyes]], 41&amp;ndash;14, for the Gators' second national football championship.

[[Tim Tebow]] became the full-time starting quarterback for the [[2007 Florida Gators football team|2007 season]].  The Gators started the season 4&amp;ndash;0 and were ranked as high as Number 3 in the various media polls.  However, a midseason stretch in which the team lost three of four games to conference foes ended any hopes of a repeat national championship. 

While the Gators finished with a relatively disappointing 9&amp;ndash;4 record and Number 13 final ranking, Tim Tebow's record-setting season earned him many post-season awards, including the [[Heisman Trophy]].  Tebow was the first sophomore to receive the Heisman.

====2008 Season====

The [[2008 Florida Gators football team|Gators]] responded in [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008]] as an improved team led by linebacker [[Brandon Spikes]] and RB/WR [[Percy Harvin]] helped to rekindle the championship passion.  Florida won their fourth straight game over [[2008 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] 30&amp;ndash;6 and then followed it up with a 31&amp;ndash;30 loss to Ole Miss.  In an emotional press conference after the game, star quarterback Tim Tebow promised that no team would play harder than Florida the rest of the season (a speech that was later posted on a plaque outside the renovated football complex &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college_uf/2009/03/tim-tebows-promise-speech-posted-outside-football-complex.html |title=Tim Tebowâs &quot;Promise&quot; speech posted outside football complex â Swamp Things â Gators Blog â Orlando Sentinel |publisher=Blogs.orlandosentinel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Florida delivered with dominant play on both sides of the ball the rest of the season on their way to a second national championship game berth in three years.  Along the way, they beat the defending National Champions [[2008 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] 51&amp;ndash;21, achieved revenge on SEC Rivals Georgia, handed former coach Steve Spurrier his worst loss in his career and thumped Florida State University in Doak Campbell Stadium 45&amp;ndash;15.  Florida earned the second slot in the BCS poll by knocking off a resurgent and then undefeated [[2008 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] 31&amp;ndash;20 for the SEC Championship.  The Gators won the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game]] on January 8, 2009 over the [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]] and former Gator defensive coordinator Bob Stoops 24&amp;ndash;14 and became the first program to win two BCS championships with the same coach (LSU has won two BCS titles, but with different coaches). Shortly after winning the 2008 BCS Title, Tim Tebow and linebacker Brandon Spikes announced that they would return for their senior seasons.

==== 2009 season====

The Gators were voted Number 1 in the preseason Associated Press and Coaches polls.  Despite several injuries on offense and defense, the Gators got off to a quick start with dominating wins over Charleston Southern and Troy. A much anticipated matchup with Tennessee followed.  Volunteers Coach [[Lane Kiffin]] made taunting comments about the Gators football program and Coach Urban Meyer several times during the off-season; the Gators prevailed 23&amp;ndash;13.  The Gators overcame several obstacles over the next several weeks, as influenza sidelined many players in a 41&amp;ndash;7 rout of Kentucky.  During the game, Tebow suffered a serious hit to the head that caused a concussion.  Following a bye week, a relatively healthy Tebow and a stifling defense knocked off LSU 13&amp;ndash;3 for the Gators' first win in Baton Rouge since 2003, extending their record to 5&amp;ndash;0.  The next week, the Gators overcame a 20&amp;ndash;13 fourth quarter deficit and four turnovers to beat the Arkansas Razorbacks 23&amp;ndash;20 in a scare.  Florida ran their record to 7&amp;ndash;0 with a 29&amp;ndash;19 win at Mississippi State despite two interceptions returned for touchdowns by the team coached by former Gator offensive coordinator [[Dan Mullen]].  The win ended a four-game losing streak in Starkville and marked the first time since 1998 that the Gators beat all SEC western division opponents in the same regular season.  Next, Florida beat Georgia for the seventeenth time in the past twenty seasons, 41&amp;ndash;17.  In the game, Tebow broke the SEC rushing touchdown record held by former Bulldog running back [[Herschel Walker]]. The following week, they knocked off Vanderbilt 27&amp;ndash;3 at home to improve to 9&amp;ndash;0.  Following a 24&amp;ndash;14 win over South Carolina and [[Steve Spurrier]] in Columbia, the Gators defeated FIU 62&amp;ndash;3.  Florida finished a 12&amp;ndash;0 regular season with a 37&amp;ndash;10 win over rival Florida State on senior day at Florida Field.  The Gators then advanced to the SEC Championship Game where they were defeated 32&amp;ndash;13 by Alabama.  However, unlike Alabama who the previous year had lost their bowl game after losing the SEC championship, the Gators ended their season - and quarterback Tim Tebow's college career - on a high note, defeating the Cincinnati Bearcats 51&amp;ndash;24 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl.  With their bowl win, the Gators became the only Division I team to have back-to-back thirteen-win seasons.

===== Meyer's leave of absence =====
On December 26, 2009, Meyer announced he would resign as head coach of the Florida Gators following their bowl game due to health and family concerns. Meyer stated, &quot;I have ignored my health for years, but recent developments have forced me to re-evaluate my priorities of faith and family... I'm proud to be a part of the Gainesville community and the Gator Nation and I plan to remain in Gainesville and involved with the University of Florida.&quot;&lt;ref name=gatorzone12262009&gt;&quot;[http://gatorzone.com/story.php?id=17169  UF's Urban Meyer Steps Down as Head Football Coach],&quot; Gatorzone.com (December 26, 2009).  Retrieved December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, however, Meyer stated that he would not resign, but would instead take an indefinite leave of absence.

Meyer's leave coincided with the important [[Recruiting (college athletics)|recruiting season]] season. Instead of traveling extensively to visit potential new players as he had in past years, Meyer mainly kept in touch with recruits by phone while traveling with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=7:31 p.m. ET |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/35035094/ns/sports-college_football/ |title=Floridaâs Meyer may not take leave of absence - College football |publisher=nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=2010-01-23 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4852624|title=Meyer: Workload has been the same|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the uncertainty about the head coaching position, the Gators signed the consensus No. 1 recruiting class in the nation in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recruiting/classrankings?classyear=2010 |title=College Football Class Rankings 2010 - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/top-10-recruiting-storylines-of-2010-class |title=Top 10 football recruiting storylines of 2010 class - CFB News - FOX Sports on MSN |publisher=Msn.foxsports.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Low |first=Chris |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/8418/florida-may-have-best-recruiting-class-ever |title=Florida may have best recruiting class ever - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2010-05-08 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/recruiting/football/2010-signing-day.htm |title=Meyer carries Florida to No. 1 recruiting class |publisher=USA Today |date=2010-08-02 |accessdate=2010-05-08 |first=Jack |last=Carey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010 season ====

Meyer resumed his coaching duties in time for Florida's spring practice in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4852624  Meyer: Workload has been the same],&quot; ESPN (January 24, 2010).  Retrieved December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his squad struggled in the fall, especially on offense. Their final record of 8&amp;ndash;5 was the worst of Meyer's head coaching career and the Gators lost three home games for the third time in 30 years. Accordingly, Florida finished the 2010 season unranked for the first time since 1989.

===== Meyer's resignation =====
On December 8, 2010, Meyer once again announced his resignation, citing many of the same concerns of the family and health issues that he had 12 months beforehand&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/stewart_mandel/12/08/urban-meyer-resigns/ &quot;Meyer was great, but Florida will survive without him&quot; - SI.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His final game was an [[Outback Bowl]] victory over [[2010 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] on January 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5899478  Urban Meyer stepping down at Florida],&quot; ESPN (December 8, 2010).

=== Muschamp era: 2011&amp;ndash;present ===

On December 11, 2010, Florida named Texas defensive coordinator [[Will Muschamp]] as Meyer's replacement.&lt;ref name=gatorzoneprofile&gt;Scott Carter, &quot;[http://web.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=19412  One-Time Gainesville Native Will Muschamp Returns To Coach Florida Gators],&quot; Gatorzone.com (December 11, 2010).

Retrieved January 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uniforms ==
===Jerseys===
Florida has worn blue jerseys (usually a variation of [[royal blue]]) with white pants at home throughout much of the program's history. The exception was a decade-long period beginning in [[1979 Florida Gators football team|1979]], when new coach Charley Pell introduced orange home jerseys similar to those worn at [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], his previous coaching stop. In [[1989 Florida Gators football team|1989]], interim head coach Gary Darnell brought back blue jerseys for the season finale against Florida State, and Steve Spurrier restored them as Florida's regular home jersey when he returned to coach his alma mater in [[1990 Florida Gators football team|1990]].

Since 1990, the Gators have consistently worn blue jerseys with white pants at home, with blue pants an option sometimes worn for night games. On the road, the team usually wears traditional white jerseys and either blue or white pants, with orange pants used on occasion. Florida wore blue jerseys with orange pants for one game each in 1989 and [[1999 Florida Gators football team|1999]], both home contests against Florida State. In [[2010 Florida Gators football team|2010]] and [[2011 Florida Gators football team|2011]], the Gators brought back orange jerseys for one home game in each season.

===Helmets===
Florida has worn many different helmet designs throughout the program's history. Helmet color has alternated between orange and white and (occasionally) blue, and logos have included an interlocking &quot;UF&quot;, a simple &quot;F&quot;, and the number of the player wearing it&lt;ref&gt;National Champs.net, [http://www.nationalchamps.net/Helmet_Project/sec.htm  The Helmet Project - SEC].  Retrieved July 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1979, the Gators have worn orange helmets with a script &quot;Gators&quot; logo, the only exceptions being three [[Throwback uniform|&quot;throwback&quot;]] games. In 2006, Florida wore 1960s throwback uniforms that included white helmets featuring a simple &quot;F&quot; logo. In 2009, the Gators participated in [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] Pro Combat uniforms campaign, wearing specially designed all-blue uniforms and white helmets featuring a different &quot;slant F&quot; logo. These uniforms were worn for the last regular season game against [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], and the white helmets were worn again the following week in the [[2009 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]] along with white jerseys and pants.

==Rivalries==
=== Florida State ===

{{main|Florida&amp;ndash;Florida State football rivalry}}

The yearly meeting of Florida State has alternated yearly between [[Florida Field]] at [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] and the Seminoles' home turf of Bobby Bowden Field at [[Doak Campbell Stadium]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] since 1964.  The Gators lead the all-time series 33&amp;ndash;20&amp;ndash;2.

=== Georgia===

{{main|Florida vs. Georgia Football Classic}}

Previously known as &quot;The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party,&quot; the official name of the rivalry with Georgia is the &quot;Florida-Georgia/Georgia-Florida Game&quot;. Currently, the game is held at [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], usually on the last Saturday in October or the first in November.  The designated &quot;home&quot; team alternates from year to year, with ticket distribution split evenly between the two schools. In past years, fans from Florida and Georgia were assigned seats grouped in alternating sections of the stadium, and the contrasting colors worn by the fans created a &quot;beach ball&quot; visual effect in the stands. Recently the seating arrangement has split the stadium lengthwise and fans sit on the side corresponding to the sideline their team occupies. 

The teams' first meeting was in Jacksonville in 1915.&lt;ref name=cfdwufugaseries&gt;College Football Data Warehouse, [http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/florida/opponents_records.php?teamid=1265  Florida vs Georgia].  Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early days of the rivalry, games rotated through neutral site locations in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and [[Tampa, Florida]] along with Jacksonville and, occasionally, Gainesville and [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]].&lt;ref name=cfdwufugaseries/&gt;  Since 1933, the contest has been held in Jacksonville every year except 1994 and 1995,&lt;ref name=cfdwufugaseries/&gt; when [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium]] was being rebuilt to accommodate the [[NFL]]'s expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] and the teams played a pair of home-and-home games at their respective on-campus stadiums.

Georgia dominated the rivalry early, winning the first six meetings and building a 21&amp;ndash;5&amp;ndash;1 series lead before 1950.&lt;ref name=cfdwufugaseries/&gt;  However, after the 2011 game, Florida has won 18 out of the last 22 meetings, and holds a 35&amp;ndash;25&amp;ndash;1 advantage in the series since 1950.  The Bulldogs have won one three of the past eight meetings and lead the all-time series, 47&amp;ndash;40&amp;ndash;2.&lt;ref name=cfdwufugaseries/&gt;

Starting in 2009, the [[Okefenokee Oar]] has been awarded to the winner of the Florida-Georgia game. The long-time rivalry had not previously had a trophy.

=== Louisiana State ===

{{main|Florida&amp;ndash;LSU football rivalry}}

LSU is Florida's permanent inter-divisional rival from the SEC Western Division.  The winner of the Florida-LSU game went on to win the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national championship game in the 2006, 2007, and 2008 seasons. With a few exceptions, this rivalry has been known for close games in recent years, with both teams usually coming into the match-up highly ranked. Florida leads the all-time series 30&amp;ndash;24&amp;ndash;3.

=== Tennessee ===

{{main|Florida&amp;ndash;Tennessee football rivalry}}

Though both Florida and Tennessee are charter members of the SEC, irregular conference scheduling resulted in the squads meeting infrequently for many years. Tennessee won the first 10 contests spread out from 1916 until 1954, when Florida finally beat the Vols. The series took a bizarre turn in 1969, when Florida hired away Tennessee head coach (and former Florida quarterback) [[Doug Dickey]] to replace the retiring [[Ray Graves]] immediately after their teams met in the [[Gator Bowl]]. 

But it was not until the 1990s that the contest became a rivalry. In 1992, the SEC expanded and split into two divisions. Florida and Tennessee were placed in the SEC East and have faced off every season since, almost always in mid-September for what is usually the first conference game of the season for one or both squads. The meeting became an annual occurrence at the same time that both football programs regained championship form. Led by coaches [[Steve Spurrier]] and [[Phil Fulmer]] and featuring star players such as [[Danny Wuerffel]] and [[Peyton Manning]], both teams were always highly ranked coming into the game, regularly giving it conference and national title implications. The squads combined to win three national championships during the decade.

Since they became annual opponents, the Gators and Vols have combined to represent the Eastern Division in the [[SEC Championship Game]] 15 times in 18 years. Currently, Florida has a seven-game winning streak against Tennessee and leads the all-time series 22&amp;ndash;19.

=== Alabama ===

While [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and Florida were charter members of the SEC, they have never been annual opponents.  Nevertheless, they have had many noteworthy meetings over the years, especially since the [[SEC Championship Game]] game was instituted in 1992.

The Gators and Crimson Tide have met seven times for the SEC championship.  These meetings have consistently held significant national title implications: on four occasions, the winner of a Florida-Alabama SEC title game has gone on to win a national championship. Stakes were never higher than in 2008 and 2009, when the teams were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 coming into the game in consecutive seasons. The second-ranked team won in both instances (Florida in 2008, Alabama in 2009), with both conference championship winners going on to win the [[BCS National Championship Game]]. The Gators hold a 4-3 edge in SEC championship contests against the Tide.

The teams have had several memorable regular season meetings as well, highlighted by notable upsets. In 1963, an unranked Gators squad handed legendary Alabama head coach [[Bear Bryant]] the first of only two losses his teams would suffer in [[Bryant-Denny Stadium|Tuscaloosa]], winning 10-6 over the No. 3 Tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120308aab.html |title=Series Preview: Alabama vs. Florida - ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE - University of Alabama Official Athletic Site |publisher=Rolltide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, freshman running back [[Emmitt Smith]] led the unranked Gators to a 23-14 upset in [[Legion Field|Birmingham]], rushing for a then school-record 224 yards in his first collegiate start. The Tide enjoyed their own upset in the series in 1999, breaking Florida's school record 30-game home winning streak in a 40-39 overtime thriller.

Historically, the Gators have not fared well against Alabama in Gainesville. The Tide won the first seven meetings on the Gators' home field, including Florida's worst-ever home loss: a 40-0 blowout in 1979 that featured an [[1979 Alabama Crimson Tide football team#1979|Alabama squad]] which would go undefeated and win the national championship against a Gator squad which would not win a game all season.  The Gators finally beat Alabama on Florida Field in 1991, 35-0, but their 2&amp;ndash;9 all-time home record against the Crimson Tide is by far their worst against any opponent.  They have fared better on the road in the series, posting a 8&amp;ndash;9 record on Alabama's home turf.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatorzone1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatorzone.com/football/media/2010/pdf/135-200.pdf |title=2010 Florida Football Media Guide |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a disagreement about when the schools' first gridiron meeting took place.  Alabama counts a 1904 victory over a team from one of Florida's four predecessor institutions, while Florida's athletic association does not, as the modern University of Florida was  not created by the Florida Legislature until 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatorzone1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolltide.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/MediaGuide_09FB |title=ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE MEDIA GUIDE 2009- University of Alabama Official Athletic Site - University of Alabama |publisher=Rolltide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to UF, Alabama leads the all-time series 21&amp;ndash;14.

=== Auburn ===

{{main|Auburn&amp;ndash;Florida football rivalry}}

[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] and Florida played annually from 1945 to 2002.  In terms of the overall series percentage win-loss record, Auburn is Florida's most evenly matched SEC opponent.  Beginning in the 1980s, one of the squads was usually highly ranked coming into the game, consistently giving the contest at least conference title implications.

The series has featured many memorable contests, including several notable upsets.  In 1986, the unranked Gators stunned the [[1986 Auburn Tigers football team|undefeated and #4 Tigers]] 18-17, overcoming a 17-0 fourth-quarter deficit in a game that is still considered one of the most dramatic in Florida Field history.&lt;ref&gt;https://mikecasella.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/florida-fields-greatest-game-florida-auburn-1986/&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[2006 Auburn Tigers football team|2006]], Auburn upset the [[2006 Florida Gators football team|undefeated Gators]] 27-17 in [[Jordan-Hare Stadium]] for what would be Florida's only loss on their way to a [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]]. This has been a trend - Auburn also upset previously unbeaten Florida teams in 1993, 1994, 2001, and 2007, though the Gators went on to win conference championships in two of those seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatorzone.com/football/media/2009/pdf/143-172.pdf 2009 Florida Football Media Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual series ended in 2002, when the SEC adjusted football schedules so that each team played one permanent and two rotating opponents from the opposite conference every year instead of two permanent and one rotating foe. LSU was designated as Florida's lone annual opponent from the SEC West, so Florida and Auburn now meet four times every ten years unless both teams make it to the [[SEC Championship Game]]. Auburn leads the series 42&amp;ndash;38&amp;ndash;2.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatorzone1&quot;/&gt;

=== Miami ===

{{main|Florida&amp;ndash;Miami football rivalry}}

Florida and Miami play each other for the Seminole War Canoe Trophy.  This formerly annual rivalry ended after the 1987 season, when Florida's annual SEC schedule expanded to eight games.  The two schools did not play each other again until the 2001 [[Sugar Bowl]].  Florida and Miami played a home-and-home series in 2002 and 2003, and met again in the 2004 [[Chick-Fil-A Bowl]].  Florida won the first leg of a home-and-home series in 2008, ending a six-game losing streak against the Hurricanes.  The next scheduled regular season meeting between the Gators and the Hurricanes will be in Miami in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/sep/07/070044/cb-war-canoe-trophy-once-again-has-meaning/sports/  About the War Canoe Trophy].&lt;/ref&gt; Miami holds a 28&amp;ndash;26 edge in the all-time series.

=== Conference championships ===

Florida has won a total of eight officially recognized Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships.  The Gators won their first SEC football championship with a conference record of 5&amp;ndash;0&amp;ndash;1 in 1984, but the title was vacated several months after the season by a vote of the SEC university presidents because of major NCAA infractions committed by the Gators coaching staff under Charley Pell.  The 1985 and 1990 teams also finished their campaigns atop the conference standings with records of 5&amp;ndash;1 and 6&amp;ndash;1, respectively.  But during those seasons, Florida was ineligible for the SEC championship due to NCAA probation arising from rules violations committed by previous coaching staffs.  Florida won its first officially recognized SEC football championship in 1991.

With the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina as new members of the Southeastern Conference in 1992, the SEC split into Eastern and Western Divisions and created a championship game between the division winners to determine the league football champion.  Florida has made ten appearances in the [[SEC Championship Game]], more than any other SEC school, with the most recent in 2009.  The Gators have won seven of the ten SEC Championship Games in which they have appeared.

== Fergie Ferguson Award ==

{{main|Fergie Ferguson Award}}

The '''Forrest K. Ferguson Award''' is given in memory of one of the University of Florida's finest athletes.  Ferguson was an All-American end for the Gators in 1941 and was state boxing champion in 1942.  He subsequently served as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and led an infantry platoon during the D-Day landings in Normandy, France on June 6, 1944.&lt;ref name=fergusondsc&gt;Hall of Valor, [http://www.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=22105  Forest Ferguson], ''Military Times''. Retrieved August 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferguson helped clear the way for his troops to advance on the enemy position, and was severely wounded leading his men in the assault.&lt;ref name=fergusondsc/&gt;  He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions.&lt;ref name=fergusondsc/&gt;  He subsequently died from war-related injuries in 1954.  The Fergie Ferguson Award is made annually in the form of a trophy, which remains in the permanent possession of the school, and is given to the football player selected by the football coaches to the Gator's Most Valuable Senior who displays &quot;leadership, character, and courage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildcatnation.com/article.php?sid=1411 About the award].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retired jersey numbers ==

Unlike many other collegiate and professional sports teams, the Gators do not currently have any retired jersey numbers from former players.  The numbers of Steve Spurrier (11) and Scot Brantley (55) were once retired, but later re-issued during Spurrier's tenure as head coach.

== University of Florida All-Time Team ==

The University of Florida All-Time Team was chosen by the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' by a fan vote in August 1983.

Doug Dickey was also the Gators' quarterback from 1951 to 1952, but was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2003 for his record as the head coach of the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]] from 1964 to 1969 and the Florida Gators from 1970 to 1978.  Steve Spurrier was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986 for his record as the Gators' [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning quarterback from 1964 to 1966.  Spurrier was also the Gators' head coach from 1990 to 2001, and his career coaching record far exceeds the Hall of Fame's minimum requirements, but he is still an active coach and is not eligible for induction as a coach until he retires.  [[Marcelino Huerta]] was a standout lineman for the Gators from 1947 to 1949, but was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2002 for his record as the head coach of the [[Tampa Spartans]], [[Wichita State Shockers]] and [[Parsons College|Parson Wildcats]].
