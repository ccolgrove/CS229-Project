'''Lintian''' is a helper tool used in conjunction with &lt;code&gt;[[dpkg]]&lt;/code&gt;, the [[Debian]] [[package management system]]. It checks Debian [[Software package (installation)|software packages]] for common inconsistencies and errors. As of 3/5/2010, the latest version complies to Debian standards version 3.8.3. A Lintian check file is often required before a package is uploaded to a distribution's core repository.

Linda was another application that was intended to overcome many difficulties with lintian. It was written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and was faster than current versions of Lintian. However, Lintian was better known and underwent many fixes to overcome past difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/03/msg00009.html Misc development news (#5)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
