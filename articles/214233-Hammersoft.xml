'''Eunice Kathleen Waymon''' (February 21, 1933 â April 21, 2003), better known by her [[stage name]] '''Nina Simone''' ({{IPA-en|ËniËnÉ sÉ¨ËmoÊn|}}), was an [[United States|American]] singer, songwriter, [[pianist]], arranger, and [[civil rights]] [[activist]] widely associated with [[jazz]] music. Simone aspired to become a classical [[pianist]] while working in a broad range of styles including [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Blues music|blues]], [[folk music|folk]], [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[Pop music|pop]]. 

Born the sixth child of a preacher's family in [[North Carolina]], Simone aspired to be a concert pianist as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=1-62&quot;&gt;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=1-62}&lt;/ref&gt; Her musical path changed direction after she was denied a scholarship to the prestigious [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in [[Philadelphia]], despite a well-received audition. Simone was later told by someone working at Curtis that she was rejected because she was black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/simone-nina-eunice-kathleen-waymon Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians]&lt;/ref&gt; She then began playing in a small club in Philadelphia to fund her continuing musical education to become a classical pianist and was required to sing as well. She was approached for a recording by Bethlehem Records, and her rendition of &quot;[[I Loves You Porgy]]&quot; became a smash hit in the United States in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=1-62&quot;/&gt; Over the length of her career, Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958 &amp;mdash; when she made her debut with ''[[Little Girl Blue (album)|Little Girl Blue]]'' &amp;mdash; and 1974.  

Her musical style arose from a fusion of [[gospel]] and [[pop music|pop]] songs with [[classical music]], in particular with influences from her first inspiration, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]],&lt;ref&gt;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=23}&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanied with her expressive jazz-like singing in her characteristic low tenor. She injected as much of her classical background into her music as possible to give it more depth and quality, as she felt that pop music was inferior to classical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=91&quot;&gt;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=91}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her intuitive grasp on the audience-performer relationship was gained from a unique background of playing piano accompaniment for church revivals and sermons regularly from the early age of six years.&lt;ref&gt;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=17-19}&lt;/ref&gt;  

After 20 years of performing, she became involved in the [[civil rights movement]] and the direction of her life shifted once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=91&quot;/&gt; Simone's music was highly influential in the fight for equal rights in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Simone|Cleary|2003|p=95}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Youth (1933â1954)===
Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in [[Tryon, North Carolina]]. The sixth of eight children in a poor family, she began playing piano at age three; the first song she learned was &quot;God Be With You, Till We Meet Again&quot;. Demonstrating a talent with the instrument, she performed at her local [[Church (building)|church]], but her concert debut, a classical recital, was given when she was twelve. Simone later claimed that during this performance her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people. Simone said she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Hampton|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|civil rights movement]].

Simone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon, was a strict [[Methodist]] minister and a housemaid. Simone's father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman who at one time owned a dry cleaning business, but who also suffered bouts of ill health. Mary Kate's employer, hearing of her daughter's talent, provided funds for piano lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist in Simone's continued education. With the assistance of this scholarship money she attended high school. 

After finishing high school, she had studied for an interview with the help of a private tutor to study piano further at the [[Curtis Institute]], but she was rejected. Simone believed that this rejection was related directly to her race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|pp=41â43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simone then moved to [[New York City]], where she studied at the [[Juilliard School of Music]].

===Early success (1954â1959)===
To fund her private lessons, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar &amp; Grill on Pacific Avenue in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano. In 1954 she adopted the stage name Nina Simone. &quot;Nina&quot; (from niÃ±a, meaning 'little girl' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) was a [[nickname]] a boyfriend had given to her, and &quot;Simone&quot; was taken from the [[French people|French]] actress [[Simone Signoret]], whom she had seen in the movie ''[[Casque d'or]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Brun-Lambert|2006|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simone's mixture of jazz, [[blues]], and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small, but loyal, fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|pp=48â52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, she befriended and married Don Ross, a [[beatnik]] who worked as a fairground barker, but quickly regretted their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/nina-simone-730232.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Nina Simone | date=2003-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing in small clubs, in 1958 she recorded a rendition of [[George Gershwin]]'s &quot;[[I Loves You Porgy]]&quot; (from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''), which she learned from a [[Billie Holiday]] album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' top&amp;nbsp;40 success in the United States, and her debut album ''[[Little Girl Blue (Nina Simone album)|Little Girl Blue]]'' soon followed on [[Bethlehem Records]]. Simone missed out on more than $1 million in royalties (mainly because of the successful re-release of ''[[My Baby Just Cares for Me]]'' during the 1980s) and never benefited financially from the album, because she had sold her rights to it for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Becoming popular (1959â1964)===
After the success of ''Little Girl Blue'', Simone signed a contract with [[Colpix Records]], and recorded a string of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her, including the choice of material that would be recorded, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. At this point, Simone only performed [[pop music]] to make money to continue her classical music studies, and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simone married a New York police detective, Andrew Stroud, in 1961; Stroud later became her manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;hommage&quot;/&gt;

===Civil rights era (1964â1974)===
In 1964, she changed record distributors, from the American [[Colpix Records|Colpix]] to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Philips Records|Philips]], which also meant a change in the contents of her recordings. Simone had always included songs in her repertoire that drew upon her African-American origins (such as &quot;Brown Baby&quot; and &quot;Zungo&quot; on ''[[Nina at the Village Gate]]'' in 1962). On her debut album for Philips, ''[[Nina Simone In Concert]]'' (live recording, 1964), however, Simone for the first time openly addressed the racial inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song &quot;[[Mississippi Goddam]]&quot;, her response to the murder of [[Medgar Evers]] and the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of a church]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] that killed four black children. The song was released as a single, and it was [[boycott]]ed in certain southern states.&lt;ref name=seeingblack&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seeingblack.com/2003/x060403/nina_simone.shtml|title= Nina Simone: She Cast a Spell â and Made a Choice|accessdate=2007-08-14 |last=Neal |first=Mark Anthony |date=2003-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|pp=90â91}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Old Jim Crow&quot;, on the same album, addressed the [[Jim Crow Laws]].

From then on, a [[civil rights]] message was standard in Simone's recording repertoire, becoming a part of her live performances. Simone performed and spoke at many [[civil rights]] meetings, such as at the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boscarol.com/ninasimone/pages/nina/chrono.php |title= The Nina Simone Database: Timeline|accessdate=2010-07-05 |author= |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simone advocated violent revolution during the civil rights period, rather than [[Martin Luther King]]'s non-violent approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she hoped that African Americans could, by armed combat, form a separate state. Nevertheless, she wrote in her [[autobiography]] that she and her family regarded all races as equal.&lt;ref name=legende/&gt; 

She covered [[Billie Holiday]]'s &quot;[[Strange Fruit]]&quot;, a song about the [[lynching]] of black men in the South, on ''[[Pastel Blues]]'' (1965). She also sang the [[W. Cuney]] poem &quot;Images&quot; on ''[[Let It All Out]]'' (1966), about the absence of pride she saw among African-American women. Simone wrote &quot;[[Four Women (song)|Four Women]]&quot;, a song about four different [[racial stereotype|stereotypes]] of African-American women,&lt;ref name=seeingblack/&gt; and included the recording on her 1966 album ''[[Wild Is the Wind (album)|Wild Is the Wind]]''.

Simone moved from Philips to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] during 1967. She sang &quot;Backlash Blues&quot;, written by her friend [[Langston Hughes]] on her first RCA album, ''[[Nina Simone Sings The Blues]]'' (1967). On ''[[Silk &amp; Soul]]'' (1967), she recorded [[Billy Taylor]]'s &quot;[[I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free]]&quot; and &quot;Turning Point&quot;. The album ''[[Nuff Said]]'' (1968) contains live recordings from the [[Westbury Music Fair]], April 7, 1968, three days after the murder of [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang &quot;Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)&quot;, a song written by her [[Bassist|bass player]], [[Gene Taylor (bassist)|Gene Taylor]], directly after the news of King's death had reached them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|pp=114â115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1969 she performed at the [[Harlem Cultural Festival]] in Harlem's [[Mount Morris Park]]. 

Together with [[Weldon Irvine]], Simone turned the late [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s unfinished play ''[[To Be Young, Gifted, and Black]]'' into a civil rights song. Hansberry had been a personal friend whom Simone credited with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the album ''[[Black Gold (album)|Black Gold]]'' (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and renditions of the song have been recorded by [[Aretha Franklin]] (on her 1972 album ''[[Young, Gifted and Black]]'') and by [[Donny Hathaway]].&lt;ref name=seeingblack/&gt;&lt;ref name=legende/&gt;

===Later life (1974â2003)===
Simone left the United States in September 1970, flying to [[Barbados]] and expecting Stroud to communicate with her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance, and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of a desire for a [[divorce]]. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone's income.

When Simone returned to the United States she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (as a protest against her country's involvement with the [[Vietnam War]]), causing her to return to Barbados again to evade the authorities and prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|pp=120â122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time and she had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, [[Errol Barrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|pp=129â134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Brun-Lambert|2006|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; A close friend, singer [[Miriam Makeba]], then persuaded her to go to [[Liberia]]. After that she lived in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]], before settling in [[France]] during 1992.
&lt;!-- help provide further verified information about Simone's later life. --&gt;

She recorded her last album for RCA, ''It Is Finished'', during 1974. Simone did not make another record until 1978, when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio by [[CTI Records]] owner [[Creed Taylor]]. The result was the album ''[[Baltimore (album)|Baltimore]]'', which, while not a commercial success, did get good reviews and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone's recording output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=18123|title= All about Jazz: review &quot;Fodder on My Wings&quot; &amp; &quot;Baltimore&quot;|accessdate=2007-08-05 |last=Sunderland |first=Celeste |date= 2005-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her choice of material retained its [[eclecticism]], ranging from spiritual songs to [[Hall &amp; Oates|Hall &amp; Oates']] &quot;[[Rich Girl (Hall &amp; Oates song)|Rich Girl]]&quot;. Four years later Simone recorded ''[[Fodder On My Wings]]'' on a French label. During the 1980s Simone performed regularly at [[Ronnie Scott]]'s jazz club in [[London]], where she recorded the album ''[[Live at Ronnie Scott's (Nina Simone album)|Live at Ronnie Scott's]]'' in 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging her audiences sometimes by recounting humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and by soliciting requests. In 1987, the original 1958 recording of &quot;[[My Baby Just Cares For Me]]&quot; was used in a commercial for [[Chanel No. 5]] perfume in the [[United Kingdom]]. This led to a re-release of the recording, which stormed to number 4 on the UK's ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' singles chart, giving her a brief surge in popularity in the UK. Her autobiography, ''[[I Put A Spell On You (book)|I Put a Spell on You]]'', was published in 1992. She recorded her last album, ''[[A Single Woman]]'', in 1993.

In 1993, Simone settled near [[Aix-en-Provence]] in [[Southern France]]. She had suffered from [[breast cancer]] for several years before she died in her sleep at her home in [[Carry-le-Rouet]], [[Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne]] on April 21, 2003. (In addition, Simone received a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1961959.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Best of Times Worst of Times Simone | first=Ria | last=Higgins | date=2007-06-24 | accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Her funeral service was attended by singers [[Miriam Makeba]] and [[Patti Labelle]], poet [[Sonia Sanchez]], actor [[Ossie Davis]], and hundreds of others. [[Elton John]] sent a floral tribute with the message &quot;You were the greatest and I love you&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2975871.stm|title= BBCnews: Funeral held for singer Simone|accessdate=2007-07-22|author= |date= 2003-04-25 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simone's ashes were scattered in several African countries. She left behind a daughter, [[Simone (actress)|Lisa Celeste Stroud]], an actress and singer, who took the stage name [[Simone (actress)|Simone]], and has appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Aida]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/seattle/se54.html|title= Talking Broadway Seattle: Aida|accessdate=2007-08-14 |last=Frank |first= Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style==

===Simone standards===
Throughout her career, Simone assembled a collection of songs that would become standards in her repertoire. These songs were self-written tunes, tributes to works by others with a new arrangement by Simone, or songs written especially for Simone. Her first hit song in America was her rendition of [[George Gershwin]]'s &quot;[[I Loves You, Porgy]]&quot; (1958). It peaked at number 18 in the pop singles chart and number 2 on the black singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r156358/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|title= Allmusic Guide: &quot;I Love You Porgy&quot; Billboard chart position |accessdate=2006-12-07 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During that same period Simone recorded &quot;[[My Baby Just Cares for Me]]&quot;, which would become her biggest success years later, in 1987, when it was featured in a [[Chanel No. 5]] perfume commercial. A [[music video]] was created by [[Aardman Studios]] for the commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boscarol.com/nina/html/where/mybabyjustcaresf.html|title= Nina Simone Web: My Baby Just Cares for Me |accessdate=2006-12-07 |last=Boscarol |first=Mauro |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061116020336/http://www.boscarol.com/nina/html/where/mybabyjustcaresf.html |archivedate = November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;includeonly&gt;!!DON'T put detailed cover/sample/soundtrack use of songs here, only the very basics. Put that sort of information on the ARTICLE ABOUT THE SONG OR ALBUM!!&lt;/includeonly&gt;
Well known songs from her Philips albums include &quot;[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]&quot; on ''[[Broadway-Blues-Ballads]]'' (1964), &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, &quot;Ne Me Quitte Pas&quot; (a rendition of a [[Jacques Brel]] song) and &quot;[[Feeling Good]]&quot; on [[I Put A Spell On You (album)|''I Put A Spell On You'']] (1965), &quot;[[Lilac Wine]]&quot; and &quot;[[Wild Is the Wind (song)|Wild Is the Wind]]&quot; on ''[[Wild Is the Wind (album)|Wild is the Wind]]'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Hampton|2004|pp=196â202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Especially the songs &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, and &quot;[[Sinnerman]]&quot; (''[[Pastel Blues]]'', 1965) have great popularity today in terms of [[cover version]]s (most notably a version of the former song by [[The Animals]]), sample usage, and its use on soundtracks for various movies, TV-series, and video games. &quot;Sinnerman&quot;, in particular, has been featured in the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' and ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', on movies such as ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', ''[[Miami Vice (2006 film)|Miami Vice]]'', and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'', and sampled by artists such as [[Talib Kweli]] and [[Timbaland]]. The song &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; was sampled by [[Devo Springsteen]] on &quot;Misunderstood&quot; from [[Common (artist)|Common's]] 2007 album ''[[Finding Forever]]'', and by little-known producers Rodnae and Mousa for the song &quot;Don't Get It&quot; on [[Lil Wayne]]'s 2008 album ''[[Tha Carter III]]''. The song &quot;[[Sea Lion Woman|See-Line Woman]]&quot; was sampled by [[Kanye West]] for &quot;Bad News&quot; on his album ''[[808s and Heartbreak]]''.

Simone's years at RCA-Victor spawned a number of singles and album songs that were popular, particularly in Europe. In 1968, it was &quot;[[Ain't Got No, I Got Life]]&quot;, a medley from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' from the album ''[['Nuff Said!]]'' (1968) that became a surprise hit for Simone, reaching number 4 on the UK pop charts and introducing her to a younger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Hampton|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it returned to the UK Top 30 in a remixed version by Groovefinder. The following single, [[Bee Gees|the Bee Gees']] rendition of &quot;[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]&quot; also reached the UK top 10 in 1969. &quot;[[House of the Rising Sun]]&quot; was featured on ''[[Nina Simone Sings The Blues]]'' in 1967, but Simone had recorded the song in 1961 and it was featured on ''[[Nina At The Village Gate]]'' (1962), predating the versions by [[Dave Van Ronk]] and [[Bob Dylan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boscarol.com/nina/html/where/houseoftherising.html|title= Nina Simone Web: House of the Rising Sun|accessdate=2006-12-07 |last=Boscarol |first=Mauro |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061113120850/http://www.boscarol.com/nina/html/where/houseoftherising.html |archivedate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Hampton|2004|pp=202â214}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later covered by The Animals, for whom it became a signature hit.

===Performing style===
Simone's bearing and stage presence earned her the title &quot;High Priestess of Soul&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} She was a piano player, singer, and performer, &quot;separately and simultaneously&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hommage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.high-priestess.com/biography.html|title= L'hommage: Nina Simone Biography|accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=|date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
On stage, Simone moved from [[gospel]] to blues, jazz, and [[folk music|folk]], to numbers with European classical styling, and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]-style fugal [[counterpoint]]. She incorporated monologues and dialogues with the audience into the program, and often used silence as a musical element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jazzlinks.net/nina-simone.html|title= Dr. Nina Simone: Biography|accessdate=2010-02-21 |last=Nupie |first=Roger |date = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simone compared it to &quot;mass hypnosis.

Throughout most of her life and recording career she was accompanied by [[percussionist]] Leopoldo Fleming and [[guitarist]] and musical director Al Schackman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Simone|Cleary|2003|pp=58â59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simone had a reputation in the music industry for her volatility. In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with a [[pneumatic]] pistol after his laughter disturbed her concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2965225.stm|title= BBC Obituary: Nina Simone|accessdate=2006-12-07 |author= |date= 2003-04-21 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also fired a gun at a record company executive whom she accused of stealing royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/302438.stm|title= BBC Hard Talk: Putting Music First|accessdate=2006-12-07 |last=Sebastian |first=Tim |date= 1999-03-25 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hampton 9â13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Hampton|2004|pp=9â13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this was only known to a small group of intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography ''Break Down And Let It All Out'' written by Sylvia Hampton and [[David Nathan (music critic)|David Nathan]] revealed this in 2004 after her death.

[[John Lennon]] cited Simone's version of ''&quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;'' as a source of inspiration for the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song ''&quot;[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]&quot;''.&lt;ref name=influenced/&gt;
Musicians who have covered her work (or her specific renditions of songs) include [[Black Rock Coalition|Black Rock Coalition Orchestra]], [[J.Viewz]], [[Carola StandertskjÃ¶ld|Carola]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Donny Hathaway]], [[David Bowie]], Elkie Brooks, [[Roberta Flack]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[The Animals]], [[Shivaree (band)]], [[Ambrosia Parsley]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Cat Power]], [[Katie Melua]], [[Timbaland]], [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], [[Shara Worden]], [[Common (entertainer)|Common]], [[Lil Wayne]], and [[Michael BublÃ©]].

Frequently her music is used in [[remix]]es, [[commercials]], and TV series.

===Film===
The documentary ''Nina Simone: La Legende'' (''The Legend'') was made in the 1990s by French filmmakers,&lt;ref name=legende/&gt; based on her autobiography ''I Put A Spell On You''. It features live footage from different periods of her career, interviews with friends and family, various interviews with Simone then living in the [[Netherlands]], and while on a trip to her birthplace. A portion of footage from ''The Legend'' was taken from an earlier 26-minute biographical documentary by Peter Rodis, released in 1969 and entitled simply, ''Nina''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3059302655201807197&amp;hl=en Peter Rodis documentary, &quot;Nina&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her filmed 1976 performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival is available on video courtesy of Eagle Rock Entertainment, and it is screened annually in New York City at an event called, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Nina Simone: Montreux, 1976,&quot;, which is curated by Tom Blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nypress.com/article-21034-pressed-for-time-the-rise-and-fall-of-nina-simone.html|title=Pressed for time: The Rise And Fall Of Nina Simone |first=Joshua David |last=Stein |date=24 March 2010 |publisher=New York Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for a Nina Simone [[biographical film]] were released at the end of 2005, to be based on Simone's autobiography ''I Put A Spell On You'' (1992) and to focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006. TV writer Cynthia Mort (''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'') is working on the [[Screenplay|script]], and singer [[Mary J. Blige]] will play the lead role. Release of the movie is scheduled for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493076/ Untitled Nina Simone Project at IMDB.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her music was used in the S4C show, &quot;Alys&quot;, in 2010.&lt;!--needs a correct date, &quot;recently&quot; will become meaningless rather quickly and this date is fudged--&gt;

A song sung by Nina Simone on her 1970 live album, ''Black Gold'', is used in the film ''The Dancer Upstairs''.

In the film ''[[Point of No Return (film)|Point of No Return]]'', the protagonist choses &quot;Nina&quot; as her codename in honor of Simone, her mother's favorite musical artist as well as her own.  Simone's music features prominently in the film.

===Honors===
On [[Human Kindness Day]] 1974 in [[Washington, D.C.]], more than 10,000 people paid tribute to Nina Simone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ref=none|Hampton|2004|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/24/AR2005042400984.html|title= Answer Man: Kindness Turned Brutality|accessdate=2007-01-05 |last=Kelly |first=John | work=The Washington Post | date=2005-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Simone received two [[honorary degree]]s in music and humanities, from the [[University of Massachusetts]] and [[Malcolm X College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/70/|title= Remembering Nina Simone|accessdate=2006-12-07 |last=Kolodzey |first=Jody}}&lt;/ref&gt; She preferred to be called &quot;Dr. Nina Simone&quot; after these honors were bestowed upon her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.williams.edu/alumni/alumnireview/fall04/Signature.pdf |title= A Diva's Spell |accessdate=2006-12-07 |last=Hanson |first=Eric |year= 2004|format= pdf |work= Williams Alumni Review |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060910135813/http://www.williams.edu/alumni/alumnireview/fall04/Signature.pdf |archivedate = September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two days before her death, Simone was awarded an honorary degree by the [[Curtis Institute]], the music school that had refused to admit her as a student at the beginning of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20080619032445/http://www.theninasimonefoundation.org/content.php?page=biography|title= The Nina Simone Foundation|accessdate=2006-12-07 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
