'''Alabama''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alabama.ogg|Ë|Ã¦|l|É|Ë|b|Ã¦|m|É}} is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Southern United States|southeastern region]] of the [[United States]]. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways. The state ranks 23rd in population with 4.7&amp;nbsp;million residents in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=Alabama Quick Facts |accessdate= December 30, 2010 |work=State and County Quick Facts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and [[African American]]s were under-represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archivedate=2007-10-17 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary, accessed March 10, 2008 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and technology.  In addition, the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Air Force]], added to state jobs.

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the ''[[Northern Flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;[[Dixie|Heart of Dixie]].&quot; The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[Longleaf Pine]], the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[Camellia]]. The capital of Alabama is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].  The largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. The largest city by total land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], founded by French [[colonists]].

===Etymology===
The [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River]]s on the upper reaches of the [[Alabama River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=0-8173-0231-X |oclc=10724679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the [[etymology|etymological source]] of the names of the river and state. In the [[Alabama language]], the word for an Alabama person is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''AlbÃ amo'' in different dialects; the plural form &quot;Alabama persons&quot; is ''Albaamaha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and Montler, Timothy |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=0-292-73077-2 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Alabama'' is believed to have originated from the [[Choctaw language]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rogers |first=William W.|coauthors=Robert D.

Although the origin of ''Alabama'' could be discerned, sources disagree on its meaning. An 1842 article in the ''Jacksonville Republican'' originated the idea that the meaning was &quot;Here We Rest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of [[Alexander Beaufort Meek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  Experts in the [[Muskogean languages]] have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw ''alba'' (meaning &quot;plants&quot; or &quot;weeds&quot;) and ''amo'' (meaning &quot;to cut,&quot; &quot;to trim,&quot; or &quot;to gather&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanton1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanton |first=John R. |authorlink=John R.

===Indigenous peoples, early history===
[[File:Cheaha Lake in the Fall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Cheaha]], Alabama's highest point]]

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the Northeast via the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000&amp;nbsp;BCâAD&amp;nbsp;700) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title = Alabama |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date= 2006-08-11 |work = The New York Times Almanac 2004|publisher = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600, with one of its major centers being at the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Welch |first = Paul D. |title = Moundville's Economy |publisher = [[University of Alabama Press]] |year = 1991 |isbn = 0-8173-0512-2 |oclc = 21330955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Walthall |first = John A. |title = Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher = [[University of Alabama Press]] |year = 1990 |isbn = 0-8173-0552-1 |oclc = 26656858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] recovered from [[archaeological]] excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] (SECC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Townsend |first = Richard F. |title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]] |publisher = [[Yale University Press]] |year = 2004 |isbn = 0-300-10601-7 |oclc = 56633574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to [[Mesoamerica]]n culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors = F.

Among the historical tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were  [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]], and the [[Muskogean]]-speaking [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (''Alibamu''), [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], [[Koasati]], and [[Mobilian Jargon|Mobile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |title = Alabama Indian Tribes |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = Updated 2006 |work= Indian Tribal Records |publisher= AccessGenealogy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European settlement===
The French founded the first European settlement in the region at [[Old Mobile Site|Old Mobile]], in 1702.&lt;ref name=&quot;US50&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |title= Alabama State History |accessdate= 2006-09-23 |date= |work= |publisher = theUS50.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was French from 1702 to 1763; part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1780. Thomas Bassett was the first British settler in the state. He settled near what is now [[Tombigbee River]] in [[Washington County, Alabama|Washington County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/aha/markers/washington.html |title=Alabama Historical Association Marker Program: Washington County |publisher=Archives.state.al.us |date= |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama became part of Spanish West Florida from 1780 to 1810; part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] for a short time (90 days); annexed by the U.S. and added to the [[Territory of Orleans]] (1810); and, finally, added to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Throughout these later developments, however, the Spanish had kept a nominal (although largely ignored) governmental presence in the region, based out of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. When [[Andrew Jackson]]'s forces occupied Mobile in 1814 âwhile preparing for the [[Battle of New Orleans]] âhe demonstrated the United States' ''[[de facto]]'' authority over the region, effectively ending Spanish governance (though not its claim), while gaining an unencumbered passage to the gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateMaster&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.statemaster.com/graph-T/bac_sum |title= AL-Alabama |accessdate= 2006-09-23 |date= |work= Landscapes and History by state |publisher= StateMaster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area making up today's northern and central Alabama, known as the [[Yazoo lands]], had been claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] after 1763. Following the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], it remained a part of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|state of Georgia]] âalthough heavily disputed. Conflicting claims to the area were held, first by several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[tribe]]s (most notably the [[Chickamauga Indian|Chickamauga-Cherokee]] and [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]]), by other states (e.g. [[South Carolina]]); and by the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]]; [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[Spain]]. In 1802, the region was joined to the [[Mississippi Territory]].  Individual statehood was delayed, however, by the territory's lack of a coastline.

===Statehood, Civil War and Reconstruction===
[[File:Oldalabamastatecapruinsintuscaloosa.png|thumb|left|Old Alabama state capital ruins at Capital Park in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] ]]

Alabama became the twenty-second state âadmitted to the Union in 1819.  Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men. Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of the fertile soil. Southeastern planters and traders from the [[Upper South]] brought [[slavery|slaves]] with them as the cotton [[plantations]] expanded. The economy of the central &quot;[[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]&quot; (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton [[plantations]] whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became [[subsistence farmers]]. The 1860 census records show that enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the state's total population of 964,201. There were only 2,690 [[Freedman|free persons of color]] living in Alabama at the time.

From 1826 to 1846, [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] served as the capital of Alabama. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. In time, a Capitol building was erected under the direction of a [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania architect. The original structure burnt down in 1849 but was rebuilt in 1851 following the original plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-South/Montgomery-History.html Montgomery: History - Early Days in Montgomery, Lafayette's Visit a Local Highlight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and joined the [[Confederate States of America]]. While few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers to the [[American Civil War]]. Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th&amp;nbsp;Amendment in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistDocs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historicaldocuments.com/13thAmendment.htm |title = 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Abolition of Slavery (1865) |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |year = 2005 |work = Historical Documents |publisher = HistoricalDocuments.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the new state legislators created a public school system for the first time, as well as establishing some welfare institutions to help its people.  Alabama was officially restored to the Union in 1868.

After the Civil War, the state was still chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.  Planters resisted working with free labor during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and sought to re-establish controls over [[freedmen]]. In the early years the [[Ku Klux Klan]] had numerous independent chapters in Alabama that attacked freedmen and other Republicans.  After it was suppressed, [[insurgent]] whites organized [[paramilitary]] groups, such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]], that acted more openly to suppress black voting.  Regaining power by the late 1870s, in the last decade of the 19th century, white Democrats passed electoral laws [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchise]] most blacks and many poor whites.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Having regained power in the state legislature, Democrats passed [[Jim Crow laws]], including [[racial segregation]] in public facilities, to restore white supremacy in the society.

In 1875, the state passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], to prohibit public money from being used to finance Catholic schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900â1960===
[[Image:FSA school in Alabama.gif|thumb|School in Alabama ([[Farm Security Administration]], 1935)]]

The new 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]] effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites through voting restrictions, including literacy requirements. While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] poor whites as well, due mostly to imposition of a cumulative [[poll tax]].

In 1900, 14 [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]] counties had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls.{{Clarify|I assume that this is total voters|date=June 2011}} By June 1, 1903, the number of {{Clarify|&quot;total&quot;|date=June 2011}} registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 had qualified to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were [[literate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt;

By 1941, a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all African Americans lost the ability to vote.

The disfranchisement was ended  by African Americans' leading the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights.  The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] also protected the [[suffrage]] of poor whites.

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title = The Black Belt |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = 2004-04-19 |work = Southern Spaces Internet Journal |publisher = Emory University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;Historical Populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920, reflecting the effect of emigration.

At the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed &quot;The Magic City.&quot; By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th&amp;nbsp;largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Birmingham |title=Birmingham |publisher=Bhamwiki |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlabamaWelcome.JPG|thumb|left|This structure greets drivers visiting the Alabama Welcome Center just inside the AL/GA border off of [[Interstate 20]].]]

Industrial development related to the demands of [[World War II]] brought prosperity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor [[George Wallace]], many whites in the state opposed federal integration efforts in schools and public facilities.

===1960âpresent===
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs.

During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. ''[[De jure]]'' segregation ended in the states as [[Jim Crow laws]] were invalidated or repealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070221054512/http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archivedate = 2007-02-21 |title = Voting Rights |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = 2002-01-09 |work = Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher = U.S.Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population.  This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

After 1972, the state's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states). Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have voted increasingly Republican in state elections.  In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.southerner.net/v1n1_99/coverstory1.html |title = The New South Rises, Again |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = Spring 1999 |work = Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher = Southerner.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}

The state is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') under the [[KÃ¶ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Koppen Climate Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facstaff.unca.edu/cgodfrey/courses/atms179/ppt/greenhouse.pdf |title=Greenhouse effect and climate |accessdate= |author=Christopher M. Godfrey  |date=2008-11-04 |year= |month= |work=Atmospheric Sciences |publisher=University of North Carolina, Asheville |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is 64&amp;nbsp;Â°F (18&amp;nbsp;Â°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |title=Alabama Climate |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&amp;nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States, with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|Â°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

[[File:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Though winters in the state are usually mild, nightly freezing occurs frequently in the [[North Alabama]] region. This is shown in this picture taken at the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]] in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]] during early January.]]

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorms]]. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]] â the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lls/fatalities_us.html Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990â2003]. NLSI. Retrieved May 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama, along with [[Kansas]], has the most reported [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5 tornadoes]] of any state â according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to October 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadoproject.com/fscale/fscale.htm Fujita scale]. Tornadoproject.com. Retrieved September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Several long â tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state, even surpassing [[Texas]] which has a much larger area within [[Tornado Alley]].  The state suffered damage in the [[Super Outbreak]] of April 1974, and the [[April 25â28, 2011 tornado outbreak]].

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state.  Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state â along the Tennessee Valley â is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|Â°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|Â°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years.  Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]].  The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year.  In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20-23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher.  In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

In 1984, under the DavisâStrong Act, Alabama established a state Indian Commission and [[State recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] seven American Indian tribes, including the Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama, which is a [[501 (c)|501 (c)(3)]] group. It is made up of descendants of the [[Chickamauga Indian|Chickamauga]] [[Cherokee]] and others who managed to evade [[Indian Removal]] in the 1830s. Working with [[Auburn University]], the tribe has begun a revival of the [[Cherokee language]].

===Agriculture===
Alabama's [[agricultural]] outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and [[sorghum]], vegetables, milk, [[soybean]]s, and peaches. Although known as &quot;The Cotton State,&quot; Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cber.cba.ua.edu/pdf/ab2005q4.pdf |title = Alabama and CBER: 75 Years of Change |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = Q4 2005 |work = Alabama Business |publisher = Center for Business and Economic Research, Culverhouse College of Commerce, The University of Alabama|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aces.edu/dept/nass/bulletin/2005/pg05.pdf |title = State Highlights for 2004â2005 |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |year = 2005 |work = Alabama Cooperative Extension System |publisher = USDA, NASS, Alabama Statistical Office|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Texas, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Mississippi]] comprising the top three.

===Industry===
[[File:USSRC Rocket Park.JPG|thumb|left|[[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] ]]

Alabama's [[industry|industrial]] outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, [[lumber]], and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and [[apparel]]. Also, Alabama produces [[aerospace]] and [[electronics|electronic]] products, mostly in the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] area, location of [[NASA]]'s [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Most Alabama's economic growth is due to the state's expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are [[Honda Manufacturing of Alabama]], [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], [[Mercedes-Benz U.S. International]], and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], as well as their various suppliers.  Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in automobile output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2008_fotw539.html |title=Vehicle Technologies Program: Fact #539: October 6, 2008 Light Vehicle Production by State |publisher=.eere.energy.gov |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel producers [[Nucor]], [[SSAB]], [[ThyssenKrupp]], and [[U.S. Steel]] have facilities in Alabama and employ over 10,000 people.  In May 2007, German steelmaker [[ThyssenKrupp]] selected Alabama for a $3.7&amp;nbsp;billion steel production plant, with the promise of 2,700 permanent jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=ThyssenKrupp's Alabama incentive package tops $811&amp;nbsp;million |newspaper= [[Press-Register]] |date= May 11, 2007 |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2007/05/mobile_county_wins_thyssenkrup.html |accessdate= July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ThyssenKrupp's new facilities reach full production capacity, Alabama is expected to become the third largest steel producing state in the country behind Indiana and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alalabor.state.al.us/PDFs/SteelCouncilNewsletter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hunt Refining Company]], a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there. The company also operates terminals in Mobile, Melvin, and [[Moundville, Alabama|Moundville]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.linkedin.com/company/hunt-refining-company Hunt Refining Company].&quot; Linkedin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[JVC|JVC America, Inc.]], a wholly owned subsidiary of JVC Americas Corp., operates an [[optical disc]] replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.jvcdiscusa.com/about/company.aspx Company Overview].&quot; JVC America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:AlabamaGulfShores2010.jpg|thumb|right|Alabama's beaches have a strong impact on the state's economy]]

An estimated 100,000 tourists annually from other countries visit the state, including from Canada, England, Germany and Japan. In 2006, 22.3 million tourists spent $8.3 billion providing an estimated 162,000 jobs in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1268 Encyclopedia of Alabama: Alabama Tourism Department (ATD)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.800alabama.com/about-alabama/alabama-news-facts/frequently-asked-questions/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David A. |last=Fahrenthold |title=Obama to survey environmental damage in gulf |url=| work= |publisher=Washington Pose |location=Washington, DC |pages= A6 |date=2 May 2010 |id= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===

[[UAB Hospital]] is the only [[trauma center|Level I trauma center]] in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facs.org/trauma/verified.html |title=Verified Trauma Centers |date=December 30, 2010 |work=American College of Surgeons, Verified Trauma Centers |accessdate=2011-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://webspace.utexas.edu/jas5349/Research_Data.htm)]&lt;/ref&gt;  UAB is the largest employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 20,000.

===Banking===
Alabama has the headquarters of [[Regions Financial Corporation]], [[BBVA Compass]] and [[Superior Bancorp]]. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Spanish-based [[BBVA]] in September 2007, although the headquarters of BBVA Compass remains in Birmingham. In November 2006, Regions Financial completed its merger with [[AmSouth Bancorporation]], which was also headquartered in Birmingham. [[SouthTrust Corporation]], another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by [[Wachovia]] in 2004 for $14.3 billion. The city still has major operations for Wachovia and its now post-operating bank [[Wells Fargo]], which includes a regional headquarters, a operations center campus and a $400 million dollar data center. Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham, such as Superior Bancorp, [[ServisFirst]] and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including [[Harbert Management Corporation]].

===Electronics===
Telecommunications provider [[AT&amp;T]], formerly [[BellSouth]], also has a major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham. The company has over 6,000 employees and more than 1,200 contract employees.

Many commercial technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville, such as the network access company [[ADTRAN]], computer graphics company [[Intergraph]], design and manufacturer of IT infrastructure [[Avocent]], and telecommunications provider [[Deltacom]]. [[Cinram]] manufactures and distributes 20th Century Fox DVDs and Blu-ray Discs out of their Huntsville plant.

===Construction===
Rust International has grown to include [[Brasfield &amp; Gorrie]], [[BE&amp;K]], [[Hoar Construction]] and [[B.L. Harbert International]], which all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. (Rust International was acquired in 2000 by [[Washington Group International]], which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based [[URS Corporation]] in 2007.)

===Transportation===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].  The Port of Mobile is currently the 9th-largest by [[tonnage]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ports1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=WATERBORNE COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES |work=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Waterborne Commerce Statistics| page=90| url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/wcusnatl08.pdf| accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barge]] transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the [[Black Warrior River]] useful in the state of Alabama.

==Law and government==
[[File:Alabama state capitol, Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol]], built in 1850]]

===State government===
{{Main|Government of Alabama}}

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
|last = Roig-Franzia |first = Manuel |title = Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |publisher = Washington Post |date = 2004-11-28 |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27?language=printer |accessdate = 2006-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Constitution of Alabama - 1901 |work = The Alabama Legislative Information System |url = http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |accessdate = 2006-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

Alabama is divided into three equal branches:
The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation.

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]].

The [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]].

===Taxes===
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are not allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, but can deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes.

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070520231150/http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sl_sales.html Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes], July 2004 Retrieved on May 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1812 |title=Reducing Alabama's Income Tax on Working-Poor Families: Two Options&amp;nbsp;â 4/14/99 |publisher=Cbpp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt; Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt;

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970â2007) |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |work=Tax Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Property tax]]es are the lowest in the United States. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&amp;nbsp;million.

===Local and county government===
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=310}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves &quot;dry&quot;; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.

===Politics===
{{further|[[Political party strength in Alabama]]}}
[[File:Dr. Robert Bentley.png|thumb|Alabama Governor Robert Bentley]]

The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert J. Bentley|Robert Bentley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is Republican [[Kay Ivey]]. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Democrat [[Sue Bell Cobb]]. The [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial [[veto]] by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.

After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a  controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican Governor [[Bob Riley]] signed, a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State elections===
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]],&quot; a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election.

Developments in the 1986 Democratic primary election led to the election of the first [[Alabama Republican Party|Republican]] Governor in more than 100 years and started Republicans on the road to political dominance in the state.  One million voters cast ballots in the 1986 Democratic primary. The then-incumbent Lieutenant Governor, [[Bill Baxley]], lost the [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination for Governor by approximately 8,000 votes to then fellow Democratic Attorney General [[Charles Graddick]]. The state Democratic party's five-member election contest committee invalidated the primary election result claiming that thousands of Republicans had &quot;illegally&quot; voted in the Democratic primary for Graddick and as a result they removed Graddick from the ballot.  The Democratic Party then placed Baxley's name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate instead of Graddick. The voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the Republican challenger [[Guy Hunt]] as Governor.&lt;ref&gt;Stovall, Cotter, &amp; Fisher, Alabama Political Almanac, p. 260, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt had been nominated in a statewide Republican primary that had 28,000 participants compared to the 1,000,000 plus of the Democratic primary.  That November Hunt became the first Republican Governor elected in Alabama since Reconstruction when he won 57% of the vote statewide against Baxley.

Since 1986, Republicans have won six of the seven Governors elections and become increasingly competitive in Alabama politics at many levels.   They currently control [[111th United States Congress|both seats]] in the U.S. Senate and six out of the state's [[112th United States Congress|seven congressional seats]].

Republicans hold all nine seats on the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor - Breaking News from The Birmingham News - al.com |publisher=Blog.al.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts.  Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994.  In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, Sonny Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry Oliver Hooper, Sr]].  Hornsby sued Alabama in court and defiantly remained in office for more than a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.  This ultimately would lead to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles and ultimately losing the last of the nineteen court seats following the resignation of the last Democrat in August, 2011.

Today, Republicans also hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices.  Republicans also hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]].  In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years.  However, Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title= Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy, Press-Register |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=Blog.al.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, [[Steve Windom]] and [[Kay Ivey]], the current Lieutenant Governor. Windom served as [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|Lt. Governor]] under Democratic Gov. [[Don Siegelman]].  Before 2011, the last time that Alabama had a governor and Lieutenant Governor of the same party was the period between 1983 and 1987 when [[George Wallace]] was serving his fourth term as governor and [[Bill Baxley]] was serving as Lieutenant Governor; both were Democrats.

In Alabama, the members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections, but the statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html|title = Alabama's Legislative Process |first = McDowell |last= Lee|year = 2009|publisher = State of Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local elections===
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats.

From 1876 through 1956, Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by large margins. In 1960, the Democrats won with [[John F. Kennedy]] on the ballot, but the Democratic electors from Alabama gave 6 of their 11 electoral votes as a protest to [[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] carried the state.

In [[United States presidential election, 1968|the 1968 presidential election]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]] over both [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Wallace was the official [[Democratic]] candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was the [[National Democratic Party of Alabama|National Democratic]] nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=1968&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0 |title=1968 Presidential General Election Results â Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=1968-11-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], Democratic candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.

Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and until 2010 comprised a longstanding majority in the [[Alabama Legislature]]; see [[Dixiecrat]].

In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote, mostly white voters. The 11 counties that voted Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where African Americans are the majority racial group.

The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]], both Republicans.

In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Jo Bonner]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Spencer Bachus]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]]).

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Alabama}}

===Primary and secondary education===
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alsde.edu/general/quick_facts.pdf |title = Alabama Education Quick Facts 2007 |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006â2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;/&gt; In 2007, over 82&amp;nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the State of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AYP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alsde.edu/Accountability/2007Reports/Press/2007AYPNewsRelease.pdf |title = Eighty-Two Percent of Alabama Schools Make AYP While Increasing Annual Measurable Objectives |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Alabama's public education system has improved,&lt;!---since when? without date this means nothing. Also this para chronicles NO improvement---&gt; it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate â 75% â is the second lowest in the United States (after Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics].
