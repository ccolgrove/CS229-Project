In early 2000, The Musgroves leave Brookside Close due to Luke's confession to raping Nikki.

===''Hollyoaks''===
During 2000, Matt moves to Hollyoaks village in [[Chester]] as a janitor at [[Hollyoaks Community College]], where he becomes close friends with [[Theo Sankofa]] and [[Alex Bell (Hollyoaks)|Alex Bell]]. He then falls for student and radio show host [[Chloe Bruce]]. However, he is not keen on asking Chloe out as he feels that she may dislike him due to his occupation. Therefore, Matt decides to phone her on her radio show and pretend to be someone else. When Matt finally reveals himself, Chloe is disappointed â leaving Matt's worst fears confirmed.

Despite this setback, Chloe decides to give Matt a chance and the pair become a couple. The relationship is going well, until Chloe has self-image issues and begins to push Matt away. This results in the pair breaking up, which leaves Matt disappointed due to his love for her. Matt ends up having a one-night-stand with new student Eve Crawford, but he is reluctant not to carry on with the relationship, as it is Chloe who he wants to be with. Eventually, Matt and Chloe get back together, as Matt supports her through her problems. Matt eventually proposes to Chloe. The pair become engaged and Chloe's demands for the wedding prove to be expensive. However, Matt is adamant to give her the best wedding ever. He turns to The Loft owner [[Scott Anderson (Hollyoaks)|Scott Anderson]], and soon becomes involved in Scott's counterfeit money scam. Matt manages to pay for the wedding with counterfeit money, but it proves costly. On his wedding day, the police turn up and Chloe learns the truth about Matt's dealings with Scott. Knowing about Matt lies, Chloe decides she does not want to go through with the wedding, leaving Matt to face the police on his own. Despite attempting to persuade Chloe to take him back, she refuses, leaving Matt to depart away from Hollyoaks.

Matt makes a brief return in 2004, in the late night spin-off ''[[Hollyoaks: After Hours]]'', where he is working as a sailor and helps [[Ben Davies (Hollyoaks)|Ben Davies]], [[Jake Dean]], [[Joe Spencer (Hollyoaks)|Joe Spencer]] and [[Dan Hunter]] escape from a mob who are running after them.
