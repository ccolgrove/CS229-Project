After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore toured North America on the [[Alternative press tour|Alternative Press Tour]], supporting bands such as [[All Time Low]] and [[The Rocket Summer]], and appeared on the cover of ''Alternative Press'' annual ''100 Bands You Need to Know'' issue.&lt;ref name=top100&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Bands You Need to Know|url=http://www.altpress.com/magazine/issue/237-1_-_100_bands_you_need_to_know_2008/|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Moore went into recording for his debut album, titled ''Bells'', alongside producer Noah Shain.

==Biography==
===From First to Last (2004â2007)===
Moore grew up in [[Northeast Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;skrillexhottopic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Glazer|first=Joshua|title=Skrillex: Strictly Laptop|work=[[Hot Topic]]|url=http://community.hottopic.com/interview/skrillex-strictly-laptop|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of [[From First to Last]] about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, [[Epitaph Records]] released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, ''[[Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count]]''.
After performing on several successful tours, two being the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, ''[[Heroine (From First to Last album)|Heroine]]'' with producer [[Ross Robinson]]. The album was released in March 2006 on [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]]. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]]. 
===Solo career (2007â2011)===
Moore announced he had left [[From First to Last]] to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (&quot;Signal&quot;, &quot;Equinox&quot;, and &quot;Glow Worm&quot;). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building.

After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the [[Team Sleep]] Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts [[Monster in the Machine]] and [[Strata (band)|Strata]]. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in &quot;baby blue envelopes&quot;, each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate.

In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with [[All Time Low]], [[The Rocket Summer]], [[The Matches]], and [[Forever the Sickest Kids]], as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards.

On April 7, 2009, he released ''[[Gypsyhook EP]]'', a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of &quot;Mora&quot; entitled &quot;æµ·æ°´&quot;. Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with [[Innerpartysystem]] and [[Paper Route (band)|Paper Route]] and opening for [[Chiodos]] on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with [[Hollywood Undead]] in April 2009 performing under the band name '''Sonny and the Blood Monkeys''', with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion &amp; beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming &amp; turntables)

Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has been reported in interviews and at events saying ''Bells'' will no longer be released.
