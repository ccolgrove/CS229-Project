The '''Auckland mayoral election, 2010''', was part of the [[New Zealand local elections, 2010]]. It was the first election of a mayor for the enlarged [[Auckland Council]], informally known as the &quot;super-city&quot;. The election was won by sitting mayor of [[Manukau City]] [[Len Brown]] with 237,487 votes, over sitting mayor of [[Auckland City]] [[John Banks (New Zealand)|John Banks]] with 171,542 and first-time candidate [[Colin Craig]] with 42,598. The sitting mayor of [[North Shore City]] [[Andrew Williams (New Zealand)|Andrew Williams]] polled fourth and actor/director [[Simon Prast]] fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/2010Elections/Results/Pages/Finalresults-Mayor.aspx |title=Final results - mayor |publisher=Auckland Council |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election occurred on Saturday 9 October 2010, as per the Local Electoral Act 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2001/0035/latest/DLM93441.html?search=ts_act_\Electoral++Act_resel&amp;p=1#DLM93441 Local Electoral Act 2001 No 35 (as at 24 January 2009), Public Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the majority of New Zealand mayoral elections, the election was held by [[postal voting]] using the [[first-past-the-post]] system. It was the largest election of the 2010 local elections, with some 961,536 eligible voters (32.5% of all registered voters nationally) able to vote in the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;enrolstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/councils/ages/district_76_auckland.htm |title= Enrolment Statistics for Auckland Council - Elections New Zealand |date= 2010-08-20 |accessdate= 2010-10-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/ages/electorate_all.html |title= Enrolment Statistics for the whole of New Zealand - Elections New Zealand |date= 2010-08-20 |accessdate= 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Lee (New Zealand politician)|Mike Lee]] and [[Stephen Tindall]] did not stand for mayor (though Lee stood as a councillor) but they were included in several opinion polls on a &quot;what if&quot; basis only.
 
Because Len Brown is generally associated with [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], and John Banks with [[New Zealand National Party|National]], some analysts remarked that the election was likely to involve more party politics than usual in Auckland.&lt;ref name=&quot;GREYMAN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Grey man' to lead the Supercity?|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=117&amp;objectid=10649966|accessdate=26 July 2010|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two front-running candidates Brown and Banks were estimated to have spent around $1 million each on their campaigns, most from bigger donors. It was commented that the fact that Banks' advertising concentrated too much on the old [[Auckland City]] area, missing out other parts of the new council areas, and especially the south, may have played a role in his poorer than expected showing.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITY&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Old fashioned city campaign may have hurt Banks badly|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/local-government/news/article.cfm?c_id=250&amp;objectid=10679461|accessdate=16 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
