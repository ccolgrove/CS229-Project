The '''Wuguang High-Speed Railway''' ({{zh|s=æ­¦å¹¿é«ééè·¯|t=æ­¦å»£é«ééµè·¯|p=WÇguÇng GÄosÃ¹ TiÄlÃ¹}}), short for '''BeijingâGuangzhou High-Speed Railway, WuhanâGuangzhou Section''', is a {{convert|968|km|adj=on}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/photo/2009-05/04/content_16417769.htm âäºä¸âå¥æå¨å·¥å°] Xinhua, 2009-05-04&lt;/ref&gt; [[high-speed rail]] line, operated by [[China Railway High-speed]] (CRH), connecting [[Wuhan]] ([[Hubei]]) and [[Guangzhou]] ([[Guangdong]]), in the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is the world's fastest train service,&lt;ref name=Dasgupta /&gt; initially using coupled [[China Railways CRH2|CRH2]]C and [[China Railways CRH3|CRH3]]C trains which average {{convert|313|km/h|mph}} in non-stop commercial service.

The line is part of the future 2100-km long [[BeijingâGuangzhou High-Speed Railway]], while the [[Jingshi Passenger Railway|BeijingâShijiazhuang]] and [[Shiwu Passenger Railway|ShijiazhuangâWuhan]] sections are still under construction and set to open by the end of 2011.

== Trains ==
When the line opened, the trains had a maximum in-service speed of 350&amp;nbsp;km/h (217&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/26/content_12705527.htm Wuhan-Guangzhou bullet train link to hit airlines hard], China Daily, 2009-12-26&lt;/ref&gt; Each train consists of two eight-car [[electric multiple unit]]s coupled together to make a 16-car train. The passenger capacity of the train is about 1114 (CRH3CÃ2) or 1220 (CRH2CÃ2). The trains are based on technology developed by [[Siemens]] ([[CRH3]]) and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] ([[CRH2]]) modified to the standards of China Railway High-speed. The trains used on the line are manufactured in China.&lt;ref name=Dasgupta&gt;{{cite news|author=Mitchell, Tom|title=Chinese Harmony train sets speed record|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1eed4d72-f351-11de-a888-00144feab49a.html|date=December 28, 2009|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Xinhua-20091226 /&gt;

On December 3, 2010, the new [[CRH380A]] trainset started serving this line.&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.sohu.com/20101203/n278095311.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial service ==
The first commercial trains left Wuhan and Guangzhou North at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am on December 26, 2009, and reached their destinations in three hours, compared with ten and a half hours for the previous service.&lt;ref name=Xinhua-20091226&gt;{{citation | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/26/content_12705875.htm | title = World's fastest rail journey starts operation | publisher = Xinhua | date = December 26, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China unveils 'world's fastest train link'|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iyiGIR1KldxNfneHStjifvaiOQiQ|date=December 26, 2009|publisher=AFP via Google|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 28, 2009,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Timetable was slightly different on December 26 and December 27.&lt;/ref&gt; until Guangzhou South Station was opened on 30 January 2010, 28 passenger train services run on the line daily each way. Of these 28 trains, two run between Wuhan and Changsha South, five run between Changsha South and Guangzhou North, and 21 run between Wuhan and Guangzhou North. 

Nonstop trains, now cancelled, covered the 922-km long journey in a scheduled 02h57m (Southbound) or 02h58m (Northbound).&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In the first day of its service on December 26, train G1001 finished the 922-km distance in 02h48m, and arrived at Guangzhou North ten minutes ahead of schedule, averaging 329&amp;nbsp;km/h&lt;/ref&gt; This is an average speed of {{convert|313|km/h|mph}} between stations. Before this line was opened, the fastest commercial train service between stations was the train run between [[LGV Est|Lorraine TGV and Champagne TGV]] in France, averaging {{convert|279|km/h|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/fileadmin/user_upload/railwaygazette.com/PDF/RailwayGazetteWorldSpeedSurvey2007.pdf |title=TGV Est lifts the record|author=Colin Taylor|publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guangzhou South Railway Station was opened on 30 January 2010, just before the Chinese New Year. Trains arrive at or depart from Guangzhou South instead of Guangzhou North since then. During the first 56 days in 2010, the railway transported 1.108 million people, or 43 thousand per day.  The total ticket income was about Â¥700 million, exceeding earlier predictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2010-03-07/044117177520s.shtml æ­¦å¹¿é«éè¯è¿è¥56å¤©ç¥¨ä»·æ¶å¥7äº¿] 2010-03-07&lt;/ref&gt;

More trains have been added to the route since March 3, 2010.

Since July 1, 2010, coupled trains have been replaced by single trains, and service frequency were doubled. The two non-stop 03h08m-long services between Wuhan and Guangzhou South had been replaced by six 03h16m-long services with one stop in Changsha South. The 03h16m-long one stop service is denoted with departure time on the hour. I.e. 08:00, 14:00, 16:00.

On September 20, 2010, even more trains were added. There were then 75 trains in each direction on weekdays and 80 trains in each direction on weekends. The average train interval had been cut to 11 minutes. On October 1, 2010 during the National holidays, the railway line transported 118 thousand people in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;http://hunan.voc.com.cn/article/201010/201010041043326334.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 the maximum speed of Chinese high-speed trains was reduced to 300km/h (186 mph) following the [[Wenzhou train collision]]. In August 2011 the fastest trains between Wuhan and Guangzhou South, with one stop at Changsha South, had a scheduled trip time of 3 hours and 33 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinatrainguide.com/trainsearch.php?checi=G1005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Line ==
{{WuhanâGuangzhou High-Speed Railway}}
Construction work began on June 23, 2005. The line cost approximately [[Chinese yuan|CNÂ¥]]116.6 billion.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|title=Record-breaking Chinese rail opening piles pressure on airlines|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/recordbreaking-chinese-rail-opening-piles-pressure-on-airlines-1850149.html|date=December 25, 2009|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xu Fangliang was the general engineer in charge of designing the line.&lt;ref name=Xinhua-20091226 /&gt;

468&amp;nbsp;km of the railway line is laid on bridges, and 177&amp;nbsp;km is in tunnels, totaling 2/3 of the entire length. There are 684 bridges and 226 tunnels along the line.&lt;ref&gt;http://politics.people.com.cn/GB/14562/10548281.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The signalling system deployed on the line is [[Chinese Train Control System|CTCS]]-3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccnews.people.com.cn/GB/10549815.html è·åº394å¬éæ¶é âæ­¦å¹¿âåä¸çé«ééåº¦ä¹æ] 2009-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eighteen stations on the line. Fourteen of them are opened for passenger service. The northern terminal, [[Wuhan Railway Station]] was open simultaneously with the railway line. Guangzhou South station was opened later on January 30, 2010. Lechang East and Yingde West stations are under construction. Wulongquan East is an overtaking station which is not open for service.

On December 9, 2009, a train achieved a top speed of {{convert|394.2|km/h|mph}} and took 02h55m to travel from Guangzhou South to Wuhan during a test run.&lt;ref name=Xinhua-20091226 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY_cF2Snihs  Video of trial run. View of speedometer at 1m22s ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fare ==
{{main|Fare of passenger trains in China}}
The second class fare is about [[Renminbi|Â¥]]0.46 per kilometer and the first class fare is 60% higher. Deluxe class is also available on CRH3 trains, which is about 80% higher than second class. Like other train services in China, insurance of Â¥0.0011722 per kilometer is included for every ticket. The ratemaking distance is based on the existing [[Jingguang Railway]], not the actual rail distance of the new railway. Hence, though the actual rail distance between Wuhan and Guangzhou South is 968&amp;nbsp;km, 1069&amp;nbsp;km is charged. The ticket price between the two terminal stations is Â¥490 and Â¥780 ($75 and $115 in U.S. currency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=æ­¦å¹¿é«éç¥¨ä»·å®ä¸º780 490|url=http://news.cctv.com/society/20091213/101077.shtml|publisher=CCTV (CCTV.com)|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
=== Reaction from existing passengers ===
With an average speed 4 times faster, the fare for the high-speed railway is also about 4 times of the ordinary railway. Some believe this is too high for the public. RMB490 is about 15% of the average monthly income of workers in Guangzhou. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=å»å¹´å¹¿å·èå·¥å¹³åå·¥èµ49215å æ¯ä¸æµ·ä½1.4ä¸|url=http://nf.nfdaily.cn/nfdsb/content/2010-07/20/content_13940776.htm|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After opening of the high-speed railway, 13 out of 45 ordinary trains were canceled, a decision criticized to have harmed the welfare of low-income workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://big5.ce.cn/gate/big5/views.ce.cn/view/economy/200912/26/t20091226_20693660.shtml | title = åå¤è¿å¥é«éæ¶ä»£ï¼éè¦è­¦æâè¢«é«éâ | publisher = Xinhua Daily Telegraph | date = Feb 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the existing passengers complain that they are &quot;forced to travel high-speed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://big5.ce.cn/gate/big5/views.ce.cn/view/economy/200912/26/t20091226_20693660.shtml | title = é«éµä¾äºæâè¢«é«éâäº | publisher = ä¸­åç¶æ¿ç¶² | date = Feb 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction from airlines ===
[[China Southern Airlines]], a national airline with one of two hubs in Guangzhou, spoke of concern over eroding [[market share]] from [[competition]].  Thirty-eight of 160 plus China Southern domestic routes will compete with the rail line. The airline has aggressively cut fares, slashing the advance purchase price of flights between Wuhan and Guangzhou by almost half.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/china/local-news/beijing/2009/12/27/238170/Wuhan-Guangzhou-bullet.htm | title = Wuhan-Guangzhou bullet train link to hit airlines hard | publisher = The China Post | date = December 27, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan Wangeng, president of China Southern Airlines, said, &quot;In the long run, the coming of high-speed railway age is  an opportunity rather than challenge to our airline company. China Southern is expecting cooperation with the railway company to extend the market and develop more packaged travel products for the passengers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;
