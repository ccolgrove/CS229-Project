'''Frank Michael Reich, Jr.''' (born December 4, 1961) is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] in the [[National Football League]] for the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Carolina Panthers]], [[New York Jets]], and the [[Detroit Lions]]. For a time, he had the distinction of having led his team to the biggest comeback victory ever in both the [[College football|collegiate]] and [[National Football League|professional]] ranks. Reich and starter [[Jim Kelly]] formed one of the longest-tenured backup-and-starter tandems, playing together for nine years (1986â1994).  He is currently the [[wide receivers coach]] for the [[Indianapolis Colts]].

==High school years==
Reich attended [[Cedar Crest High School]] in [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]] where he played baseball, football, and basketball. Reich started on the football team for his last two years in high school. He played quarterback in the [[Big 33 Football Classic]] (known as the &quot;Super Bowl of high school games&quot;) his senior year of high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich, Frank 2009&quot;&gt;Reich, Frank. Telephone Interview. 9 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Reich was accepted to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] on a football scholarship and played backup to [[Boomer Esiason]] the first few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich, Frank 2009&quot;/&gt; The biggest highlight of his college career was the comeback he led against the [[University of Miami]] [[Miami Hurricanes football|Hurricanes]] on November 10, 1984 at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl Stadium]]. Reich came off the bench to play for [[Stan Gelbaugh]], who had previously replaced him as the starter after Reich separated his shoulder in the fourth week of the season against [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]]. Miami quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]] had led the 'Canes to a 31-0 lead at halftime. At the start of the third quarter, Reich led the [[University of Maryland athletics|Maryland Terrapins]] on multiple scoring drives.  Three touchdowns in the third quarter and a fourth at the start of the final quarter turned what was a blowout into a close game.  With the score 34-28 Miami, Reich hit Greg Hill with a 68-yard touchdown pass which deflected off the hands of Miami safety [[Darrell Fullington]] to take the lead. Maryland scored once more to cap a 42-9 second half, and won the game 42-40, completing what was then the biggest comeback in NCAA history.  

This comeback from 31 points down has since been exceeded by the [[Michigan State University]] [[Michigan State Spartans football|Spartans]]' [[2006 Michigan State vs. Northwestern football game|41-38 comeback win]] in 2006 over the [[Northwestern University]] [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Wildcats]] during which Michigan State trailed 38-3 in the third quarter.

==Professional career==
Reich was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the third round (57th overall) in the [[1985 NFL Draft]]. The Bills already had drafted future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Jim Kelly]] in 1983 and when Kelly signed with the Bills in 1986, Reich was relegated to the backup role. Reich got his first start when Kelly went down with a shoulder injury in [[1989]]. Reich led the Bills to two straight victories. He rallied the Bills in the fourth quarter by throwing two drives down the field for a 23-20 victory over the previously unbeaten Los Angeles Rams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich, Frank 2009&quot;/&gt; This first game for Reich occurred in front of a Rich Stadium crowd of 76,231 and a Monday Night Football audience. Reich returned the following season, however, when Kelly was injured again late in the season. Reich provided the Bills with two key wins, clinching them the [[AFC East]] title and [[home field advantage]] throughout the [[NFL playoffs, 1990-91|playoffs]]. 

On January 3, 1993, Reich led the Bills on a 35-3 run in the second half and overtime against the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] en route to a 41-38 victory, the [[The Comeback (American football)|largest comeback]] in NFL history.  Reich would help the Bills defeat the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the divisional round with a score of 23-7 before once again giving the team back to Kelly, who led them into [[Super Bowl XXVII]], where they fell to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 52-17.

After giving the Bills one more comeback victory late in the [[1993 NFL season]], Reich was picked from the Bills in the [[1995]] [[expansion draft]] to join the [[Carolina Panthers]] to start off their first year. He threw the first touchdown pass to former Bills player [[Pete Metzelaars]] in [[Bank of America Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich, Frank 2009&quot;/&gt;  The Panthers had drafted [[Kerry Collins]] as their intended franchise quarterback, but Reich was the starter for most of the first half of the season until Collins was deemed ready to take the starting job. He was signed by the [[New York Jets]] where he started for seven games and the [[Detroit Lions]]. Reich retired following the [[1998 NFL season]].

In the first round of the 1997 NFL playoffs, Reich took over as quarterback for the [[Detroit Lions]] when [[Scott Mitchell (American football)|Scott Mitchell]] was knocked out of the game. Late in the game, Reich dropped back and spiked the ball accidentally on fourth down, giving the ball to opponent Tampa Bay. 

In the year of 2008, he served as an offensive assistant and quarterbacks coach for the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. After [[Tony Dungy]] retired early in the year of 2009, [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] (former Colts quarterback coach) replaced Dungy and Reich took his place as the new quarterbacks coach.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Coaches Roster&quot;. &lt;u&gt;Colts.com&lt;/u&gt;. 2009. 12 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life outside of football==
Throughout Reich's NFL career, he remained a devout Christian. He is a [[motivational speaker]] utilizing the great comebacks and the importance of God as a main keynote of his speeches. He credits the song &quot;In Christ Alone&quot; by [[Michael English]] as his inspiration.  He belongs to the Premier Speakers Bureau where his main topics are communication and teamwork. Reich attended the Charlotte Campus of [[Reformed Theological Seminary]], Charlotte, [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frank About His Faith|author=Aaron Little and Andrew Knox|url= http://www.cbn.com/700club/features/sports_frank_reich.aspx|newspaper=CBN.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he received a Seminary Degree and [[Master of Divinity]]. He served as president of RTS' Charlotte campus from 2003-2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Christ Alone|author=Erica Parkerson|url=http://www.worldnewspaperpublishing.com/news/FullStory.asp?loc=TCW&amp;ID=883|newspaper=The Charlotte World |date= July 22, 2003|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reich was also a pastor at Ballantyne Presbyterian until he moved to [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RTS-CHARLOTTE PRESIDENT FRANK REICH ACCEPTS CALL|author=|url=http://www.rts.edu/Site/ENewsArchives/enews_issue7_2006.aspx|newspaper=RTS Enews |date=March 21, 2007|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in [[Buffalo, New York]] in the early 90s, Reich met a man named Jim Case who Reich hired to build his deck and refinish his base. A friendship between Reich and Case formed and they started a company together called Pro Display Inc. which specialized in sports memorabilia. Their main item was a football stand inspired by Frank's dad who created a wooden stand shaped like a football field where the goal posts held up the football. Frank Reich had co-founded a retail business in the 90s that he started with friend [[Boomer Esiason]] and two others. They were part owners of Jim and Chuck's Boot Shop. The store expanded over the [[New England]] area with fifteen stores where they still remain today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich, Frank 2009&quot;/&gt;

On the January 30, 2010 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', [[Jon Hamm]] portrayed Reich in a Gametime with Randy and Greg skit.

==Personal==
Reich's father, Frank, played for [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] from 1953â1955 as a [[Center (American football)|center]] and [[linebacker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tuscano, John |title=Tezak family's athletic accomplishments span many generations, sports |url=http://www.pennlive.com/specialprojects/index.ssf/2009/08/tezak_familys_athletic_accompl.html |work=[[The Patriot-News]] |date=August 1, 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was drafted by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the 14th round of the [[1956 NFL Draft]], but did not play in the [[National Football League]].
