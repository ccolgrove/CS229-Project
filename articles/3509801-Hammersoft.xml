'''Division One North''' is one of the two second-tier divisions of the '''[[Northern Premier League]]'''. It is at tier 4 of the [[National League System]], tier 8 of the [[English football league system]]. For sponsorship reasons, it is also referred to as the '''Evo-Stik League Division One North'''.

The league currently covers the english regions of the [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]].

The split of the [[Northern Premier League First Division]] resulted in the creation of the Division One North and the [[Northern Premier League Division One South|Division One South]]. The division began play at the start of the [[NPL Division One North 2007-08|2007â08]], initially with 18 teams.

At the end of the season, the champion of the league is promoted to the Northern Premier Division.  The teams placed 2nd to 5th engaged in a playoff to determine which team is also promoted. The teams placed 22nd and 23rd are relegated to level 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7201054.stm BBC Guide to the Non-League Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==League system==
The League operates a double round robin system, where each team plays each other team twice, once at home and once away. After 42 games the team that are placed top of the league will automatically be promoted to the Northern Premier League Premier Division and the two teams at the bottom of the league will be relegated to one of the feeder leagues (Usually either the [[North West Counties Football League|North West Counties]], [[Northern Counties East Football League|Northern Counties East]] or [[Northern League (football)|Northern League]]).

The teams placed 2nd to 5th will play off for the final promotion spot.

However, for the 1st season of the new division in 2007â08 season, when the league originally split from its traditional one division into a Division North and Division South, the league operated with 18 teams, leading to splitting the league into two separate groups of nine teams each. Each team would play each team in their own group three times (once at home, once away then an extra game where each team received an extra four home games) and play the teams in the other group home and away once each.

This changed back to the traditional format in 2008â09 when more teams entered the league.
