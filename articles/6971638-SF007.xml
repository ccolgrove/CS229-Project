'''Terri Alden''' is a major fictional character during the final three seasons of the sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'', born in Longmeadow, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/31/people.watn.barnes/ &quot;Three's Company's Terri pursues her craft&quot; - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt; She is played by [[Priscilla Barnes]] and is the third &quot;token [[blonde]]&quot; on the show ([[Suzanne Somers]] and [[Jenilee Harrison]] having preceded her); however, she works as a [[registered nurse]] and is portrayed as far less &quot;ditzy&quot; than her predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LZEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C1gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5430,1408454&amp;dq=terri-alden&amp;hl=en &quot;Role still loosely structured&quot; - Victorian Advocate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jOMPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iosDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3685,2487400&amp;dq=terri-alden&amp;hl=en &quot;For ABC,'Three's' #1&quot;- The Free Lance-Star]&lt;/ref&gt; She is written into the story as being Janet and Jack's new roommate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yboSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dvkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5210,2615484&amp;dq=terri-alden&amp;hl=en &quot;Roommate&quot; - Spokane Daily Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jack originally disliked Terri, owing to a disastrous first meeting at the doctor's office when she administered an injection into his [[buttocks|behind]], he forgave her and warmed up to her eventually. It was Terri, in fact, who convinced Jack to move in with Victoria Bradford, thus paving the way for the successor series ''[[Three's a Crowd]]''.

==Personality==
In response to complaints about the characterization of blondes on the show, the writers portrayed Terri as a &quot;smart blonde&quot;, and a &quot;woman with brains&quot;, electing to steer away from the ditziness of Chrissy Snow and the clumsiness of Cindy Snow, Terri's blonde roommate predecessors.  A dedicated professional at work, Terri is more relaxed when out of uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LGgaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8CkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5498,4630922&amp;dq=terri-alden&amp;hl=en &quot;'Three's Company' Star Always Liked Attention&quot; - The Milwaukee Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;
