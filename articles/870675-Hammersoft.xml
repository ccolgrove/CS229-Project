'''Samuel James &quot;Sam&quot; Cassell''' (born November 18, 1969), is a retired [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player who is an assistant coach for the [[Washington Wizards]]. The {{height|ft=6|in=3}}, {{convert|185|lb|kg st|abbr=on}} [[point guard]] was selected out of [[Florida State University]] by the [[Houston Rockets]] with the 24th overall pick in the [[1993 NBA Draft]]. He won two [[NBA Finals|NBA Championships]] in his first two seasons in the league as a member of the Rockets, and his third with the [[Boston Celtics]] in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]]. He was selected to the [[NBA All-Star Game]] and [[All-NBA Team]] once, both in the [[2003â04 NBA season|2003â04 season]]. He played for the [[Houston Rockets|Rockets]], [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Dallas Mavericks]], [[New Jersey Nets]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], [[Boston Celtics]], and [[Los Angeles Clippers]].

==College==
After graduating from [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Dunbar High School]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], Cassell spent a post graduate year at [[Maine Central Institute]] in [[Pittsfield]], [[Maine]] under coach [[Max Good]]. From MCI, Cassell was successfully recruited to attend [[DePaul University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enidnews.com/sportslocal/local_story_093001039.html/resources_printstory Mullin, Jeff. &quot;Sutton victim of Joey Meyer syndrome,&quot; ''Enid'' (OK) ''News &amp; Eagle'', Wednesday, April 2, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was declared academically ineligible based on [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] Proposition 48 standards, and ended up starting his college career at [[San Jacinto College]] in [[Texas]], where he was known as a big scorer. He moved on to [[Florida State University]] for his junior and senior years. In his senior year in 1992â93, he averaged 18.3 [[Point (basketball)|points]], 4.9 [[Assist (basketball)|assists]], and 4.3 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game and led the [[Atlantic Coast Conference#Basketball|Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) in [[Steal (basketball)|steals]]. Cassell and teammate [[Bob Sura]] formed the highest scoring and rebounding backcourt in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|nation]] with 38.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game.  Cassell's 1992â93 Seminoles team finished with a 25â10 record and advanced to the [[Elite Eight]] in the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they lost to the [[Kentucky Wildcats basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/recap?gid=200903080213&amp;prov=ap Cassell's 1992-93 Seminoles team]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2008, in a game against [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]], Cassell's jersey was retired by [[Florida State Seminoles#Men's Basketball|Florida State]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nolesports.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080215/FSU05/802150354&lt;/ref&gt;

==NBA==
===First years===

Cassell was selected out of [[Florida State University]] with the 24th overall pick of the [[1993 NBA Draft]] by the [[Houston Rockets]] as eventual successor to [[Kenny Smith]] at the [[point guard]] position. Eventually, he split point guard duties with Smith in [[1993â94 NBA season|1994]] and [[1994â95 NBA season|1995]], his first two seasons in the league, and helped the Rockets win two [[NBA Finals|NBA Championships]]. After the [[1995â96 NBA season|1995â96 season]], he was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]], along with [[Robert Horry]], [[Chucky Brown]] and [[Mark Bryant]], in exchange for [[Charles Barkley]], but his tenure there was brief, as he appeared in just 22 games for the Suns.

On December 27, 1996, he was traded along with [[Michael Finley]], [[A. C. Green|A.C. Green]] and a second-round draft pick to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in exchange for [[Jason Kidd]], [[Tony Dumas]] and [[Loren Meyer]]. Midway through the [[1996â97 NBA season|1996â97 season]], after appearing in 16 games for the Mavericks, he was traded with [[Chris Gatling]], [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]], [[George McCloud]] and [[Eric Montross]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in exchange for [[Shawn Bradley]], [[Ed O'Bannon]], [[Robert Pack]] and [[Khalid Reeves]] on February 17, 1997. Following the season, he elected to re-sign with the Nets. Cassell lived in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], which allowed him to be close to the Nets arena and to the nightlife in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaccaro, Mike. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/327741501.html?dids=327741501:327741501&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+24%2C+2003&amp;author=MIKE+VACCARO&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=CASSELL%3A+I+LOVE+N.Y.&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Cassell: I Love NY&quot;], ''[[New York Post]]'', April 24, 2003. Accessed October 23, 2011. &quot;'When I played in New Jersey, it wasn't so much that I was thrilled with being in New Jersey as that I was 10 minutes from New York,' said [Sam Cassell], who lived in Teaneck when he played for the Nets. 'I spent a lot of days and a lot of nights in the city. A lot of fun days. And a few long nights.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milwaukee Bucks===
Midway through the [[1998â99 NBA season|1998â99 season]], he was dealt again, for the fourth time in 6 seasons, in a three-way trade with the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], which sent him to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] along with [[Brian Evans (basketball)|Brian Evans]], [[Chris Gatling]], a [[1999 NBA Draft|1999 first-round draft pick]] and a future first-round draft pick on March 11, 1999. On March 3, 2001, he scored his career-high of 40 points against the [[Chicago Bulls]]. During [[NBA All-Star Weekend|All-Star Weekend]] in [[2001 NBA All-Star Game|2001]], he won the [[Fleer]] Shootout at Jam Session on All-Star Saturday. He almost reached the [[NBA Finals]] with the Bucks in [[2000â01 NBA season|2001]], falling just short when they lost in Game 7 of the [[NBA Conference Finals#Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. During the [[2002â03 NBA season|2002â03 season]], he passed 10,000 points for his career.

===Minnesota Timberwolves===
After spending 4 seasons with the Bucks, he was traded along with [[Ervin Johnson]] to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]] and [[Anthony Peeler]] following the [[2002â03 NBA season|2002â03 season]]. He arguably had his best season in [[2003â04 NBA season|2003â04]], when he was named to the [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA Second Team]] and All-Interview Second Team, and voted into the [[2004 NBA All-Star Game]]. He helped the Timberwolves to reach the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004 Western Conference Finals]].

===Los Angeles Clippers===
After the [[2004â05 NBA season|2004â05 season]], the Timberwolves traded him and a conditional first-round pick to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in exchange for [[Marko JariÄ|Marko Jaric]] and [[Lionel Chalmers]]. Cassell appeared to have found a home with the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]], as he led them to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Semifinals in the [[2006 NBA Playoffs|2006 Playoffs]]. In the First Round, they beat the [[Denver Nuggets]] in five games, but would eventually fall to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in 7 games. Before the [[2006â07 NBA season|2006â07 season]], Cassell was tempted to take a two-year, $15M offer from the [[Atlanta Hawks]], but eventually re-signed with the Clippers on a two-year, $13M deal.

Throughout the [[2007â08 NBA season|2007â08 season]], it had been rumored that Cassell would get bought out of his contract with the Clippers, especially after they let the [[Trade (sports)#NBA|trade deadline]] pass without dealing him. Cassell first denied that he was pushing strongly towards a buyout,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Abrams, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/clippers/la-sp-cliprep8feb08,1,5864132.story Cassell denies aggressive bid for a buyout], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually acknowledged his buyout talks with the Clippers.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Abrams, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/clippers/la-sp-cliprep26feb26,1,5783606.story?ctrack=8&amp;cset=true Cassell confirms buyout talks with Clippers], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2008, it was reported that the Clippers would officially announce the buyout later that day,&lt;ref name=cassellbuyout&gt;Peter May, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/02/26/cassell_drawing_interest/ Cassell drawing interest], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but that did not happen, and only some days later the interests of both parties were reported to be far apart.&lt;ref name=casselnobuyout&gt;Jonathan Abrams, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-cliprep28feb28,1,5553677.story Sides are far apart in deciding Cassell's fate], February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassell would have to walk away from all of his remaining salary to receive a buyout, and initially was not ready to do so.&lt;ref name=casselnobuyout/&gt; But on February 28, 2008, the Clippers reached a contractual buyout agreement with Cassell and placed him on waivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/clippers/news/cassell_waived_080228.html Clippers Waive Guard Sam Cassell], ''[[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers.com]]'', February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3269649 Injury-prone Cassell released by the Clippers], ''[[Associated Press]]'', February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the agreement, Cassell received half of his remaining salary, roughly $850,000.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Abrams, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/clippers/la-sp-cliprep29feb29,1,7159868.story?ctrack=6&amp;cset=true Cassell finally gets his contract buyout], February 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassell became an [[Free agent#Restricted and unrestricted free agency|unrestricted free agent]] on March 3, 2008, 6&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|ET]], when he cleared waivers, and was eligible to sign with a team of his choice.&lt;ref name=waivers&gt;Marc J.

According to his [[Sports agent|agent]], Cassell had signed a contract with the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]] on March 3, 2008, but the signing was pending an official league announcement.&lt;ref name=signingdelay&gt;Peter May, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/03/03/cassell_clears_waivers_signs_with_celtics/ Cassell clears waivers, signs with Celtics], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3274465 Former Clipper Cassell expected to officially join Celtics Tuesday], ''[[ESPN.com]]'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bulpett, [http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1077517&amp;srvc=celt&amp;position=1 Cassell clears waivers, heading to Hub], ''[[Boston Herald]]'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His arrival was delayed because of a death in his family.&lt;ref name=signingdelay/&gt; On March 4, 2008, Cassell officially signed with the Celtics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press030408-sam-cassell.html Celtics Sign Guard Sam Cassell], ''[[Boston Celtics|Celtics]].com'', March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but immediately flew back to his hometown of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] to attend funeral services for his deceased family member.&lt;ref&gt;Celtics Insider, [http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/celtics/?p=215&amp;srvc=sports&amp;position=recent Cassell here and gone], ''[[Boston Herald]]'', March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc J.

On March 17, 2008, Cassell had a standout performance in a [[Saint Patrick's Day]] matchup against the [[San Antonio Spurs]], when he led the team from a 22-point deficit to a 2-point victory, scoring 17 points and hitting a clutch shot late in the game.&lt;ref&gt;Marc J.

On March 28, 2008, Cassell was honored as one of the 20 greatest players in [[Milwaukee Bucks]] history during the team's 40th Anniversary Team Celebration, but could not attend the festivities because of the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]]' game against the [[New Orleans Hornets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/bucks/features/40th_anniversary_main.html 40th Anniversary Main Page], ''Bucks.com'', March 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=40years&gt;Charles F.

On February 17, 2009 Cassell was traded to the Sacramento Kings for a conditional second-round draft pick in the [[2015 NBA Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = KINGS ACQUIRE SAM CASSELL | url = http://www.nba.com/kings/news/Press_Release_2009.html | work = [[NBA.com]] | date=2009-02-17 | accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, Kings waived Cassell, along with [[Quincy Douby]], in order to make room for the players acquired in the Miller/Salmons to the Bulls trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nba.com/kings/news/kings_press_release0209.html |title = KINGS ACQUIRE FOUR PLAYERS IN THREE-TEAM TRADE | work = [[NBA.com]] | date = 2009-02-18 | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assistant Coach===

On May 21, 2009, Cassell was named [[assistant coach]] under [[Flip Saunders]] of the Washington Wizards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nba.com/wizards/news/wittmancassell_090521.html |title = Wizards Name Wittman and Cassell As Assistant Coaches | work = [[NBA.com]] | date = 2009-05-21 | accessdate = 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/2009/news/05/21/wizards.assistants.ap/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Cassell is known for his feistiness and outgoing personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CASSELL+KNOWS+HOW+TO+SELL+IT-a0145705892 Cassell knows how to sell it], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]' &quot;Big Three&quot;, alongside [[Ray Allen]] and [[Glenn Robinson]], that reached the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[NBA Finals|Finals]] in [[2000â01 NBA season|2001]].&lt;ref name=40years/&gt; In [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minnesota]], he was an integral part of the team, as he and his teammates were led by [[2003â04 NBA season|2003â04]] [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] [[Kevin Garnett]] to the 2004 [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Finals for the first time in franchise history. Coincidentally, both Allen and Garnett, alongside resident star [[Paul Pierce]], would become Cassell's teammates with the [[Boston Celtics]], and helped them win the [[2008 NBA Finals]].

==Media==
Cassell appeared on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''NBA Fundamentals'' series, in which [[basketball]] players describe certain aspects of the game. He was chosen to illustrate the &quot;mid-range game&quot;, i.e. shooting from the area around the [[free throw]] line, the paint, the wings and the baseline. In this clip,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLWvSqkDAU NBA Fundamentals: Sam Cassell - Mid-Range] on [[YouTube]].com&lt;/ref&gt; Cassell explains how to [[Basketball moves#Post up, related moves and shots|post up]] against opposing guards, shoot [[Jump shot (basketball)|pull-up jump shots]] and hit [[buzzer beater]]s. He admires retired [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players [[Terrell Brandon]] and [[Jeff Hornacek]], two prolific mid-range shooters after whom he modeled his game.
