'''Drive Image''' ('''PQDI''') is a software [[disk cloning]] package for [[Intel]]-based computers.  The software was developed and distributed by the former [[PowerQuest]] Corporation.  Drive Image version 7 became the basis for [[Ghost (software)|Norton Ghost 9.0]], which was released to retail markets in August 2004.  Ghost was a competing product, developed by [[Binary Research]], before [[Symantec]] bought the company in 1998. This also explains the different file extensions used for Ghost image files: formerly it was .gho, now in versions 9.0 and above it is .v2i.

== Product history ==
Drive Image version 7 was the last version published under the [[PowerQuest]] corporate banner.  It was also the first version to include a native Windows interface for cloning an active [[system partition]]; prior versions required a [[reboot]] into a [[DOS]]-like environment in order to clone the active partition.  In order to clone active partitions without requiring a reboot, Drive Image 7 employed a volume snapshot device driver which was licensed from [http://www.storagecraft.com StorageCraft].

Drive Image 2002 (version 6) is the last release that allows the creation of a rescue set on [[floppy disk]], which can be used to create and restore an image.
