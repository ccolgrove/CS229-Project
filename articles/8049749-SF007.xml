==OS==
The [[Live Distro|Live CD]] OS for the host PC is based on [[Turbolinux Fuji]]. The device OS is unknown, and not user accessible for development or customization. There were initial unconfirmed reports stating the device OS is [[VxWorks]]. However, it has recently come to light that [http://www.laser5.co.jp Laser5], a Japanese open source embedded software development house, was involved in Linux driver development for the Wizpy. It is unknown if this was for a driver on the host PC OS for accessing the Wizpy, or for internal drivers on board the device OS. If the latter, it would imply that the device OS is also Linux. However, there currently does not seem to be any announcements regarding this. If the device OS is Linux, and the source code has not been released, this may qualify as a GPL violation.

==Bundled Software for Host PC OS==
*[[Skype]]
*[[Mozilla Thunderbird]]
*[[Mozilla Firefox]]
*[[ATOK]]

==Power==
&quot;Power is supplied to the lithium polymer battery via USB cable and though rechargeable, it is only rated for about 500 charges lasting 12 hours. The battery is considered to be a disposable and is not covered by a warranty. Replacement batteries require you to send the unit away to a support center for servicing.&quot;

==Mac compatibility==
&quot;It's in this use we had a problem. Connected to a Windows XP machine the Wizpy was recognized and drivers loaded but the same thing didn't happen on two Apple Mac computers running Mac OS X. It appeared to Windows as USB Mass Storage, so it should have worked with Macs but it didn't. TurboLinux said they would work on compatibility with Macs for future versions of the product.&quot;
