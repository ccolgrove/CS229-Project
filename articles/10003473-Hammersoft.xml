The '''[[Memphis Tigers]] men's basketball''' team represents the [[University of Memphis]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's [[college basketball]]. The Tigers compete in [[Conference USA]], in which they have won six regular season and four conference tournament championships. As of 2011, the Tigers have the 29th highest winning percentage in NCAA history.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA D1 Records&quot;&gt;[http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2011/D1.pdf NCAA D1 Record Book]&lt;/ref&gt; They play home games at [[FedExForum]]. 

==History==
The predecessor of the University of Memphis, West Tennessee State Normal School, first fielded a basketball team in 1920. [[Zach Curlin]] began coaching the team in 1924. The Tigers joined the Mississippi Valley Conference in 1928. The team played its early home games at a local high school gym, a local [[YMCA]], and in a room on campus called the &quot;Normal Cage&quot; which allowed only six inches from the court lines to the walls. In 1929, a $100,000 facility on campus named Memorial Gym became the Tigers' home.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;[http://gotigersgo.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/archive/101899aaa.html Tiger Basketball History :: The early years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Curlin's last season coaching the Tigers was in 1948, by which time the school had been renamed Memphis State College; it would become Memphis State University in 1957. His successor was McCoy Tarry. In 1951, the new $700,000 [[Elma Roane Fieldhouse|Field House gym]] was opened for Tiger home games. In 1952, John Wallisa became the first Memphis State player to be drafted by the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. [[Forest Arnold]] became the school's first All-American in 1954.  The Tigers made the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] for the first time in 1955 under coach [[Eugene Lambert]]. [[Bob Vanatta]] became the team's coach in 1956 and took the Tigers to the [[1956 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] final. Win Wilfong became the team's second All-American in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

In 1962, Dean Ehlers took over coaching duties. The Tigers began playing its home games at the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] in 1964. Moe Iba became the team's coach in 1966, the same year the team joined the [[Missouri Valley Conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; 

[[Larry Finch]] played in his first game as a Tiger in 1970, the same year that [[Gene Bartow]] took over as head coach. The Tigers shared the Missouri Valley Conference title in 1972 with  Louisville (Louisville won a playoff to represent the MVC in the NCAA Tournament), and won the MVC outright in 1973. During the 1972&amp;ndash;73 season, All-American Finch led the Tigers to the [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament championship game]], which the Tigers lost to the [[1972-73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA Bruins]]. Bartow also won the NABC National Coach of the Year award that season. Wayne Yates took over for Bartow in 1974.  The Tigers left the Missouri Valley Conference to become one of the inaugural members of the [[Metro Conference]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;&gt;[http://gotigersgo.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/archive/101899aab.html Tiger Basketball History II :: The last three decades&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dana Kirk (basketball)|Dana Kirk]] became head coach in 1979.  During the 1980s, the Tigers made seven NCAA tournaments and won multiple Metro Conference titles.  [[Keith Lee]] began playing for the Tigers in 1982, and Memphis was ranked number one in both major national polls for the first time the same year.  Lee eventually led the team to its second [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four appearance]] in 1985. Only a year later, however, Kirk was forced out after becoming the subject of a criminal investigation.  He was also found to have committed many NCAA violations as well; the Tigers were forced to sit out the [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987 NCAA Tournament]] and were stripped of their Final Four appearance from 1985, as well as all of their NCAA tournament appearances from 1982-86.

Former player Larry Finch took over head coaching duties in 1986.  One of Finch's first recruits, [[Elliot Perry]], began playing for the team in 1987.  In the 1988-89 season, the Tigers set a school record by starting the game against [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] with a 24&amp;ndash;0 run.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot; /&gt;

In the early 1990s, [[Anfernee Hardaway]] and [[David Vaughn III|David Vaughn]] began their careers at Memphis.  Other notable Memphis players from the 90s include [[Cedric Henderson]], [[Michael Wilson (basketball)|Michael Wilson]] and [[Lorenzen Wright]].  The 1991&amp;ndash;92 season marked a number of changes for the Tigers.  The team left the Metro Conference to become part of the [[Great Midwest Conference]] in 1990 and left the Coliseum to make the [[Pyramid Arena]] its new home in 1991.  On February 6, 1993, the school achieved its 1,000 all-time basketball victory. Memphis joined [[Conference USA]] in 1995, one year after the school adopted its current name of the University of Memphis.  Finch stepped down as head coach in 1997 and [[Tic Price]] took over thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot; /&gt;

===John Calipari era===
[[File:Calipari CIMG0087.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Calipari directing his players during an away game against [[Conference USA]] rival [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]] in January 2007.]]
[[John Calipari]] was named Memphis' head coach in 2000. Under his leadership, the Tigers won the [[2002 National Invitation Tournament|2002]] [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] championship then made the NCAA tournament in [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003]] and [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2004]].  The Tigers left [[Pyramid Arena|The Pyramid]] to play home games in the [[FedExForum]] in 2004. The 2005&amp;ndash;06 Tigers were led by [[Darius Washington]], [[Shawne Williams]] and [[Rodney Carney]] and set a school record by going 30&amp;ndash;3 during the regular season that was capped by a Conference USA championship. In the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006 NCAA tournament]], the Tigers received a number one seed, and they advanced to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual tournament runner-up [[2005-06 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]].

Despite losing their top three scorers from the prior season to the NBA and graduation, the 2006&amp;ndash;07 Tigers duplicated the previous year's regular season record of 30&amp;ndash;3 and again won the [[Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament|Conference USA championship]], going undefeated in conference play. The Tigers earned a number two seed in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007 NCAA tournament]]. The Tigers defeated 15 seed [[North Texas Mean Green men's basketball|North Texas]] in the first round, 7 seed [[Nevada Wolf Pack men's basketball|Nevada]] in the second round, 3 seed [[2006-07 Texas A&amp;M Aggies men's basketball team|Texas A&amp;M]] in the Sweet Sixteen, and lost to 1 seed and eventual tournament runner-up [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] in the Elite Eight.

The 2007&amp;ndash;08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team achieved a No. 1 ranking in the [[AP Poll|Associated Press basketball poll]] in January 2008, the school's first No. 1 ranking in the poll in twenty-five years, and went on to win their third straight [[Conference USA]] title on March 15, 2008. Led by First-Team All-American [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]] and future No. 1 overall lottery pick [[Derrick Rose]], the team received a No. 1 seed in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008 NCAA tournament]] and defeated No. 16 seed [[University of Texas at Arlington#Athletics|Texas-Arlington]] in round one, No. 8 seed [[Mississippi State Bulldogs#Men's basketball|Mississippi State]] in round two, and No. 5 seed [[2007-08 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]] in the [[NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship#Regional_semifinals_and_finals|Sweet Sixteen]]. Memphis convincingly defeated No. 2 seed [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] in the Elite Eight round to advance to the school's first Final Four since 1985. Following this win, Memphis went on to beat No. 1 seed [[2007-08 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] on April 5, 2008, advancing to the National Championship game on April 7, 2008. With this win, Memphis became the first team in NCAA history to achieve 38 wins in a single season.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc_38wins&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://beyondthearc.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/04/02/852777.aspx Could this year's champ be 'greatest ever']?&quot; ''[[MSNBC]].'' April 2, 2008. Retrieved on April 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After holding a nine point lead with two minutes and twelve seconds left in regulation, the Tigers lost to [[2007-08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] in the National Championship in overtime by the final score of 75&amp;ndash;68, becoming the second NCAA runner-up team in Memphis history. &lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=284000063 &quot;Kansas vs. Memphis Box Score&quot;] ''[[ESPN]]'' 7 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 2008&amp;ndash;09 Tigers again went undefeated in Conference USA and earned a two seed in the 2009 NCAA tournament.  The Tigers were defeated by the #3-seed [[Missouri Tigers|University of Missouri Tigers]] in the Sweet Sixteen. On March 31, 2009, Calipari resigned to become the head coach at the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]]. Former Assistant Coach Josh Pastner has now taken the role of Head Coach to replace Calipari.

On May 28, 2009, the NCAA formally accused former Tiger star [[Derrick Rose]] of knowingly allowing another person to take his SAT college entrance exam. The accusation was denied by Rose.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2009/aug/20/memphis-tigers-found-guilty-ncaa-must-forfeit-2007/&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2009, the NCAA Committee on Infractions announced that Memphis must vacate all 38 wins for the 2007-2008 season as well as their appearance in the NCAA tournament. They must also return all money earned as result of playing in the Final Four and were placed on probation for three years. The penalties result from an investigation that alleged that Derrick Rose, a Chicago native, had obtained a fraudulent SAT score by allowing another person to take the test for him in Detroit, Michigan and because his brother Reggie Rose was provided nearly $1,700 in free travel and lodging with the team.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=4412279&lt;/ref&gt; Memphis appealed the penalty, but this appeal was rejected by the NCAA Committee on Infractions on March 22, 2010, forcing Memphis to take down its banner commemorating the season and adhere to all other penalties handed down. &lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=5018281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Josh Pastner era===
On April 7, 2009, [[Josh Pastner]] was named the team's head coach.  Pastner was hired as an assistant at Memphis in 2008 after serving as an assistant coach under [[Lute Olson]] at [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] for six years.  Pastner gained a reputation as a strong recruiter during his tenure at [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/11600010 Memphis promotes assistant Pastner to coach, replacing Calipari], by Gary Parrish, CBSSports.com, April 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first year as coach at Memphis, Pastner recruited one of the top ranked recruiting classes in division one men's basketball for the class of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://scouthoops.scout.com/a.z?s=75&amp;p=9&amp;c=14&amp;cfg=bb&amp;yr=2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Pastner led the Tigers back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in his coaching career. Pastner's staff includes veteran assistant coach [[Jack Murphy (basketball)|Jack Murphy]], former NBA player and [[Memphis Grizzlies]] assistant [[Damon Stoudamire]], and [[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles Laker]] [[Luke Walton]] (hired during the [[2011 NBA Lockout]])&lt;ref&gt; name=&quot;MemphisCoaches&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/mem-m-baskbl-mtt.html|title=2009-10 Roster|publisher=[[University of Memphis]]|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/082211aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
