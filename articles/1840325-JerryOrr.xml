==History==
[[Image:shipoldmain.JPG|left|thumb|Old Main]]

Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania was established in 1870, contrary to popular belief that the university was founded in 1871 which Shippensburg's main entrance gates even displays, as the Cumberland Valley State Normal School.  The school received official approval by the state on February 21, 1873, and was admitted its first class of 217 students on April 15, 1873.  In 1917 the school was purchased by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

On June 4, 1926, the school was authorized to grant the bachelor of science in education degree in elementary and junior high education. The school received a charter on October 12, 1926, making it the first normal school in Pennsylvania to become a state teachers college. On June 3, 1927, the State Council of Education authorized the school to change its name to the State Teachers College at Shippensburg.

The business education curriculum was approved on December 3, 1937. On December 8, 1939, Shippensburg State Teachers College became the first teachers college in Pennsylvania and the fourth in the United States to be accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and (Secondary) Schools.

The State Council of Education approved graduate work leading to the master of education degree on January 7, 1959. On January 8, 1960, the name change to Shippensburg State College was authorized.

The arts and sciences curriculum was authorized by the State Council of Education on April 18, 1962, and the bachelor of science in business administration degree program was initiated on September 1, 1967.

On November 12, 1982, the governor of the Commonwealth signed Senate Bill 506 establishing the State System of Higher Education. Shippensburg State College was designated Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania effective July 1, 1983.

In 1985, many of the original historic buildings of the campus, including Old Main, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;arch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Cumberland_Valley_State_Normal_School_Historic_District| year=2006| title=Cumberland Valley State Normal School Historic District|first=| last=| publisher=archiplanet.org/| accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
