'''Route 126''' is a north&amp;ndash;south [[state highway]] in [[Massachusetts]].  It is a continuation of [[Rhode Island Route 126]]

==Route description==
Route 126 begins at the Rhode Island state line, continuing into [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]] as [[Rhode Island Route 126]].  After a short stretch in the town of [[Blackstone, Massachusetts|Blackstone]] and [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]], Route 126 enters the town of [[Bellingham, Massachusetts|Bellingham]] and [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], heading north.  In Bellingham, Route 126 has a short concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]] at the center of town.  In the north of the town, the route turns east on Hartford Avenue, crossing [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] at Exit 18.  Shortly after entering the town of [[Medway, Massachusetts|Medway]], the route turns north again, crossing [[Massachusetts Route 109|Route 109]] shortly after that.  Route 126 then enters [[Holliston, Massachusetts|Holliston]], in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].  

In Holliston, Route 126 shares a {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} long concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]] through the center of town. After splitting from Route 16, Route 126 heads north into [[Ashland, Massachusetts|Ashland]], passing through the eastern side of town before entering [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]].  The route passes Waushakam Pond before crossing [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] near the center of town, next to the [[Framingham (MBTA station)|Framingham MBTA station]].  The road bears to the right, passing Gleason Pond before crossing over [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]] with exit ramps between the two.  At this point, [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] eastbound joins Route 126 for a short stretch before meeting Route 30 westbound.  Route 126 continues northward, crossing the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] (I-90) without junction.  (The nearest exit along the Pike is on Route 30 to the east.)

As it passes [[Lake Cochituate]], Route 126 enters the town of [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]].  The route then joins [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]] for a mile, crossing [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]] together just before the two routes split.  Route 126 then enters the town of [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]].  After crossing [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]], the route continues north, crossing the [[Fitchburg Line]] before entering [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].  As the route rounds the banks of [[Walden Pond]] through the State Reservation, it finally ends at [[Massachusetts Route 2|Routes 2]] and [[Massachusetts Route 2A|2A]].
