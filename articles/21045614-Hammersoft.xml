}}
[[Boycie|Terrence Aubrey Boyce]] ([[John Challis]]) - A shady ex-used car salesman and a frightful snob with a machine gun laugh who likes to think of himself as above everyone else. Boycie made sporadic appearances in ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' before becoming a regular cast member from the fifth series onwards. He remains the same in ''The Green Green Grass''. A snobbish, tight and now slightly ignorant person who seems to think that he is popular with other people, but, unfortunately for him, they just think he is a fool.

For ''The Green Green Grass'', the character of Boycie had to be made more humane. He was also seen in a match of one-upmanship in ''Only Fools and Horses''. This had to be toned down considerably to make the couple more realistic, in the sense that they would row occasionally, but in the end it would be obvious that they had deep feelings for each other. Boycie had a major part in the second episode of the final trilogy of ''Only Fools and Horses''; this allowed the character to expand on screen before taking the lead role in the spin-off series.

A spin-off series could have been made with any one of the supporting characters in ''Only Fools and Horses'', but it was with Boycie and Marlene that [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] decided to proceed with. This is mainly because Boycie is one of the strongest supporting characters. A spin-off with [[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]] or [[Denzil Tulser|Denzil]] may not have had enough depth to it.

Marlene ([[Sue Holderness]]) â Marlene was initially an unseen character in ''Only Fools and Horses'', occasionally mentioned by her husband Boycie. However, her first appearance saw that she was a cheerful, slightly daft woman whose burning, and seemingly unattainable, desire to have a child provided one of the ''Only Fools and Horses'' sub-plots. She later matured and became a frequently seen character, as did Boycie. In total, she appeared in around twenty episodes, slightly fewer than the character of Boycie.

In ''The Green Green Grass'' she is exactly the same in all senses. Unlike Boycie, Marlene settles into her new surroundings without a fuss and without changing herself. She also appears to gain more respect for the country as the series progresses. In the series two episode &quot;[[Mother Earth (The Green Green Grass)|Mother Earth]]&quot;, Marlene gives away all her clothes, as they were not environmentally friendly. Marlene also has a fear of the Driscoll Brothers, as seen in both &quot;[[Brothers and Sisters (The Green Green Grass)|Brothers and Sisters]]&quot; and &quot;[[Home Brew]]&quot;.

She has great love of her dog, Earl. Duke has obviously died since his last appearance in ''Only Fools and Horses''; however, this hasnât been revealed within ''The Green Green Grass''. She is also extremely proud of her son Tyler, even when he does something extremely stupid or inept. The character of Marlene has been expanded massively since her first appearance in the mid-eighties.

}}
Tyler (Jack Doolan) â The character of Tyler made several appearances in ''Only Fools and Horses'', although he was portrayed by different actors. His similarity in looks to [[Del Boy]] has led to a continuation of a running gag dating back to the late eighties. It has been speculated in both ''Only Fools and Horses'' and ''The Green Green Grass'' that Tyler might be the outcome of a fling between Marlene and Del.

One of his appearances in ''Only Fools and Horses'' was in the episode &quot;The Jolly Boysâ Outing&quot;, in which [[Uncle Albert]] told him one of his many war stories. Tyler made other appearances in the show but didnât really feature much until the beginning of ''The Green Green Grass''. His introduction in the spin-off hyped the speculation that Tyler might have been a result of something between Marlene and Del.

Tyler's introduction into ''Only Fools and Horses'' was to fuel a joke in which Del doesnât believe in seances. Boycie had been contacted during the seance and told by his father that he should look after his child. Thinking that it was a sick joke on behalf of his father's joke, he stormed out. Later, Del was contacted via the medium by his mother and told to go and have his pains looked at. After telling Rodney that its a load of cobblers, he finds out that Marlene is in fact pregnant, but is it with Boycie's child?

Tyler has a girlfriend called Beth from the episode &quot;[[Pillow Talk (The Green Green Grass)|Pillow Talk]]&quot; to &quot;[[The Special Relationship (The Green Green Grass)|The Special Relationship]]&quot;. He has a new girlfriend from the fourth series called Sara. She first appears in the episode &quot;[[Calendar Boys]]&quot;. Tyler has no on-screen friends in the country. Tyler has appeared in nearly every episode of the series, except &quot;[[Lust in Translation]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Done It My Way]]&quot;.

===Elgin Sparrowhawk===
{{Infobox soap character 2 
| name       = Elgin
| series     = [[The Green Green Grass]]
| years      = 2005â09
| first      = ''&quot;[[Keep On Running (The Green Green Grass)|Keep On Running]]&quot; &lt;small&gt;(2005)&lt;/small&gt;''
| last       = ''&quot;[[For Richer For Poorer]]&quot; &lt;small&gt;(2009)&lt;/small&gt;''
| creator    = [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]]
| introducer = [[Gareth Gwenlan]]
| born       = 1947
| death      = 
| occupation = [[Farm]] [[Management|manager]]
| portrayer  = [[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]
}}
Elgin ([[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]) â Elgin Sparrowhawk is the farm manager of Winterdown Farm. He is a rather strange man, who likes to appear a bit thick to ensure his workload remains light, but likes to show people that he is capable of outsmarting Boycie any day. He always carries his briefcase with a string shoulder strap around with him, to help remind people that he is still farm manager, even though it looks empty on occasions.

Elgin is married to his unseen wife, who apparently has a glass eye. He has said on occasions that she doesnât really like him, and at one point he started to have his mail redirected to Boycie's house just to ensure that she doesnât find out that he's still living there. He has shown deep affection towards his wife on many occasions, although he obviously fancies Marlene. Whenever she has her back turned, he is copping an eyeful; on one occasion he went as far as to dive across to kitchen floor in an attempt to woo an unsuspecting Marlene.

The character of Elgin has many levels of personality. He has been known to display aspects of comfort, depression, empathy and even love on occasions, although this may sometimes be towards people who donât love him back. Elgin has a sister who is mentioned only once in the first series. He has sometimes seemed idiotic, in the sense that he is ignorant of many walks of life; however, this is sporadically shown up as a facade. His subterfuge is irregularly revealed to other people, as he displays his ignorance to gain pay rises and substitute his work to other people.

Elgin is potentially the cleverest person displayed in ''The Green Green Grass'', as his colleagues have not yet been revealed as masquerading their intelligence. Both Boycie and Marlene arenât displayed as the cleverest people in the world. Even Tyler is displayed as a stereotypically thick teenager. Elgin's house has been shown once since the show's debut in 2005; it was shown from the outside in the episode &quot;[[The Path of True Love]]&quot;.

===Bryan===
{{Infobox soap character 2

| introducer = [[Gareth Gwenlan]]
| born       = {{Birth-date|1964}}
| occupation = Herdsman
| death      = 
| portrayer  = [[Ivan Kaye]]
}}
Bryan ([[Ivan Kaye]]) â Bryan is the farm's herdsman. He again likes to appear a bit thick so that he can take advantage of Boycie's ignorance. He has, on occasions, reduced his workload by bluffing to an out-of-his-depth Boycie. Bryan can be a little over the top on occasions, especially when thinking about his ex-girlfriend Myrtle. In one particular episode, he states that she chucked him seven times, and every time he found exactly the same wedding ring in a second-hand shop. It is sometimes hard to believe that Bryan's stupidity is a put-up job.

Little else is known about the character besides the fact that he lives alone in a caravan on the edge of Winterdown Farm. In the episode &quot;[[The Path of True Love]]&quot;, Jed is seen to come over to his caravan in a general fashion showing that this may be a general occurrence. He is shown to have a good working and social relationship with fellow colleagues Elgin, Jed and Imelda however, his relationship with both Boycie and Marlene isnât quite as cosy. He is often at the end of one of Boycie's jokes. 

Bryan has been known to invite people into his caravan in a crisis such as Elgin being thrown out by his wife and Boycie being thrown out by Marlene. However, he has stayed at other people's houses such as when his caravan burns down and he is forced to stay at Boycie's manor house along with Elgin in the episode &quot;[[But is it Art?]]&quot;

Bryan's workload has been known to expand from herdsman to such jobs as chauffeur in &quot;[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo Clock]]&quot; to security guard in &quot;[[Home Brew]]&quot;. The character of Bryan has settled down massively since the show's debut in 2005. The character of Myrtle, Bryan's ex-girlfriend, is mentioned frequently but is never seen.

===Jed===

| introducer = [[Gareth Gwenlan]]
| born       = {{Birth-date|1971}}
| death      = 
| occupation = Ploughman
| portrayer  = Peter Heppelthwaite
}}
Jed (Peter Heppelthwaite) â Jed is the farm's ploughman. He again likes to think he's appearing a bit thick, but, in reality, viewers are led to believe that Jed is genetically thick. He is renowned for having a family of five children. He is often the brunt of a joke, whereby he and his wife are âtoo lazyâ to use contraception. In the episode &quot;[[Hereâs to You, Mrs Boyce]]&quot;, Jed's youngest child is seen on the front of a local newspaper.

Jed's workload has also been known to expand from ploughman to various other areas of expertise, such as in the episode &quot;Home Brew&quot; when he gets involved in Ye Potato Cyder business. He is also known for attempting to escape his wife, such as in the episode &quot;[[The Path of True Love]]&quot; when he turns up unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, at Bryan's caravan after having a blazing row with his wife. Bryan just accepts this as a usual occurrence and lets him in.

Other than the details already specified, little else is known about Jed other than the fact that he has a wife and many children. He is also renowned for wearing his hat almost all the time. He even turns up at the disco wearing his best suit and his grubby hat in &quot;[[For Richer For Poorer]]&quot;. Other details include the fact that he is probably the thickest of the farm's staff and the most eccentric of the local people.

He is known for getting himself into several sticky situations such as the mistake regarding âlettersâ in the episode &quot;[[Your Cheating Art]]&quot; whereby Boycie and Marlene ask him and Bryan to talk to Tyler about his âDear Johnâ letter however they get the wrong end of the stick and end up telling Elgin that Marlene wants him leading to a risky situation for Elgin.

===Imelda Cakeworthy===
{{Infobox soap character 2

| death      = 
| occupation = [[Cleaner]]
| spouse     = Colin Cakeworthy
| portrayer  = [[Ella Kenion]]
}}
Imelda ([[Ella Kenion]]) â Mrs Cakeworthy is The Grange's housecleaner. Various jokes have been made to her expense, referring to her non-cleaning and biscuit-eating habits. She has even on occasions been asked to lift her legs whilst Marlene does the hoovering. Boycie sacks her in the episode &quot;[[Bothered and Bewildered]]&quot; after he catches her sitting around doing nothing. However, after some strange experiences he re-hires her.

Mrs Cakeworthy has a husband who has been seen on occasions, most notably in the 2006 Christmas special &quot;[[From Here to Paternity]]&quot;. She has also been seen to hold seances within The Grange since &quot;[[More Questions Than Answers]]&quot;. Mrs Cakeworthy is also said to have a dust intolerance.

She is probably the most normal person out of the population of Oakham. She is said to have paranormal qualities in which she can see and contact the dead. This is explored in many of the episodes and is the central plot of the episode &quot;[[The Departed (The Green Green Grass)|The Departed]]&quot;. She is sometimes referred to as âusing words from Narniaâ due to her use of old local language. 

Her husband, Colin, is in and out of hospital almost every series and thus she appears to be under pressure on occasions however, her responsibilities are sometimes thrown to one side much to other peoplesâ disgust. She is sometimes self-centred and oblivious to other peoples actions.

| daughters   = Rhian
| portrayer  = [[Alan David]]
}}
Llewellyn ([[Alan David]]) â Llewellyn is Boycie's next-door neighbour. Boycie continually refers to him as a mad Welshman. He has been known to look after himself and puts his thoughts before others. In the episode &quot;[[Testing Times]]&quot;, he grassed Boycie up for using Artificial Fertiliser on his Organic Farm. This could have put Boycie in prison for up to five years. Llewellyn has a daughter called Rhian, who is Tyler's English teacher. Rhian has appeared in two episodes.

Llewellyn has been known to get a little out of his own depth, such as when he challenged Boycie to a pub quiz in ''More Questions Than Answers'' and lost ten thousand pounds that he didnât have in the first place. He has also accused Boycie of things that he hasnât done, such as in ''From Here To Paternity'' when Boycie's dog, Earl, supposedly made Llewellyn's âslapper of a dogâ pregnant, which Earl didnât. Llewellyn tends to speak first, think later, and generally lands himself in a lot of trouble. In the episode &quot;[[The Departed (The Green Green Grass)|The Departed]]&quot;, Llewellyn is a special constable.

}}
Bethany (Lisa Diveney) â Beth is Tyler's girlfriend until the end of the third series. She is clever, attractive and vegetarian. Over the three years she spent as Tyler's girlfriend, she had her patience put to the test. First, Tyler showed no interest in supporting her horse racing protests, then he put meat before her, and, to top things off, she peers through the window to see Boycie completely naked, thanks to Earl, in ''Mother Earth''.

Beth made her last appearance in the 2007 Christmas special, &quot;[[The Special Relationship (The Green Green Grass)|The Special Relationship]]&quot;. The role of Tyler's girlfriend passed on to Sara from the fourth series. Beth was written out of the series, but is still mentioned frequently. She is said to have gone to Cambridge to further her education. This annoys Tyler, as he is slightly jealous of her achievements. However, Beth's dad Ray enjoys boasting about his daughter's achievements to him.

Sara (Samantha Sunderland) â Sara is Tyler's latest girlfriend. She is slightly weird in the sense that she is a fan of Tyler's band, Puddle of Agony. Tyler eventually asked her out in the episode &quot;[[Your Cheating Art]]&quot;, after some help from his mum and Dora. Tyler even managed to get her to strip naked for a piece of artwork. Sara has made two appearances in the series so far.

Ray ([[Nigel Harrison]]) â Ray is Beth's father and landlord of the local pub. Ray doesnât particularly like Tyler, as he believes that his daughter could have done better. He first appeared in the episode &quot;Testing Times&quot; and appeared in another ten episodes since. He is known to lash out in extreme circumstances, such as the misunderstanding in ''From Here to Paternity'', when he thinks that Boycie is calling his daughter âa bitchâ and when he says âtake a close look â it's a dogâ.
