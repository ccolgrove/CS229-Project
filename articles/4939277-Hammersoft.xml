The '''tenth season''' of the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' was originally broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States between August 23, 1998 and May 16, 1999. It contains twenty-three episodes, starting with &quot;[[Lard of the Dance]]&quot;. ''The Simpsons'' revolves around a working class [[Simpson family|family]] that consists of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Set in the fictional city of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], the show lampoons [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], society, television, and many aspects of the [[human condition]].

The [[show runner]] for the tenth season was [[Mike Scully]]. Before production began, a salary dispute between the main cast members of ''The Simpsons'' and Fox arose. However, it was soon settled and the actors' salaries were raised to [[United States dollar|$]]125,000 per episode. In addition to the large ''Simpsons'' cast, many guest stars appeared in season ten, including [[Phil Hartman]] in his last appearance before his death. 

The season, which won the [[Annie Award]] for &quot;[[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production|Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Program]]&quot;, has been cited by several critics as the beginning of the series' decline in quality. It ranked twenty-fifth in the season ratings with an average of 13.5 million viewers per episode. The tenth season DVD boxset was released in the United States and Canada on August 7, 2007. It is available in two different packagings, both featuring Bart.

==Production==
The tenth season was the second that Mike Scully served as show runner for (he had previously run the [[The Simpsons (season 9)|ninth season]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gimple|1999|pp=56â58}}&lt;/ref&gt; As show runner and [[Executive producer#Motion pictures and television|executive producer]], Scully headed the writing staff and oversaw all aspects of the show's production.&lt;ref name=tv&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Gail|url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/scully99b.html|title=Mike Scully Interview|publisher=[[UltimateTV (Online Service)|UltimateTV]]|date=1999-01-24|accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he told [[UltimateTV (Online Service)|UltimateTV]] in January 1999, he did not &quot;make any decisions without the staff's input.

In 1999, there were around sixteen staff writers working on ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name=tv/&gt; Many of them had written for the show for several years, including [[John Swartzwelder]] and [[George Meyer]].&lt;ref name=motherjones/&gt; The third episode of the tenth season, &quot;[[Bart the Mother]]&quot;, was the last full-length episode written by [[David X.

The main cast of the season consisted of [[Dan Castellaneta]] (Homer Simpson, [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], among others), [[Julie Kavner]] (Marge Simpson), [[Nancy Cartwright]] (Bart Simpson, [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Nelson Muntz]]), [[Yeardley Smith]] (Lisa Simpson), [[Hank Azaria]] ([[Moe Szyslak]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[Chief Wiggum]], among others) and [[Harry Shearer]] ([[Ned Flanders]], [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]], among others).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cast&quot;/&gt; Up until the production of season ten in 1998, these six main voice actors were paid [[United States dollar|$]]30,000 per episode. In 1998, a salary dispute between them and the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] (which airs ''The Simpsons'') arose, with the actors threatening to go on a strike.&lt;ref name=Glaister&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html|title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share|accessdate=2011-07-21|date=2004-04-03|author=Glaister, Dan|work=[[The Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but an agreement was soon made and the actors' salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode.&lt;ref name=Glaister/&gt; Groening expressed his sympathy for the cast members in an issue of ''[[Mother Jones (magazine){{!}}Mother Jones]]'' a while after the salary dispute had been settled. He told the magazine: &quot;They are incredibly talented, and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood.

He commented that it &quot;is not the last great 'Simpsons' season ever. The last great season was the eighth. The last really good season was the ninth.

[[File:Mike Scully by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mike Scully]], show runner of season ten, has been the target of criticism.]]
Scully, who was show runner during seasons nine through [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelve]], is held responsible by many critics and fans for the decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ortved/&gt; An [[op-ed]] in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' by Chris Suellentrop argued that ''The Simpsons'' changed from a realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon when Scully was the show runner: &quot;under Scully's tenure, ''The Simpsons'' became, well, a cartoon. {{interp|...}} Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck. The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;/&gt; John Ortved wrote in his book ''[[The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History]]'' that &quot;Scully's episodes excel when compared to what ''The Simpsons'' airs nowadays, but he was the man at the helm when the ship turned towards the iceberg.&quot;&lt;ref name=ortved&gt;{{harvnb|Ortved|2009|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' under Scully has been negatively labeled as a &quot;gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation&quot; by Jon BonnÃ© of [[MSNBC]],&lt;ref name=Back&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3404331/|title=The Simpsons,' back from the pit|author=BonnÃ©, Jon|date=2003-11-07|accessdate=2010-02-27|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fans have bemoaned the transformation in Homer's character during the era, from sweet and sincere to &quot;a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;lostitscool&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341530/|title='The Simpsons' has lost its cool|author=BonnÃ©, Jon|date=2000-10-02|accessdate=2008-09-05|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; dubbing him &quot;Jerkass Homer&quot;.&lt;ref name=Back/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2006/03/28/Arts/Matt-Groening.Did.You.Brain.Your.Damage-1751361.shtml|title=Matt Groening, did you brain your damage?|author=Ritchey, Alicia|date=2006-03-28|accessdate=2011-03-13|work=[[The Lantern]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070726_180440_10392|title=The life and times of Homer J.(Vol. IV)|author=Selley, Chris; Ursi, Marco; Weinman, Jaime J.|date=2007-07-26|accessdate=2011-07-05|work=[[Maclean's]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Simpsons'' writer Tom Martin said in Ortved's book that he does not understand the criticism against Scully because he thinks Scully ran the show well. He also commented that the thinks the criticism &quot;bothered [Scully], and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ortved|2009|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortved noted in his book that it is hard to tell how much of the decline is Scully's fault, and that blaming a single show runner for lowering the quality of the show &quot;is unfair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ortved|2009|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that some of the episodes from Scully's first two seasons (nine and ten), such as &quot;The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace&quot; and &quot;[[When You Dish Upon a Star]]&quot;, are better than certain episodes of the two previous seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;page261&quot;/&gt;

[[UGO Networks]]' Brian Tallerico has defended the season against the criticism. He wrote in a 2007 review that comparing &quot;tenth season Simpsons episodes to the prime of the series (3â7) is just unfair and really kind of self-defeating. 'Yeah, I laughed, but not as hard as a couple of years ago. So it sucks.' That's nonsense. The fact is that even the tenth season of The Simpsons was funnier than most [other] show's [''sic''] best years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ugo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090207205440/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17679 |title=The Simpsons Season Ten DVD Review |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-07-26|last=Tallerico |first=Brian |publisher=[[UGO Networks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; PopMatters' Hassenger commented in his review that although the show had declined in quality, &quot;this is not to say that these episodes are without their charm; many, in fact, are laugh-out-loud funny and characteristically smart.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;popmatters&quot;/&gt; Similarly to Tallerico, he also noted that &quot;weaker ''Simpsons'' seasons are superior to most television.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;popmatters&quot;/&gt;

 |ShortSummary=Homer tries to assemble a [[barbecue pit]] quickly, but fails and is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement. As a result, he vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. When Homer takes the failed barbecue pit back to the store, an art dealer sees it and describes it as a masterpiece of [[outsider art]]. As a result, he gets his own art exhibition and channels his rage into his work. Marge, who had been trying to succeed at art for years, gets jealous of Homer's easy success. However, when Homer makes new art pieces for a show called &quot;Art in America&quot; that are similar to his first piece, his peers reject him as repetitive. In an attempt to do something groundbreaking, Homer floods Springfield and puts snorkels on the animals. The townspeople declare this a masterpiece and everyone enjoys the new &quot;Grand Canals of Springfield&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Guest stars: [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Isabella Rossellini]]&lt;ref name=&quot;j&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gimple|1999|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
