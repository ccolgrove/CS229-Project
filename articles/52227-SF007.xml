'''SourceForge''' is a web-based [[source code repository]]. It acts as a centralized location for software developers to control and manage [[open source]] software development. The website runs a version of [[SourceForge Enterprise Edition]], [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from the last open-source version available. {{As of|2011|7}}, the SourceForge repository hosts more than 300,000 projects and has more than 2 million registered users,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/What%20is%20SourceForge.net| title=What is SourceForge.net? | accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not all are active. The domain ''sourceforge.net'' attracted at least 33 million visitors by August 2009 according to a [[Compete.com]] survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteanalytics.compete.com/sourceforge.net?metric=uv Sourceforge attracts almost 40m visitors yearly]&lt;/ref&gt;

SourceForge offers free access to hosting and tools for developers of [[free software|free]] / [[open source software]], competing with other providers such as [[RubyForge]], [[Tigris.org]], [[BountySource]], [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]], [[BerliOS]], [[JavaForge]], [[GNU Savannah]], [[Github]] and [[Gitorious]].

== Features ==

Project developers have access to centralized storage and tools for managing projects, although it is best known for providing [[revision control]] systems such as [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[Subversion (software)|SVN]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], [[Git (software)|Git]] or [[Mercurial (software)|Mercurial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sourceforge/wiki Sourceforge.net]&lt;/ref&gt;  Major features ([http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Comprehensive%20service%20directory amongst others]) include project [[wiki]]s, metrics and analysis, access to a [[MySQL]] [[database]], and unique sub-domain [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] (such as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://project-name.sourceforge.net&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;).

The vast number of users at SourceForge.net (over 2,000,000 as of 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sourceforge/wiki/What%20is%20SourceForge.net?|title=What is SourceForge.net?}}&lt;/ref&gt;) exposes prominent projects to a variety of developers, and can create a [[positive feedback loop]]. As a project's activity rises, SourceForge.net's internal ranking system makes it more visible to other developers who may join and contribute to it. Given that many open source projects fail due to lack of developer support, exposure to such a large community of developers can continually breathe new life into a project.

== Banned countries and controversy ==
[[Image:SourceForge.net - Download Forbidden.jpg|thumb|Error-message seen by someone attempting to access SourceForge from an [[ITAR]]-restricted country.]]
In its terms of use,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sitelegal/wiki/Terms_of_Use Sourceforge.net terms of use]&lt;/ref&gt; SourceForge states that its services are not available to users in countries on the sanction list of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (including [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]] and [[Syria]]). Since 2008, access to the secure server (used for making contributions to the site) was blocked for people from those countries. {{as of|2010|1}}, all access including downloads is blocked for those users. This means that all people whose IP addresses appear to belong to those countries are prevented from using the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/blog/clarifying-sourceforgenets-denial-of-site-access-for-certain-persons-in-accordance-with-us-law/ Sourceforge blog clarification for denial of access]&lt;/ref&gt;

These restrictions have drawn criticism as being counter to the free software movement, the open source software movement and the principles of making software available to all without discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/01/25/sourceforge-blocks-iran-north-korea-syria-sudan-and-cuba/ Blog entry discussing country-wide blocks]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temporary bans in China ===
{{Main|Golden Shield Project}}

SourceForge.net was banned in [[People's Republic of China|China]] around 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2119983/china-asta-la-vista-altavista|title=China says asta la vista to Altavista|publisher=vnunet.com|date=2002-09-06|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the ban was later lifted in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 2008, SourceForge.net website was banned again in [[People's Republic of China|China]] for about a month (June 26, 2008 â July 24, 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;moonblog&quot;&gt;[http://www.moon-blog.com/2008/06/sourceforge-blocked-in-china.html SourceForge Blocked In China]. Moonlight Blog. June 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moon-blog.com/2008/07/sourceforge-unblocked-in-china.html SourceForge Unblocked in China]. Moonlight Blog. July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=500647 Gamedev.net]&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that the ban was a result of the &quot;Boycott Beijing 2008&quot; banner placed on [[Notepad++]]'s SourceForge.net homepage to point out the human rights problem in China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Attacks on SourceForge.net==
SourceForge has faced critical attacks on its databases. In 2006, attackers targeted the SourceForge.net database and most of its users were advised to change their passwords in order to remain secure. In December 2007, SourceForge.net was offline for a while due to another attack&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/SourceForge-net-Hacked-73241.shtml/ SourceForge.net Hacked!]&lt;/ref&gt;. Nobody knew exactly what had happened, since there were no reports about the outage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On January 27, 2011, SourceForge faced another attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-net-attack/ Sourceforge.net attack]&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was mainly against some of the developer infrastructure and resulted in the exploitation of several SourceForge.net servers.
SourceForge said, &quot;The attack resulted in an exploit of several SourceForge.net servers, and we have proactively shut down a handful of developer centric services to safeguard data and protect the majority of our services&quot;

According to a SourceForge.net announcement on their [http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-net-attack/ blog], as a short term response, they have taken down services such as CVS Hosting, ViewVC (web-based code browsing), New Release upload capability, and Interactive Shell services. The company is silent about the type of attack and from where those attempts were made.

==Suit by SCPP==
[[SociÃ©tÃ© civile des Producteurs de Phonogrammes en France]] (SCPP) is an umbrella group for a variety of organizations in France. In November, 2008, SCPP initiated a suit against Sourceforge.net, [[Vuze]], [[Limewire]], and [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] for hosting P2P file-sharing application [[Shareaza]] that &quot;facilitates mass copyright infringement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/record-labels-to-sue-vuze-limewire-and-sourceforge-081114/ Record Labels to Sue Vuze, Limewire and SourceForge]&lt;/ref&gt; SourceForge is not sued for hosting copyrighted material itself, but for hosting Vuze.
