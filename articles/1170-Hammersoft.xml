An '''architect''' is a person trained in the planning, design and oversight of the construction of buildings. To ''practice architecture'' means to offer or render services in connection with the design and construction of a building, or group of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.&lt;ref name=ns.ca&gt;http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Etymologically, ''architect'' derives from the Latin ''architectus'', itself derived from the Greek ''arkhitekton'' (''arkhi-'', chief + ''tekton'', builder), i.e. '''chief builder'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect Online Etymology of the term &quot;architect&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a ''practicum'' (or ''internship'') for practical experience to earn a license to practice [[architecture]]. The practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction (see below).

The terms '''architect''' and '''architecture''' are also used  in the disciplines of [[landscape architecture]], [[naval architecture]] and often [[information technology]] (for example a [[software architect]]). In most of the world's jurisdictions, the professional and commercial uses of the term &quot;architect&quot;, outside of the etymological variants noted, is legally protected.

==Origins==
{{Main|History of Architecture}}
Throughout ancient and medieval history, most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as stone [[masonry|mason]]s and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Master Builder|master builder]]. Until modern times there was no clear distinction between the architect and [[Civil engineering|engineer]]. In Europe, the titles &quot;architect&quot; and &quot;engineer&quot; were primarily geographical variations referring to the same person, often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&amp;q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt ISBN 0-8052-1082-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architects in practice==

Architecture is a business in which technical knowledge, management, and an understanding of business are as  important as design. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.

===Design role===
The architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client [extensively] to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. This information, known as a program or brief, is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs and desires of the ownerâit is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.

Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines.

===Documentation role===
Architects prepare the technical or &quot;working&quot; documents (construction [[Architectural drawing|drawings]] and [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]]), usually coordinated with and supplemented by the work of a variety of disciplines [i.e., with varied expertise like mechanical, plumbing, electrical, civil, structural, etc.] engineers for the building services and that are filed for obtaining permits (development and [[building permit]]s) that require compliance with building, seismic, and relevant federal and local regulations. These construction drawings and specifications are also used for pricing the work, and for construction.

===Construction role===
Architects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]],  and review the progress of the work during construction. They typically review [[subcontractor]] [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide construction contract administration and Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]). In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the work is required.

Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less inclusive (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions). With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in design and to manage construction. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting.

==Alternate practice and specializations==
Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, health care, retail, public housing), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as [[building code]], [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[technical writing]], [[historic preservation]](US) or conservation (UK), [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants.

Many architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], [[construction management]], [[interior design]] or other related fields.

==Professional requirements==
{{Main|Professional requirements for architects}}
Although there are variations from place to place, most of the world's architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.

Educational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degreed candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.

Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late nineteenth century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s, and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder]], or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/surveyor surveyor], after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.

==Professional title distinctions==
According to the [[American Institute of Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf &quot;http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; titles and job descriptions within American architectural offices might be as follows:

*'''Senior Principal / Partner''': Typically an owner or majority shareholder of the firm; may be the founder; titles may include president, chief executive officer, or managing principal/partner.

*'''Mid-level Principal / Partner''': Principal or partner; titles may include executive or senior vice president.

*'''Junior Principal / Partner''': Recently made a partner or principal of the firm; title may include vice president.

*'''Department head / Senior Manage'''r: Senior management architect or non-registered graduate; responsible for major department(s) or functions; reports to a principal or partner.

*'''Project Manager''': Licensed architect, or non-registered graduate with more than 10 years of experience; has overall project management responsibility for a variety of projects or project teams, including client contact, scheduling, and budgeting.

*'''Senior Architect / Designer''': Licensed architect, or non-registered graduate with more than 10 years of experience; has a design or technical focus and is responsible for significant project activities.

*'''Architect / Designer III''': Licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 8â10 years of experience; responsible for significant aspects of projects.

*'''Architect / Designer II''': Licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 6â8 years of experience, responsible for daily design or technical development of projects.

*'''Architect / Designer I''': Recently licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 3â5 years of experience; responsible for particular parts of a project within parameters set by others.

*'''[[Intern Architect]]''': Unlicensed architecture school graduate participating in defined internship program; develops design or technical solutions under supervision of an architect.

==Architect's fees==
{{See also|Earnings for architects}}
Architects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on an a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 2 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.

Overall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner or shareholder, etc.) and the size and location of the firm.

==Professional organizations==
[[File:France in XXI Century. Robot building.jpg|thumb|270px|Architect in 21 century ([[1910]] card)]]
Refer to the international [[list of professional architecture organizations]] for groups created to promote career and business development in architecture. A wide variety of [[List of architecture prizes|prizes]] are awarded to architects to acknowledge superior buildings, structures and professional careers.

==Prizes, awards, and titles==
The most lucrative award an architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes termed the &quot;[[Nobel Prize]] for [[architecture]].&quot; Other prestigious architectural awards are the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]], the [[Richard H. Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture]], the [[Alvar Aalto Medal]] ([[Finland]]), the [[Carlsberg Architecture Prize]] ([[Denmark]]), and the [[Governor General's Awards#Governor General's Medals in Architecture|Governor General's Awards]] ([[Canada]]). [[List of architecture prizes|Other awards]] for excellence in architecture are given by national professional associations such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), and the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] (RAIC).

Architects in the [[UK]] who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and can write [[FRIBA]] after their name if they feel so inclined. Architects in the [[United States|US]] who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and can write [[FAIA]] after their name.   Architects in [[Canada]] who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and can write FRAIC after their name.
