'''Timothy Lyle Wood''' (born June 21, 1948 in [[Highland Park, MI]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[Figure skating|figure skater]]. He is three-time [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national champion]], and two-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World champion]]. He also won the silver medal at the [[1968 Winter Olympics]].

Wood's medal at the 1968 Olympics was somewhat unexpected, as he had been only 9th at the [[1967 World Figure Skating Championships|previous year's World Championships]].  He attributed his success to becoming mature enough to conquer his competition nerves, and to training harder.  While also a pre-law student at [[John Carroll University]], he spent 7 and a half hours a day training, including at least four hours just on [[compulsory figures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ADgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R6sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=petkevich%20skating&amp;pg=3041%2C4944538 &quot;Wood Attributes Rise to Hard Work, Maturity&quot;], The Owosso Argus-Press, Feb 17 1968&lt;/ref&gt;
