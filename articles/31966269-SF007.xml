'''Lulz Security''', commonly abbreviated as '''LulzSec''', is a [[hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] group that claims responsibility for several high profile attacks, including the compromise of user accounts from [[Sony Pictures]] in 2011. The group also claimed responsibility for taking the [[CIA]] website offline.&lt;ref name = BBCCIA&gt;{{cite news|title=LulzSec hackers claim CIA website shutdown|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13787229|accessdate=17 June 2011|newspaper=BBC |date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been described as a &quot;[[cyberterrorism|cyber terrorism group]]&quot; by the [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]] after their systems were compromised and information leaked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdps.gov/Media/News/View/?p=316|title=DPS Victim of Cyber Attack|date=June 27, 2011|work=Press Release|publisher=Arizona Department of Public Safety|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other security professionals have applauded LulzSec for drawing attention to insecure systems and the dangers of password reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is There a Hacking Epidemic?|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/07/is_there_a_hack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has gained attention due to its high profile targets and the sarcastic messages it has posted in the aftermath of its attacks.

At just after midnight ([[British Summer Time|BST]], [[Universal Time|UT]]+01) on 26 June 2011, LulzSec released a &quot;50 days of lulz&quot; statement, which they claimed to be their final release, confirming that LulzSec consisted of six members, and that their website is to be taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisenthal|first=Joe|title=Notorious Hacker Group LulzSec Just Announced That It's Finished|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lulzsec-finished-2011-6|accessdate=25 June 2011|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|date=25 June 2011|agency=Silicon Alley Insider|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ziS1EJcn|archivedate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This breaking up of the group was unexpected.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | first = Peter | last = Svensson | title = Parting is such tweet sorrow for hacker group | date = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/technology/security/parting-is-such-tweet-sorrow-for-hacker-group-20110626-1glos.html#ixzz1QSL6wvEC | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release included accounts and passwords from many different sources. Despite claims of retirement, the group committed another hack against newspapers owned by [[News Corporation]] on 18 July, defacing them with false reports regarding the death of [[Rupert Murdoch]]. The [[London Metropolitan Police]] has announced the arrests of two teenagers they allege are LulzSec members [[T-flow]] and [[Topiary (hacktivist)|Topiary]]. The group helped launch [[Operation AntiSec]], a joint effort involving LulzSec, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], and other hackers.

== Overview ==
LulzSec draws its name from the [[neologism]] &quot;[[Lulz]]&quot;, (from [[LOL]]s), &quot;laughing out loud&quot;, which often signifies laughter at the victim of a prank, and &quot;Sec,&quot; short for &quot;Security&quot;. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' has characterized its attacks as closer to Internet pranks rather than serious cyber-warfare,&lt;ref name=twsj/&gt; while the group itself claims to possess the capability of stronger attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LulzSec threatens governments|date=21 June 2011|work=RT|url=http://rt.com/usa/news/lulzsec-government-group-reads|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has gained attention in part due to its brazen claims of responsibility and lighthearted taunting of corporations that have been hacked. It frequently refers to [[Internet meme]]s when defacing websites. The group first emerged in May 2011, and has successfully attacked the websites of several major corporations.&lt;ref name=twsj/&gt; It specializes in finding websites with poor security, and then stealing and posting information from them online. It has used well-known straightforward methods, such as [[SQL injection]], to attack its target websites.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Several media sources have described their tactics as [[grey hat]] hacking.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Lulz Security|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13671195|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=BBC |date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnm&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Dan|title=Yet another hack, yet another delay in reporting it|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/06/09/yet-another-hack-yet-another-delay-in-reporting-it/?section=magazines_fortune|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=CNN Money|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scm&gt;{{cite news|last=Raywood|first=Dan|title=Security expert publicly backs 'grey hats' such as LulzSec, saying that public disclosure will help businesses|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/security-expert-publicly-backs-grey-hats-such-as-lulzsec-saying-that-public-disclosure-will-help-businesses/article/204904/|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=SC Magazine|date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the group may have been involved in a [[Anonymous (group)#Attack on HBGary Federal|previous attack]] against the security firm [[HBGary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Acohido|first=Byron|title=Who's who among key LulzSec hackitivists|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/06/whos-who-among-key-lulzsec-hackitivists/1|work=USA Today|accessdate=21 June 2011|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has used the motto &quot;Laughing at your security since 2011!&quot; and its website, created in June 2011, plays the theme from ''[[The Love Boat]]''.&lt;ref name=twsj&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morse|last2=Sherr|first1=Andrew|first2=Ian|title=For Some Hackers, The Goal Is Just To Play A Prank|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110605-702801.html|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|page=B1|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It announces its exploits via Twitter and its own website, often accompanied with lighthearted [[ASCII art]] drawings of boats. Its website also includes a [[Bitcoin]] donation to help fund its activities.&lt;ref name=forb&gt;{{cite news|last=Olson|first=Parmy|title=LulzSec Hackers Post Sony Dev.

Retrieved on 6 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also been critical of [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] hackers, claiming that many of them have been corrupted by their employers.&lt;ref name=twsj/&gt;

Some in the security community have lauded them for raising awareness of the widespread lack of effective security against hackers.&lt;ref name=tth&gt;{{cite news|last=Ragan|first=Steve|title=One month later&amp;nbsp;â LulzSec continues their personal brand of comedy|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201123/7251/One-month-later-%E2%80%93-LulzSec-continues-their-personal-brand-of-comedy|accessdate=9 June 2011|newspaper=The Tech Herald|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been credited with inspiring [[LulzRaft]], a group which has been implicated in several high-profile website hacks in Canada.&lt;ref name=tcp&gt;{{cite news|last=Beltrame|first=Julian|title=Hacker without a cause scores with Harper 'breakfast incident' hoax|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5haZn2PyOSvxJly0_pPXkakAc52kA?docId=7077370|accessdate=10 June 2011|newspaper=The Canadian Press|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's first recorded attack was against [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox.com]]'s website. It claimed responsibility for leaking information, including passwords, altering several employees' [[LinkedIn]] profiles, and leaking a database of [[The X Factor (U.S.)|X Factor]] contestants containing contact information of 73,000 contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is LulzSec, Hacker of PBS?

Some LulzSec members had once been prominent Anonymous members, including member [[Topiary (hacktivist)|Topiary]].&lt;ref name=logs/&gt;

== Members and associates ==
LulzSec consists of six core members.&lt;ref name=fifty/&gt; The online handles of these six have been established through various attempts by other hacking groups to release personal information of group members on the internet, leaked IRC logs given to ''[[The Guardian]]'', and through confirmation from the group itself.&lt;ref name=members&gt;{{cite news|last=Poeter|first=Damon|title=Who Is LulzSec?|url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/266414/Who-Is-LulzSec|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=[[PC Magazine]]|date=2 July 2011|agency=[[Ziff Davis]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zx2jodqN|archivedate=5 July 2011|pages=1â9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sabu (hacktivist)|Sabu]] &amp;ndash; One of the group's founders who seemed to act as a kind of leader for the group, often Sabu decides what targets to attack next and who could participate in these attacks. He may have been part of the Anonymous group that hacked [[HBGary]]. Various attempts to release his real identity have claimed that he is an [[Information technology consulting|information technology consultant]] with the strongest hacking skills of the group and a knowledge of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;
* [[Topiary (hacktivist)|Topiary]] &amp;ndash; Topiary is also a suspected former member of the Anonymous AnonOps, where he used to perform media relations, including hacking the website of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] during a live interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=William|title=Video: Anonymous hacks Westboro Baptist Church website during on-air confrontation|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504784_162-20036043-10391705.html|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|date=24 February 2011|agency=[[CBS]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zx3f5f7H|archivedate=5 July 2011|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topiary ran the LulzSec Twitter account on a daily basis; following the announcement of LulzSec's dissolution, he deleted all the posts on his twitter page, except for one, which stated: &quot;You cannot arrest an idea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; http://twitter.com/atopiary &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=members/&gt; Police arrested a man from [[Shetland]], [[United Kingdom]] suspected of being Topiary on 27 July 2011.&lt;ref name=topiaryarrest/&gt; The man was later identified as Jake Davis and was charged with five counts, including unauthorized access of a computer and conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LulzSec: Shetland teen charged over computer hacking claims|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14359933|accessdate=31 July 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=31 July 2011|agency=[[BBC]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60b7Z5Nyr|archivedate=31 July 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kayla &amp;ndash; Also identified as &quot;lol&quot; in LulzSec chat logs, Kayla owns a [[botnet]] used by the group in their distributed denial-of-service attacks. The botnet is reported to consist of about 8,000 infected [[computer server]]s. Kayla also may have participated in the Anonymous operation against HBGary.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;
* T-flow &amp;ndash; The fourth founding member of the group identified in chat logs, attempts to identify him have labelled him a [[PHP]] coder, [[web developer]], and performer of scams on [[PayPal]]. The group placed him in charge of maintenance and security of the group's website lulzsecurity.com.&lt;ref name=members/&gt; London Metropolitan Police announced the arrest of a 16 year-old hacker going by the handle Tflow on 19 July 2011.&lt;ref name=tflow/&gt;
* Avunit &amp;ndash; He is one of the core six members of the group, but not a founding member. He left the group after their self-labelled &quot;Fuck the FBI Friday&quot;.  He was also affiliated with Anonymous AnonOps HQ.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;
* Pwnsauce &amp;ndash; Pwnsauce joined the group around the same time as Avunit and became one of its core members.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;

Associates and former members include:
* M_nerva &amp;ndash; M_nerva, once a member of the group, leaked some of the group's chat logs to ''The Guardian''. In response to the leak, LulzSec published M_nerva's personal information and records of the illegal hacking activity performed with them.  May also have participated with LulzSec in the attack on Fox.com.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;
* Joepie91 &amp;ndash; Though he is one of the most frequent participants in LulzSec IRC chat logs, the group stated that he is not a core member.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;. 
* Neuron &amp;ndash; Neuron is not a core member of the group, but may have supported them by building software and taking part in some of their distributed denial-of-service attacks. He is thought to be an engineering student in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=members/&gt;
* [[LulzSec#Ryan Cleary|Ryan Cleary]] &amp;ndash; A 19-year-old from [[Essex]], [[United Kingdom]] who was arrested by [[Metropolitan Police]] on 21 June 2011 and charged with violating the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990|Computer Misuse Act]] and the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].&lt;ref name=charged/&gt; Though not a member of the group, LulzSec admitted that he did run one of the IRC channels that they used for communicating.&lt;ref name=hardawar/&gt;

In June 2011, the group released a manifesto outlining why they perform hacks and website takedowns. In it they reiterated that &quot;we do things just because we find it entertaining&quot; and that watching the results can be &quot;priceless&quot;.&lt;ref name=arsmanifesto&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Nate|title=LulzSec manifesto: &quot;We screw each other over for a jolt of satisfaction&quot;|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/lulzsec-heres-why-we-hack-you-bitches.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|date=18 June 2011|agency=[[CondÃ© Nast Publications]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zZgZGcO3|archivedate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also claim to be drawing attention to [[computer security]] flaws and holes. They contend that many other hackers exploit and steal user information without releasing the names publicly or telling people they may possibly have been hacked. LulzSec said that by releasing lists of hacked usernames or informing the public of vulnerable websites, it gives users the opportunity to change names and passwords elsewhere that might otherwise have been exploited, and businesses will be alarmed that they should upgrade their security.&lt;ref name=arsmanifesto/&gt;

The group's latest attacks have had a more political tone. They claim to want to expose the &quot;racist and corrupt nature&quot; of the military and [[law enforcement]]. They have also expressed opposition to the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=LulzSec Releases Arizona Police Documents|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/lulzsec-arizona/|accessdate=24 June 2011|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine){{!}}Wired]]|date=24 June 2011|agency=[[CondÃ© Nast Publications]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zflovgpH|archivedate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lulzsec's Operation Anti-Security has been characterized as a protest against government censorship and monitoring of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevenson|first=Alastair|title=Operation Anti-Security: Anonymous yet to act while LulzSec rampage|url=http://uk.ibtimes.com/articles/167639/20110622/lulzsec-lulz-security-anonymous-operation-anti-security-anti-sec-hacked-cleary-ryan-arrest-attack.htm|accessdate=24 June 2011|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=22 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zfn4uYd2|archivedate=24 June 2011|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a question and answer session with [[BBC]] ''[[Newsnight]]'', LulzSec member Whirlpool said, &quot;Politically motivated ethical hacking is more fulfilling&quot;.

== Initial targets ==
The group's first attacks came in May 2011. Their first recorded target was Fox.com, which they retaliated against after they called Common, a rapper and entertainer, &quot;vile&quot; on the [[Fox News Channel]]. They leaked several passwords, LinkedIn profiles, and the names of 73,000 X Factor contestants. Soon after on 15 May, they released the transaction logs of 3,100 [[Automated Teller Machine]]s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=reasons/&gt; In May 2011, members of Lulz Security gained international attention for hacking into the American [[Public Broadcasting System]] (PBS) website. They stole user data and posted a fake story on the site which claimed that [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Biggie Smalls]] were still alive and living in New Zealand. In the aftermath of the attack, [[CNN]] referred to the responsible group as the &quot;Lulz Boat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CNN Wire Staff|title=Hackers pirate PBS website, post fake story about Tupac still alive|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/05/30/pbs.hackers/index.html?iid=EL|publisher=CNN|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lulz Security claimed that some of its hacks, including its attack on PBS, were motivated by a desire to defend [[WikiLeaks]] and [[Bradley Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Olson|first=Parmy|title=Interview With PBS Hackers: We Did It For âLulz And Justiceâ|url=http://blogs.forbes.com/parmyolson/2011/05/31/interview-with-pbs-hackers-we-did-it-for-lulz-and-justice/|work=Forbes|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fox News]] report on the group quoted one commentator, Brandon Pike, who claimed that Lulz Security is affiliated with the [[Hacktivism|hacktivist]] group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. Lulz Security claimed that Pike had actually hired it to hack PBS. Pike denied the accusation and claims it was leveled against him because he said Lulz Security was a splinter of Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaplan |first=Jeremy |title=Group Claims It Was 'Paid to Hack PBS,' Then Leaks a Million Sony User IDs |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/06/02/man-denies-paying-group-to-hack-pbsorg/ |publisher=Fox News |date= 2 June 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, members of the group claimed responsibility for an attack against [[Sony Pictures]] that took data that included &quot;names, passwords, e-mail addresses, home addresses and dates of birth for thousands of people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Group claims fresh hack of 1 million Sony accounts Money|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/02/technology/sony_lulz_hack/?section=money_latest|publisher=CNN |date= 2 June 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group claimed that it used a [[SQL injection attack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ogg|first=Erica|title=Hackers steal more customer info from Sony servers|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31021_3-20068414-260/hackers-steal-more-customer-info-from-sony-servers|publisher=CNET|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was motivated by Sony's legal action against [[George Hotz]] for [[Privilege_escalation#Jailbreaking|jailbreaking]] into the [[PlayStation 3]].

Lulz Security attempted to hack into [[Nintendo]], but both the group and Nintendo itself report that no particularly valuable information was found by the hackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LulzSec Hacks Nintendo: No User Information Released|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2386428,00.asp|newspaper=PCMag|date=5 June 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; LulzSec claims that it did not mean to harm Nintendo, declaring: &quot;We're not targeting Nintendo.

On 8 June 2011, LulzSec hacked into the website of Black &amp; Berg Cybersecurity Consulting, a small network security company, and changed the image displayed on their front page to one containing the LulzSec logo. They did so after the company had issued a &quot;Cybersecurity For The 21st Century, Hacking Challenge&quot;, in which they challenged hackers to hack the site and alter the homepage graphic. The intrusion came after Joe Black, an owner of the company posted the message &quot;Black &amp; Berg Cybersecurity Consulting appreciate all the hard work that you're putting in. Your Hacking = Clients for us. Thx&quot; to the LulzSec Twitter account. Though Black &amp; Berg offered a prize of $10,000 and a position with the company for the successful hack, members of LulzSec declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LulzSec wins hacking competition, refuses $10k award|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/159446/20110608/lulzsec-hacking-competition-black-berg-cybersecurity.htm|accessdate=8 June 2011|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=8 June 2011|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the website contained the reply &quot;DONE, THAT WAS EASY.

On 11 June, reports emerged that LulzSec reportedly hacked into and stole user information from the [[Internet pornography|pornography website]] www.pron.com. They obtained and published around 26,000 e-mail addresses and passwords. Among the information stolen are records of two users who subscribed using email addresses associated with the Malaysian government, three users who subscribed using United States military email addresses and 55 users who LulzSec claimed were administrators of other adult-oriented websites. Following the breach, Facebook locked the accounts of all users who had used the published e-mail addresses, and also blocked new Facebook accounts opened using the leaked e-mail addresses. They feared that users of the site would get hacked after LulzSec encouraged people to try and see if these people used identical user name and password combinations on Facebook as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Keir|title=Porn Site Users Beware: Hacker Group LulzSec May Have Posted Your Email Address|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/230122/porn_site_users_beware_hacker_group_lulzsec_may_have_posted_your_email_address.html|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=[[PC World (magazine){{!}}PC World]]|date=11 June 2011|agency=[[IDG]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zMrR1kzh|archivedate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported a number of attacks, originally attributed to LulzSec, that the group later denied involvement in. On 21 June, someone claiming to be from the group posted on Pastebin that they had stolen the entire database of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011]]. LulzSec responded by saying that they had obtained no such data and that whoever posted the notice was not from the group.
