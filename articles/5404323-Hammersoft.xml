'''No. 159 Squadron RAF''' was a [[Royal Air Force]] Squadron that was active as a [[Bomber]], [[Mine-laying]], [[Reconnaissance]] and [[Transport]] unit in [[World War II]].

==History==
===Formation in World War One===
The original '''159 Squadron''' was to be formed during the [[First World War]], but the idea was disbanded so that reinforcements could be sent to [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Jefford 2001, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation in World War II===
No. 159 Squadron was reformed at [[RAF Molesworth]] on 2 July 1942 during the [[Second World War]] and its ground crew personnel were posted, without aircraft, to the Middle East on 12 February 1942 and then to India on 18 May 1942. Flying [[B-24 Liberator]]s, the squadron was posted to Palestine in July 1942 and carried out bombing raids in North Africa, Italy and Greece. No. 159 then flew to India on 30 September 1942. The first operation against the Japanese was on 17 November 1942, and during the rest of the war, the squadron flew mine-laying, bombing, and reconnaissance missions over [[Burma]], [[Siam]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Indo-China]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. After the war, No.159 converted to transport and survey duties before disbanding on 1 June 1946.

==Notable squadron members==
===Stanley James Woodbridge, GC===
Flight Sergeant [[Stanley James Woodbridge]], a wireless operator who served with 159 squadron, was awarded the [[George Cross]] posthumously in 1948. Woodbridge had steadfastly refused to divulge his codes and other details of his radio equipment to his Japanese captors. Woodbridge was tortured and eventually beheaded along with three other members of his crew.
