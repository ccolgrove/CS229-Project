==January 2011 uprising in Egypt==
Mahfouz has been credited with having sparked the protests that began the uprising in January 2011 in Cairo. In a video blog posted to Facebook on 18 January, she called on Egyptians to demand their human rights and to voice their disapproval of the regime of [[Hosni Mubarak]]. The video was uploaded to Youtube and, within days, went &quot;viral&quot;.&lt;ref name=democnow&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2011/2/8/asmaa_mahfouz_the_youtube_video_that Asmaa Mahfouz &amp; the YouTube Video that Helped Spark the Egyptian Uprising] [[Democracy Now!]], 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[al-Mihwar TV]], she said that a week before 25 January, she posted a video to Facebook announcing that she would be going to [[Tahrir Square, Cairo|Tahrir Square]] to protest. Mahfouz said that four other young Egyptians joined her, and that the internal security services quickly surrounded and moved the group away from the square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/2785.htm Asmaa Mahfouz, Organizer of the Demonstrations in Egypt, Talks About Her Decision to Use Facebook to Take Action] Al-Mihrar TV, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following this, she posted another video announcing her intention to go to the square again on 25 January, a [[National Police Day (Egypt)|national holiday in Egypt]] honoring police who died in a confrontation with British forces. In this video, she challenged Egyptians to take to the street, saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;If you think yourself a man, come with me on 25 January. Whoever says women shouldnât go to protests because they will get beaten, let him have some honor and manhood and come with me on 25 January. Whoever says it is not worth it because there will only be a handful of people, I want to tell him, 'You are the reason behind this, and you are a traitor, just like the president or any security cop who beats us in the streets.'&lt;ref name=democnow /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in 2011, Mahfouz was arrested on charges of defaming the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Egyptian military rulers]] for calling them a &quot;council of dogs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=581&amp;alert=99 |title=Freedom Alert: Egyptian activist Asmaa Mahfouz arrested|month=August | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was referred to a military court, prompting activists, as well as presidential hopefuls such as Mohamed El Baradei and Ayman Nour, to protest her being charged in a military court.&lt;ref&gt;Osman, Ahmed Zaki [http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/486440 Activists and presidential hopefuls condemn Asmaa Mahfouz arrest] al-Masry al-Youm. 15 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mahfouz was released on bail in the amount of 20,000 Egyptian Pounds, equivalent to approximately 3,350 US dollars and after that the supreme council of Armed forces renounced the charge and charges were released of Asmaa and another activist called Loay Nagaty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/79edadb4-ca4d-11e0-a0dc-00144feabdc0.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/79edadb4-ca4d-11e0-a0dc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VVb8cIIh|title= Egyptian military drops charges against activists|month=August | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14524094 Egypt blogger Mahfuz quizzed for 'defaming' military] BBC News. 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osman, Ahmed Zaki [http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/486305 Activist released from military court on LE20,000 bail for Facebook post] al-Masry al-Youm. 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support of Occupy Wall Street==
On October 23, Mahfouz held a teach-in at Liberty Plaza, in a show of support for the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement.  When asked why she came to the OWS protest she replied, &quot;Many of U.S. residents was in solidarity with us. So, we have to keep going all over the world, because another world is possible for all of us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/10/25/from_tahrir_to_wall_street_egyptian |title=From Tahrir to Wall Street: Egyptian Revolutionary Asmaa Mahfouz Speaks at Occupy Wall Street |publisher=Democracynow.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
