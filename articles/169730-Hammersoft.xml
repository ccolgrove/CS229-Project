* November 9 â The cast and crew had begun work on episodes for [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|''The Incredible Hulk''{{'}}s]] fifth season on [[CBS]] when the network's head of programming, Harvey Shepherd, delivered a surprise blow: despite maintaining solid ratings, ''The Incredible Hulk'' was to be canceled immediately. Author Frank Garcia, while interviewing Johnson, learned that CBS executive Harvey Shepherd disliked ''The Incredible Hulk'' and felt that there &quot;wasn't a full season left in it&quot;, thus putting an end to David Banner's struggles. Producer [[Kenneth Johnson (producer)|Kenneth Johnson]] tried to convince Sheppard to buy six additional episodes so that CBS could have a half-season of new episodes but he declined. The series was canceled so suddenly that Johnson never had a chance to film an INCREDIBLE HULK series finale which would feature David on trial for the murder of Elaina Marks. Several scripts including &quot;David Banner, RIP&quot;, and &quot;Killer On Board&quot; never went before the cameras to become small-screen Hulk adventures. The notice came so quickly and so suddenly that Johnston and Corea were unable to film a proposed two hour finale in which David was brought to trial for the murder of Elaina Marks. Production officially halted in the summer of 1981.
