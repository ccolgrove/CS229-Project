Dravidian politics has developed by associating itself to the [[Dravidian people|Dravidian community]]. The original goal of Dravidian politics was to achieve social equality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Theory and Political Thought |author= N.D. Arora/S.S.

Most Dravidian parties are offshoots of [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] (DK);.&lt;ref name=Cho/&gt; There are also a few other parties in Tamil Nadu that did not arise from DK directly.

The antipathy towards Sanskrit compounded with the animosity against the Brahimins paved the way for the rise of Dravidian politics in Madras Presidency.&lt;ref name=hardriots/&gt;

===Early Dravidian politics===
[[File:Theagaroya Chetty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir P. Theagaroya Chetty]] was one of the founders of Justice Party in 1916.]]
An early pineer in Dravidian politics was [[Iyothee Thass]] in the late 19th century. His efforts brought together the lower caste Dravidians with the establishment of  the ''Dravida Mahajana Sabha'' organisation in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;politics_of_naming&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last= Ravikumar| first=  | title= Iyothee Thass and the Politics of Naming | date=September 28, 2005 | url =http://www.countercurrents.org/dalit-ravikumar280905.htm | work = The Sunday Pioneer | accessdate = 2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major leap in Dravidian politics was the formation of the ''Madras United League'' by non-Brahmin intellectuals, who considered the dominance of Brahmins in civil administration a threat to the non-Brahmin majority.&lt;ref name=EPP&gt;{{cite book

The League was initially started as a workgroup that helped non-Brahmin students in [[Madras]] with accommodation. It later grew into a [[political party]] under the efforts of leaders like [[Sir Pitti Theagaroya Chetty]] and [[Dr. T. M. Nair]]. The party was named ''South Indian Liberal Federation (S. I. L. F.)'' - popularly known as the [[Justice party (India)|Justice party]].&lt;ref name=EPP/&gt;

===Justice Party era===
{{main|Justice Party (India)}}
A limited form of self governance was introduced in [[British Raj#World War I and its aftermath|British India]] after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Votes1/&gt; While the Justice Party saw this as an opportunity to displace Brahmin dominance, the British government considered it favourable, since the [[Indian National Congress]] spearheading the [[Indian independence movement]] was dominated by Brahmins.&lt;ref name=Votes1/&gt; The Justice party emerged as a winner in the 1920 general elections and brought about the reforms it had campaigned for,&lt;ref name=Votes1/&gt; including establishing [[Reservation in India|communal reservation]] through [[affirmative action]] for the first time in the country, and brought [[Hindu temple|temples]] under state control.&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; Soon after their electoral success the animosity between [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Telugu people|Telugu]] members deepened, thus weakening the party.&lt;ref name=Votes1/&gt; Nevertheless, the Justice Party electorally dominated the presidency for 17 years until it was defeated by the Indian National Congress party in 1937.&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; Although out of power, the Justice Party was involved in demonstrations across the Province against the introduction of [[Hindi language|Hindi]] as a compulsory subject of study in schools by a [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]-led government, which led to the detainment of scores of Tamil scholars, academics and Justice Party leaders.&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; This and other struggles for social justice helped create the social base of what emerged as the Dravidian Movement.&lt;ref name=frontline2/&gt;

===Dravidar Kazhagam===
{{main|Dravidar Kazhagam}}
{{see also|Periyar E. V. Ramasamy}}
The next few years saw a decline in the Justice Party's popularity. In 1938, the by then badly weakened party sought the leadership of [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]], a leader of the Dravidian Movement, who became its president. In 1944, Periyar changed the name of the party to [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] ('''Dravidian organisation''' in English).&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt; This move was opposed by some members of the Party who continued contesting elections as the Justice Party under the leadership of [[P. T. Rajan]] until 1957. Periyar as the president of Dravidiar Kazhagam considered that contesting in elections would lead to compromises in principles and withdrew Dravida Kazhagam from parliamentary politics.&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt;

===Independent Dravida Nadu===
{{see also|Dravida Nadu}}
Although initially both DK and DMK sought an independent Dravida Nadu, DK later moved on to work on bringing social changes whereas DMK leaders such as [[C. N. Annadurai]] and [[E. V. K. Sampath]] endeavoured to achieve their goals through parliamentary election processes.&lt;ref name=Swarna/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardgrave1/&gt; 
Sampath, who had earlier forfeited his seniority with Periyar's party to join DMK, saw the call for an independent Dravida Nadu was turning out to be an unrealistic goal.&lt;ref name=Urmila&gt;{{cite book

Sampath expressed concerns over using film stars to increase the popularity of the party.&lt;ref name=Urmila/&gt; His views led him to cross swords with the major leaders of the party and eventually caused the first split in DMK.

DMK leaders also perceived that the attempts to declare Hindi as the sole national language of India was an attempt impose an Aryan language unwilling people in the South.&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; According to the terms of the Indian constitution dated January 26, 1965, [[English language|English]] as an [[official language of India]] would come to an end and Hindi would become the sole official language.

Although DMK was not directly involved in the violence that marred the agitation,&lt;ref name=hardriots/&gt; the protest itself catapulted DMK to political power in the State in the [[Madras State legislative assembly election, 1967|1967 legislative elections]].&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt;

The electoral victory in 1967 led to an [[electoral fusion]] among the non-Congress parties to avoid a split in the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Opposition]] votes. [[Rajaji|Rajagopalachari]], a former senior leader of the Congress Party, had by then left the Congress and launched the right-wing [[Swatantra Party]]. He played a vital role in bringing about the electoral fusion amongst the opposition parties to align against the Congress.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt;

==Split in DMK and birth of AIADMK==
===MGR and the split from DMK===
{{main|M. G. Ramachandran|AIADMK}}
[[Image:Mgre34wk3wk.jpg|thumb|250px|M. Karunanidhi and M. G. Ramachandran, seen in their early days in the DMK. They later became political rivals and stalwarts in their own parties.]]

M. G. Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR, was an [[actor]] in [[Tamil Cinema Industry|Tamil cinema]] and a well known propagator of Dravidian ideologies in his movies since 1953. In the 1970s as the then [[treasurer]] of DMK, he played a vital part in popularising the party, bringing many of his fans as supporters. 
A political feud between MGR and the party's president [[M. Karunanidhi]]  had been ongoing since the death of Annadurai in 1969. It arose from Karunanidhi calling himself the &quot;[[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Mujib]] of Tamil Nadu&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardgrave/&gt; Soon after the electoral victory of DMK in 1971, some of senior members expressed concern that MGR's popularity was growing strong within the party cadres. 
Karunanidhi made several attempts to weaken MGR's position within the party. MGR retaliated with corruption charges&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt; and a call for a boycott of the party's General Council.&lt;ref name=Prasad&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
DMK's General Council suspended MGR from the party stating that he had involved himself in &quot;anti party activities&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prasad/&gt; Although MGR had lost support from top ranking leaders within the DMK, the strong public reaction following his suspension demonstrated his popular support within the party's volunteers.&lt;ref name=Prasad/&gt; Inspired by this support from the party's lower cadres and his fans,&lt;ref name=Prasad/&gt; MGR launched his own party, [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], AIADMK (named after Annadurai: Anna was his nickname).&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardgrave&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIADMK government===
MGR presented his new party to [[Indira Gandhi]] as the regional equivalent of her [[Congress (I)]] Party.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt; Indira Gandhi was the head of her party, which she split from the [[Indian National Congress]] with the support of lower cadres and opposition from senior party leaders.&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus AIADMK could show itself as an equally strong alternative to that of DMK with which Congress (I) could ally. From then on, the Congress (I) Party fought elections in the State in alliance with one of the two parties. Ever since then the Dravidian parties have helped the Congress (I) sustain itself in the State, but with limited ambitions.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt; 

In 1977, the DMK government, led by Karunanidhi, was dismissed under corruption charges by the Central government of India, led by Congress (I), which had by then allied with AIADMK.&lt;ref name=Murasoli/&gt;

[[Sivaji Ganesan]], a veteran actor of [[Tamil Cinema]], was a founding member of DMK party.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave/&gt; The actor himself was nick-named [[Shivaji]] by Periyar E. V. Ramasami after his role portraying the [[Maratha]] king.&lt;ref name=lode&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, differences between the party leadership and the actor widened since he perceived that M. G. Ramachandran, his acting contemporary, was given more prominence than himself.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave/&gt; Furthermore, he started distancing himself from the party's anti-religious atheistic stance to satisfy his religious fans.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave/&gt; Hence when E. V. K. Sampath launched his own splinter from DMK (in the name of Tamil National Party), Sivaji left DMK and joined Sampath.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave1/&gt; However, Tamil National Party itself was short-lived and was merged into Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ('''Progressive Dravidian Renaissance Organisation''' in English) or MDMK is yet another offshoot of the DMK. It was formed in May 1994, after [[V. Gopalswamy]] (popularly known as Vaiko), a senior leader and [[Member of Parliament]] from DMK, was expelled from the party.&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; Barring, perhaps, their more radical support for an independent [[Tamil Eelam]] in the [[Sri Lankan civil war|Sri Lankan crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;

the MDMK do not have major ideological differences with the other Dravidian parties. MDMK shares its goals with the DMK and AIADMK in respect to State [[autonomy]], constitutional protection for the [[Reservation in India|reservation]] formula and making Tamil an official language of the Indian Union.&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; In 2004, Tamil film director and actor [[T.

===Offshoots of AIADMK===
Soon after MGR's death in 1987, his wife [[Janaki Ramachandran]] took over as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name=Janaki1&gt;
{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This appointment was opposed by former actress and politician [[J. Jayalalithaa]].&lt;ref name=Janaki1/&gt; The resistance from Jayalalithaa eventually led to the dismissal of the AIADMK government, the shortest lived government in the history of Tamil Nadu, by the Central Government of India then led by [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. The antagonism built up and the AIADMK split into two fragments.&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt; 
The [[Election Commission of India]] refused to accept either of them as the successor of the original party and separate [[List of political party symbols in India|electoral symbols]] were allocated.&lt;ref name=iconic&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
The faction led by MGR's widow chose to use ''two doves'', with a large dove holding leafy branch in its beak, as if feeding the smaller dove. Jayalalithaa's faction was represented by a ''crowing cock''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election defeat, Janaki retired from active politics and the two party factions rejoined into one party.&lt;ref name=Janaki1/&gt;&lt;ref name=iconic/&gt; 

Other breakaways in AIADMK were witnessed in 1990s, when [[R. M. Veerappan]] and [[S.

==Dravidian parties in central government==
Although the DMK and the AIADMK started playing a minimal role in the decision-making process in the [[Government of India|Central government]] in the late 1960s, their actual participation in [[coalition government]]s came only in 1979, when two AIADMK Members of Parliament, [[Satyavani Muthu]] and [[Aravinda Bala Pajanor]], joined the short-lived [[Charan Singh]] Ministry, which followed the [[Morarji Desai]]-led [[Janata Party]] government (1977â79). The DMK's [[Murasoli Maran]] joined the [[V.P. Singh]] Ministry in 1989. The DMK shared power with the subsequent [[United Front]] governments led by [[H.D. Deve Gowda]] and [[I.K. Gujral]]. In the [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] Ministry (1998â99), three parties from Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK, the [[Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (MDMK) and the [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]] (PMK) were represented. In the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Ministry, headed by Vajpayee (1999â2004), the DMK, the MDMK and the PMK all had representatives. In fact, it was in this Ministry that Tamil Nadu had the largest representation. At one stage there were 10 Ministers from Tamil Nadu, seven of them from the Dravidian parties. In the Vajpayee Ministry (1998â99), the AIADMK's presence lasted only a few months.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt; The current central government led by [[Manmohan Singh]] includes cabinet members from DMK.&lt;ref name=murmaran&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
===Dravidianism and Tamilism===
The principal ideals and goals of Dravidian parties at their incipience, which were borrowed from Dravidar Kazhagam, were social reforms such as ending religious beliefs, ending [[caste]] distinction,&lt;ref name=sarah/&gt; empowerment of women, ending Brahmin dominance&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt;&lt;ref name=sarah/&gt; in Tamil Nadu educational institutions and government, ending northern domination of the politics and economy of Tamil Nadu, opposition to Hindi as India's official language, and independence for Dravida Nadu from India.&lt;ref name=Atul/&gt; The call for Dravida Nadu in the initial days during the [[British Raj]] meant a &quot;Dravidian state under the British Raj&quot;.&lt;ref name=Atul&gt;

  | isbn = 0521805309}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although Annadurai defended his party's demand for Dravida Nadu in his maiden speech in the [[Rajya Sabha]] in 1962 and recorded his protest against a ban on demanding separation, a year later the demand had to be abandoned following the [[Sino-Indian War]].&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; This paradigm shift is often attributed to the ''Sixteenth Amendment to the [[Indian Constitution]]'' or ''Anti-sectionist'' amendment, as it is usually called.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave1/&gt; In the 1960s, the formation of Tamil Nadu as a Tamil language state carved out of the erstwhile Madras Presidency fulfilled the goal of an encompassing Dravidian state.&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt; 
Since then, state [[autonomy]] and social justice through [[reservation in India|reservation]] for the underprivileged in education and employment have been the main political planks of the DMK.&lt;ref name=frontline3/&gt; 
The Dravidian political ideology has evolved through the years and is now varied between parties. 
Starting from an initial atheistic inclination with the strict [[Anti-Brahminism|anti-Brahmin]] outlook of the DK, the DMK moved on to a strong ethnic identity - initially that of &quot;the Dravidian&quot; and later of &quot;the Tamilian&quot; or &quot;the common Tamil man&quot;.&lt;ref name=frontline2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
In fact it is considered that Dravidian politics developed into an inclusive [[Tamil nationalism]] since it associated the [[Dravidian people|Dravidian community]] with the non-[[Sanskrit]]ic Tamil language and cultural tradition.&lt;ref name=Hasan/&gt; 
With the rise of AIADMK in 1977, Tamil Nadu witnessed two Chief Ministers (MGR and Jayalalitha) who were not Tamils themselves.&lt;ref name=frontline2/&gt;

===Leftist inclination===
The Self-respect movement, which is at the root of Dravidian politics, was initially forged in the mid-1920s in emulation and in critique of the [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhian]] Congress Party, but by the 1930s it was heavily influenced by [[Leninist]] [[socialism]], [[atheism]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s inspired rationalism.&lt;ref name=sarah&gt;

==Political use of media==
[[Image:J. Jayalalithaa (old).jpg|thumb|[[J.Jayalalitha]], the leader of present ruling government in [[Tamil Nadu]] was once a famous film actor during 60's and 70's]]
Mass media have been widely used by Dravidian politicians from the early days of the parties. Initially propaganda was spread through newspapers owned by benefactors or by the organisations themselves and through public gatherings.&lt;ref name=sarah/&gt; One early example of media use was the magazine [[Justice (magazine)|Justice]], which carried strong non-Brahmin viewpoints, after which the [[Indian Justice Party]] was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Tamil cinema and politics===
{{main|Tamil cinema and Dravidian politics}}
[[Tamil cinema]] first became politicized during the [[Non-cooperation movement]]. With the advent of sound in films, large numbers of theater personnel were attracted, many of whom were already active in politics.&lt;ref name=Dickey/&gt; 
Annadurai was a writer, director, and producer of many films that were used as a means of propagation of Dravidian ideologies.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave1/&gt; 
[[Sivaji Ganesan]] was a member of DK but later moved to DMK as one of its founding members. Nevertheless, he was expelled from the DMK following his comments on the party being a &quot;glamour party&quot;, a reaction which is attributed to his frustration over lack of recognition.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave1/&gt; 
M. G. Ramachandran was reputedly the most famous star of any Dravidian party.&lt;ref name=Dickey&gt;

Former Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu [[Janaki Ramachandran]] and [[J. Jayalalitha]] were both film stars who paired with MGR in many of his movies. Other stars within the Dravidian parties include [[S. S. Rajendran]] and [[K. R. Ramaswamy]].&lt;ref name=Hardgrave1/&gt;

===Television===
DMK initially used [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]] Network for its propaganda until the family feud within Karunanidhi's family, which eventually led to the birth of the alternate Tamil Channel [[Kalaignar TV]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Impact==

One of the major impacts of the Dravidian parties is said to be the lack of or limited support to the [[Hindutva]] movement, which swept the [[Hindi belt|Hindi heartlands]] of India, in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;

The announcement in 1990 by the then Prime Minister [[V.P. Singh]] that the [[Mandal Commission]]'s recommendation to extend [[Reservation in India|reservation]] in employment in the Union government to the Other Backward Classes would be implemented was &quot;in accordance with the resolution to that effect, passed in the State Assembly&quot; is claimed by DMK to be one of its achievements.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt; 
Listing the benefits accruing to the State from sharing power at the Centre, the DMK stated that &quot;the presence of the DMK Minister (Murasoli Maran) in the National Front Cabinet and the resolution passed in the (Tamil Nadu) Assembly during the DMK regime (1996-2001) resulted in a Tribunal being appointed to adjudicate the [[Kaveri River Water Dispute]] in the case filed by the [[Thanjavur]] farmers in the Supreme Court&quot;. The success of the efforts of Prime Minister Vajpayee in persuading [[Karnataka]] to accept the Tribunal's Interim Award ensuring 205 [[Tmcft|tmc.ft.]] of [[Kaveri river|Kaveri river water]] to Tamil Nadu has been seen as one of the benefits of the DMK's presence in the BJP-led government.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt; 

According to the DMK, the &quot;creation&quot; of 11 [[Navratna|Navaratnas]] and 97 [[Mini-Ratnas]] companies in the public sector, ([[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] companies which invest 30 per cent of their surplus funds in public sector mutual funds) &quot;with administrative and financial autonomy&quot;, during the United Front government at the Centre (1996â98) was because of the party's presence in the Cabinet.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt; 
Another benefit cited by DMK is the substantial profits the State has received from foreign investments since the start of the liberalisation process. According to a party statement, of the total investment of [[Rupee|Rs]].13,150,170 millions that has flowed into the country since liberalisation began, Tamil Nadu has received 1,511,870 millions, which is 11.5 per cent of the total investment in the country.&lt;ref name=frontline1/&gt; 
It is often stated by the DMK and its sympathisers that DMK chief Karunanidhi played a vital role in the then central government declaring [[Tamil language|Tamil]] a [[classical language]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Flags==
Each Dravidian party is represented by its own flag. Black and Red are the usual colours used, a feature which traces its origin to Periyar's visit to [[Axis powers|Axis countries]] and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. On his arrival back home, he declared that his party members would wear black shirts whenever and wherever possible ''as a symbol of the present down-trodden condition of Dravidians''.&lt;ref name=Hardgrave1/&gt; The design of the DMK flag consists of two colour rectangles, with the top half black and the bottom half red. The black color reflects the dark political, economical and social situation of Dravidians. Red is used to signify &quot;rising sunlight&quot; that removes the darkness. The red rises from the bottom and is expected to slowly remove all the darkness. Years later, when DMK contested elections, it would take the &quot;rising sun&quot; as the party symbol.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; AIADMK uses the black and red combination with a picture of Annadurai in white in the middle and hence it is sometimes characterised as being a tricoloured flag: black and red with white in the middle.&lt;ref name=flag&gt;
