'''Jack Roosevelt''' &quot;'''Jackie'''&quot; '''Robinson''' (January 31, 1919&amp;nbsp;â October 24, 1972) was the first [[African American|black]] [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) player of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson broke the [[baseball color line]] when he debuted with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947. As the first black man to play in the major leagues since the 1880s, he was instrumental in bringing an end to [[racial segregation]] in professional baseball, which had relegated black players to the [[Negro leagues]] for six decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loewen&quot;/&gt; The example of his character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=World &amp; I |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=257â273 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2003/march/mtpub.asp |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson: precursors of the civil rights movement |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last=Glasser |first=Ira }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OneMeeting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MLB.com |url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&amp;content_id=2529821 |title=One meeting, two men, a changed world |first=Justice B. |last=Hill |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=September 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his cultural impact, Robinson had an exceptional baseball career. Over ten seasons, he played in six [[World Series]] and contributed to the Dodgers' [[1955 World Series|1955 World Championship]]. He was selected for six consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] from 1949 to 1954,&lt;ref name=&quot;BRef.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinja02.shtml |title=Jackie Robinson statistics and history |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the recipient of the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|MLB Rookie of the Year Award]] in 1947, and won the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] in 1949âthe first black player so honored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nemec|Nemec &amp; Flatow]], p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1962|1962]]. In 1997, Major League Baseball [[Uniform number (Major League Baseball)#Retirement of numbers|retired]] his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams.

Robinson was also known for his pursuits outside the baseball diamond. He was the first black television analyst in Major League Baseball, and the first black vice-president of a major American corporation. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in [[Harlem]], New York. In recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

== Early life ==
Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] in [[Cairo, Georgia]], during a [[Spanish flu]] and [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]]. He was the youngest of five children, after siblings Edgar, Frank, [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Matthew (nicknamed &quot;Mack&quot;)]], and Willa Mae.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bigelow&quot;&gt;[[#Bigelow|Bigelow]], p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; His middle name was in honor of former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who died twenty-five days before Robinson was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/kids/dreamteam/jackierobinson.html |title=White House dream team: Jackie Roosevelt Robinson |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |date=January 20, 2002 |publisher=Whitehousekids.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 15â18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |accessdate=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinsonp9&quot;&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs to support the family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p17&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 33â35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eigp10&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Muir High School ===
In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at [[John Muir High School (Pasadena, California)|John Muir High School]] (Muir Tech).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics|silver medalist]] at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]])&lt;ref name=Eigp10/&gt; and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Jackie-Robinson-9460813?print |title=Jackie Robinson biography |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=The Biography Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20/&gt; At Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the [[varsity team|varsity level]] and [[Letterman (sports)|lettered]] in four of them: [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinsonp9&quot;/&gt; He played [[shortstop]] and [[catcher]] on the baseball team, [[quarterback]] on the football team, and [[Shooting guard|guard]] on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the [[long jump|broad jump]]. He was also a member of the [[tennis]] team.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 36â37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famers]] [[Ted Williams]] and [[Bob Lemon]].&lt;ref name=Rampp37&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In late January 1937, the ''[[Pasadena Star-News]]'' newspaper reported that Robinson &quot;for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pasadena Junior College ===
After Muir, Robinson attended [[Pasadena City College|Pasadena Junior College]] (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 40â41.&lt;/ref&gt; On the football team, he played quarterback and [[Safety (American football position)|safety]]. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad jump records held by his brother Mack.&lt;ref name=Robinsonp9/&gt; As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white.&lt;ref name=Rampp37/&gt; While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[Media:INTERVIEW Jackie Robinson U.pdf|Sports: Jackie Robinson]] |first=Bob |last=Stone |date=November 23, 1945 |work=[[Yank, the Army Weekly]] |volume=4 |issue=23 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Robinson was one of ten students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger (''Omicron Mu Delta''), awarded to students performing &quot;outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 59â60.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racistâa character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linge, p. 18&quot;&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incidentâalong with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and policeâgave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 50â51.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UCLA and afterward ===

After graduating from PJC in spring 1939,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson transferred to UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win [[varsity letter]]s in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memory1940/&gt; He was one of four black players on the 1939 [[UCLA Bruins football]] team; the others were [[Woody Strode]], [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]], and Ray Bartlett.

While a senior at UCLA, Robinson met his future wife, [[Rachel Robinson|Rachel Isum]], a UCLA freshman who was familiar with Robinson's athletic career at PJC.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], pp. 10â11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring semester of 1941, despite his mother's and Isum's reservations, Robinson left college just shy of graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Sources point to various reasons for Robinson's departure from UCLA. Family sources cite financial concerns. {{cite web |url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |accessdate=April 9, 2009}} In addition, Robinson himself cited his growing disillusionment about the value of a college degree for a black man of his era. [[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 11. Other sources suggest that Robinson was uninterested in academics, and behind on class work at the time he left UCLA. [[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 45; [[#Eig|Eig]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government's [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA) in [[Atascadero, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale Group&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/robinson_j.htm |title=Black History Biographies Jackie Robinson |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |publisher=[[Gale (Cengage)|Gale Cengage Learning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinsonp12&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the government ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to [[Honolulu]] in fall 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu Bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale Group&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinsonp12/&gt; After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] of the [[Pacific Coast Football League]].&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/09-03-295.pdf |first=Bob |last=Gill |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |journal=The Coffin Corner |title=Jackie Robinson: Pro Football Prelude |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=1â2 |format=PDF |year=1987  |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, however, the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] had taken place, drawing the United States into [[World War II]] and ending Robinson's nascent football career.&lt;ref name = Gale_Group/&gt;

== Military career ==

In 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]]. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race-neutral, practically speaking few black applicants were admitted into OCS  until after subsequent directives by Army leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=G.P.O. |isbn=1153755394 |title=Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-65 |last=MacGregor |first=Morris J. |year=1981 |location=Washington, D.C. |footnote=94 |chapter=Chapter 2: World War II: The Army |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-02.htm |id=n. 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months.&lt;ref name=Robinsonp13&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After protests by heavyweight boxing champion [[Joe Louis]] (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of [[Truman Gibson]] (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/text/gibson.html |title=Library of Congress: Truman K.

In early 1945, while Robinson was at Sam Huston College, the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues.&lt;ref name=enders/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson accepted a contract for $400 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400|1945}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) per month, a boon for him at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale_Group&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he played well for the Monarchs, Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues' disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tygiel|Tygiel]], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The hectic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom he could now only communicate by letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Robinson played 47 games at [[shortstop]] for the Monarchs, hitting .387 with five home runs, and registering 13 stolen bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lester |first=Larry |coauthors=Sammy J. Miller |title=Black Baseball in Kansas City |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2000 |page=55 |isbn=9780738508429}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the 1945 Negro League All-Star Game, going hitless in five at-bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lester |first=Larry |title=Black Baseball's National Showcase: The East-West All-Star Game, 1933-1953 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |page=457 |isbn=9780803280007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the season, Robinson pursued potential major league interest. The [[Boston Red Sox]] held a tryout at [[Fenway Park]] for Robinson and other black players on April 16.&lt;ref name=Bryantp31&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simon|Simon]], pp. 46â47.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets.&lt;ref name=Npr2002&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/oct/redsox/ | title = The Boston Red Sox and Racism with New Owners, Team Confronts Legacy of Intolerance |publisher=National Public Radio |year=2002

Other teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, [[Branch Rickey]], club president and [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players, and interviewed Robinson for possible assignment to Brooklyn's [[International League]] [[Farm team#Baseball|farm club]], the [[Montreal Royals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/general/povich/launch/jackier.htm |title=The Ball Stayed White, but the Game Did Not |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |last=Povich |first=Shirley |date=March 28, 1997 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneMeeting&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016431.html |title=Jackie changed face of sports |accessdate=September 25, 2009 |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |year=2007 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrilyâa concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale_Group&quot;/&gt; Robinson was aghast: &quot;Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?&quot;&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinsonp33/&gt; Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player &quot;with guts enough not to fight back.&quot;&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinsonp33&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600|1945}}}} today.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinsonp34&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he required Robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 127â128.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale_Group&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinsonp34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, with representatives of the Royals and Dodgers present, Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In what was later referred to as &quot;The Noble Experiment&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale_Group&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tygiel|Tygiel]], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s.&lt;ref name=Pennington&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/27/sports/27hall.html |title=Breaking a barrier 60 years before Robinson |last=Pennington |first=Bill |work=New York Times |date=July 27, 2006 |accessdate=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robinson was not necessarily the best player in the Negro leagues,&lt;ref name=&quot;Satch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|first=Mark |title=Don't look back: Satchel Paige in the shadows of baseball|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2000|page=313|isbn=9780306809637}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and black talents [[Satchel Paige]] and [[Josh Gibson]] were upset when Robinson was selected first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satch2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Paige|first=Satchel |coauthors=David Lipman|title=Maybe I'll pitch forever: a great baseball player tells the hilarious story behind the legend|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=1993|pages=xi, xii|isbn=9780803287327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickey's offer allowed Robinson to leave the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides behind, and he went home to Pasadena.
That September, he signed with [[Chet Brewer]]'s Kansas City Royals, a post-season [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] team in the [[California Winter League]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tygiel2|Tygiel (2002)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that off-season, he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team, while his fiancÃ©e Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 1946, Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend, Rev.

=== Minor leagues ===
In 1946, Robinson arrived at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], for [[spring training]] with the [[Montreal Royals]] of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]] [[International League]] (the designation of &quot;AAA&quot; for the highest level of [[minor league baseball]] was first used in the {{by|1946}} season). Robinson's presence was controversial in racially charged Florida. As he was not allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel, he lodged instead at the home of a local black politician.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled spring training compound in [[Vero Beach]] known as &quot;[[Dodgertown]]&quot; did not open until spring 1948),&lt;ref&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], pp. 358â359.&lt;/ref&gt; scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or [[Johnny Wright (baseball player)|Johnny Wright]], another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization in January. In [[Sanford, Florida]], the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], pp. 42â43.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the [[J.

After much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself, the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers.

On April 18, 1946, [[Roosevelt Stadium]] hosted the [[Jersey City Giants]]' season opener against the [[Montreal Royals]], marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie Robinson. In his five trips to the plate, Robinson had four hits, including a three-run home run. He also scored four runs, drove in three, and stole two bases in the Royals' 14â1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;Tygiel (1983), pp. 3, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Robinson proceeded to lead the International League that season with a .349 batting average and .985 [[fielding percentage]],&lt;ref name=&quot;biography.com&quot;/&gt; and he was named the league's Most Valuable Player.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simon|Simon]], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he often faced hostility while on road trips (the Royals were forced to cancel a [[Southern United States|Southern]] exhibition tour, for example),&lt;ref name=time/&gt; the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US to honor Robinson's Montreal home|date=February 27, 2011|publisher=Associated Press|work=FOXSports.com|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/United-States-to-honor-Jackie-Robinsons-Montreal-apartment-022711|accessdate=2011-02-27|quote=... the apartment the couple called home in the summer of 1946.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether fans supported or opposed it, Robinson's presence on the field was a boon to attendance; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson in 1946, an amazing figure by International League standards.&lt;ref name=SABRbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=2379&amp;pid=12074 |title=SABR Biography of Jackie Robinson |publisher=Society for American Baseball Research |accessdate=May 27, 2009 |first=Rick |last=Swaine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1946, following the baseball season, Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the short-lived Los Angeles Red Devils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tygiel|Tygiel]], pp. 163â164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 158â159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major leagues ===
==== Breaking the color barrier (1947) ====

The following year, six days before the start of the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. With [[Eddie Stanky]] entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a [[first baseman]].&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at [[Ebbets Field]] before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons.&lt;ref name=McNeil357/&gt; Although he failed to get a base hit, the Dodgers won 5â3.&lt;ref name=McNeil357&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Ethnicity and Sports in the United States|author=Kirsch, George B., Othello Harris, and Claire Elaine Nolte, eds.|year=2000 |isbn=0313299110 |publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT |pages=12, 336|chapter=The Right to Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satch2&quot;/&gt;

Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.&lt;ref name=SABRbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a general survey of the media reaction to Robinson at various phases of his career, ''see'' [http://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/jackie/proball.html www.umass.edu] and subpages. Retrieved on July 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, racial tension existed in the Dodger clubhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jackie-robinson-breaks-color-barrier |title=Jackie Robinson breaks major league color barrier |accessdate=October 21, 20011 |publisher=[[History (TV channel)|History Channel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed the team, &quot;I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was also derided by opposing teams. Some, notably the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], threatened to [[Strike action|strike]] if Robinson played. After the threat, National League President [[Ford Frick]] and [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Happy Chandler]] let it be known that any striking players would be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_jackie.html |title=Jackie Robinson integrates Baseball |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last=Wormser |first=Richard |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Phillies players called Robinson a &quot;[[nigger]]&quot; from their [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and yelled that he should &quot;go back to the cotton fields&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ken Burns|Burns, Ken]] (writer and director) |date=1994 |title=[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]], Part 6 |medium=Television production |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |time=minute 120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickey later recalled that Phillies manager [[Ben Chapman (baseball player)|Ben Chapman]] &quot;did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers. When he poured out that string of unconscionable abuse, he solidified and united thirty men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Burns, Ken (writer and director) |date=1994 |title=[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]], Part 6 |medium=Television production |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |time=minute 122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players. Dodgers teammate [[Pee Wee Reese]] once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, &quot;You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&amp;content_id=1895445&amp;vkey=perspectives&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=1947: A time for change |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |last=Newman |first=Mark |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=MLB.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Reese put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-04-24/news/debunkers-strike-out/ |title=Debunkers Strike Out |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Barra |first=Allen |date=April 24, 2007 |work=[[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at [[KeySpan Park]] on November 1, 2005, commemorates this event by representing Reese with his arm around Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From Clay to Bronze to the Hall |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |date=June 1, 2008 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/sports/baseball/01oneil.html |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish]] baseball star [[Hank Greenberg]], who had to deal with racial epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. After colliding with Robinson at first base on one occasion, Greenberg whispered a few words into Robinson's ear, which Robinson later characterized as &quot;words of encouragement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg&quot;/&gt; Greenberg had advised him that the best way to combat the slurs from the opposing players was to beat them on the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/01/12/2000-01-12__greenberg__a_home_run.html |title='Greenberg' A Home Run |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |last=Mathews |first=Jack |date=January 12, 2000 |work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the [[Dodgers]], with a [[batting average]] of .297, an [[on-base percentage]] of .383, and a .427 [[slugging percentage]].  He had 175 hits (scoring 125 runs) including 31 doubles, 5 triples, 12 home runs, driving in 48 runs for the year. Robinson led the league in [[sacrifice hits]], with 28, and in [[stolen bases]], with 29.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural Major League Baseball [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] (separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/awards/mlb_awards_content.jsp?content=roy_history |title=Rookies of the Year |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Stanky's trade to the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 [[fielding percentage]] that year (second in the [[National League]] at the position, fractionally behind Stanky).&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeil94&quot;&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/historical/individual_stats_player.jsp?c_id=mlb&amp;playerID=121314 |title=Historical Player Stats |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 12â7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29, {{by|1948}}, he [[Hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]]âa [[home run]], a [[triple (baseball)|triple]], a [[double (baseball)|double]], and a [[single (baseball)|single]] in the same game.&lt;ref name=&quot;lester&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://larrylester42.com/my-hero/ |title=My Hero&amp;nbsp;â Jackie Robinson |accessdate=October 30, 2008 |last=Lester |first=Larry |year=2007 |publisher=LarryLester42.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the [[1948 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman |location=Lincoln |last=Lowenfish |first=Lee |year=2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0803211031 |chapter=A Year of Disappointment, Odd Choices, and an Adieu to Leo |page=461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players entered the major leagues. [[Larry Doby]] (who broke the color barrier in the [[American League]] on July 5, 1947) and [[Satchel Paige]] played for the [[Cleveland Indians]], and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeil94&quot;/&gt; In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12500|1948}}}} today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a [[vaudeville]] tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions, and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp {{Convert|30|lb|kg}} overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], pp. 71â72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer [[George Sisler]], working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field.&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball.&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; Robinson also noted that &quot;Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.&lt;ref name=Sizzler&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sizzler: George Sisler, Baseball's Forgotten Great |last=Huhn |first=Rick |year=2004 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |isbn=0826215556 |chapter=Full circle |page=260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 [[Run batted in|runs batted in]] with 122 runs scored.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; For the performance Robinson earned the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] award for the National League.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]âthe first All-Star Game to include black players.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Robinson, the 1949 All-Star game featured [[Larry Doby]], [[Roy Campanella]], and [[Don Newcombe]].

That year, a song about Robinson by [[Buddy Johnson]], &quot;Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?&quot;, reached number&amp;nbsp;13 on the charts; [[Count Basie]] recorded a famous version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/music.html |title=Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball? |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |publisher=Library of Congress }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Dodgers won the National League pennant, but lost in five games to the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1949 World Series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeil94&quot;/&gt;

Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was called to testify before the [[United States House of Representatives]]' [[House Committee on Un-American Activities|Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor [[Paul Robeson]]. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paul Robeson |last=Duberman |first=Martin |year=1989 |isbn=9780394527802 |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |pages=361â362 |chapter=The Right to Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Robinson led the National League in [[double play]]s made by a second baseman with 133.&lt;ref name=&quot;lester&quot;/&gt; His salary that year was the highest any Dodger had been paid to that point: $35,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jackie Robinson Breaks the Color Line |last=Santella |first=Andrew |year=1996 |publisher=Children's Press |isbn=0516066374 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1950}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). He finished the year with 99 runs scored, a .328 batting average, and 12 stolen bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; The year saw the release of a film biography of Robinson's life, ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]'', in which Robinson played himself,&lt;ref name=&quot;LIFE1950&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |work=Life Magazine |url=http://www.life.com/image/74168523/in-gallery/23148/jackie-robinson-american-pioneer |date=May 8, 1950 |title=Jackie Robinson Star Ballplayer Stars in a Movie |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actress [[Ruby Dee]] played Rachael &quot;Rae&quot; (Isum) Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies &amp; Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Films |last=Bogle |first=Donald |year=2001 |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Continuum |isbn=082641267X |chapter=Black Odds and Ends |pages=184â185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project had been previously delayed when the film's producers refused to accede to demands of two Hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of Robinson being tutored in baseball by a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies &amp; Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Films |last=Bogle |first=Donald |year=2001 |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Continuum |isbn=082641267X |chapter=Black Odds and Ends |page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Robinson, &quot;doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies &amp; Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Films |last=Bogle |first=Donald |year=2001 |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Continuum |isbn=082641267X |chapter=Black Odds and Ends |page=185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner [[Walter O'Malley]], who referred to Robinson as &quot;Rickey's [[prima donna]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stout|Stout]], p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired.

Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, &quot;Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Long|Long]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Jackie |year=1950 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jaraglet.html |title=Letter to Branch Rickey |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pennant races and outside interests (1951â1953) ====

Before the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career. O'Malley was quoted in the ''Montreal Standard'' as saying, &quot;Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post&quot;âalthough reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robinson Linked to Montreal Job |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press |date=March 25, 1951 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TAMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cE0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3670,3811383&amp;hl=en |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robinson Offered Managerial Berth |date=March 25, 1951 |page=27 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HUUuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PtoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5339,1955903&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137.&lt;ref name=&quot;lester&quot;/&gt; He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant.  During the last game of the season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th.  This forced a playoff against the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], which the Dodgers lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitker|first=Steve|title=The Original San Francisco Giants: The Giants of '58|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2001|page=196|isbn=9781582613352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Robinson's regular-season heroics, the Dodgers lost the pennant on [[Bobby Thomson]]'s famous home run, known as the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]], on October 3, 1951. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers sportscaster [[Vin Scully]] later noted that the incident showed &quot;how much of a competitor Robinson was.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Impact&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlb/y2007/m04/d12/c1895331.jsp |title=Robinson made impact on field, too |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Bloom |first=Barry |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 106 runs scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;

Robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=[[#Dorinson|Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream]] |page=154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the year with 104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; He did, however, record a career-high [[on-base percentage]] of .436.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before, winning the National League pennant before losing the [[1952 World Series]] to the New York Yankees in seven games. That year, on the television show ''Youth Wants to Know,'' Robinson challenged the Yankees' general manager, [[George Weiss (baseball)|George Weiss]], on the racial record of his team, which had yet to sign a black player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/13/1997-04-13_the_legacy__race_through_time.html |title=The Legacy of Race Through Time |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |date=April 13, 1997 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sportswriter [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], whom Robinson had described as a &quot;bigot&quot;, said, &quot;If there was one flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, shortstop, and in the [[outfielder|outfield]], with [[Jim Gilliam]], another black player, taking over everyday second base duties.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Robinson's interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the [[Puerto Rico Baseball League|Puerto Rican Winter League]], but according to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tygiel 2002, p. 34&quot;&gt;[[#Tygiel2|Tygiel (2002)]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals,&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another [[1953 World Series|World Series]] loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson's continued success spawned a string of death threats.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Long|Long]], pp. 10â11.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not dissuaded, however, from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor for ''Our Sports'' magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson's old friend [[Joe Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//collections/jr/history.html |title=Jackie Robinson and baseball highlights, 1860sâ1960s |accessdate=September 13, 2009 |date=September 26, 2002 |publisher=Library of Congress }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jr1947.html |title=Robinson as a Dodger: 1947â1956 |work=Baseball, the Color Line, and Jackie Robinson |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the five-star [[Chase Park Plaza Hotel|Chase Park Hotel]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What I Learned from Jackie Robinson: A Teammate's Reflections On and Off the Field |author=Erskine, Carl with Burton Rocks |chapter=Wait Till Next Year |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0071450858 |pages=61â74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World Championship and retirement (1954â1956) ====
In 1954, Robinson had 62 runs, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lester&quot;/&gt; The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the [[1955 World Series]]. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a [[third baseman]], both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson, then 37 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Impact&quot;/&gt; Robinson missed the game because manager [[Walter Alston]] decided to play Gilliam at second and [[Don Hoak]] at third base. That season, the Dodgers' [[Don Newcombe]] became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nemec|Nemec &amp; Flatow]], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Robinson had 61 runs, a .275 batting average, and 12 steals.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of [[diabetes]], and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tygiel 2002, p. 34&quot;/&gt; After the season, Robinson was traded by the Dodgers to the arch-rival [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] for [[Dick Littlefield]] and $35,000 cash (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1956}}}} today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of [[Chock full o'Nuts]] to quit baseball and become an executive with the company.&lt;ref name=Lingep114&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'']] magazine two years previously,&lt;ref name=Lingep114/&gt; his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.&lt;ref name=mlb.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070603&amp;content_id=2003372&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Jackie Robinson: Gone but not forgotten |accessdate=October 11, 2008 |last=Bloom |first=Barry |date=June 4, 2007 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration of to the North, where their political clout grew, and [[Harry Truman|President Harry Truman]]'s [[Military history of African Americans|desegregation of the military]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/17/opinion/better-late-than-never.html|title=Better Late Than Never|last=Klarman|first=Michael J. |date=May 17, 2004|work=New York Times|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter.

Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sports 20000&quot;/&gt; During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRef.com&quot;/&gt;  In 1999, he was posthumously named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp?story=2|title=The All-Century Team|year=1999|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the postâ&quot;long ball&quot; era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=[[#Dorinson|Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream]] |pages=151â152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially more [[base on balls|walks]] than [[strikeout]]s (740 to 291).&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sports 20000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/170132.html |title=The No. 1 Most Significant Development in the 20th Century |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |last=Kindred |first=Dave |month=July | year=1999 |work=[[The Sporting News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1783632 |title=Remembering Jackie Robinson |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |last=Simon |first=Mark |date= |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947â56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 ([[Minnie MiÃ±oso]] was the other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/04/19/SP68618.DTL |title=By The Numbers -- Robinson Was All-Around Player |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Camps |first=Mark |date=April 7, 1997 |accessdate=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total,&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; including 19 steals of home.

At the November 2006 groundbreaking for a new ballpark for the New York Mets, [[Citi Field]], it was announced that the main entrance, modeled on the one in Brooklyn's old [[Ebbets Field]], would be called the [[Citi Field#Jackie Robinson Rotunda|Jackie Robinson Rotunda]]. The rotunda was dedicated at the opening of Citi Field on April 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4072441 |title=Jackie Robinson Rotunda dedicated at Citi Field |date=April 16, 2009 |publisher=Associated Press  |accessdate=May 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It honors Robinson with large quotations spanning the inner curve of the facade and features a large freestanding statue of his number, 42, which has become an attraction in itself. Mets owner [[Fred Wilpon]] announced that, in conjunction with [[Citigroup]] and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, the Mets will create a Jackie Robinson Museum and Learning Center, located at the headquarters of the Jackie Robinson Foundation at One Hudson Square in [[lower Manhattan]]. The main purpose of the museum will be to fund scholarships for &quot;young people who live by and embody Jackie's ideals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2006/11/14/2006-11-14_mets_honor_robinson_at_new_h.html |title= Mets honor Robinson at new home |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080304&amp;content_id=2403980&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Plans Unveiled for Robinson Museum |date=March 4, 2008 |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Spencer|last=Fordin|title=Museum in NY to tell Jackie's story|date=April 13, 2011|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.|work=MLB.com|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110413&amp;content_id=17745294&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson has also been recognized outside of baseball.

In a letter read during the ceremony, Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, wrote: &quot;I remember [[Montreal]] and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great city. Before Jack and I moved to Montreal, we had just been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida.

&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; The [[sacrifice fly]] (SF) as a unique statistical category did not exist in Major League Baseball from 1940 through 1953. Any pre-1954 sacrifice flies by Robinson would be reflected in the [[sacrifice bunt|sacrifice hit]] (SH) category.

&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, the [[intentional base on balls|intentional walk]] (IBB) category only became a unique statistic beginning in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/touchingbase/2008/08/walk-this-way-intentional-pass.html |work=[[New York Daily News]] |title=Walk this way: Intentional pass with bags packed works |last=Spector |first=Jesse |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any intentional walks issued to Robinson before that year would be reflected in the [[bases on balls|walk]] (BB) category.
