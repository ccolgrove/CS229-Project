'''''The Sims 3''''' is a 2009 [[strategy game|strategic]] [[life simulation game|life simulation]] [[computer game]] developed by [[The Sims Studio]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is the [[sequel]] to the [[List of best-selling video games#PC|best-selling computer game]], ''[[The Sims 2]]''. It was first released on June 2, 2009 simultaneously for [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''The Sims 3'' was released to [[Video game console|home consoles]] on October 26, 2010, for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[iOS]] and [[Nintendo DS]] and later the [[Wii]] platform on November 15, 2010. There is also a [[Nintendo 3DS]] version, released on March 27, 2011, as one of its launch titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ds.ign.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Reilly, Jim |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/109/1097918p1.html |title=E3 2010: Big List of 3DS Games - DS News at IGN |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been released for mobile phone platforms, and a simpler version for mobiles with Java.

==Gameplay==
''The Sims 3'' is built upon the same concept as its predecessors. Players control their own Sims in activities and relationships in a similar manner to real life.  The game play is open-ended and indefinite. Sim houses and neighborhoods are entirely in one continuous map. The developers stated, &quot;What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within.&quot; One of the biggest changes to the franchise is the use of rabbit-holes.  Your sim isn't allowed to go inside the majority of city buildings; instead, they simply disappear inside for a certain amount of time--a feature known in video games as a rabbit-hole--while you are given very basic choices on what happens inside without actually seeing it.  This was a rather large step backwards for The Sims franchise, as the previous installments had many fun and exciting locales in which your sims could cavort.  For example, instead of walking your sim and her date inside a restaurant and watching the waiter serve them dinner as they nuzzle each other at the table, as you could in The Sims 2, you now wait outside while getting little text alerts about your sim's activities.  This lack of interaction with the city has led many critics to wonder why such emphasis was put on walking around town when there's hardly anything for your sim to really do.  

The game includes an optional feature called &quot;Story Progression&quot;, which allows all Sims in the neighborhood to autonomously continue as if the player were controlling them, such as grow up, get married, get jobs and promotions, have children, build or buy their dream house while the player isn't playing.

''[[The Sims 2]]'' used a reward system called Wants and Fears. This is replaced with a new system called Wishes in ''The Sims 3''. Fulfilling a Sim's wish contributes to the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score and mood. Some wishes, such as &quot;Go to the Park&quot;, may add little points to their lifetime happiness while &quot;Have A Baby Boy&quot; may add thousands of points. In ''The Sims 2'', Wants and Fears also contributed to a Sim's &quot;Aspiration&quot; meter, roughly analogous to current [[self-esteem]].  In ''The Sims 3'', Aspiration is removed entirely, replaced with &quot;Moodlets&quot;, which contribute positive or negative values to the original Motivation meter. Moodlets can be inspired by physical events, such as having a good meal or comfort from sitting in a good chair, as well as emotional events like a first kiss or a break-up. Most moodlets last for a set duration, but some negative Moodlets can be cured (such as the one incurred by an urgent need to urinate) and some positive ones rely on the Sim's surroundings and traits.

Sims live for a set duration of time (adjustable by the player) and advance through several stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder). Sims can die of [[old age]] or they can die prematurely from causes such as fire, starvation, drowning, electrocution, (as of the ''World Adventures'' expansion pack) The [[Mummy]]'s curse, (as of the ''Ambitions'' expansion pack) a meteor, and (as of the ''Late Night'' expansion pack) by thirst (vampires only). One of the major new additions to gameplay is Opportunities, tasks that Sims can complete to earn rewards. These challenges occur randomly based on aspects of each Sim's lifestyle, such as relationships, skills and job. Career opportunities such as working overtime or completing special tasks can yield a pay raise, cash bonus, or relationship boost. Skill opportunities are requests by neighbors or community members for Sims to solve problems using their acquired skills for cash or relationship rewards. If the opportunity is connected to a Sim's school, the reward may be increased school performance.

===Create a Sim===
[[File:Sims3CreateaSim.png|thumb|left|300px|A player editing a Sim in Create a Sim.]]
Create a Sim (CAS) now has more customizable options for Sims than the CAS in ''[[The Sims 2]]''. The player now has a larger selection of body types for Sims, and are able to create different hair styles for every Sim. The player is now able to pick their Sim's shoes.

There are a total of 22 hairstyles for female Sims and 17 hairstyles for male Sims. There are a variety of hats and hair accessories that the player can use, but they all come with set hairstyles. Each of the hats and accessories can also have their colors and textures altered. Hairstyles can be chosen separately for each outfit. Each hairstyle's colour can be customized with one of eight basic colors. but players can customize the hair further by clicking the paintbrush icon. Individual colors for the base, roots, tips and highlights of the Sim's hair can be customised with a color palette and slider. 4 new men hairstyles were added with the ''[[The Sims 3: Pets|Pets]]'' expansion pack, and some men clothes. The Sim's basic hair color can be changed to even unnatural colors, as can the color of the roots, tips, and highlights. There are a variety of preset hairstyles which can be chosen for the Sim, and the colour of the Sim's hair can be chosen or customized. User-made hair colours can be saved onto the bin and used later, and will be used by generated Sims. Hair colors can be shared to the exchange for other players to download and use.

Compared to previous games in the series, a lot more things can be modified. It is possible to just change the nose, for example, and it is possible to use the Advanced Mode to go into more depth (such as to change nostril definition, nose tip scale and bridge height). There are more hairstyles than that in ''The Sims 2'' and ''[[The Sims]]'' core games combined.  The player cannot add layers when customizing clothing, but if the clothes already have layers then the colors and textures for each layer can be altered. The player can also click on any part of the Sim and the Create a Sim tool takes them directly to the right menu for editing whatever is selected. There is an eyelash length slider bar. Socks and shoes are also fully customizable.An interesting edition is the breast, muscle, muscle definition and body weight sliders. These can be fully adjusted to create much more realistic looking Sims. 

The player can choose the Sim's full name, age, gender, skin tone, weight and muscle tone. There are six possible skin tones, but only three of the six are realistic. The other three are green, red, and blue. There is a slider so the player can edit how light or dark the skin tone is. For example, they can make a light green Sim with a dark green mother and a light skinned father. Body modifiers also use sliders that adjust weight from thin to fat and muscle size from flabby to muscular.  In the ''[[The Sims 3: Late Night|Late Night]]'' expansion pack, sliders for muscle definition and breast size were added. Height still cannot be changed, due to conflicts with animation. In ''The Sims 2'', players could only choose between two basic body types: normal and fat. A third body type - Fit - could only be achieved in the game and not on the Create A Sim menu. In ''The Sims 3'', however, body weight is determined by moving a slider left or right. Sims can be extremely skinny or extremely fat. However, toddlers do not have the option to have their weight customized. This can be decreased through gameplay if the Sim uses the Athletic skill and exercises or increased if the Sim eats with the Stuffed mood let.

In the clothing tab, players can choose what their Sims will wear. Five categories include everyday wear, formal wear, sleepwear, athletic wear, and swimwear. Each type of clothes found in each categories include tops, bottoms, full-body outfits, footwear (which players can choose, unlike in ''The Sims'' and ''The Sims 2''), eye wear, earrings, gloves, bracelets, rings and socks. Players can create up to three outfits in all categories. Outfits can be customized during gameplay by clicking on a dresser. The color and pattern of the clothes can be chosen by the player with the Create a Style tool. However toddlers do not have the option to have athletic wear, swimwear and accessories chosen and/or customized. Accessories can also be added and customized also with the Create a Style tool.

Players can choose any of the [[The Sims 3#Traits|traits]] available in the menu. Players can also can choose their Sim's favorite food, music and color. The Sim's voice is customizable as well. Toddlers have one voice slider, children have two voice sliders, and teenagers and older have three voice sliders. They can also pick the Sim's lifetime wish, which is a goal a Sim will be working for all of their lifetime until it is fulfilled. [[Zodiac sign]]s are added in ''Late Night''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edenstyle.it/expansion-packs-late-night/cas-updates-late-night-preview.html CAS updates - Late Night preview]&lt;/ref&gt; and Patch 1.7, which make Sims more friendly with other Sims of compatible signs. Players can also write the biography of their Sims. However, toddlers, children and teenagers don't have the option to have their lifetime wish chosen in CAS, but children and teens will be able to choose it once they are out of CAS.

===Skills===
There are several skill-dependent abilities, such as advanced social interactions available from high charisma, special songs for guitar players and appliance upgrades (self-cleaning, more TV channels, etc.) for high handiness. Painting, writing and guitar are now different skills, instead of the all-encompassing &quot;creativity&quot; skill of ''The Sims'' and ''The Sims 2''. Paintings are now more particular to each Sim, based on their traits. Sims can increase their skills by practising a skill (e.g. playing the guitar, working in the garden, writing a novel, even flirting, etc.), reading a book about the skill, or taking a class in the skill at a civic building. Sims can begin building their skills as early as their toddler days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fierysims3.byethost4.com/3baby.php Child Care]&lt;/ref&gt; While skills do not show up in the meter right away, using skill building objects is rewarded once the toddler grows into a child. Logic can be used to teach children skills that will help them in later life. The skills include Logic, Cooking, Painting, Gardening, Writing, Guitar, Athletic, Handiness, Charisma and Fishing. New skills were later added in expansion packs. When Sims reach level 10 of a skill, they will get a certificate in the mail to display on a wall or sell for 1000 Simoleons.

Players do not see the skill in the Sim panel until the first point is unlocked, then they can view them in a skill journal. Each skill has a tab in the skill journal detailing the level of the skill, statistics, what the challenges are, and sometimes other special information. For example, the athletic skill journal shows the statistics: hours of cardio workout, hours of strength workout, distance jogged. The skill journal is viewed by pressing the 'J' key in-game or selecting the skills tab and clicking the small document that appears at the end of the skill bar after unlocking the first point. Various challenges are also available in the skill journal. For example, in the Painting skill journal, a challenge to paint thirty paintings is available. When completed, the Sim earns a reward of being able to paint significantly faster than normal Sims. There are multiple skill challenges for each and every skill, as well as collections. All of them earn some kind of benefit, such as quicker completion, better results, etc. With ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions]]'', the skill journal also shows hidden skills that a Sim has learned.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width: 12%;height:40px;&quot; | Skill Name
! Description 
! Expansion Pack Required
|-
| Athletic|| In the Athletic skill, Sims can live a longer life. The fittest Sims will outlive the average Sims. The player's characters can learn to train others, and help them to learn the Athletic skill faster. The skill is also used in the professional sports, military, and criminal career tracks.|| None
|-
| Bass, Drums, and Piano || These three new musical instruments come with the Late Night expansion. Combined with the original Guitar skill, Sims can now form a band, play gigs, practice together, and earn money playing at night clubs. || ''[[The Sims 3: Late Night|Late Night]]''
|-
| Charisma || Charisma will help player's Sims to make friends. With the right challenges completed, it can even help them to keep friends forever. Sims with a high level in the Charisma skill will be better at jobs that require on the boss and co-worker relationships. It is also a vital skill in the political career. || None
|-
| Cooking || The cooking skill allows the Sim to prepare food. The skill is augmented by the Natural Cook trait. Perfectionist Sims take longer to cook for better results. Vegetarian Sims learn vegetarian versions of meat dishes. Eco-friendly Sims serve organic dishes. The cooking skill is also an excellent skill for making legendary parties because high quality food makes guests happy. When a Sim is cooking a recipe with a random ingredient, such as pancakes, he/she uses the first ingredient available in his/her inventory. If there's no eligible ingredient, he/she uses the first ingredient in the fridge. The cooking skill is very useful and needed in the culinary career.|| None
|-
| Fishing || The fishing skill is gained by Sims fishing in the ponds or ocean around the map. The higher their skill, the more types of fish they can catch. Books can be found at the book shop showing the bait that can be used to catch specific fish, however a Sim can determine the bait through trial and error by simply selecting a bait and seeing what they catch. Water can be inspected to see what known fish can be caught there, and whether the fish are active. || None
|-
| Gardening || The gardening skill is augmented by the Green Thumb and Loves The Outdoors traits, and the Super Green Thumb lifetime reward. It involves (as with gardening in real life and the previous Sims games) the planting, growing and harvesting of various plants that Sims can find within the game. Unlike the previous Sims games, The Sims 3 gardening has been much expanded upon, introducing many real-life plants and several fictional species such as the 'Life Fruit' and 'Flame Fruit', which are the two most valuable fruits in the game. || None
|-
| Guitar || The guitar skill is gained from playing the guitar. Sims with an instrument skill level 5 or above can learn new songs by buying and reading sheet music from book shop. Sheet music is used up when learned and must be bought again for another Sim to learn it. Songs can not be learned more than once. Two more songs are available from Master Guitarist challenge and Money Maker challenge. || None
|-
| Handiness || The handiness skill is gained from repairing objects. After a certain point, Sims can start upgrading and tinkering with a select number of objects. When objects are upgraded, they work better and need  to be repaired less. The skill is augmented by the Handy trait. || None
|-
| Inventing ||  With the inventing skill, Sims can create either brilliant or destructive gadgets. This skill benefits from the Eccentric trait. There is a new junk yard lot where inventors can collect scrap using detonation packs. Inventive Sims can provide scrap as a medium for Sims developing their sculpting skill. There is a new inventions log that lists all the inventions a Sim has created and the travels they had in the time machine. Inventing will also increase Sim's handiness skill. Players can register as a self-employed inventor if they have at least a skill level in inventing. &lt;br /&gt; Inventor Sims use the Scraptasticâ¢ Workbench to build inventions. While inventing on the workbench, there is a chance that a Sim might accidentally electrocute themselves or cause an explosion that sets them on fire. In addition to working at the Scraptasticâ¢ Workbench, Sims can also raise inventing skill by reading books and detonating objects. Before being able to create an invention at will, a Sim must use the Invent interaction and accidentally stumble upon making the object first. After that, they can reproduce the object at will so long as they have the required amount of scrap metal. || ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions|Ambitions]]''
|-
| Logic || The logic skill is augmented by the Computer Whiz, Genius, and Perceptive traits. With a higher Logic skill, Sims can look through the telescope in many different ways. When using a telescope and Searching the Galaxy, a Sim will sometimes discover a celestial body. It may be a comet, planet, star, moon, galaxy, black hole, neutron or satellite. The player's Sim will earn a small amount of money or up to several thousand (for discovering a black hole) for contributing to the scientific community. Sims may see a meteor fall from the sky and land somewhere in town. Players can use Map View to find the land site and travel there to collect the space rock. There is also a chance that the meteor will fall on them.|| None
|-
| Martial Arts || The martial arts skill allows sims to spar with others. The Disciplined trait increases its learning rate. Sims can train at the Phoenix Academy of Martial Arts in Shang Simla. However, Sims may purchase a training dummy, Board Breaker, and books to train at home. Sims get different color belts at different levels, just as real martial artists do. And apparently Sims are using The Black Tiger-Kung Fu (or in this case Sim Fu) style. || ''[[The Sims 3: World Adventures|World Adventures]]''
|-
| Mixology|| The mixology skill functions somewhat similarly to Nectar Making. Like bouncers, mixologists are randomly chosen at start of game and vary from day to day but they have been seen doing the same job. The mixologists have been seen around town, and most of them are homeless. || ''[[The Sims 3: Late Night|Late Night]]''
|-
| Nectar Making || The nectar making skill can be started by visiting Champs Les Sims. There's an adventure which introduces the player to Nectar Making, but it is also possible to get started right away by purchasing a L'amour des Fruits Nectar Maker at the nectary. The three skill books for Nectar Making from level 1-10 are also available at Circle of Knowledge Book shop in Champs Les Sims. Gardening is a must to make the best nectar since the quality depends heavily on the fruit used as ingredients. || ''[[The Sims 3: World Adventures|World Adventures]]''
|-
| Painting || The painting skill allows Sims to paint art and is augmented by the Artistic trait and Extra Creative lifetime reward. Pictures drawn can be hung, sold or kept in inventory as in The Sims 2. Also note that pictures will appreciate over time. You could see the original price and the appreciated price when the picture is in your inventory. In The Sims 3, certain personalities traits affect how a player's Sim's paintings look. Occasionally, Sims will paint easter eggs such as recreations of famous paintings or the cover of the Maxis game ''Spore''.  || None
|-
| Photography || Sims who take up the Photography skill gain access to an album of themed photo collections, encouraging the player to take Photographs of various events, objects, people and places using a camera. Without a camera, Sims cannot learn the Photography skill. Rare photos are needed to complete the collection, and completing the more difficult collections is no easy task. || ''[[The Sims 3: World Adventures|World Adventures]]''
|-
| Riding || The riding skill is gained from riding horses. Your first riding lesson could also be done at the Equestrian Center for a fee. The higher their skill, the faster you can ride and the more options are available to you when entering Equestrian Competitions. The skill is augmented by the Equestrian trait. || ''[[The Sims 3: Pets|Pets]]''
|-
| Sculpting || The sculpting skill allows Sims to mold items and benefits from the Savvy Sculptor trait. Sims with the Handiness skill improve this skill more rapidly. Sculptors can sculpt with a variety of media, but when they start out, they can only use clay. Once they learn to sculpt with ice, they can use Sims as models.|| ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions|Ambitions]]''
|-
| Writing || The writing skill allows Sims to write novels and get paid.  Sims can only write by using a computer. The skill is augmented by Artistic and Bookworm traits, and Acclaimed Author lifetime reward (Some other traits are also useful for several types of writing). Finished books will be mailed to the Sim after completion free of charge with the exception of articles which simply appear in the Sim's inventory. They can be read just like any other book. The books can also now be found in the library, and be bought from the Bookshop in town. Income is paid once a week on Sunday 12pm for 6 weeks per book. Small payments are also received for every 20% of the book completed. If the author dies, payments will stop for any books they have written.  || None

===Careers===
Many of the careers from ''[[The Sims 2]]'', such as the Law Enforcement and Athletic tracks, are in ''The Sims 3''. Of course, there are also some new ones. Sims can look for these jobs in the newspaper or apply right at the building where theyâd like to work. (Every career has a building in the neighbourhood.) Sims are also able to make a living at home selling paintings, writing novels, or growing fruit and vegetables these jobs including nectar making can become a profession with the Sims 3 Ambitions. To get some extra cash on the side if the Sim also has some cash to spare, they can [[investment|buy out businesses]] and receive a percentage of the profits they earn. If Sims are less inclined towards pursuing a full-time career or if they need more time during the day, they can get [[part-time job]]s at certain career locations within the town. Part-time jobs have a lower pay than full-time jobs and do not give career [[The Sims 3#Opportunities|opportunities]]. Part-time jobs are also available for teen Sims.

Advancing in a career still depends on mood and skills, but also relationships with colleagues/boss and even certain goals that have to be fulfilled. The player can decide how hard they work while on the job. The option to work hard will increase the Sim's performance faster at the expense of their mood. Taking work home, schmoozing the boss, reading medical journals, or completing [[opportunities]] also have an impact on a Sim's job performance. [[Chance cards]] and at-work events can still cause the Sim to lose their job, but may actually help them get a better job in another career track. Reaching the top of a career doesn't mean they're done, either. If a Sim keeps excelling at their duties, they can rake in extra Simoleons through additional raises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Careers&quot;&gt;[http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/blog.jsp?author=Ray%20Mazza#CareersandOpportunities Careers and Opportunities Blog] (11-16-2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new feature ''The Sims 3'' offers is branching careers, which allows Sims to choose a certain path in their career (such as Sim in the Music career can eventually choose to specialize in Symphonic music or Rock).

The ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions|Ambitions]]'' expansion pack introduces professions, careers that allow the player direct control over their Simsâ work and how they spend their days, and the ability for Sims to register at City Hall as self-employed in a skill career.

The careers in the core game are Business, Culinary, Criminal, Journalism, Law Enforcement, Medical, Military, Music, Political, Science, and Professional Sports. Professions in the ''Ambitions'' expansion pack include Firefighter, Ghost Hunter, Investigator, Architectural Designer, and Stylist. The [[part-time job]]s available include such positions as a Bookstore Clerk, Grocery Store Clerk, Spa Receptionist, Spa Specialist and a Mausoleum Gravedigger. If the Sim is a Rockstar, other Sims recognize this and react. The same if he/she is at the top of other careers, like the Military career: Sims use their military greeting and their children can then also use the military greeting. There are some banners that can be found depicting them. Careers and part-time jobs pay hourly, not daily. Sims in a professions from ''Ambitions'', will get money for performing each job, while receiving a weekly stipend. [[Non-player character|NPCs]] such as the maid and repairman, when asked about their career by a Sim, will state Maid and Repairman, but if they move into a household they will be listed as unemployed. So far most service NPC jobs are off limits to the player.

===Pregnancy===
To get [[pregnancy|pregnant]], a couple must &quot;Try for Baby&quot;. There is a possibility that the female Sim will not get pregnant; if she does, a lullaby plays briefly, signalling successful conception. A female Sim can be pregnant with up a single baby, twins, or triplets.  Adult females have a lower chance of getting pregnant and of delivering twins or triplets than Young Adult females, with Elder females unable to get pregnant at all.  Any male Sim in the Young Adult or older age groups can try for a baby.

Each [[trimester]] lasts one day of game time. During the first trimester, the pregnant Sim may suffer from morning sickness, running to a toilet periodically to throw up, with a thought bubble showing a pacifier and a question mark.  This may occur while the Sim is sleeping.  The Sim also loses certain physical interaction options with other Sims and may have food cravings.

To signal the beginning of the second trimester, the pregnant Sim will attract the player's attention and change appearance. Their abdomen will enlarge and they will begin to wear maternity clothing.  If the pregnant Sim has a job, they will be placed on maternity leave. The Sim will be paid for these leave days even if they fall on one of their days off. Many new social interactions are available in the second day, mostly centered around the Sim's new baby belly. The pregnant Sim and father can announce the pregnancy to others.

In the third trimester, pregnant Sims will get negative moodlets, such as the ''sore'' moodlet, and may no longer run. Before birth, a warning message will appear, saying, &quot;The baby is coming! Make sure your Sim is at the hospital or at home!&quot; On the last day of the pregnancy the Sim will attract the viewer once again and go into labor. This is an autonomous action and all Sims on the lot will be drawn to the Sim to watch the birth. The pregnant Sim can also be taken to the hospital when clicked on while in labor.  If the Sim goes to the hospital, the player won't be able to see anything, but can still hear the birth taking place.  After the birth of each baby, the player will then be able to name them and sometimes choose traits for them, depending on how happy the mother was during the pregnancy.  If the Sim has a job, they will get additional leave in the form of three normal vacation days.

===Worlds===
Neighborhoods are now being officially referred to as 'worlds', possibly due to [[Electronic Arts]]' use of the [[The Sims 3#Create a World|Create a World]] tool and the neighborhoods scale. Worlds are now 'seamless', open to exploration between lots and are affected by a new [[game mechanic]] called story progression.
The Create a World tool allows players to make their own neighborhoods with custom terrains similar to [[SimCity 4]]. A game patch, released in conjunction with the release of ''Ambitions'', also allows players to manipulate premade neighborhoods to a limited degree, such as adding or removing lots and scenery.
As of ''Late Night'', worlds are divided into &quot;''Sims 3 Towns'' and &quot;''Late Night Towns''&quot;. There seem to be important differences between the two, like the sims they can spawn, etc. {{As of|alt=Up to now|2011|April|5}}, Bridgeport is the only pre-made world to be catalogued as a city. The rest, including the exotic destinations from ''World Adventures'', are considered suburbs.

On March 19, 2008, EA revealed [[open world]], a new feature, for ''The Sims 3''. Players can explore the world outside their Sims' homes without having to face strenuous loading times. Every house lot is now synchronized with the main neighborhood time. In previous ''Sims'' games, the time of day was separate and different for each house lot. Players can interact with every building and amenity in a city. Although players are unable to see inside of certain commercial buildings often called rabbitholes (grocery, bookstore, theater, police station, school, etc.), they are able to enter and retain limited control over their Sims' actions while in these locations. The player has complete control in some other commercial buildings - such as the gym, library and the beach house. All occupied residential buildings can be entered in the same manner as a Sims' home, provided that the buildings are not empty or it is not too late at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/860/860744p1.html|title=IGN: The Sims 3 Preview|publisher=IGN|last=Ocampo|first=Jason |date= March 19, 2008|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sunset Valley====
[[File:Downtown Sunset Valley.jpg|thumb|left|310px|Downtown Sunset Valley in ''The Sims 3''. Sunset Valley is where Sims live in the base game.]]
Sunset Valley is very large compared to the neighborhoods in previous [[The Sims (series)|The Sims]] games, having a total of 97 lots with various playable characters and about 85 in total premade. (In EA's Burnout Paradise, an area is also named Sunset Valley which may have given its name) The main part of the town is the park, where Sims can have a picnic, go fishing, or take a stroll and maybe meet someone new; there are also cinemas, gyms, restaurants, shops, pools, and other recreational facilities. Sims can now visit all their friends' and neighbors' homes and call up their friends with the new cell [[phone]], for a night on the town.

Sunset Valley mixes modern and futuristic building ideas with nostalgic architecture and design rooted in American suburbs of the 1950s. The town is very unique on all accounts and hosts a whopping 25 playable families. Sunset Valley is full of places to explore and has a very diverse cityscape, leaving players hours of fun while exploring alone.

The houses in Sunset Valley are diversely priced, but every little group of houses are generally similarly priced. For example, the homes by the public beach are generally cheap, making them homes for lower-middle class type Sims, although (if viewing the water as south), the further west you go the nicer they become, until they're more like upper-middle class type homes. Summerhill Court contains the largest, most expensive lots. The area directly behind city hall has some of the poorest houses, and behind that zone is a middle class area. Along the east side of Sunset Valley are some very nice homes, probably for upper-middle class Sims. There are 21 available empty lots for players to build on. They are priced from Â§1200 at the cheapest, to Â§14,700 as the most expensive. The amount of space (in squares) for building goes from 19x29 at the smallest to 60x60 at the largest. The most expensive lot, 15 Summer Hill Court, is on the same hill as the Landgraabs' and Altos' mansions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Before Pleasantview, there was Sunset Valley, founded by the Goth family and built up by the Landgraabs to be a quiet, peaceful town. But when the Altos arrive with uptown ideals, will the townsfolk feel the need to choose sides?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many players believe that Sunset Valley is Pleasantview several decades before ''[[The Sims]]'', where it is called Old Town. Others believe it cannot be as Gunther Goth, the founder of Pleasantview, would have been too young. Sunset Valley is set 50 years before ''The Sims 2'' and 25 years before ''The Sims''. Also, some believe that Sunset Valley is set on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] because of the way the sun sets and rises. As the description states, there seems to be a rivalry between the Landgraabs and the Altos. Meanwhile, the Goths are living elsewhere in town and seem to have nothing to do with it.

Many of the places in town are available for purchase. In The Sims 3 core game, this list is limited to rabbit holes which your Sim enters but cannot be seen. With ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions|Ambitions]]'' expansion, it also includes buildings such as Library and Fishing Holes which can be upgraded with more equipment to increase their profit potential.

====Riverview====
Riverview is a free downloadable town offered from The Sims 3 store. The town was developed by Visceral Games. The town is a gift for people who register their copy of ''The Sims 3''. Currently, it is the only free downloadable town. The town initially served as an incentive for players to purchase, rather than pirate, their copy of ''The Sims 3'', as pirated versions are unable to download Riverview from TheSims3.com.

Like Sunset Valley, Riverview is very large compared to previous games, although it is a 'small town with an idyllic countryside setting. Itâs dotted with farms, beautiful pastures and nestled by a winding river', known, according the world's flavour text, as the Simomon (possibly a play on the word 'cinnamon' but more likely a homage to the real-life Cimarron River). There are 95 lots altogether, three fewer than in Sunset Valley. The centre of town is built up on an island in the middle of the Simomon. The name of the island is unknown, but the name of the road on which Constance Shelley and Meadow Carpenter-Rhodes live ([[Long Island]] Drive), the name is possibly Long Island. On one of the shores of the river, there is an industrial area featuring several rabbit holes. The landscape is primarily flat, with one notable hill upon which stands Remington's Ruse, the Remington family home.

The architectural style is primarily small town rustic, with a few industrial-style lots in the industrial area that contains the [[military base]], [[hospital]], and [[Park#&quot;All the Rave&quot; Warehouse|abandoned warehouse]]. Despite the small town style, there is a lot of diversity in the townscape, with farms, poor and wealthy subdivisions, and forested terrain.

'This sleepy little town comes with an entirely new set of inhabitants with secrets for your Sims to uncover', there are 50 new playable Sims in total. There are 22 empty residential lots for players to get started on, or they can choose any of the premade families. The cheapest of the lots is Â§1200, and the most expensive is Â§14,700. The smallest available lot is 20x30, and the largest is 64x64. The most expensive lot will put players in the company of Lessen, Shallows, Wilson, and Grisbys.

Riverview and Riverblossom Hills share the same farm/country effect and Riverview has a street named &quot;Riverblossom Hills Drive&quot;. This evidence suggests that Riverblossom Hills used to be Riverview, but no Sims from Riverblossom Hills appear in Riverview. Riverview might have been rescontructed and then renamed to Riverblossom Hills. There are a few old faces from ''[[The Sims 2]]'' in Riverview, just as in Sunset Valley.

===Traits===
Traits are like segments of a whole personality that the player can assign to their Sims. They can combine to create increasingly complex personalities. There are 63 traits to choose from in the base game, with Expansion packs adding more, plus some hidden traits which can be passed on to the offspring of service Sims (such as firefighters and police officers) or from Sims in certain careers (such as the Criminal career). When the player assigns Traits to a Sim, that Sim will look and act the part. Toddlers, Children and Teens get a new trait at their birthday. If children had a good childhood, then the player can choose a trait. If not, the game will give them a random one, which is usually negative. Theyâll have unique behaviors, preferences and advantages. Some traits give special abilities. They can be useful towards skill improvement (such as the Artistic and Athletic traits) and special interactions. Young adults and older have 5 traits, teenagers have 4 traits, kids have 3 traits, while toddlers and infants have 2 traits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesimsresource.com/articles/sims3&lt;/ref&gt; The fewer traits a Sim has, the less complex that Sim's personality will be. For example, giving a Sim the Kleptomaniac trait only will result in him constantly stealing while giving a Sim 5 traits will result in more balance. A Sim can have any combination of traits as long as they do not contradict each other. For example, a Sim cannot be both &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sims can be both absent-minded and geniuses, however.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many third-party modifications to the game that allow sims to have more than five traits, as well as some that allow the player to assign hidden traits to Sims.

===Age===
Age types of Sims within the game are baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult (''default age''). Adult (''middle age'') and elder. The lifespan of a Sim can also be edited, making it any number of days between 25 and 960. Adult and Elder Sims can be married to Young Adult Sims. A [[birthday cake]] is available for purchase to age Sims before the natural end of the phase. Also, players can now adjust the number of days a life stage lasts in the latest patch of the sims.

*Short (25 Sim days)
*Medium (50 Sim days)
*Normal (90 Sim days)
*Long (190 Sim days)
*Epic (960 Sim days)

Also, in the [[Generations]] expansion pack, players who go into the settings menu are given sliders to decide the precise amount of days each age group will live until growing up but it's optional and default ages can be restored.
Default life phase lengths are as follows:

*[[Toddler]] - 7 days
*[[Child]] - 7 days
*[[Teen]] - 14 days
*[[Young adult (psychology)|Young adult]] - 21 days
*[[Adult]] - 21 days
*[[Elderly|Elder]] - 17 days (vegetarians live up to 25 days)

===Build/Buy modes===
[[File:Sims3Buildmode.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A player placing doors in their Sim's house in Build mode. Build mode is very prominent in the game, as without it a Sim would not have a house.]]
The build and buy modes have received their own makeover. The square tile outlines that appeared on the ground in previous ''Sims'' games' build and buy modes are now a quarter of their original size to give the player more liberty to place objects where they want.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/blog.jsp?author=Feisal%20Maroof Build and Buy Mode Developer Blog]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is possible to place objects freely without square tiles, an option that was missing in previous Sims games. Players can re-color and re-pattern the furniture and other items to specific shades and patterns with the new Create-a-Style and make six story houses with basements.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimsResource&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesimsresource.com/article/sims3|title=The Sims 3: First Preview|author=Bonham, Steve|publisher=The Sims Resource|accessdate=2008-11-28|date=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Build mode is one of three modes in ''The Sims 3''. It is used mainly for construction and architectonic work. Some items that would be considered to be in build mode, such as counters and lights, are actually in the buy mode section. Build mode can be used to do many things including adding walls, paint/cover walls, add doors and windows, lay down flooring, create foundations and raised decks, create basements by using either foundations or the Basement tool, add columns and supports, create pools, raise and lower land, create ponds, build gardens and landscape a lot, add fireplaces, add additional floors/stories to a building, add stairs, and add a roof.&lt;ref&gt;http://guides.ign.com/guides/802129/page_5.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some expansion packs released after ''The Sims 3'' add extra build mode features such as ceiling construction and designing the terrain, Players cannot build or place objects outside the limits of the lot. Walls and foundations cannot be placed within 2 tiles of the outer limit of the lot, or within 2 tiles of the front sidewalk. The sidewalks mark the limit on which a player can place objects on their lot. Fences can be placed all the way up to the edge of the lot and all structures built by the players are limited to eight stories. The height of a section of wall is equal to the length of 3 floor squares. This is most noticeable while placing a 45Âº roof. It is possible that the length of a game tile is 1 meter, and that the height of a section of wall would then be 3 meters. In some situations, Build mode, as well as Buy mode, may become disabled, such as during a fire, burglary, or other major event. This is done to prevent modifications to the lot that may impact or prevent a game event from occurring. After the event has ended, Build and Buy modes will be re-activated. This feature has been an annoyance to many player and is disabled in many mods. Depreciation of objects is visible in ''The Sims 3''. All objects depreciate 10% as soon as the player exits build mode. This adds realism to the game and gives the player limited tries at building before the costs of building use up too much of the funds intended for furnishing and living expenses. When in build mode, players can return items for full value by using the undo tool.

Buy mode in which the player may purchase items from the catalog, sell objects that are on the current lot, and arrange objects on the current lot. Construction-related elements such as doors, windows, fences, and stairs are not associated with buy mode, but are in build mode.&lt;ref&gt;http://n4g.com/news/248772/the-sims-3-build-and-buy-mode-developer-blog&lt;/ref&gt; Buy mode largely focuses on furniture and appliances. The descriptions of many of the objects available for purchase in the game (namely the least expensive ones) involve humor, sarcasm, insults towards the player, and wit, and serves as comic relief in the game. For example, one of the cheapest cars available in The Sims 3, the &quot;Big Lemon&quot;, notes that although the car's doors are jammed and its ignition is faulty, it is still worth buying. Another example is the outdoor entertainment item &quot;Foot-and-Hand Ball&quot; used to train the athletic skill, which references and pokes fun at American football, which, despite its name, rarely involves contact with the ball via the feet. A feature that was introduced in The Sims 2 and stays present currently is the eyedropper tool. When the eyedropper tool is pointed at a wall covering, floor covering, or most objects, will show the name of what it's pointed at. Clicking on a wall or floor covering will switch to the appropriate area of build mode and select that covering so it can be applied. Clicking on an object will make an exact duplicate of it, and will focus the catalog on that object.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamespot.com/features/6209418/sims-3-primer-guide?page=4&lt;/ref&gt; The family inventory is a space where objects that are too large to be held in a Sim's personal inventory are kept. Certain opportunities may make an object available in the Family Inventory. When a Sim family moves, if &quot;pack furniture&quot; is selected, all objects in the household will be placed in the Family inventory, to be moved and rearranged in the new house.

===Create a World===
On October 29, 2009, [[Electronic Arts]] announced &quot;Create a World (CAW)&quot;, which is a [[game world]] editor that allows players to create their own custom cities from scratch for use within the game. Players can customize lots, choose terrain patterns and add roads, vegetation and neighborhood accents (such as water towers and lighthouses). CAW also allows players to import designs from [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] for use in their worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/thesims3worldadventures/news.html?sid=6238425&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=gs_previews&amp;subj=6238425&amp;mode=previews|title=The Sims 3 World Adventures Preview -Exclusive Details on Create-a-World|author=Park, Andrew|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-10-31|date=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can upload their worlds to ''The Sims 3 Exchange'' for download by other players. The editor tool is offered to players as a separate download (156MB), and was released on December 16, 2009 as a [[beta version]]. EA will offer technical support and updates. Players are able to share their neighborhoods as with other content. The Create A World tool is currently only available for Windows based PCs.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesims3.com/game/tools/world|title=Create a World-The Game-Community-The Sims 3|author=Arts, Electronic|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=2010-05-03|date=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electronic Arts]] first announced ''Sims 3'' on March 19, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;actiontrip-site&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Paul | first = Ure | title = The Sims 3 Announced | publisher = Action Trip.com | date = 2008-03-19 | url = http://www.actiontrip.com/rei/comments_news.phtml?id=031908_9 | accessdate = 2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed at The Sims Studio located in Redwood Shores, CA. On January 15, 2009, EA invited &quot;some of the best&quot; custom content creators to their campus at Redwood Shores where they were hosting a Creatorâs Camp. Creators have been invited to spend the week exploring and creating content like Sims, houses and customized content.  The Creators' work is used to pre-populate The Sims 3 Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/blog.jsp?author=Andrea%20Wendland#Creator'sCampIntroBlog |title=The Sims 3 â Blog |publisher=Electronic Arts |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the seventh expansion pack for ''The Sims 2'', ''[[The Sims 2: FreeTime]]'', an event occurs in which a Sim-version of [[Rod Humble]], the head of The Sims franchise, gives the player's Sim family an unopened gift box. When opened, the family gets a computer with ''The Sims 3'' on it. The ''Sims 3'' game cannot be bought in the catalog. Sims can then play ''The Sims 3'' on their computers or console systems. Like all the other games that Sims can play in ''The Sims 2'', ''The Sims 3'' is a looping gameplay video shown on the player's Sim's computer screens when played by a Sim. On July 15, 2008 the first video preview of ''The Sims 3'' appeared on the official website as did seven new screenshots and five Create-A-Sim screens. Four screenshots that appeared on the website and were then taken down soon after, leaked onto the Internet by a member of the community.&lt;!-- do not add the &quot;lost screenshots&quot; tidbit here. This is irrelevant and not important to the article. Please discuss this on the talk page before re-entering it. --&gt;

Copies of the video game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' also came packaged with fliers advertising the game, with information stating whole-neighborhood accessibility and endless possibilities on character creation. On October 31, 2008, two teaser trailers were released by [[Electronic Arts]] featuring a comical view on the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] in the United States. Candidates [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] were included along with respective running mates [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.media.pc.gamespy.com/media/802/802129/vids_1.html|title=GameSpy: The Sims 3 Trailer, Videos and Movies|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth expansion pack of ''The Sims 2'', ''[[The Sims 2: Apartment Life]]'', new objects were added including logo posters and framed screenshots. The game was shipped with a code and an Internet address, where the player could download clothing with ''The Sims 3'' logo on it. Another developer walk through was released on November 6, 2008, featuring in-depth previews of the neighborhood and Create-A-Sim.

On May 8, 2009, EA announced that ''The Sims 3'' had [[Gold release#Production or live release|gone gold]] meaning that the game had finished beta testing stage and was off for manufacturing ahead of its June 2009 release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/newsItem.jsp?item=-1844984272 Sims 3 goes gold]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2009 EA released some online interactive teaser experiences on ''The Sims 3'' Website, including 'SimFriend', which allows users to choose a virtual Sim Friend who would email them throughout the day. 'SimSocial', which allows users to create their own Sim online, and have an adventure with them. 'SimSidekick', which allows users to surf the web with a sim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/newsItem.jsp?item=1524048814 |title=SimSocial launched |publisher=Electronic Arts |accessdate=2009-05-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before the game was scheduled to be released, a pirated version of the [[digital distribution]] version&lt;ref name=&quot;bayimg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bayimg.com/LApBoaABN |title=image: TheSims3EULA.png - free uncensored image hosting |publisher=bayimg |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the game leaked onto the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sims 3 leaked to torrent sites weeks before retail release |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/05/sims-3-leaked-to-torrent-sites-weeks-before-retail-release.ars |author=Ben Kuchera |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; EA later commented the leak was a &quot;buggy, pre-final&quot; version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i2Ts-zyPtq_1NOZV49oeN7ZvY4RgD98BBEMG0 |title=EA comment on leak |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; EA claims that more than half of the game is missing and is susceptible to crashes or worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/05/23/0523gamepiracy.html|title=Video game pirates swoop on 'The Sims 3'|last=Satariano|first=Adam |date=May 23, 2009 |publisher=BLOOMBERG NEWS|accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the title has seen higher [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] rates than that of the most pirated game of 2008, ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/18095.cfm |title='Sims 3' piracy rates higher than 'Spore' |publisher=Afterdawn.com |date=2009-05-30 |accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
In April 2009, [[Electronic Arts]] began to post billboards in many areas in advertisement for the game. Many of the billboards covered skyscrapers in densely populated areas, most notably [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kee |first=Tameka |url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-ea-goes-all-out-with-sims-3-ad-blitz/ |title=EA Goes All Out With Pricey Sims 3 Ad Blitz |publisher=paidContent |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of these billboards was estimated to be $10 million a month. This marketing campaign proved successful, as ''The Sims 3'' sold 1.4 million copies in its first week, breaking the record for all EA games.

On March 23, 2009, the look and feel of ''The Sims 3'' was seamlessly threaded throughout the storyline of an episode of [[The CW Television Network|The CW series]] ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. On screen, the episode opens in an idealized Sims version of ''One Tree Hill'' and then transitions into the real Tree Hill. As this episode plays out, Sims versions of popular ''One Tree Hill'' characters are introduced and then morph into the real-life characters, including Dan ([[Paul Johansson]]), Lucas ([[Chad Michael Murray]]) and Peyton ([[Hilarie Burton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesims2.ea.com/news/detail.php?id=1728 The Sims 3 visits One Tree Hill on The CW Tonight!] from TheSims2.com&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sims 3'' versions of the characters are available for download via [[The CW Television Network|CW]]'s official website. On April 19, 2009, Target exclusively released a promotional disc of ''The Sims 3'' that features a [[Ladytron]] band poster, ''The Sims 3'' theme song music download, and a $5 off coupon. The main menu includes screensaver downloads, videos, Create-A-Sim, Create-A-House, and much more. There is no actual gameplay involved, but it describes what playing feels like.

On July 14, 2010, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor]] began a promotion at ''The Sims 3 Store'' by allowing players to download their newest car at the time, the [[Ford Fiesta]] Mark VI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.thesims3.com/fiesta?intcmp=eaint505&amp;sourceid=eaom695 |title=Fiesta Urban Landscape |author=Electronic Arts |date=14 July 2010 |publisher=Electronic Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car also came with a collection of street signs. On October 27, 2010, the download was updated to include the Fiesta Hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simprograms.com/26473/the-sims-3-store-updates-with-free-2011-fiesta-hatchback |title=The Sims 3 Store updates with FREE 2011 Fiesta Hatchback |author=Judhudson |date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 [[Ford Focus]] was made available to download on June 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simprograms.com/31013/2012-ford-focus-now-available-to-download-for-the-sims-3/ |title=2012 Ford Focus now available to download for The Sims 3 |author=Judhudson |date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car included one male Ford t-shirt, one female Ford t-shirt, a stereo, and a set of neon lights, all for use in-game. The Focus pack was available to download on Mac, Xbox, and Playstation platforms.

===Audio===
Music for ''The Sims 3'' was composed by [[Steve Jablonsky]]. Scores were recorded with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at Newman Scoring Stage at [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name=scoring&gt;{{Cite news| author=Goldwasser, Dan | url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/160 | title=Steve Jablonsky scores The Sims 3 | publisher=Scoring Sessions | date=2008-11-02 | accessdate= February 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music for the game's stereo and guitar objects was produced by others, including [[Darrell Brown (musician)|Darrell Brown]], [[Rebeca Mauleon]], and [[Peppino D'Agostino]]. Additional music was produced by [[APM Music]].&lt;ref name=mobygames1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sims 3 (2009) Windows credits - MobyGames|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/sims-3/credits|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two soundtracks have been released for ''The Sims 3'' base game, ''The Sims 3 Soundtrack'' and ''The Sims 3 - Stereo Jams''. The soundtrack includes theme music and the ''Stereo Jams'' album includes music from stereos in game. All songs on ''Stereo Jams'' are in [[Simlish]].

===Software copy restriction===
Some of EA's other recent PC titles, such as ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' and ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', have used a [[SecuROM]] copy restriction scheme that requires online and offline authentication and limits the number of times a user can install the game to five. While it was speculated that ''The Sims 3'' would use the same system, on March 26, 2009, executive producer [[Rod Humble]] revealed that ''The Sims 3'' uses traditional disk-based copy protection as ''Sims 2'' did, and does not require online authentication to install. A [[product key]] is also required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/newsItem.jsp?item=-608201177 The Sims 3 Copy Protection], ''The Sims 3'' official website&lt;/ref&gt; However, SecuROM based restriction is still present within the &quot;Digital Download&quot; version of the title, limiting users to a total of 5 authorizations for 5 different machines via online activation, each of which can be de-authorized online at any time. A legitimate serial key is required to download custom objects and Sims from the official website. This includes custom designs created by other Sims 3 players as well as additional content from EA.

===Delay===
On February 3, 2009, it was announced that the release date of ''The Sims 3'' would be delayed from February 20, 2009 to June 2, 2009 in the US, and June 5, 2009 in the UK.  John Riccitiello, CEO of Electronic Arts, said &quot;In the case of Sims 3, weâre moving this title to June 2 to give us additional time to build the worldwide marketing campaign a title like this deserves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tymesaid.com/2009/the-sims-3-delayed-ea-lost-money-what-happened/ |title=The Sims 3 delayed.

{{quote|The Sims 3 June launch gives more time for tuning and polish and the ability to launch the game on PC and Mac platforms simultaneously.

At the event, ''The Sims 3'' T-shirts were available for purchase.

====iOS====
{{Main|The Sims 3 (smartphone video game)}}
A version of ''The Sims 3'' was released on the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] on June 2, 2009. The iPhone game works similar to that of the PC version. In Create-a-Sim, instead of Lifetime Wishes, there are personas. Personas decide which lifetime wishes your sim will have, as a persona is the largest factor in a sim's personality. Sims start out with a small house. The house can be expanded every five sim days if the player can afford it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sims 3 on iTunes App Store|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-sims-3/id317904170?mt=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sims 3 Store===
The Sims 3 Store is an online store where players of ''The Sims 3'' can purchase and download content for their game online for additional fees. To date, unlike [[The Sims 2#The Sims 2 Store|its counterpart for The Sims 2]], The Sims 3 Store only offers exclusive objects, clothing, skins, and hairstyles not found through any other medium. The Store also offers variants of special objects found in expansions (such as laundry and hot-tubs), which offer their features for players who haven't purchased those expansions. The store is updated with new items for purchase every month. Two notable release that were published outside of the regular monthly schedule were Barnacle Bay and Hidden Springs, both of which are world downloads with exclusive items. Premium content, such as the [[Massage#Tables and chairs|foot massage chair]] and [[wind chimes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://store.thesims3.com/productList.html?scategoryId=13062&lt;/ref&gt; add new gameplay or animations.
 
The store uses a point system in which players can purchase additional SimPoints using a credit card or Points Card, which may be purchased at retail stores or via the Origin online store. It was launched on June 4, 2009 to coincide with the launch of the game. Players can download purchased items using the game launcher or the Store Mode interface found within the game itself. When a user purchases additional SimPoints, they obtain an object in the game for buying SimPoints.

This is a noted departure from both the first and second generation of the franchise, in which new items were obtained primarily through expansion packs, stuff packs, and/or user-generation.

====Barnacle Bay====
Barnacle Bay is a [[neighborhood]] available for download from The Sims 3 Store.&lt;ref name=&quot;the sims hub&quot;&gt;[http://thesimshub.net78.net/barnacle-bay-new-world-coming-to-the-sims-3/ The Sims Hub - New World Coming to The Sims 3]&lt;/ref&gt; It became available to download on September 23, 2010. Barnacle Bay is by far the city with the deepest connection to the sea and pirates. The neighborhood features 4 default [[Beach]]es, and the sims' clothing and personalities surrounds the theme of outdoors. The climate is supposedly tropical.

====Hidden Springs====
Hidden Springs&lt;ref&gt;http://ea.gamespress.com/release.asp?i=1618 Official EA Confirmation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=230928623609679 Official EA confirmation by Facebook event.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everybodyplays.co.uk/news/PC/The-Sims-3-Hidden-Springs-announced/796&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shacknews&quot;&gt;http://www.shacknews.com/article/69590/sims-3-getting-hidden-springs-dlc-on-august-25&lt;/ref&gt; is another neighborhood that is available for download. It was announced on August 4, 2011 and was released August 25, 2011. Hidden Springs is a resort-type neighborhood centered around health and beauty. As such, sims can visit the Crystal Solarium Rejuvenating Waters and the Zephyr Health Spa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurogamer&quot;&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-04-sims-3-hidden-springs-dlc-announced&lt;/ref&gt; New families include the Chos, Pertridges, Shues, and the Vanderburgs.&lt;ref&gt;http://simsvip.com/?p=2601&lt;/ref&gt; This download includes several new clothing options and items, one of which, the Fountain of Eternal Youth, is considered premium content with new features. The homes and residents are much wealthier than that of any previous town. The fountain of youth in the town allows sims to become young and stay that way forever, similar to that of the Age Freeze and Young Again Potions in ''[[The Sims 3: Generations|Generations]]''. As with Barnacle Bay, the XML in the world file carry preset celebrity data for Sims in Hidden Springs. Therefore, when ''[[The Sims 3: Late Night|Late Night]]'' is installed a some number of Hidden Springs Sims have celebrity status. The world comes with one new venue - the Silver Zephyr Health Spa. The building is much larger than spas in the game and all of its expansion packs.

{{Quote|text=This is simply a better playing Sims experience, and once you experience the freedom to hit the town without hitting a load screen youâll be hard-pressed to go back to any of the earlier games.
