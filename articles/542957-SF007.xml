'''''Red Rackham's Treasure''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le TrÃ©sor de Rackham le Rouge'''}}) is the twelfth of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', a series of classic comic-strip albums written and illustrated by Belgian writer and illustrator [[HergÃ©]], featuring young reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] as a hero. It is a continuation of ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'', and is one of very few Tintin books to directly carry on the story of the preceding title. It is notable for the first appearance of the eccentric but ingenious [[Professor Cuthbert Calculus]]. According to [[Michael Farr]]'s ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'', it is also the best-selling book in the ''Tintin'' series.

==The storyline==
In the previous adventure, ''The Secret of the Unicorn'', Tintin and [[Captain Haddock]] discover three [[parchment]]s revealing the location of the [[Unicorn (ship)|''Unicorn'']], a 17th century navy ship commanded by Haddock's ancestor [[Sir Francis Haddock]]. The ''Unicorn'' was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by Sir Francis while battling the pirate [[Red Rackham]] for his treasure. Tintin and Haddock believe that the pirate's treasure is in the remains of the sunken ''Unicorn''. 

Tintin and Captain Haddock hire a fishing trawler, the ''Sirius'', to search for the treasure.  As the crew prepare for the search, their plans are discovered and publicized by the press, forcing Tintin and Haddock to deal with numerous strangers claiming to be Red Rackham's descendants and insisting on a share of the treasure. They are quickly driven away by Haddock, who reminds them he is the descendant of the man who killed Red Rackham.

Another petitioner is [[Professor Calculus|Professor Cuthbert Calculus]], an eccentric and hard-of-hearing inventor who offers the use of a special [[shark]]-shaped, electrically powered one-man [[submarine]] to help search for the sunken ship without being bothered by the numerous sharks in the area.  The treasure hunters turn him down and prepare to embark. 

Before Tintin and the Captain clear the port, the two detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] join the crew to protect their friends from the possible threat of the rival treasure hunters, [[the Bird brothers]].  Shortly after departure, Tintin and Haddock discover that Calculus has stowed away on board. The professor has stashed the unassembled parts of his submarine in the hold, removing the Captain's crates of whisky in the process. Despite initially threatening to throw Calculus into the hold on bread and water, Haddock grudgingly decides to keep him along for the trip. 

Tintin and Captain Haddock reach the location stated in Sir Francis Haddock's parchments. Initially, the party cannot find anything at the coordinates ({{coord|20|37|42|N|70|52|15|W|}}, off the [[Mouchoir Bank]]), but then Tintin hypothesizes that Sir Francis Haddock used the [[Paris Meridian]] instead of [[Greenwich Meridian|Greenwich]] (which would yield {{coord|20|37|42|N|68|32|1|W|}}, off the [[Navidad Bank]]). Sure enough, the ship reaches an unknown and uninhabited island.  As they come ashore to explore it, the Captain stubs his toe on a piece of wood protruding from the sand, which is excavated and turns out to be the remains of Sir Francis Haddock's [[jolly boat]]. As they penetrate into the interior of the island, they encounter numerous [[Human skull|skull]]s, which Tintin deduces are the remains of the island's cannibalistic former inhabitants. There is also a magnificent pagan [[icon]] of Sir Francis, and numerous [[parrot]]s that repeat the Haddockian [[argot]], which an amused Tintin realizes has been passed down for generations. 

Calculus's submarine proves useful in searching for the sunken ''Unicorn'', while the actual examination of the wreck itself is performed with a [[standard diving dress|hardhat diving suit]]. Thomson and Thompson soon begin to rue their decision to join the treasure hunt, because they are consigned to manning the air pumps supplying the diving suit when Tintin, and later the Captain, explore the wreck. While facing complications like shark attacks, they discover a [[cutlass]], a gold bejeweled cross, a strongbox of old documents, the [[figurehead (object)|figurehead]] of the ship and, to Captain Haddock's delight, a large supply of vintage [[Jamaica]]n [[rum]].  

Although the search is otherwise unproductive, the crew spots a large wooden cross on the island itself and Tintin believes that the reference in Sir Francis' parchments to &quot;the Eagle's cross&quot; could refer to it as the marker for the treasure's location.  Upon coming to the cross the party begins to dig, but after a while Tintin realizes that they are following a false lead, considering that Sir Francis would not deliberately leave his treasure on an island he did not intend to return to, so they return to the ''Sirius''. 

Time passes. Although there are further dives to the wreck, they are unable to find the treasure itself and they go home disappointed. 

Calculus's examination of the documents from the retrieved strongbox allows him to determine that Sir Francis was the owner of the large estate of [[Marlinspike Hall]], the former home of the Bird brothers. Upon this discovery, Tintin insists that Haddock must purchase the estate, which is up for auction, but the Captain is short on funds due to the wasted expense of their failed treasure hunt. However, Calculus, who has received large sums of money from the government after a profitable sale of his submarine design, helps his friend overcome that difficulty.  

After purchasing the Hall, Tintin and Captain Haddock explore the cellars of the main house. Amongst the Bird Brothers' cluttered antiques they find a statue of [[John of Patmos|Saint John]] holding a cross. Tintin suddenly shouts out, &quot;The Eagle's cross!&quot; as he remembers the Saint is called &quot;The Eagle of [[Patmos]]&quot;. At the statue's feet is a globe. On it, Tintin locates the island where Sir Francis Haddock was marooned. He touches that point and discovers it to be a trigger buttonâthe globe springs opens and Red Rackham's treasure is found hidden inside.

==History==

===Background===

The Belgian comic book creator Georges Remi â who would become better known under his pen name of HergÃ© â first came up with the character of Tintin, a young boy reporter, whilst working at the right wing Belgian newspaper ''[[Le XXe SiÃ¨cle]]'' (''The 20th Century''). Pioneering this new character in the story ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', this comic, which involved Tintin battling the socialist authorities in the [[Soviet Union]], was serialised in ''Le XXe SiÃ¨cle'''s supplement for children, ''[[Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me]]'' (''The Little Twentieth''), from 10 January 1929 until 11 May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lof92|Lofficier and Lofficier 2002]]. pp. 22&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; Proving a success, HergÃ© went on to pen a string of new ''Adventures of Tintin'', sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, the United States, Egypt, India, China and the United Kingdom, and also to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of [[San Theodoros]] and the East European kingdom of [[Syldavia]].

As he produced these works, his political approach to the world began to change; the earliest books reflected the [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], [[fascism|fascist]] and [[imperialism|imperialistic]] attitudes of those for whom he worked.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; As he got older, he became more critical of the political far right, with the eighth Tintin adventure, ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' (1939), involving Tintin battling the forces of fictional fascist state [[Borduria]], whose leader, named MÃ¼sstler, was a combination of Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] and Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued this anti-German sentiment in his subsequent work, ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', in which the main antagonist, Dr MÃ¼ller, is a German intent on sabotaging the oil supply in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 1991. p. 91-92&quot;&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gestapomen following the white buses.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Himself an anti-fascist, HergÃ© focused his ''Adventures of Tintin'' on non-political themes to avoid trouble with the Gestapo (pictured here) during the period of Nazi occupation.]]

Then, in November 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as [[World War II]] broke out across Europe, and although HergÃ© initially considered fleeing into a self-imposed exile, he ultimately decided to stay in his occupied homeland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure their own dominance, the Nazi authorities closed down ''Le XXe SiÃ¨cle'', leaving HergÃ© unemployed and his story ''Land of Black Gold'' unfinished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 1991. p. 91-92&quot;/&gt; In search of employment, he was given a job as an illustrator by [[Raymond de Becker]], an executive of the popular newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' (''The Evening''), which was allowed to continue publication under German management.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 1940 he was made editor of the paper's children's supplement, ''Le Soir Jeunesse'', in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures, ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'' (1941) and then ''[[The Shooting Star]]'' (1942).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; In this new, more repressive political climate, HergÃ© could no longer explore political themes in his ''Adventures of Tintin'' lest he be arrested by the Nazi secret police, the [[Gestapo]]. As Tintinologist [[Harry Thompson]] noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer, something which was not a politically sensitive topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 1991. p. 112&quot;&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the culmination of ''The Shooting Star'', HergÃ© began work on a new Tintin adventure, which would spread through the two volume-length story ''The Secret of the Unicorn'' and ''Red Rackham's Treasure''. Revolving around the &quot;ultra-romantic theme&quot; of the treasure hunt, Tintinologist [[Benoit Peeters]] would later describe it as &quot;an act of sheer escapism from the rigours of occupation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pee89|Peeters 1989]]. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to write a story that would span the length of two books was something which he had tried before, with the ''Tintin in the East'' story arch that was found in both ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' (1934) and ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' (1936). He considered it to be sufficiently successful that he repeated it over the next four books, ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'' (1948), ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'' (1949), ''[[Destination Moon]]'' (1953) and ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Far01|Farr 2001]]. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication===
The story was originally published as a daily strip in the newspaper ''Le Soir'' between 19 February and 23 September 1943 under the title &quot;Aventures Extraordinaires de Tintin et Milou&quot; (French for &quot;Extraordinary Adventures of Tintin and Snowy&quot;). It was published in book form in 1944 and translated into English in 1959.

By the time ''Red Rackham's Treasure'' had finished appearing in ''Le Soir'', Tintin's next adventure, ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'', was not yet ready for publication. Crime writer Paul Kinnet came up with a storyline which starred the Thompsons and had them investigate the disappearance of their farmer friend, on whose farm they can be seen working in much the same way as they did on the ''Sirius''.&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

==Inspirations==
The ''Sirius'', which had appeared before in ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', was named after the ''[[SS Sirius (1837)|SS Sirius]]'', the first ship to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] solely under [[steam power]], but was based on another ship called the ''John-o.88''.&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

==Differences between newspaper strip and comic book==
In order to fit into the 62-pages required by the book publishers, certain scenes of the original strip were edited out and some panels were cropped or made bigger.

The speech bubbles and the fonts were made smaller and there were some changes in the text which, in some cases, toned down the aggression of the characters: in the original strip, when confronting the so-called descendants of Red Rackham, Haddock announces that he fancies killing them all in combat and, once they have fled, Tintin expresses satisfaction. In the book Haddock's words are changed to his claiming to feel the boiling blood of his ancestor, Sir Francis, and Tintin makes no comment on his methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

In the newspaper strip, the sailor caps worn by the Thompsons displayed the name &quot;[[French ship Redoutable|Redoutable]]&quot; (French for &quot;Ruthless&quot;). These were taken out in the book version.&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

Scenes from the strip that did not appear in the book edition included:
*the shopkeeper warning Haddock that breaking the mirror is a bad omen and that he should give up his plans (in the book edition Haddock himself believes it to be a bad omen, while the shopkeeper merely demands to be paid for the broken mirror);

*in the port scene, Snowy's tail is hit by Haddock's match after the Captain's finger catches fire. Haddock then turns to Thompson and makes his statement that he is afraid of nothing and that they sail at dawn;

*Haddock, examining one of the steel plates in the hold, comments that it wasn't a bomb after all when a sudden bang can be heard behind them. However it's just the door closing suddenly;

*when digging at the foot of the cross, Thompson finds what he thinks is the treasure, a silver button, only for Haddock to tell him that it's just a button from Sir Francis' clothing and calling him a &quot;freshwater sailor&quot;;

*before dragging Calculus off to see Haddock about the Marlinspike parchment, Tintin calls the Captain who mutter: &quot;Calculus?... that phenomenon can go westwards&quot;, a reference to the professor's insistence that the treasure is westwards, as per his pendulum.&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

Scenes that were drawn for the book edition included:
*Haddock being helped to his feet by Thompson and Tintin after going through Calculus' clothes-brushing machine;
*Tintin commenting on the irony of finding the treasure in Marlinspike Hall &quot;right under our very noses&quot; after going halfway across the world to find it.&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

Some of the panels were redrawn for the book edition in order to cover half-a-page rather than a small panel. These included:
*the scene where Tintin, in his diving-gear, first approaches the ''Unicorn'';
*the scene in the Maritime Gallery at Marlinspike, redrawn to include Snowy chewing a bone, an anchor and the three models of the ''Unicorn'' on a glass panel with a book and some of the parchments (the original panel only had a single model on a wooden case).&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

==Translation differences==
A joke in the book involves Thomson and Thompson re-doing Captain Haddock's navigational calculations, but their ignorance causes them to place the ship in a fanciful location far from its real one. In the original French version, Captain Haddock mockingly explains that they place them in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. The [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] English translation alters this to [[Westminster Abbey]], [[London]]; America's [[Golden Press]] translation alters it to [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (New York)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], [[New York City|New York]].

When making their way back to the ship with the idol of Sir Francis, Haddock, his hand trailing in the water, recites the opening lines of &quot;The Galley of Count Arnaldos&quot; by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. In the original French, he quotes from [[Alphonse de Lamartine]]'s &quot;Le Lac&quot; (&quot;The Lake&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot; /&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Belvision animation, 1957===
In 1957, the animation company [[Belvision]] produced a string of colour adaptations based upon HergÃ©'s original comics, adapting eight of the ''Adventures'' into a series of daily five-minute episodes. ''Red Rackham's Treasure'' was the eighth such story to be adapted, being directed by Ray Goossens and written by [[Michel Greg]], himself a well known comic book writer and illustrator who in later years would become editor-in-chief of the ''Journal De Tintin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lof02|Lofficier and Lofficier 2002]]. pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ellipse/Nelvana animation, 1991===
In 1991, a second animated series based upon ''The Adventures of Tintin'' was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio [[Ellipse]] and the Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]]. Adapting 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long, ''Red Rackham's Treasure'' was the tenth story to be produced into the series, with the story spanning two episodes. Directed by StÃ©phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lof02|Lofficier and Lofficier 2002]]. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
In his analysis of the ''Adventures of Tintin'', the academic Jean-Marie ApostolidÃ¨s characterised the ''Secret of the Unicorn''-''Red Rackham's Treasure'' arc as being about the characters going on a &quot;treasure hunt that turns out to be at the same time a search for their roots.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Apo10|ApostolidÃ¨s 2010]]. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The shark-shaped submarine on the book's cover was the inspiration for &quot;[[Troy (submarine)|Troy]],&quot; the real-life shark-shaped [[submersible]] constructed by aquatic film-maker and oceanographic explorer [[Fabien Cousteau]], the grandson of [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau|Jacques Cousteau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A_la_recherche_du_trÃ©sor_de_Rackham_le_Rouge&quot;&gt;''A la recherche du trÃ©sor de Rackham le Rouge'' (French for &quot;In Search of Red Rackham's Treasure&quot;) by HergÃ©, with comments by Daniel Couvreur and FrÃ©dÃ©ric Soumois, published by Editions Moulinsart in November 2007, ISBN 978-2874241604&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movie ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character reads this book to his son.
