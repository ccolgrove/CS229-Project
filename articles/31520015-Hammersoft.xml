===Possum Drop===
The Possum Drop is an annual event at [http://www.clayscorner.com Clay's Corner] [[convenience store]] organized by proprietors Clay and Judy Logan.&lt;ref&gt;Clay's Corner - Opossum Capital of the World - Clay &amp; Judy Logan Proprietors  http://www.clayscorner.com&lt;/ref&gt;  At midnight on [[New Year's Eve]], instead of [[List of objects dropped on New Year's Eve|dropping an object]], a plexiglass pyramid containing a living [[opossum]] is lowered from the roof of the store.&lt;ref&gt;New Years Eve Lowering of the Opossum http://www.clayscorner.com/new-years-eve.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The animal is lowered carefully to prevent the occurrence of injury or trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Note: The opossum is not actually &quot;dropped&quot;, it is lowered with great care. We treat our little friend with respect, hold him in awe, and do not inflict any injury or traumatize God's creature of the night.  http://www.clayscorner.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
