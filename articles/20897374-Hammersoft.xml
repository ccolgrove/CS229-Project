==History==
15 (Edmonton) Field Ambulane's lineage originates with No. 4 Casualty Clearing Station mobilized in December 1939 as one of the medical units of the 1st Canadian Division for service overseas during the second world war. No. 4 CSS departed Halifax on 30 Jan 1940 embarked in the Empress of Britain and disembarked along the Clyde on 8 Feb 40. The unit was directed to Aldershot were it spent the next three years. The medical services of No. 4 CCS during the windter of 1941-42 were provided in a large country house that accommodated 130 patients. Patients expected to be ill for more than three or four days were transferred from a field ambulance to the CCS.

During the Dieppe raid, No. 4 CCS remained in Dorking, England. Casualties from the battle were evacuated by landing craft back to the casualty reception area at Portsmouth and No. 4 CCS handled the walking wounded.

In 1943 No.4 CCS was sent to Sicily and opented in Catania providing care for sick and injured Canadian soldiers. The unit followed the battle of the 1st Canadian Corps through Ortona to the Gustav Line, on to the Hitler Line and Northern Italy. In 1945, the unit moved to Maresilles, France and to Belgium and finally into Holland. No. 4 CCS opened with attached surgicial and transfusion units in Brackenstein, near Nijmeagon.

At war's end, No. 4 CCS returned to Canada and was re-designated No. 36 Casualty Celaraing Station in the milita. In 1954, the unit was once again re-designated No. 23 Medical Comapnay (Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps). 23 Med Coy trained to achieve the highest standards and won the Ryerson Trophy each year from 1961â1964, and 1972-1974.

In 1978 No. 23 Medical Company was once again redesignated as 15 (Edmonton) Medical Company. In 1991, 14 Medical Platoon of 14 (Calgary) Service Battalion was reassigned and became 15 (Edmonton) Medical Company Detachmet Calgary. In 2004, subsequent to the reorganization of all Canadian Forces medical and dental units into the Canadian Forces Health Services Group, the militia medical companies were re-designated and organized as Reserve field ambulances and the unit became 15 (Edmonton) Field Ambulance with its detachment 15 (Edmonton) Field Ambulance Detachment Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;Unit history, Department of National Defence, http://www.army.dnd.ca/15MEDICAL_COMPANY/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
