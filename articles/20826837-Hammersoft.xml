The '''coat of arms of Singapore''' was adopted in 1959, the year [[Singapore]] became self-governing within the [[British Empire]]. The committee that created it, headed by then Deputy Prime Minister [[Toh Chin Chye]], was also responsible for the [[Flag of Singapore|national flag]] and the [[Majulah Singapura|national anthem]]. At the centre of the emblem is a red shield bearing a white crescent and five white stars (representing various national ideals including multiculturalism), supported by a [[Asiatic lion|lion]] and a [[Malayan tiger|tiger]] (representing Singapore and [[Malaysia]] respectively); below them is a blue ribbon inscribed with ''[[Majulah Singapura]]'' in gold, [[Malay language|Malay]] for &quot;Onward Singapore&quot;. While the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the government, the symbol enjoys wide use on the [[Singapore dollar|national currency]] and state decorations, and appears on the cover of the [[Singapore passport|national passport]].

== History ==
When Singapore became self-governing in 1959 Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] determined to create for the new state a coat of arms, among other symbols, to replace the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] that had been in use until then.&lt;ref name=singapedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwww.singapedia.com.sg/entries/s/state_crest.html |title=State Crest |accessdate=2008-12-25 |year=2008 |work=Singapore: The Encyclopedia |publisher=Editions Didier Millet and the National Heritage Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was formed to design the state symbols, headed by the deputy prime minister [[Toh Chin Chye]], who wanted both the arms and flag of Singapore to represent the country's united, multi-ethnic society. The coat of arms and the flag were created over a span of two months by Toh and his committee. A law establishing the state symbols of Singapore was presented to the National Assembly by the Minister of Culture, [[S Rajaratnam]], and approved in November 1959. On 3 December 1959, the state coat of arms, flag and anthem were presented to the people of Singapore for the first time.&lt;ref name=infopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_54_2005-01-25.html |title=National coat of arms (State crest) |accessdate=2008-12-25 |author=Zaubidah Mohamed |date=9 June 2003 |work=Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toh said in a 1989 interview that when tasked with the creation of the state symbols, &quot;apart from the anthem we have to produce the flag and the crest&quot;, and he felt that the new flag of Singapore should be flying next to the [[Union Jack]].&lt;ref name=toh&gt;{{Cite document|last=Toh|first=Chin Chye|authorlink=Toh Chin Chye|title=Dr. Toh Chin Chye [oral history interview, accession no. A1063, reel 1]|publisher=National Archives of Singapore|year=1989|postscript=.}}: {{cite web|title=State symbols|url=http://www.a2o.com.sg/a2o/public/html/etc/07_symbol.htm|publisher=Access to Archives Online (a2o), National Archives of Singapore|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toh further stated about the design:

{{quote|In the case of the state crest, again we got the five stars and the new moon&amp;nbsp;... A lion next to the tiger. Tiger of course is a more local animal than the lion. The old City Council had a lion. It did merge with our own ideas of self governing of Singapore.&lt;ref name=toh/&gt;}}

== Symbolism ==
The central emblem of the coat of arms is a red shield with five white stars resting above a white crescent, similar to the crescent and stars used on the [[Flag of Singapore|Singapore flag]] and such other national symbols as the [[Red Ensign of Singapore|national ensign for civilian ships]]. Red symbolises &quot;universal brotherhood and equality of man&quot; and white &quot;pervading and everlasting purity and virtue&quot;. The crescent &quot;represents a young nation on the ascendant&quot;, while the stars &quot;stand for the nation's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Second Schedule of the [http://www.sg/explore/Singapore_Arms_And_Flag_And_National_Anthem_Rules.pdf Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules] (Cap. 296, R 1, 2004 Rev.

== Uses ==
[[File:Singapore 10 cent coin.jpg|thumb|150px|Reverse of the 10 cent coin, with the coat of arms in the centre]]
[[File:Golden coat of arms of Singapore (cropped) - 20081001.jpg|thumb|The coat of arms of Singapore depicted on the main gate of the [[Istana (Singapore)|Istana]], the official residence of the [[President of Singapore]]]]

In 1985 the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] (MAS) began to issue their second series of coins. The coat of arms is displayed on the reverse side of these coins, surrounded by an inscription comprising the name of Singapore in the four official languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English) and the year of minting. In 1987 the dollar coin entered circulation with this same pattern.&lt;ref name=coin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency_info/coins/second_series/Singapore_Circulation_Coins_Second_Series.html |title=Singapore Circulation Coins â Second Series |accessdate=2008-12-24 |date=19 March 2007 |publisher=Monetary Authority of Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MAS, the coat of arms has also appeared on all Singaporean banknotes since the &quot;Orchid&quot; series of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency_info/notes/orchid_series/Singapore_Circulation_Notes_Orchid_Series.html |title=Singapore Circulation Notes â Orchid Series |accessdate=2008-12-24 |date=19 March 2007 |publisher=Monetary Authority of Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt; State decorations of Singapore also depict the coat of arms on the medallions. For example, the medallions of the [[Darjah Utama Temasek]] and the [[Sijil Kemuliaan]] use the full achievement of arms,&lt;ref name=temasek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/NationalHonoursandAwards/Darjah+Utama+Temasek+(The+Order+of+Temasek).htm |title=National Honours and Awards â The Order of Temasek |accessdate=2008-12-24 |date=11 December 2008 |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=certhonour&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/NationalHonoursandAwards/Sijil+Kemuliaan+(The+Certificate+of+Honour).htm |title=National Honours and Awards â The Certificate of Honour |accessdate=2008-12-24 |date=26 September 2008 |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang]] medal displays the shield.&lt;ref name=cemerlang&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/NationalHonoursandAwards/Darjah+Utama+Bakti+Cemerlang+(The+Distinguished+Service+Order).htm |title=National Honours and Awards â The Distinguished Service Order |accessdate=2008-12-24 |date=26 September 2008 |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidelines ==
According to the ''Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules'', the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the government. Without explicit permission from the [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts]] (MICA), no person or group is permitted to physically print, manufacture, display or sell anything depicting the coat of arms, or to allow such actions to happen. It is also forbidden to use any symbol that can be easily mistaken for the coat of arms. Persons who wish to use the coat of arms in a literary work must also obtain prior permission from MICA. The only exception provided by the ''Rules'' is that the arms can be used by government officials and ministries on their building's exteriors and on printed documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sg/explore/Singapore_Arms_And_Flag_And_National_Anthem_Rules.pdf Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules] (Cap. 296, R 1, 2004 Rev.
