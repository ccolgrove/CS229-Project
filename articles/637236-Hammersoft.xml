The '''Fish River Canyon''' is located in the south of [[Namibia]]. It is the second largest canyon in the world and the largest in [[Africa]], as well as the second most visited tourist attraction in Namibia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} It features a gigantic ravine, in total about {{convert|100|mi|km}} long, up to 27 km wide and in places almost 550 metres deep.  

The [[Fish River, Nambia|Fish River]] is the longest interior river in Namibia. It cuts deep into the plateau which is today dry, stony and sparsely covered with hardy drought-resistant plants. The river flows [[River#Classification|intermittently]], usually flooding in late summer; the rest of the year it becomes a chain of long narrow pools. At the lower end of the Fish River Canyon, the hot springs resort of [[Ai-Ais Hot Springs|Ai-Ais]] is situated.

Public view points are near [[Hobas]], a camp site 70 km north of Ai-Ais. This part of the canyon is part of the  [[Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park]].  The other 90 km of this canyon are privately owned.

Upstream the river runs through horizontal dolomite strata. These strata formed part of the canyon about 650 million years ago when plate movement cracked the earth, the first process in the formation of the Fish River Canyon.

Lower down, a [[granite]] complex system is exposed to form a characteristic river bed that results in forms like Fingerspitze.  In this area, a fault runs north-south, which accounts for the gorge-like channel and the presence of hot sulphurous springs.

The ''Fish River Hiking Trail''  starts at Hobas and ends {{convert|85|km|mi}} further south at Ai Ais. No facilities are available and hikers sleep outdoors for the entire trip which usually takes 3 to 5 days to complete.

Due to flash floods and high summer temperatures which frequently exceed 45Â°C, the hike is only open in winter. The season starts 1 May and ends 15 September (winter time in the Southern Hemisphere). A medical certificate is required to attempt the hike, and groups must consist of at least 3 participants older than 12 years.
