'''Daemon Tools''' (styled '''DAEMON Tools''' by its creators) is a [[Virtual drive|disk image emulator]] and [[optical disc authoring software|optical disc authoring program]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Daemon Tools was originally a furtherance in the development of another program, ''Generic SafeDisc emulator'', and incorporated all of its features. The program claims to be able to defeat most [[copy protection]] schemes such as [[SafeDisc]] and [[SecuROM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.daemon-tools.cc/gamedb.php?letter=all|title=Supported games and protections database}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7. DAEMON Tools has a special mode for proper operation of copies of discs with advanced protection ([[SafeDisc]], [[SecuRom]] and [[LaserLock]], CDCOPS, [[StarForce]] and Protect CD), which are used on some discs with games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/news/bbe0f423e15c028735eadcce333289e6 |title=DAEMON Tools Lite 4.35.5 represents full Windows 7 support |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
Versions prior to v4.00 had only one edition. That edition was [[freeware]], had no [[adware]], and was solely an imaging disc-emulation software (no image conversion, creation, burning, and so forth).

Currently, four editions of the product exist: Lite, Pro Standard, Pro Advanced, and Net. DAEMON Tools Net is an enterprise-oriented edition containing modern network features. A feature comparison is given below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/compare|title=DAEMON-Tools.cc :: Products :: Compare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Y.A.S.U (Yet Another SecuROM Utility) is a very small tool that works as a &quot;SCSI-drive protector&quot;. It was created by sYk0, who also created [[CureROM]] (but CureROM uses an alternative method to protect SCSI drives)
Itâs a simple utility that can be used to hide emulated drives from [[SecuROM|SecuROM 7]] and [[SafeDisc|SafeDisc 4]]. YASU is a companion program for Daemon Tools and currently being hosted, supported and maintained by the Daemon Tools team. On March 4 of 2009, sYk0 announced development of '''Omen''' which is to succeed development of YASU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.daemon-tools.cc/f40/omen-future-anti-blacklists-near-23216/ Omen: The future of Anti-Blacklists is near... - THE DAEMON TOOLS FORUM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010, development of Omen has been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.daemon-tools.cc/f40/omen-future-anti-blacklists-near-23216/index4.html#post123255 Omen: The future of Anti-Blacklists is near... - Page 4 - THE DAEMON TOOLS FORUM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==File format==
The default file format of Daemon Tools is Media Data eXtended (MDX). MDX is a [[disc image]] file format similar to [[MDS file|MDS/MDF images]]. It supports all of MDS/MDF format features except that all data is in one monolithic file only. The files of these types bear the filename extension of &lt;tt&gt;.mdx&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  |publisher = File-Extensions.org

  |accessdate = 15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
MDX file contains [[metadata]] of original media - specifically the main physical parameters of disc, such as layer breaks, sessions, tracks and other. It could be described as being an archive file containing all data from a CD/DVD. It also supports [[data compression]]. MDX file includes the [[magic number]] &quot;MEDIA DESCRIPTOR&quot; at the beginning of the file.
