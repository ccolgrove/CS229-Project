The '''Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey''' team is the [[college ice hockey]] team that represents [[Michigan State University]] (MSU). The team plays at the [[Munn Ice Arena]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], on the MSU campus. The current head [[Coach (ice hockey)|coach]] is [[Tom Anastos]], who took over coaching duties on March 23, 2011, after [[Rick Comley]] announced his retirement. Since the [[Big Ten Conference]] does not yet sponsor Division I ice hockey, Michigan State currently competes in the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]] (CCHA). Along with the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Ohio State University]], it is one of three [[Big Ten]] schools in the CCHA.

The MSU ice hockey program has seven CCHA regular season championships and 11 [[CCHA Tournament]] titles.  MSU has also won 12 [[Great Lakes Invitational]] titles.  The Spartans have been in the NCAA tournament 23 times, with nine [[Frozen Four]] appearances and three national titles (1966, [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament|1986]], and [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament|2007]]). On April 7, 2007, the Michigan State Spartans won their third Collegiate Championship by beating [[Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey|Boston College]] 3-1.  [[MichiganâMichigan State ice hockey rivalry|Their traditional rival]] is [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan]] and the teams have played an annual game at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] since 1990.

==History==
===Early history===
The Spartan Ice Hockey program traces its roots back to the first informal varsity team that began in 1922 playing an independent NCAA Division I schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;seasons&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|work=U.S. College Hockey Online|url=http://www.uscho.com/stats/history/michigan-state/mens-hockey/2010-2011/|title=Michigan State Men's Hockey Team History|date=1996-2011|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 1922, Michigan State played its first intercollegiate hockey game, a 1-5 loss to [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan]].&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msuspartans.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/msu/sports/m-hockey/auto_pdf/10-full-mg|title=Spartan Hockey Media Guide 2010-11|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|year=2010|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan State finished 0-3 in the 1922 season and picked up its first win during the second season on February 11, 1923, 6-1 over the Lansing Independents.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; The team did not play the 1923-24 season but returned for the 1924-25 season. The 1924-25 season marked the first time the program had a head coach, [[John H. Kobs]], who also coached the [[Michigan State Spartans#Other sports|Michigan State Spartans baseball team]].&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; Kobs' tenure at Michigan State lasted six season before the team was suspended for 19 seasons. During which time the team compiled a record of 8-18-1.&lt;ref name=&quot;seasons&quot;/&gt;

[[Harold Paulsen]] was hired as the varsity ice hockey coach at Michigan State on August 1, 1948 following the suspension of the hockey programs during the years of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; Before recruiting or coaching, Paulsen oversaw the renovation of [[Demonstration Hall]] into an indoor rink with artificial ice-making capabilities. On January 12, 1950, MSU played its first game since 1930, losing to [[Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey|Michigan Tech]] 6-2. Paulsen struggled through his first two years at Michigan State with a 6-25 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;seasons&quot;/&gt; MSU athletic director Ralph Young felt the hockey program's progress was inadequate and Paulsen resigned.  Following the 1951 season, [[Amo Bessone]] accepted the head coaching position at Michigan State University. Bessone would remain at MSU for the next 28 years.

===Amo Bessone era===
When Bessone arrived at Michigan State, the ice hockey program was beginning its third full season after being reinstated. That same season, in 1951-52, the Spartans joined [[Colorado College Tigers men's ice hockey|Colorado College]], [[Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey|Denver]], Michigan, Michigan Tech, [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|Minnesota]], and [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey|North Dakota]] as founding members of the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association|Midwest Collegiate Hockey League]] (MCHL).&lt;ref name=&quot;wcha&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]|url=http://www.wcha.com/men/wcha/history.php|title=WCHA History Tradition and Success|year=2010|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amo Bessone won his first collegiate hockey game as head coach on November 29, 1951, when the Spartans defeated [[Ontario Agricultural College]] 8-2.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; The Spartans struggled with six losing seasons before Bessone turned things around in his seventh season as coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;seasons&quot;/&gt; In 1957-58, Michigan State enjoyed its first winning season. The following season, Bessone guided MSU to a Big Ten championship and a berth in the [[1959 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|NCAA tournament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1959ncaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ESPN|Inside Colelge Hockey]]|url=http://insidecollegehockey.com/6History/ncaa_59.htm|title=1959 NCAA Tournament|date=2002-04|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament was MSU's first [[Frozen Four|NCAA]] tournament appearance. The Spartans defeated [[Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey|Boston College]] 4-3 in the semifinals and advanced to the schools's first championship appearance. The Spartans lost the 1959 national championship game in overtime 3-4 to North Dakota. MSU finishes the season 17-6-1.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; Michigan State became a charter member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) in 1959.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; The WCHA was a reincarnation of the loosely affiliated Midwest Collegiate Hockey League and Western Intercollegiate Hockey League that disbanded following the 1957-58 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;wcha&quot;/&gt; Bessone and MSU struggled during the first five seasons of the WCHA. Again, Bessone turned things around with a winning season in 1964-65. The following season, Bessone coached Michigan State to an improbable NCAA National Championship.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1966ncaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ESPN|Inside Colelge Hockey]]|url=http://insidecollegehockey.com/6History/ncaa_66.htm|title=1966 NCAA Tournament|date=2002-04|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSU began the 1965-66 season 4-10,&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; but rebounded winning 12 of their last 15 games including defeating the defending national champion, Michigan Tech, to win the WCHA playoffs after finishing sixth in the regular season.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; The win earned MSU a spot in the [[1966 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1966 NCAA tournament]].&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; In the national semifinals, Bessone upset highly-favored [[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]] 2-1 with a goal by Spartan forward, [[Doug Volmar]].&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; In the national championship game, Bessone and the Spartans faced [[Len Ceglarski]]'s [[Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey|Clarkson]] team that owned the national-best record of 24-2. On March 19, 1966, Michigan State beat top-ranked Clarkson 6-1 victory to give Michigan State is first national championship.&lt;ref name=seasons/&gt;&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; Len Ceglarski and Amo Bessone shared the [[Spencer Penrose Award]] as the national coach of the year in 1966. The national title and coaching award cemented Bessone's legacy as a coach. To this day, Bessone's 1966 Michigan State team remains one of the biggest underdog stories in NCAA ice hockey history. The total number of team victories (16) and team winning percentage (.551) is the lowest of any NCAA ice hockey champion. MSU made the NCAA tournament again with a strong WCHA playoff finish in 1967, but lost 2-4 in the national semifinals, a rematch of the 1966 NCAA Tournament against Boston University.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt;

Bessone began the 1970s with six straight winning seasons. During Bessone's time coaching the Spartans the team won MSU won its first [[Great Lakes Invitational]] by defeating Michigan Tech 5-4 on December 28, 1973.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt;

As MSU hockey was building momentum, [[Munn Ice Arena]] opened October 25, 1974, when Michigan State hosted [[Laurentian University|Laurentian]].&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; That same season saw the first sellout crowd in Munn's history when the Spartans defeated North Dakota 6-2.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; A season later, in 1975-76, Bessone guided MSU to its best WCHA conference record of 20-12-0 before Minnesota knocked MSU out of the WCHA playoffs in 6-7 triple overtime loss.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; Minnesota, who had finished below Michigan State in the conference, received an NCAA tournament bid instead. Bessone announced his retirement effective at the end of the 1978-79 season after three straight losing seasons.&lt;ref name=seasons/&gt; Bessone coached his final game as head coach on March 3, 1979, when the Spartans defeated rival Michigan 5-3.&lt;ref name=seasons/&gt;

===Ron Mason era===
[[Image:The Cold War UofM v.s MSU.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&quot;The Cold War&quot;]]
After Amo Bessone retired from Michigan State University, the MSU Athletic Director, Joseph Kearney, hired [[Ron Mason]] as the Spartans new head coach. Mason was named Spartan head coach on April 1, 1979, and spend the next 23 seasons at Michigan State. It was a rough start in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association for Mason as he compiled a record of 26-46-2 over two seasons. Michigan State joined the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]] (CCHA) in 1981 and over the next few seasons Mason turned the hockey program around. The Spartans won CCHA playoff championships the first four straight seasons of the conference in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985.&lt;ref name=seasons/&gt; MSU would win a second national title in [[1986 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1986]] when the Spartans defeated [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey|Harvard]] 6-5.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1986ncaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ESPN|Inside Colelge Hockey]]|url=http://insidecollegehockey.com/6History/ncaa_86.htm|title=1986 NCAA Tournament|date=2002-04|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 CCHA coaches and athletic directors unanimous voted to renamed the CCHA championship trophy to the [[Mason Cup]] in honor of Ron Mason, who was a key figure in establishing the conference in the early 1970s prior to his tenure at Michigan State. During the 2000-01 season Michigan State finished first in the regular season and advanced through the CCHA Tournament winning the first ever Mason Cup.&lt;ref name=seasons/&gt;&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; That same season the Spartans made a Frozen Four appearance by beating [[Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey|Wisconsin]] 5-1 before losing to North Dakota in the Semifinal game.&lt;ref name=&quot;2001ncaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ESPN|Inside Colelge Hockey]]|url=http://insidecollegehockey.com/6History/ncaa_01.htm|title=2001 NCAA Tournament|date=2002-04|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 2001, the Spartans hosted an outdoor game at [[Spartan Stadium]] against rival Michigan known as [[Cold War (ice hockey)|The Cold War]]. The school would set an attendance record for an outdoor hockey game as 74,554 fans attended.&lt;ref&gt;Hockeyâs Book of Firsts, p.72, James Duplacey, JG Press, ISBN 978-1-57215-037-9&lt;/ref&gt; The game ended in a 3&amp;ndash;3 tie.

Mason lead Michigan State to seven CCHA regular season titles and a conference-record 10 CCHA tournament titles. In addition, MSU under Mason made 19 NCAA tournament appearances during his 23 seasons with the Spartans.&lt;ref name=seasons/&gt; He coached MSU to five NCAA Frozen Fours, two National Championship appearances, and one National Championship.&lt;ref name=seasons/&gt; Mason coached two [[Hobey Baker Memorial Award]] winners, [[Kip Miller]] in 1990 and [[Ryan Miller]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://msuspartans.cstv.com/sports/m-hockey/archive/msu-m-hockey-hobeybaker.html|title=Hobey Baker Memorial Award |publisher=MSU Spartans }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rick Comley===
[[Image:MichiganState hockey 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey team in 2008]]

Rick Comley was announced as Ron Mason's successor as head ice hockey coach at Michigan State University in March 2002.&lt;ref name=1011mediaguide/&gt; Comley lead the Spartans to a tournament appearance in 2004, his second season as MSU's head coach. After losing to [[Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey|Northern Michigan]] in the [[2004 CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2004 CCHA Tournament]] the Spartans received an at-large bid to the [[2004 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2004 NCAA Tournament]]. Third ranked MSU fell to second seed [[Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey|Minnesota-Duluth]] in the opening round 0-5.&lt;ref name=&quot;2004ncaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ESPN|Inside Colelge Hockey]]|url=http://insidecollegehockey.com/6History/ncaa_04.htm|title=2004 NCAA Tournament|date=2002-04|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comley's Spartans returned to the NCAA Tournament in [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2006]] after missing the NCAA Tournament in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;seasons&quot;/&gt; Comley guided MSU to a second-place CCHA finish in the regular season and a [[Mason Cup|CCHA Mason Cup Championship]] in [[2006 CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2006]]. Michigan State advanced into the 2006 Tournament with an automatic bid. The Spartans defeated [[New Hampshire Wildcats men's ice hockey|New Hampshire]] 1-0 before losing to [[Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey|Maine]] 4-5 in the East Regional Final.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006ncaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ESPN|Inside Colelge Hockey]]|url=http://insidecollegehockey.com/6History/ncaa_06.htm|title=2006 NCAA Tournament|date=2002-04|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006-07 season, Michigan State was preseason ranked No. 5, which was MSU's highest preseason ranking since October 2001. The team earned an [[2007 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] bid after finishing the regular season with a conference record of . Comley led MSU to defeat three higher-ranked teams en route to the national championship including No. 1-ranked [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey|Notre Dame]] in the Midwest Regional final.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007ncaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ESPN|Inside Colelge Hockey]]|url=http://insidecollegehockey.com/6History/ncaa_07.htm|title=2007 NCAA Tournament|date=2002-04|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Frozen Four the team defeated  defeated No. 4-ranked Boston College in the National Championship game on April 7, 2007, by a score of 3&amp;ndash;1 in a game that saw Michigan State score three unanswered goals in the third period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://msuspartans.cstv.com/sports/m-hockey/recaps/040707aaa.html|title=Last-Minute Tally Hands Spartans Third NCAA Title Michigan State scores three times in the final period to beat Boston College 3-1|publisher=MSU Spartans|date=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 the Michigan State Spartans and Michigan Wolverines played a second outdoor game at [[Michigan Stadium]]. The game, known as [[The Big Chill at the Big House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Florek|first=Michael|work=College Hockey News|url=http://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2010/12/09_teams_ready_for_big_chill.phptitle=Teams Ready for Big Chill at Big House|date=December 9, 2010|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place on December 11, 2010. 104,173 fans filled Michigan Stadium and watched as Michigan beat Michigan State 5-0.

===Big Ten Conference===
In September 2010 [[Penn State University]] announced that the university was elevating its men's and women's [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] club programs to varsity status. Then-CCHA commissioner Tom Anastos publicly stated that the CCHA would strongly consider adding [[Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey|Penn State]] as the conference's 12th member.&lt;ref name=&quot;attractive&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gholston|first=Sandy|work=[[Mlive.com]]|url=http://blog.mlive.com/crimson_and_gold_report/2010/08/anastos_to_the_detroit_news_penn_state_very_attractive_to_the_ccha.html|title=Anastos to the Detroit News: Penn State 'very attractive' to the CCHA|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced plans to sponsor men's ice hockey starting in 2013â14 season.

=== Spartan Hobey Baker winners ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The [[Hobey Baker Memorial Award]] has been presented annually since 1981 to the outstanding college hockey player in the United States by the Decathlon Athletic Club of Bloomington, Minnesota. The award is named after college hockey great Hobey Baker of Princeton, a member of both the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth, Minn., and the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. Also a standout in football, he is also a member of the National Football Hall of Fame. Baker's brilliant skating and stickhandling abilities allowed him to dominate the college game and lead Princeton to the Intercollegiate League Championship in each of his three years of varsity hockey (1911â14). He added to his physical prowess the exemplary qualities of being a completely unselfish sportsman and an opponent of publicity. Facts about Baker's career often sound more like myths, such as the story of his playing every second of a 73-minute game against Harvard, or the claim that he was penalized just twice during his career, and both times the mere suggestion that he had violated a rule of the game nearly drove him to tears. To date, two Spartans have won the Hobey Baker Memorial Award: Cousins Kip and Ryan Miller.

Spartan center [[Kip Miller]] was the recipient of the 10th Hobey Baker Memorial Award in 1990 after leading the nation in scoring for the second consecutive season with 101 points on 48 goals and 53 assists. A two-time first-team All-Central Collegiate Hockey Association honoree, Miller was recognized as the league's Player of the Year after leading the conference in scoring for the second straight season with 36 goals and 38 assists for 74 points. In MSU's career record books, the two-time first-team All-America selection finished third in goals (116), assists (145) and points (261). He closed out his career among the NCAA's top 25 all-time point producers. Over the course of his four seasons, the Spartans won three CCHA regular season and playoff titles and amassed an impressive 132-45-9 record. The 1989-90 Hockey News/Bauer College Hockey Player of the Year also led the Spartans to their ninth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance as a senior.

In 2001, Michigan State goaltender [[Ryan Miller (ice hockey)|Ryan Miller]] backstopped the Spartans into the [[Frozen Four]] as the number-one team in the nation. Miller shattered the NCAA record for career shutouts in just his second year of college hockey, with 18 overall. The sophomore's selection made him just the second goaltender ever to win the Hobey Baker. Minnesota netminder Robb Stauber was the first, in 1988. To win the award, Miller edged forwards Brian Gionta of Boston College and Jeff Panzer of North Dakota, who tied for second place in the balloting. The native of East Lansing, Michigan, posted 31 wins with a .950 save percentage and a 1.32 goals against average, leading the nation in all three categories. His 31-5-4 record in 2000-2001 included 10 shutouts to also lead the nation in that statistic. Miller, the CCHA Defensive Player of the Week five times during the season, was previously named a First-Team All-American and CCHA Player of the Year, as well as being a member of the all-conference first team. He holds four league and seven school netminding records. Ryan was a general business management major with a 3.07 grade point average. Off-ice activities for the All-Academic goalie included volunteering with the D.A.R.E. drug-resistance program, reading to elementary-school children and giving tours of the dressing room â sometimes during games.  Ryan Miller currently plays for the [[NHL]]'s [[Buffalo Sabres]] and Kip Miller plays for the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]].
