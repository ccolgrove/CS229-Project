The '''University of California, Santa Cruz''', also known as '''UC Santa Cruz''' or '''UCSC''', is a [[public university|public]], [[residential college|collegiate]] [[university]]; one of ten campuses in the [[University of California]].

  | title = Campus Overview | publisher = UC Santa Cruz

  | accessdate = February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; UC Santa Cruz began as a showcase for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. Since then, it has evolved into a modern research university with a wide variety of both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation for strong undergraduate support and student political activism. The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.

==History==
Although some of the original founders had already outlined plans for an institution like UCSC as early as the 1930s, the opportunity to realize their vision did not present itself until the City of Santa Cruz made a bid to the [[Regents of the University of California|University of California Regents]] in the mid-1950s to build a campus just outside town, in the foothills of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;City council hasn't told&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Santa Cruz was selected for the beauty, rather than the practicality, of its location, however, and its remoteness led to the decision to develop a residential college system that would house most of the students on-campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;McHenry UCSC origins&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

===Impact on Santa Cruz===
Although the city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] already exhibited a strong [[conservation ethic]] before the founding of the university, the coincidental rise of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to [[environmentalism]] that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC to pay for the impacts of campus growth. A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on the ballot. In 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookwalter&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|title=Suits over UCSC growth settled: City, county, neighbors reach deal; university agrees to concessions over roads, water and housing|last=Bookwalter|first=Genevieve|date=2008-08-09|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Blumenthal, UCSC's 10th Chancellor, intends to mitigate growth constraints in Santa Cruz by developing off-campus sites in [[Silicon Valley]].

===Budget cuts===
In a Faculty Senate meeting on May 21, 2009, Chancellor George Blumenthal described budget cuts that would be needed because of a 20 percent drop in state funding.  While he said that the ultimate amount of these cuts were unknown, he said that they would be above the $13 million already cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Extent of deeper cuts for UCSC unknown |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_12417155 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UCSC chancellor's office, UCSC is receiving a budget cut of $52.3 million for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 fiscal years, as of July 23, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCSC Townhall Budget Facts for Staff |url=http://www.ucsc.edu/budget_update/townhall.7-23-09.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, UCSC will be undergo a furlough and pay cut program along with all other UC campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UC Regents Endorse Emergency Fiscal Proposal |url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/?p=629 |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The {{convert|6651|acre|ha|adj=on}} UCSC campus is located {{convert|75|mi|km}} south of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], in the Ben Lomond Mountain ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Elevation varies from {{convert|285|ft|m}} at the campus entrance to {{convert|1,195|ft|m}} at the northern boundary, a difference of about {{convert|900|ft|m}}. The southern portion of the campus primarily consists of a large, open [[meadow]], locally known as the Great Meadow. To the north of the meadow lie most of the campus' buildings, many of them among [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] groves. The campus is bounded on the south by the city's upper-west-side neighborhoods, on the east by Harvey West Park&lt;ref&gt;

A number of shrines, dens and other student-built curiosities are scattered around the northern campus. These structures, mostly assembled from branches and other forest detritus, were formerly concentrated in the area known as Elfland, a glen the University razed in 1992 to build colleges Nine and Ten. Students were able to relocate and save some of the structures, however.&lt;ref&gt;

Creeks traverse the UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The footbridges make it possible to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UCSC Walking Map | url=http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flickr: Oaks Path Night | url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/exitfromreality/55520898/ |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of natural points of interest throughout the UCSC grounds. The &quot;Porter Caves&quot; are a popular site among students on the west side of campus. The entrance is located in the forest between the [[Porter College]] meadow and Empire Grade Road. The caves wind through a set of caverns, some of which are challenging, narrow passages. Tree Nine is another popular destination for students. A large [[Douglas Fir]] spanning approximately {{convert|103|ft|m}} tall, Tree Nine is located in the upper campus of UCSC behind [[College Nine]]. Complete with a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} rope ladder to the first branch and a flat wooden platform at its peak, Tree Nine boasts an impressive view of the Monterey Bay. Unfortunately, due to high visitation, the understory plants and soil below Tree Nine have been trampled, and climbers have worn the bark off of many of the branches. For specific directions, reference: [http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Tree-Nine-at-the-University-of-California-in-Santa-Cruz directions to Tree Nine] For the less experienced tree-climber, students also frequent Sunset Tree located on the east side of the meadow behind the UCSC Music Center.&lt;ref&gt;

The combination of porous limestone bedrock with torrential coastal winter rains can lead to sinkholes; there are two such 'bottomless' pits across from the Science Hill complex. The Jack Baskin Engineering Building, formerly known as the Applied Sciences Building, began sinking shortly after it was built; in the late 1970s, hundreds of tons of concrete were poured underneath its foundation to prevent it from sinking.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The UCSC campus is also one of the few homes to [[Mima Mounds]] in the United States. They are extremely rare in the United States, and, indeed, in the world in general.

Interdisciplinary programs, such as Feminist Studies, American Studies, Environmental Studies, Digital Arts and New Media, and the unique [[History of Consciousness]] Department are also hosted alongside UCSC's more traditional academic departments.

In an effort to cut $13 million, as required by the University of California office of the President and Board of Regents in a decision to cut 10% from the budget of each campus, UCSC nearly eliminated its longstanding and sometimes controversial undergraduate major Community Studies in 2009. The interdisciplinary major continues to be offered, though cuts to department staff raised concern by students that the curriculum has already been seriously damaged. Community Studies and other majors within the Social Sciences division, including some graduate programs, remain threatened by more cuts expected in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_12295850|title=Community Studies takes first cuts: UCSC staffers get pink slips in wake of $13 million deficit|last=Bookwalter|first=Genevieve|date=2009-05-05|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Although designed as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level [[natural science]] research component with the appointment of plant physiologist [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] as the first provost of [[Crown College, University of California, Santa Cruz|Crown College]]. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060714160609/http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archivedate=2006-07-14|title=Kenneth V.

==Residential colleges==
[[Image:BaskEng1Entr.JPG|thumb|Approaching Baskin Engineering from McLaughlin Drive]]
The undergraduate program, with only the partial exception of those majors run through the University's School of Engineering, is still based on the version of the &quot;[[residential college|residential college system]]&quot; outlined by Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry at the inception of their original plans for the campus (see [[University of California, Santa Cruz#History|History]], above). Upon admission, all undergraduate students have the opportunity to choose one of ten colleges, with which they usually stay affiliated for their entire undergraduate careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegesection&quot;&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
There are cases where some students switch college affiliations as each college holds a different graduation ceremony.
Almost all faculty members are affiliated with a college as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt;
The individual colleges provide housing and dining services, while the university as a whole offers courses and majors to the general student community.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; Other universities with similar college systems include [[Rice University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

Each of the colleges has its own, distinctive architectural style and a resident faculty [[provost (education)|provost]], who is the nominal head of his or her college.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; An incoming first-year student will take a mandatory &quot;core course&quot; within his or her respective college, with a curriculum and central theme unique to that college.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; College resident populations vary from about 750 to 1,550 students, with roughly half of undergraduates living on campus within their college community or in smaller, intramural campus communities such as the International Living Center, the Trailer Park, and the Village.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; Coursework, academic majors and general areas of study are not limited by college membership, although colleges host the offices of many academic departments. Graduate students are not affiliated with a residential college, though a large portion of their offices, too, have historically tended to be based in the colleges. The ten colleges are, in order of establishment:

===Enrollment and retention===
[[Image:Bridge across ravine at UCSC.jpg|thumb|Bridge across ravine.]]
In 2008, UCSC offered admission to a record number of 19,138 new undergraduate students out of 25,746 applications for the Fall term, representing an increase in selectivity to 74.3 percent from 82.8 percent admitted in 2007. In 2009, UCSC offered admission to 63.7% of applicants. UCSC hopes to contain the entering class to about 3,700 students.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Fall 2006 semester, UCSC enrolled 13,941 undergraduates and 1,419 graduate and postgraduate students, for a student body total of 15,360.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, [[graduation]] and retention rates are above national averages but below the mean among UC campuses. Among students who entered in 1999, 70% graduated within six years, ten percentage points below the UC average. Earlier statistics show that the six-year graduation rate is above the mean for both NCAA Division I schools and a sample of major universities throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

===Grading===
For most of its history, UCSC employed a unique [[Grading in the United States|student evaluation]] system. With the exception of the choice of letter grades in science courses the only [[grade (education)|grades]] assigned were &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;no record&quot;, supplemented with [[narrative evaluation]]s. Beginning in 1997, UCSC allowed students the option of selecting letter grade evaluations, but course grades were still optional until 2000, when faculty voted to require students receive letter grades. Students were still given narrative evaluations to complement the letter grades. {{As of|2010}}, the narrative evaluations were deemed an unnecessary expenditure. Still, some professors write evaluations for all students while some would write evaluations for specific students upon request.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Students can still elect to receive a &quot;pass/no pass&quot; grade, but many academic programs limit or even forbid pass/no pass grading. A grade of C and above would receive a grade of &quot;pass&quot;. Overall, students may now earn no more than 25% of their UCSC credits on a &quot;pass/no pass&quot; basis. Although the default grading option for almost all courses offered is now &quot;graded&quot;, most course grades are still accompanied by written evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;

==Library==
[[Image:McHenry Library stacks, University of California Santa Cruz.jpg|thumb|McHenry Library stacks]]
The [[McHenry Library]] houses UCSC's arts and letters collection, with most of the scientific reading at the newer Science and Engineering Library. The McHenry Library was designed by [[John Carl Warnecke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;/&gt; In addition, the colleges host smaller libraries, which serve as quiet places to study. The McHenry Special Collections Library includes the archives of [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the largest collection of [[Edward Weston]] photographs in the country, the [[mycology]] book collection of composer [[John Cage]], a large collection of works by [[Satyajit Ray]], the [[Hayden White]] collection of 16th century Italian printing, a photography collection with nearly half a million items, and the Mary Lea Shane Archive. The latter contains an extensive collection of photographs, letters, and other documents related to [[Lick Observatory]] dating back to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;

UC Santa Cruz is also well known for its [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] culture. On April 20, 2007, approximately 2000 UCSC students gathered at Porter Meadow to celebrate the annual &quot;420.&quot; Students and others openly smoked marijuana while campus police stood by.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The once student-only event has grown since the city of Santa Cruz passed [[Measure K 2006|Measure K]] in 2006, an ordinance making marijuana use a low-priority crime for police. The 2007 event attracted a total of 5,000 participants. The university does not condone the gathering, but has taken steps to regulate the event and ensure security for all participants. On April 20, 2010, the school administration shut down the west entrance to campus and limited the amount of buses that could drive through campus.&lt;ref&gt;

Another well known tradition is what is known as &quot;[[First Rain]]&quot;. Students run around campus naked or nearly naked to celebrate the school year's first night of heavy rain. The run begins at Porter and proceeds to travel through all the other colleges, finishing with skinny dipping at OPERS swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;

===Housing===
Most of the UCSC undergraduate housing is affiliated with one of the ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen to twenty students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas. Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women. Single-gender, gender-neutral and substance-free floors are also available.

All of the colleges, except for Kresge, have both residence halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by four to eight students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and a combination of shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.

In addition to the residential colleges, housing is available at the Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing, transfer, and graduate students; the University Inn, a remodeled hotel in downtown Santa Cruz that accommodates all students; Redwood Grove, formerly Kresge East, now available to applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, also located downtown, that primarily serves international students. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Housing Services |url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek Life===
UCSC is home to many fraternities and sororities. The oldest fraternity on campus is [[Theta Chi]], which was given colony status on January 10, 1987 and later became a full chapter on October 14, 1989 (designation: Theta Iota). In the beginning, fraternities like [[Theta Chi]] and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] were met with strong opposition from the student body. Student groups like P.A.C. (People's Alternative Community), S.A.G.E. (Students Against Greek Environments), and M.A.C. (Men's Alternative Community) protested the existence of Greek life at the UCSC campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxucsc.com/history.html Oxucsc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the campus gained national recognition when MTV's reality show ''[[Fraternity Life]]'' documented the lives of students pledging Delta Omega Chi. During the shooting, a few of the students fished a 15-year-old koi named Midas out of a pond at Porter College, barbecued it, and ate it. Since the incident was captured on video, the individuals involved were charged with misdemeanor grand theft and vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fraternity Life#cite note-6]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since this time, Greek life has flourished at UCSC, making way for fraternities like [[Sigma Pi]], [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Phi Zeta]], [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Sigma Lambda Beta]] and [[Pi Alpha Phi]]. Sororities on campus include [[alpha Kappa Delta Phi]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Sigma Pi Alpha]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]], [[Tri-Chi]], [[Sigma Omicron Pi]], [[Kappa Zeta]], and [[Alpha Psi]]. 

Aside from social fraternities and sororities on campus, there are also a number of professional organizations as well. There are [[Kappa Gamma Delta]], a prehealth sorority, Sigma Mu Delta, a premed fraternity, [[Alpha Phi Omega]], a coed service fraternity, and [[Delta Sigma Pi]], a co-ed professional business fraternity, founded on May 22, 2010, Pi Chi Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm Admissions.sa.ucsc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
[[Image:UCSC East Field.jpg|thumb|East Field]]
UCSC competes in [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as an Independent member. There are twelve [[varsity team|varsity]] sports (men's and women's [[basketball]], tennis, [[Football (soccer)|soccer]], [[volleyball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[diving]], women's [[golf]], and women's [[cross country running|cross country]]). UCSC teams are nationally ranked in [[tennis]], soccer, men's volleyball, and swimming. After defeating Emory to win the 2007 National Championship in men's tennis, UCSC has won six men's tennis team championships, and have been defending champions in tennis for two of the past three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Banana Slugs were also runners-up in men's soccer in 2004. In the 2006 season, the men's water polo team won the Division III championship, as well as an overall ranking of 19th in the nation. However, both the men and women's water polo teams were cut in 2008 due to budget constraints.&lt;ref&gt;

In addition to its NCAA sports, UCSC maintains a number of successful club sides including its women's [[rugby union|rugby]] team, which won the [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] National Collegiate Championship during its '05-'06 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Women's rugby team wins Division II national championship | url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/05-08/brief-rugby.asp | journal=Currents | publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz| volume=10 | date=2006-05-08 | accessdate=2008-01-29 | issue= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCSC also fields an often victorious men's lacrosse team, which competes against other western universities in the WCLL. After a highly successful 2008 season, the team traveled to Texas for nationals. Although UCSC never had a track, the residential colleges regularly competed in an improvised &quot;Slug Run&quot; every spring from 1967 to 1982,&lt;ref&gt;

===Mascot===

UCSC's mascot is the [[banana slug]]&lt;ref name=&quot;UCSC Mascot&quot; /&gt; (specifically, ''Ariolimax dolichophallus'').&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, when the university began participating in NCAA intercollegiate sports, the then-chancellor and some student athletes declared the mascot to be the &quot;[[Sea Lion|sea lions]].&quot; Most students disliked the new mascot and offered an alternative mascot, the banana slug. In 1986, students voted via [[referendum]] to declare the banana slug the official mascot of UCSC â a vote the chancellor refused to honor, arguing that only athletes should choose the mascot. When a poll of athletes showed that they, too, wanted to be &quot;Slugs,&quot; the chancellor relented. The June 16, 1986, issue of ''People'' magazine featured a full-page spread dedicated to the selection of the Banana Slug as the official mascot of UCSC (see page 85).&lt;ref&gt;

The &quot;Fiat Slug&quot; logo prominently featured on campus is a trademark of UCSC owned by the Regents. It was developed by two students during the mascot controversy, who later incorporated as &quot;Oxford West&quot; and licensed their design from the Regents to produce clothing inspired by the university.

The slug also is featured along with the school's logo on [[Vincent Vega]]'s T-shirt during the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
