The '''National Democratic Action Society - Wa'ad''' ({{lang-ar|Ø¬ÙØ¹ÙØ© Ø§ÙØ¹ÙÙ Ø§ÙÙØ·ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¯ÙÙÙØ±Ø§Ø·Ù - ÙØ¹Ø¯}}) is [[Bahrain|Bahrain's]] largest [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[List of political parties in Bahrain|political party]]. It emerged out of the [[Popular Front (Bahrain)|Popular Front]], a radical clandestine opposition movement of [[Maoism|Maoist]], [[socialist]] and [[Arab nationalist]] orientation. Under the reform process initiated by Bahrain's King Hamad, the leaders of the Popular Front returned from exile to participate in the political process through the National Democratic Action. 

The party's origins lie in the split within the Left in the Arab world in the 1960s, between a pro-Moscow camp and a pro-China camp, with the NDA's leaders backing Beijing. The party is the first  licensed political group in any of the [[Arab States of The Gulf]].

Historically the Left in Bahrain had been very strong, partly as a result of the creation of a local [[working class]] through the Kingdom's [[industrialisation]] with the discovery of oil in the 1930s; however the waning of Arab nationalism, the collapse of [[communism]] as an ideology and the rise of the [[Al Wefaq|Islamist Right]] have marginalised the NDA and robbed it of much of its traditional support. The party suffered a very disappointing result in 2002's municipal elections when none of its candidates were elected in any constituency. Despite this, the NDA's leaders are widely respected and retain a great deal of influence in Bahraini society.

The current leader of the party is [[Ibrahim Sharif Al-Sayed]], who took over in 2005 from [[Abdul-Rahman Al Nuaimi]]. In 2005 the party renamed itself ''Wa'ad'' ({{lang-ar|ÙØ¹Ø¯}}), which translates to &quot;Promise&quot;. Other prominent members include: [[Abdul-Nabi Alekri]] , [[Ebrahim KamalAldeen]] , [[Sami Seyadi]] , [[Ali Salih]] and [[Munira Fakhro]]

The party boycotted 2002's parliamentary elections, but took part in the [[Bahraini parliamentary election of 2006]]; among its candidates was its Vice President and former [[Harvard]] academic, [[Munira Fakhro]], who contested an [[Isa Town]] constituency against Dr Salah Ali of [[Al-Menbar Islamic Society]].
