This article is about the history of the fictional [[DC Comics]]' character '''[[Wonder Woman]]'''.

==Early days==
[[Image:SensationComics.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wonder Woman's first cover, ''Sensation Comics'' #1 (January 1942)]]
Wonder Woman was introduced in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' (issue #8; December 1941), the second bestselling comic in DC's line. Following this auspicious debut, she was featured in ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #1 (January 1942), and six months later appeared in her own book (Summer 1942). Wonder Woman took her place beside the extant superheroines or antiheroes [[Fantomah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm |title=Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Fantomah |publisher=Toonopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Black Widow (Claire Voyant)|Black Widow]], [[Invisible Scarlet O'Neil]], and [[Canada]]'s [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]]. Until his death in 1947, Dr. William Moulton Marston wrote all of the Wonder Woman stories. [[H. G. Peter]] penciled the book in a simplistic yet easily identifiable style.

Armed with bulletproof bracelets, [[Lasso of Truth|magic lasso]], and  [[Amazons (comics)|Amazonian]] training, Wonder Woman was the archetype of Marston's perfect woman. She was beautiful, intelligent, strong, yet still possessed a soft side. Her powers were derived from &quot;Amazon concentration&quot;, not as a gift from the gods which would later become part of her back story.

Wonder Woman's &quot;lasso of truth&quot; was forged from the Magic Girdle of [[Aphrodite]], which [[Hippolyta (comics)|Queen Hippolyte]] (Wonder Woman's mother) was granted by the Goddess. [[Hephaestus]] had borrowed the Olympian belt, removed several links from it in order to forge the magic lasso, which was unbreakable as well as infinitely elastic, and compelled all encircled by it to obey the commands of the wielder, most notably to tell the truth.

In Wonder Woman's origin story, [[Steve Trevor]], an intelligence officer in the [[United States Army]], crashed his plane on Paradise Island, the Amazons' isolated homeland. Using a &quot;[[Purple Ray]]&quot;, Princess Diana nursed him back to health and fell in love with him. When the goddess Aphrodite declared that it was time for an Amazon to travel to &quot;Man's World&quot; and fight the evil of the [[Nazism|Nazis]], a tournament was held to determine who would be the Amazon champion. Although forbidden by her mother Queen Hippolyte to participate in the tournament, Princess Diana did so nevertheless, her identity hidden by a mask.

After Diana won the tournament and revealed her true identity, Queen Hippolyte relented and allowed her daughter to become Wonder Woman. Diana returned Steve Trevor to the outside world and soon adopted the identity of nurse Lt. Diana Prince (by taking the place of her exact double by that name) in order to be close to Trevor as he recovered from his injuries. Afterward, he became Wonder Woman's crime-fighting partner and romantic interest.

In her guise as a nurse, Diana cares for Trevor and frequently overhears his intelligence discussions, allowing her to know where she is needed. Prince is eventually hired to work for Trevor in the War Department as his assistant. Trevor periodically suspects that Diana and Wonder Woman might be the same person, especially since he frequently catches Diana using her tiara or lasso.

Wonder Woman was ably assisted by the Holliday Girls, a sorority from a local women's college led by the sweets-addicted [[Etta Candy]]. Etta stood out for several reasons: she had a distinctive figure, she occupied a central role in many storylines, and had an endearing propensity for exclaiming &quot;woo-woo&quot; (which echoed the &quot;hoo-hoo&quot; catchphrase associated with the popular vaudevillian comedian [[Hugh Herbert]]). Etta took her place with Steve Trevor and Diana as the series' most enduring characters.

During 1942 to 1947, images of bound and gagged women frequently graced the covers of ''Sensation Comics'' and ''Wonder Woman''. For example, in ''Wonder Woman'' #3, Wonder Woman herself ties up several women, dresses them in deer costumes and chases them through the forest. Later she rebinds them and displays them on a platter. In addition, Diana is rendered powerless if a male manages to chain her bracelets together. The comic's sexual [[subtext]] has been noted, leading to debates over whether it provided an outlet for Dr. Marston's sexual fantasies or whether it was meant (perhaps unconsciously) to appeal to, and possibly influence, the developing sexuality of young readers.&lt;ref&gt;Bunn, Geoffrey C. &quot;The lie detector, ''Wonder Woman'', and liberty: the life and work of William Moulton Marston,&quot; ''History of the Human Sciences'' Vol. 10, No. 1 (1997): 91â119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bondage and submission elements had a broader context for Marston, who had worked as a prison psychologist. The themes were intertwined with his theories about the rehabilitation of criminals, and from her inception, Wonder Woman wanted to reform the criminals she captured (a rehabilitation complex was created by the Amazons on Transformation Island, a small island near [[Themyscira|Paradise Island]]). A core component in Marston's conception of Wonder Woman was &quot;loving submission&quot;, in which kindness to others would result in willing submission derived from [[agape]] based on Moulton's own personal philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Wonder Woman: A Complete History ISBN 0-8118-2913-8. William Moulton Marston: &lt;blockquote&gt;Confinement to WW and the Amazons is just a sporting game, an actual enjoyment of being subdued. This, my dear friend, is the one truly great contribution of my Wonder Woman strip to moral education of the young. The only hope for peace is to teach people who are full of pep and unbound force to enjoy being bound. Women are exciting for this one reason â it is the secret of women's allure â women enjoy submission, being bound. This I bring out in the Paradise Island sequences where the girls beg for chains and enjoy wearing them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has resulted in parodies of the character in which male criminals are so enamored with the heroine's beauty that they surrender solely to enjoy her company.

During this period Wonder Woman joined the [[Justice Society of America]] (featured in ''All Star Comics'') as its first female member. Reflecting the mores of this pre-feminist era, Wonder Woman served as the group's secretary, despite being one of the group's most powerful members.

Upon William Moulton Marston's death in 1947, [[Robert Kanigher]] took up the writing duties on ''Wonder Woman''. Diana was written as a less feminist character, and began to resemble other traditional American heroines. Peter produced the art on the title through issue #97, when the elderly artist was fired (he died soon afterward). During this time, Diana's abilities expanded. Her earrings provided her the air she needed to breathe in outer space, and she piloted an &quot;[[Invisible Plane|invisible plane]]&quot;, originally a propeller-driven [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Warhawk]] or [[P-51 Mustang]], later upgraded to a jet aircraft. Her tiara was an unbreakable boomerang, and a two-way wrist radio similar to [[Dick Tracy]]'s was installed in one of her bracelets, allowing her to communicate with Paradise Island.

Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s controversial and influential ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954) argued that comic books contributed to juvenile delinquency, and alleged that there was a lesbian subtext to the relationship between Wonder Woman and the Holliday girls. Reacting to Wertham's critique and well-publicized Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency, several publishers organized the [[Comics Code Authority]] as a form of preemptive self-censorship. Due to a confluence of forces (amongst them the Code and the loss of Marston as writer), Wonder Woman no longer spoke out as a strong feminist; she began to moon over Steve Trevor, and, as time wore into the Silver Age, also fell for [[Merman]] and [[List of avian humanoids|Birdman]].

Prior to the start of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in 1956 three super heroes still had their own titles: Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Superman was available in &quot;great quantity, but little quality.&quot; Batman was doing better, but his comics were &quot;lackluster&quot; in comparison to his &quot;atmospheric adventures&quot; of the 1940s. Wonder Woman, having lost her original writer and artist, was no longer &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Comic Book Heroes: From the Silver Age to the Present |last=Jacobs |first=Will |coauthor=Gerard Jones |year=1985 |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=0517554402 |pages=3â4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wonder Woman'' experienced significant changes from the mid-1950s throughout the 1960s. [[H. G. Peter|Harry G. Peter]] was replaced by [[Ross Andru]] and [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] in 1958 (starting with issue #98), and the character was revamped as were other characters in the Silver Age. In Diana's new origin story (issue #105), it is revealed that her powers are gifts from the gods. Receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become as &quot;beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], stronger than [[Hercules]], and swifter than [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]&quot;. Further changes included the removal of all World War II references from Wonder Woman's origin, the changing of Hippolyta's hair color to blonde, Wonder Woman's new ability to glide on air currents, and the introduction of the rule that Paradise Island would be destroyed if a man ever set foot on it.

Several years later, when DC Comics introduced the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], the Silver Age Wonder Woman was situated as an inhabitant of Earth-One, while the Golden Age Wonder Woman was sited on Earth-Two. It was later revealed, in ''Wonder Woman'' #300, that the Earth-Two Wonder Woman had disclosed her secret identity of Diana Prince to the world, and had married her Earth's [[Steve Trevor]].

In the 1960s, regular scripter [[Robert Kanigher]] adapted several gimmicks which had been used for [[Superman]]. As with [[Superboy]], Wonder Woman's &quot;untold&quot; career as the teenage [[Wonder Girl]] was chronicled. Then followed Wonder Tot, the infant Amazon princess (in her star-spangled jumper) who experienced improbable adventures with a [[genie]] she rescued from an abandoned treasure chest. In a series of &quot;Impossible Tales,&quot; Kanigher teamed all three ages of Wonder Woman; her mother, Hippolyta, joined the adventures as &quot;Wonder Queen&quot;.

==The Diana Prince era and the Bronze Age==

In 1968, under the guidance of scripter [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] and editor/plotter/artist [[Mike Sekowsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 131 |quote = Carmine Infantino wanted to rejuvenate what had been perceived as a tired Wonder Woman, so he assigned writer Denny O'Neil and artist Mike Sekowsky to convert the Amazon Princess into a secret agent.  Wonder Woman was made over into an Emma Peel type and what followed was arguably the most controversial period in the hero's history.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wonder Woman surrendered her powers to remain in &quot;Man's World&quot; rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension where they could &quot;restore their magic&quot; (part of her motivation was to assist Steve Trevor, who was facing criminal charges).
[[Image:WonderWoman1970s.jpg|thumb|''Wonder Woman'' #189 (August 1970): By this era, Wonder Woman had more in common with [[Emma Peel]] than superheroes. Cover art by [[Mike Sekowsky]] &amp; [[Dick Giordano]].]]

Now a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] boutique owner, the powerless Diana Prince acquired a Chinese mentor named [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]]. Under I Ching's guidance, Diana learned [[martial arts]] and weapons skills, and engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology. During this time she fought villains such as [[Catwoman]], [[Doctor Cyber]], the hippie gang [[THEM! (comics)|Them!]], and the campy witch [[Morgana (comics)|Morgana]].

This new era of the comic book was influenced by the British television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', with Wonder Woman in the role of [[Emma Peel]]. With Diana Prince running a boutique, fighting crime, and acting in concert with private detective allies [[Tim Trench]] and [[Jonny Double]], the character resembled the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] [[Black Canary]]. Soon after the launch of the &quot;new&quot; ''Wonder Woman'', the editors severed all connections to her old life, most notably by killing Steve Trevor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]| penciller= [[Mike Sekowsky|Sekowsky, Mike]]| inker= [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]| story= A Death for Diana!| title= Wonder Woman| volume= | issue= 180
| date= January-February 1969| publisher=| page= | panel= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 25 bi-monthly issues of the &quot;new&quot; ''Wonder Woman'', the writing team changed four times. Consequently, the stories display abrupt shifts in setting, theme, and tone. The revised series attracted writers not normally associated with comic books, most notably science fiction author [[Samuel R. Delany]], who wrote ''Wonder Woman'' #202â203 (October and December 1972).

The I Ching era had an influence on the 1974 ''Wonder Woman'' TV movie featuring [[Cathy Lee Crosby]], in which Wonder Woman was portrayed as a non-powered globe-trotting super-spy who wore an amalgam of Wonder Woman and Diana Prince costumes. The era continues to influence stories decades later, most notably Walter Simonson's run (''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2, #189â194).{{citation needed|date=December 2007}} The first two issues of Allan Heinberg's run (''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3, #1â2) include direct references to I Ching, and feature Diana wearing an outfit similar to that which she wore during the I Ching era.

Wonder Woman's powers and traditional costume were restored in issue #204 (JanuaryâFebruary 1973).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie &quot;1970s&quot; in Dolan, p. 154 &quot;After nearly five years of Diana Prince's non-powered super-heroics, writer-editor Robert Kanigher and artist Don Heck restored Wonder Woman's. . .well, wonder.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Steinem]], who grew up reading Wonder Woman comics, was a key player in the restoration. Steinem, offended that the most famous female superheroine had been depowered, placed Wonder Woman (in costume) on the cover of the first issue of ''[[Ms. magazine|Ms.]]'' (1972)&amp;nbsp;â [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]], DC Comics' owner, was an investor&amp;nbsp;â which also contained an appreciative essay about the character.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://marionetteblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/whos-that-girl-part-1a-wonder-womans.html Who's that Girl? Part 1a: Wonder Woman's pal Gloria Steinem.]&quot; 4 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
The costume used on the cover of ''Ms.'' was very much like the Silver Age version of the costume, but in one way it was unlike anything that the character had worn before. Steinem's version wore the red high-heeled boots that the character had worn off and on â most recently in issues #157 â #177 of her magazine. The eagle on her costume was also the newer, stylized version. However, the character's original incarnation had worn a skirt, and more recent versions had sported shorts; Steinem's version wore what was essentially the bottom half of a bathing suit. Steinem's new extra-short pants were adopted in issue #204 when the costume returned.

The return of the &quot;original&quot; Wonder Woman was executed by [[Robert Kanigher]], who returned as the title's writer-editor. For the first year he relied upon rewritten and redrawn stories from the Golden Age. Following that, a major two-year story arc (largely written by [[Martin Pasko]]) consisted of the heroine's attempt to gain readmission in the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] â Diana had quit the organization after renouncing her powers. To prove her worthiness to rejoin the JLA, Wonder Woman voluntarily underwent twelve trials (analogous to the labors of [[Heracles|Hercules]]), each of which was monitored in secret by a member of the JLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia|last= Jimenez|first= Phil|authorlink= Phil Jimenez |coauthors= Wells, John|year= 2010 |publisher= Del Rey|isbn= 0345501071

He adopted the identity of Steve Howard, and worked alongside Diana Prince (now knowing her true identity) at the United Nations.

Soon after Wonder Woman's readmittance to the JLA, DC Comics ushered in another format change. Following the popularity of the ''Wonder Woman'' TV series (initially set during [[World War II]]), the comic book was also transposed to this era.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie &quot;1970s&quot; in Dolan, p. 172 &quot;The comic's time and Earth shifts were actually dictated by ABC-TV's popular ''Wonder Woman'' TV series, set during World War II, and they continued in this era for the next fifteen issues.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The change was made possible by the [[multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] concept, which maintained that the 1970s Wonder Woman and the original 1940s version existed in two separate yet parallel worlds. A few months after the TV series changed its setting to the 1970s, the comic book returned to the contemporary timeline. Soon after, when the series was written by Jack C. Harris, Steve (Howard) Trevor was killed off yet again.

==1980s==
Writer [[Gerry Conway]] brought [[Steve Trevor]] back to life again in issue #271 (September 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K. &quot;1980s&quot; in Dolan, p.187 &quot;This landmark issue also saw the return of Steve Trevor to Wonder Woman's life in the main feature by writer Gerry Conway and penciler Jose Delbo.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Following Diana's renunciation of her role as Wonder Woman, a version of Steve Trevor from an undisclosed portion of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] accidentally made the transition to Earth-One. With Diana's memory erased by the Mists of Nepenthe, the new Steve again crash-landed and arrived at Paradise Island. After reclaiming the title of Wonder Woman, Diana returned to Military Intelligence, working with Trevor and re-joined by supporting characters [[Etta Candy]] and General Darnell.

In the [[DC Comics insert previews|preview]] in ''DC Comics Presents'' #41 (January 1982), writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciler [[Gene Colan]] provided Wonder Woman with a stylized &quot;WW&quot; emblem on her bodice, replacing the traditional eagle.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The hotly-debated new Wonder Woman uniform will be bestowed on the Amazon Princess in her first adventure written and drawn by her new creative team: Roy Thomas and Gene Colan.&quot; &quot;This story will appear as an insert in ''DC Comics Presents'' #41.&quot; as noted in &quot;Thomas/Colan Premiere Wonder Woman's New Look&quot; [[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] ''Comics Feature'' #12/13 (September/October 1981) p. 23&lt;!-- This was a double issue hence the #12/13 issue number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;WW&quot; emblem, unlike the eagle, could be protected as a trademark and therefore had greater merchandising potential. ''Wonder Woman'' #288 (February 1982) premiered the new costume and an altered cover banner incorporating the &quot;WW&quot; emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|http://www.comics.org/issue/36086/ |title= ''Wonder Woman'' #288 (February 1982)|publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]]|date= |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dann Thomas co-wrote ''Wonder Woman'' #300 (Feb. 1983) and, as Roy Thomas noted in 1999 &quot;became the first woman ever to receive scripting credit on the world's foremost super-heroine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dannref&quot;&gt;Thomas, Roy &quot;The Secret Origins of Infinity, Inc.&quot; ''Alter Ego'' Vol. 3 #1 (Summer 1999) TwoMorrows Publishing p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

After the departure of Thomas in 1983, [[Dan Mishkin]] took over the writing. However, sales of the title continued to decline. Shortly after Mishkin's departure in 1985 â including a three issue run by [[Mindy Newell]] and a well-publicized but never-published revamp by [[Steve Gerber]]&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Heroes'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/01/comic-book-legends-revealed-254/ |title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #254 |author= Cronin, Brian|date= April 1, 2010 |publisher= Comic Book Resources |quote= Gerber and Frank Miller pitched DC on revamps of the âTrinity.â The three titles would be called by the âline nameâ of METROPOLIS, with each character being defined by one word/phraseâ¦ AMAZON (written by Gerber); DARK KNIGHT (written by Miller); and Something for Superman â I believe either MAN OF STEEL or THE MAN OF STEEL, but Iâm not sure about that (written by both men).|accessdate=November 6, 2011}} [http://www.webcitation.org/63A6fwhjK WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; â the series ended with issue #329 (February 1986). Written by [[Gerry Conway]], the final issue depicted Wonder Woman's marriage to Steve Trevor.

As a result of the alterations which followed the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' cross-over of 1986, the Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor of Earth-Two, along with all of their exploits, were erased from history. However, the two were admitted into Olympus. At the end of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the [[Anti-Monitor]] appeared to have killed the Wonder Woman of Earth-One, but in reality, she had been hurled backwards through time, devolving into the clay from which she had been formed. ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' erased all previously existing incarnations of Wonder Woman from continuity, setting the stage for a complete relaunch and reboot of the title.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K. &quot;1980s&quot; in Dolan, p. 227 &quot;Wonder Woman received a complete and utter makeover, even more so than the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight.  Her adventures started from scratch, and unlike Superman and Batman's revamped origins, occurred in the present, rather than in flashback fashion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the publication of the second series, a four-part miniseries was released (with [[Kurt Busiek]] as writer and [[Trina Robbins]] as artist) titled ''The Legend of Wonder Woman''. The series paid homage to the character's Golden Age roots, although it appeared to be set on Earth-One.

==Post-Crisis==

PÃ©rez and Potter wrote Wonder Woman as a feminist character, and PÃ©rez's research into [[Greek mythology]] provided Wonder Woman's world with depth and verisimilitude missing from her previous incarnation.&lt;ref&gt; Manning, Matthew K. &quot;1980s&quot; in Dolan, p. 227 &quot;With the help of PÃ©rez's meticulous pencils, as well as his guidance as co-plotter, Wonder Woman was thrust further into the realm of Greek mythology than she'd ever been before.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporation of Greek gods and sharply characterized villains added a richness to Wonder Woman's Amazon heritage and set her apart from other DC heroes.

Wonder Woman was now a princess and emissary from Paradise Island (called Themyscira) to Patriarch's world. She possessed stunning beauty and a loving heart, gifts from the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. From [[Athena]], she received the gift of great wisdom; from [[Demeter]], the power and strength of the earth; from [[Hestia]], sisterhood with fire; and from [[Artemis]], unity with beasts and the instincts and prowess of a hunter. Finally, Diana received the gift of speed and the power of flight from the god [[Hermes]].

The American theme of Diana's costume was explained by PÃ©rez in the ''Challenge of the Gods'' storyline in which Diana engaged in a series of trials arranged by [[Zeus]] as punishment for refusing his advances. Diana met the spirit of Steve Trevor's mother, Diana Trevor, who was clad in armor identical to her own. Trevor revealed that during World War II she had crashed on [[Themyscira]] while on duty as a [[United States Army|US Army]] pilot. She blundered into an Amazon battle against [[Hecatonchires|Cottus]], a multi-armed demon, at the portal to the underworld. Trevor was drawn into the battle, although she was armed only with her [[side arm]]. She wounded the beast before suffering a mortal blow, allowing the Amazons to reseal the portal.&lt;ref name=ww12&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Len Wein|Wein, Len]] | Artist = [[George PÃ©rez]] | Story = Echoes of the Past | Title = Wonder Woman | Volume =  | Issue = 12 | Date = January 1988 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impressed by this unknown woman's self-sacrifice, the Amazons entombed her with honors and clothed her in armor displaying the American flag pattern on her uniform, which they assumed were her [[heraldry|heraldic]] colors.&lt;ref name=ww12/&gt; Consequently, Princess Diana's costume honors Diana Trevor and, by clothing her in its own heraldry, was intended to ease the heroine's acceptance in Man's world.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;!--The &quot;ease the heroine's acceptance&quot; part is the one I'd like the citation for. --&gt; Trevor's legacy was also the primary reason why [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] arranged for Steve Trevor to bomb the island, as he could not resist the irony of the heroine's son unwittingly killing her admirers.&lt;ref name=ww12/&gt;

Wonder Woman did not keep her identity a secret, and initially did not consider herself a [[superheroine]]. Indeed, her character was wide-eyed and naive, innocent and without guile. Diana spoke only Themyscirian, a variation of ancient [[Greek language|Greek]], and had to learn [[English language|English]] when she arrived in [[United States|America]]. Fortunately, Diana soon met [[Julia Kapatelis]], a scholar in Greek culture, and her daughter [[Silver Swan (Vanessa Kapatelis)|Vanessa Kapatelis]] who helped the Amazon princess adjust to the world of Men. However, for all her apparent naivetÃ©, Diana was a trained warrior, and had no compunction against using deadly force when called for. For example, she felled the god [[Deimos (comics)|Deimos]] in battle and felt completely justified under the circumstances. Through PÃ©rez's tenure on the book, Diana confronted war, injustice, inequality, death, and conflicts involving the Olympian Gods.

Wonder Woman's supporting characters were altered as well. In addition to the introduction of the Kapatelises, [[Steve Trevor]] was changed into an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] officer considerably older than Diana, thus sidestepping the traditional romance between the two. Instead, Trevor became involved with [[Etta Candy]], a mature military officer possessing a plump physique. The Greek war god Ares and the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] eventually became two of Diana's greatest enemies. Her rogue's list included the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], a woman who could transform into a ferocious feline-humanoid creature; and the [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]], a once deformed radiation victim granted beauty, wings, and deafening sonic powers through genetic engineering.

Following PÃ©rez, [[William Messner-Loebs]] took over as writer and [[Mike Deodato]] became the artist for the title.  Messner-Loebs introduced Diana's [[Daxam]]ite friend Julia in Wonder Woman vol. 2 #68 during the six issue space arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcuguide.com/WW/WW2_068.php |title=Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #68 |publisher=Dcuguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcuguide.com/WW/WW2_071.php |title=Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #71 |publisher=Dcuguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messner-Loebs's most memorable contribution to the title was the introduction of the red-headed Amazon [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], who took over the mantle of Wonder Woman for a short time. He also included a subplot during his run in an attempt to further humanize Diana by having her work for a fictional fast food chain called Taco Whiz.

[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s run included a period in which Diana's mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] served as Wonder Woman, having traveled back to the 1940s, while Diana ascended to Mount Olympus as the Goddess of Truth. Byrne posited that Hippolyta had been the Golden Age Wonder Woman. In addition, Wonder Woman's Amazon ally [[Nu'Bia|Nubia]] was re-introduced as Nu'Bia, scripted by a different author.

Writer [[Eric Luke]] next joined the comic and depicted Diana as often questioning her mission in Man's World, and most primarily her reason for existing. His most memorable contributions to the title was having Diana separate herself from humanity by residing in a floating palace called the ''Wonder Dome'', and for a godly battle between the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]] and the various religious pantheons of the world. [[Phil Jimenez]], the penciler who next worked on the title, produced a run which has been likened to PÃ©rez's, particularly since his art bears a resemblance to PÃ©rez's. Jimenez's run showed Wonder Woman as a diplomat, scientist, and activist who worked to help women across the globe become more self-sufficient. Jimenez also added many visual elements found in the ''Wonder Woman'' television show. One particaluar story arc is The Witch and the Warrior, in which Circe turns New York City's men in beasts, women against men, and lovers against lovers. The worst part of this is tragedy is that is occurs so soon after the [[Imperiex|Imperiex War]].&lt;ref&gt;'Wonder Woman' (vol. 2) #174-176&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jimenez, [[Walt Simonson]] wrote a six-issue homage to the I Ching era, in which Diana temporarily loses her powers and adopts an all-white costume (''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2, #189â194). [[Greg Rucka]] became writer at issue #195. His initial story arc centered upon Diana's authorship of a controversial book and included a political subtext. Rucka also introduced a new recurring villain, ruthless businesswoman [[Veronica Cale]], who uses [[media manipulation]] to try to discredit Diana. Rucka modernized the Greek and Egyptian gods, updating the toga-wearing deities to provide them with briefcases, laptop computers, designer clothing, and modern hairstyles. Rucka dethroned Zeus and Hades, who were unable to move with the times as the other gods had, replacing them with Athena and Ares as new rulers of the gods and the underworld. Athena selected Diana to be her personal champion.

==Infinite Crisis==
The four part &quot;Sacrifice&quot; storyline (one of the lead-ins to ''[[Infinite Crisis]])'' ended with Diana breaking the longstanding do-not-kill code of DC superheroes. [[Superman]], his mind controlled by [[Maxwell Lord]], brutally beats [[Batman]] and engages in a vicious fight with Wonder Woman, thinking she is his enemy [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].
[[Image:WWMax.png|left|150px|frame|Wonder Woman kills [[Maxwell Lord]].&lt;br&gt;Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]
In the midst of her battle with Superman, Diana realizes that even if she defeats him, he would still remain under Max Lord's absolute mental control. She creates a diversion lasting long enough for her to race back to Max Lord's location and demand that he tell her how to free Superman from his control. Bound by her lasso of truth, Max replies, &quot;Kill me.&quot; Wonder Woman then snaps his neck (see ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' for more about this storyline).

Upon his recovery, Batman rejects Diana's attempt to explain her actions; Superman is no better able to understand her motivations. At a crucial time, a profound rift opens up between the three central heroes of the DC universe. In the final pages of ''The OMAC Project'', the Brother Eye satellite â the deranged [[Artificial intelligence]] controlling the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]] (Omni Mind And Community) â broadcasts the footage of Wonder Woman dispatching Maxwell Lord to media outlets all over the world, accompanied by the text &quot;Murder.&quot;

At the start of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] distrust Diana: the latter can only see her as a coldblooded murderer, the former sees in her an expression of the mentality that [[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|led several members of the League to the decision to mindwipe their villains]] (when Batman tried to stop the League from [[mindwiping]] [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] after the villain brutally raped [[Sue Dibny]], Batman's memory was also altered). To make matters worse, in ''Infinite Crisis'' #2 Brother Eye initiates the final protocol &quot;Truth and Justice&quot;, which aims at the total elimination of the Amazons. A full-scale invasion of Themyscira is set into motion utilizing every remaining OMAC. Diana and her countrywomen, now isolated and alienated from the outside world, must fight for their lives.

In ''Infinite Crisis'' #3, the Amazons prepare to destroy the OMACs with a powerful new weapon, the Purple Death Ray, a corruption of the healing [[Purple Ray]]. Realizing, however, that the battle is being broadcast to TV stations around the world, and edited to make the Amazons look like cold-blooded killers, Wonder Woman convinces the Amazons to shut the weapon down. She then assembles the Amazons on the beach of Themyscira to decide their next move.

[[Image:Dianaprincearth2.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Diana meets the Wonder Woman of [[Earth-Two]].&lt;br&gt; Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]

Diana calls upon Athena, who transports Paradise Island and the Amazons to another dimension. Wonder Woman chooses not to join them, and is left to face the OMACs on her own. In ''Infinite Crisis'' #5, as Diana is breaking up a riot in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], she is interrupted by a woman she initially believes is Queen Hippolyta. However, the intruder identifies herself as the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Two]] Wonder Woman, Diana Prince, who has voluntarily left [[Mount Olympus]] in order to provide Diana with vital information and guidance. She advises her [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|Post-Crisis]] counterpart to be &quot;the one thing you haven't been for a very long time... human,&quot; and, more importantly, strongly urges Diana to intervene in a fight taking place at that moment between the Modern Age [[Superman]] and his counterpart, [[Kal-L]]. Having left Mount Olympus, and with her gods' blessings gone, Diana Prince then faded away.

Wonder Woman manages to stop the Supermen from fighting, enabling them to work together in defeating the forces deployed by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] and [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]] (who are revealed as the true culprits behind the Crisis). In the Battle of Metropolis, Diana redeems herself by convincing an anguished [[Batman]] not to shoot [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] to death. At the story's conclusion, Diana, Bruce Wayne, and Clark Kent interact like the friends they were in the past, and Diana declares her intention to do some soul-searching before returning to her role as Wonder Woman.

Near the conclusion of the ''Infinite Crisis'' the history of Earth is modified. Wonder Woman's Silver Age past is restored, and it is revealed that she has also served as a founding member of the Justice League. This notion was evidenced in the merging of both the Earth-One Wonder Woman and the 1987 rebooted Wonder Woman by Alexander Luthor.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 was one of several titles canceled at the conclusion of the Infinite Crisis crossover, #226 (April 2006) being the final issue. The title included 228 published issues, including an issue #0 between #90 and #91, and issue #1000000 between #138 and #139.

==2006 relaunch==

[[Image:Dianaprince.PNG|thumb|Wonder Woman as Agent Diana Prince, with Nemesis. Art by [[Terry Dodson]].]]

In conjunction with [[DC Comics|DC]]'s &quot;[[One Year Later]]&quot; crossover storyline, the third ''Wonder Woman'' comic series was launched with a new #1 issue (June [[2006]]), written by [[Allan Heinberg]] with art by [[Terry Dodson]]. Her bustier features a new design, combining the traditional eagle with the 1980s &quot;WW&quot; design, similar to her emblem in the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries.

[[Donna Troy]] has taken up the mantle of Wonder Woman; Diana has disappeared to parts unknown, though there are reports that she has been seen in the company of an eastern mystic named [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]]. The World Court drops the charges against Diana for the killing of [[Maxwell Lord]].

When Diana returns she takes on the persona of Diana Prince, now a [[espionage|secret agent]] and member of the Department of Metahuman Affairs. She is partnered with [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]] and the two report to [[Sarge Steel]]. Her first assignment is to retrieve her sister Donna Troy, who has been kidnapped by several of her most persistent enemies; their powers have been augmented by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]]. After this is accomplished, Diana takes back the title of Wonder Woman.

Wonder Woman, [[Superman]], and [[Batman]] re-form the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] and collaborate on the team's roster.

Wonder Woman asks Kate Spencer, whom she knows to be [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter]], to represent her before a Federal [[grand jury]] empaneled to determine if she should be tried for the murder of Maxwell Lord (though the World Court has exonerated her, the US government pursues its own charges). Upon concluding their deliberations, the grand jurors refuse to indict Diana.&lt;ref&gt;Manhunter #26â30&lt;/ref&gt;

During the story-arc penned by [[Jodi Picoult]] (issues #6â10, and which ties into ''[[Amazons Attack|Amazons Attack!]]''), Diana is captured and imprisoned by the Department of Metahuman Affairs, led by an [[Everyman (DC Comics)|imposter Sarge Steel]]. She is tortured and interrogated to garner information that will allow the [[United States]] government to build a [[Purple Ray|Purple Death Ray]] previously used during ''[[Infinite Crisis]].''

For reasons of her own, Circe resurrects Diana's mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]]. When Hippolyta learns that her daughter is being detained by the US government, she goes on the warpath, leading an Amazon assault on [[Washington, D.C.]] Freed by Nemesis, Diana tries to reason with her mother to end the war.

[[Gail Simone]] took up writing duties on the title beginning with issue #14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=125340 |title=Simone's Wonder Woman Debut Pushed Back a Month |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=2007-08-14 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Wonder Woman Annual'' #1 (2007), Circe gives Diana the &quot;gift&quot; of human transformation.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman Annual'' #1 Volume Three, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When she becomes Diana Prince she transforms into a non-powered mortal. She is content, knowing that she can become Wonder Woman when she wishes and be a member of the human race as Diana Prince.

The relaunch was beset by scheduling problems, described by Grady Hendrix in his article, &quot;Out for Justice&quot;, in the ''New York Sun''.  &quot;By 2007 [Heinberg had] only delivered four issues ... Ms. Picoult's five issues hemorrhaged readers ... and ''Amazons Attack!'', a miniseries commissioned to fill a hole in the book's publishing schedule caused by Mr. Heinberg's delays, was reviled by fans who decried it as an abomination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, Grady. &quot;Out for Justice&quot;. ''The New York Sun'' December 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many attribute these flaws to the constraints that DC placed on the authors; Picoult's interpretation in particular has received acclaim from critics, who would have liked to have seen the novelist given more time to work. Says Min Jin Lee of the UK Times, &quot;By furnishing a 21st-century emotional characterization for a 20th-century creation, Picoult reveals the novelist's dextrous hand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article3210539.ece article]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, others blame DC's inconsistent portrayals of the Wonder Woman universe, brought about by employing so many writers in such a short span of time, for the failures in the relaunch; &quot;I feel sorry for Picoult, she was going in a good, clear direction but is soon side-tracked by DC Comicâs external needs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trav73.wordpress.com/2008/03/22/ |title=TaCk's Pop Culture blog |publisher=Trav73.wordpress.com |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently in the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, Diana was attacked by [[Mary Marvel]] who infected her with the Morticoccus virus. This seriously deformed Diana and brainwashed her into becoming one of [[Darkseid|Darkseid's]] [[Female Furies]]. She aided him in conquering Earth along with other female superheroes/villains like [[Catwoman]], [[Giganta]] and [[Batwoman]].

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Diana is lured to Arlington National Cemetery by Maxwell Lord, who was reanimated as a Black Lantern. When Wonder Woman arrived, he sprang a trap, using black rings to revive the bodies of fallen soldiers. Wonder Woman uses her Lasso to reduce Max and the soldiers to dust; However, as she leaves, the dust begins to regenerate.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #1 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Nekron]], lord of the dead, and the one responsible for the creation of the Black Lantern Corps, reveals that he allowed for Diana's earlier resurrection, in order for him to have an &quot;inside agent&quot; among the living. Briefly reanimating Bruce Wayne as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], Nekron creates an emotional tether in Diana, allowing him to place a black power ring on her and transforming her into a Black Lantern.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, a duplicate of [[Carol Ferris]]' violet power ring attaches itself to Diana, using her unrequited romantic love for Batman (Bruce Wayne) as well as the love she feels for the whole of Earth to destroy the black ring, at the same time turning her into a [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]. Diana was also given spiritual aid from Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, in accepting the ring.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, Max attacks Wonder Woman in Coast City. Wonder Woman encases Max's body in a violet crystal and then shatters it to pieces. She then encounters Mera who had transformed into a [[Red Lantern Corps|Red Lantern]] during the fight, their two rings interfaced with each other, Wonder Woman constructed the violet light giving Mera some measure of control over her new-found
savagery.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #3 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Wonder Woman join the power of white light to lose her Star Sapphire ring in the final battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wonder Woman was also seen in ''Justice League of America'', encouraging Donna Troy to help make a new Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;Justice League of America (vol. 2) #41 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue 600 and beyond==
[[Image:WWKramer.jpg|thumb|left|Wonder Woman's new design for the [[J. Michael Straczynski]] run. Art by [[Don Kramer]].]]
DC Comics Executive Editor Dan DiDio asked fans for 600 postcards to restore the Wonder Woman comic book to the original numbering, starting at #600. The publisher's office had received 712 postcards by the October 31, 2009 deadline. As a result, the current numbering switched to #600 after Wonder Woman #44, in an anniversary issue.

Issue #600 featured several stories featuring work from guest creators such as [[Geoff Johns]], George PÃ©rez, Phil Jimenez, and [[Amanda Conner]]. The issue also featured guest appearances from other female superheroes such as [[Batwoman]], [[Power Girl]], [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]], [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] and [[Renee Montoya|the Question]].

Writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] officially took over the title after Gail Simone in issue #601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/03/08/j-michael-straczynski-to-write-superman-and-wonder-woman-starting-in-july/ |title=DC Universe: The Source Â» Blog Archive Â» J.

Straczynski's run focuses on an alternate timeline created by the Gods where Paradise Island was destroyed leading to many Amazons being raised in the world outside of the island. It revolves around Wonder Woman's attempts to restore the normal timeline despite the fact that she does not remember it properly. Wonder Woman in this alternative timeline has been raised in New York City as an orphan and is coming into her powers. She is aware of the presence of Amazons, but does not remember her childhood on Paradise Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jms-talks-wonder-woman-100629.html |title=JMS Talks WONDER WOMAN's New Look and New Direction |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/06/29/unveiling-wonder-woman%E2%80%99s-new-costume-direction/ |title=DC Universe: The Source Â» Blog Archive Â» Unveiling Wonder Womanâs new costume, direction |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=var authorId = &quot;41401878&quot; by Richard George |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/110/1102826p2.html |title=Wonder Woman's New Era - Comics Feature at IGN |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wonder Woman will also wear a new costume designed by DC Comics co-publisher [[Jim Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/books/30wonder.html | work=The New York Times | title=Wonder Woman, 69, Has Style and Mythos Makeover | date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]] will continue the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jms-earth-one-sequel-101110.html |title=JMS Leaving SUPERMAN and WONDER WOMAN for EARTH ONE Sequel |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to redesign Wonder Woman received considerable coverage in mainstream news outlets, which in turn drew attention to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/01/fans-react-to-wonder-womans-costume-change/ |title=Fans react to Wonder Woman's costume change â The Marquee Blog - CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Marquee.blogs.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wonder Woman in this timeline started off with a limited power set, but gained her lasso and the power of flight during the fourth installment of the story.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #604&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the new Wonder Woman costume is being used in the intercompany crossover series, ''[[JLA/The 99]]''. Despite wearing the new costume, the Wonder Woman in this series is stated to be an Amazon ambassador, indicating that she does not share the same backstory as her counterpart in Straczynski's storyline.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/The 99'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'' storylines, Wonder Woman is shown helping the heroes search for the resurrected Maxwell Lord. Unfortunately, Max uses his psychic powers to the utmost to erase all memory of himself from the minds of the entire world, including Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, Booster Gold, Captain Atom, Fire and Ice  are the only ones who remember Max's existence. Fire tries talking to Wonder Woman of her killing Max, but she refuses to believe it and tells Fire that Checkmate has dismissed her for failing her psychological evaluation. Fire discovers that Max has mentally influenced everyone.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the new timeline, Max (having used his powers to make the world forget his existence) is baffled to discover that all records of Wonder Woman have been erased. Former Justice League members Booster Gold, Captain Atom, Fire and Ice also retain memories of Wonder Woman but seemingly no one else remembers her prior existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #15 (December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed that thanks to the [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]], [[Batman]] remembers Wonder Woman as he helps the JLI save her from an attack by Max's [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #22 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Batman learned that since Max cannot find information on Wonder Woman, he is using the JLI to track her down. The OMAC army then teleports Wonder Woman and the JLI to Los Angeles. Max sends the new OMAC known as OMAC Prime, a huge robot, he controls to attack the heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #23 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The JLI saves Wonder Woman from OMAC Prime after nearly being beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #24 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Wonder Woman is shown aiding the JLA during their mission into Hell, where she helps Supergirl defeat the demon.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America 80-Page Giant 2011''&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 Relaunch==
[[Image:Wonderwomanreboot.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' Wonder Woman design. Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]
In August 2011, the third volume of ''Wonder Woman'' was cancelled along with every other DC title as part of a line-wide relaunch following ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]''. The series was relaunched in September with a #1 issue written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and drawn by [[Cliff Chiang]]. Wonder Woman now sports another new costume, once again designed by [[Jim Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/08/dc-comics-justice-league/&lt;/ref&gt; Azzarello describes the new ''Wonder Woman'' book as being darker than the past series, even going so far as to call it a &quot;horror&quot; book.&lt;ref&gt;http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/08/relaunched-wonder-woman-is-a-horror-book-brian-azzarello-says/&lt;/ref&gt;

In this new continuity, Wonder Woman's origin is significantly changed and she is no longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods. Instead, she is the natural-born daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus.

Wonder Woman will also be appearing as one of the lead characters in the new ''[[Justice League]]'' title written by [[Geoff Johns]] and drawn by Jim Lee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dc-comics-november-2011-solicitations-110812.html&lt;/ref&gt;
