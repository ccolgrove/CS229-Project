The name, a [[pun]] on &quot;a two-tit sling,&quot; was invented by humorist [[Wallace Reyburn]] in the 1970s.  Since then, the name has appeared in the game ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' (the makers of the game fell for the hoax, and listed &quot;Otto Titzling&quot; as the &quot;correct answer&quot; to the question of who invented the brassiere), the 1988 movie ''[[Beaches (film)|Beaches]]'' features a song by this name sung by [[Bette Midler]], and has appeared in practice questions sent out to prospective teams by the [[BBC 2]] show ''[[University Challenge]]''.

A similar situation exists with [[Thomas Crapper]], who was a [[real-life]] [[plumber]] but did not invent the [[flush toilet]].
