'''Rsyslog''' is an [[open source]] software utility used on [[UNIX]] and [[Unix-like]] computer systems for forwarding [[Data logging|log messages]] in an [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Computer Network|network]]. It implements the basic [[syslog]] protocol, extends it with content-based filtering, rich filtering capabilities, flexible configuration options and adds important features such as using [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] for transport.

== Protocol ==
Rsyslog uses the quasi-standard [[BSD]] syslog protocol, specified in [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 3164. As the text of RFC 3164 is just a vague informational description and not a standard, various incompatible extensions of it emerged. Rsyslog supports many of these extensions. The format of relayed messages can be customized.

The most important extensions of the original protocol supported by rsyslog are:
* [[ISO 8601]] timestamp with millisecond granularity and timezone information
* the addition of the name of relays in the host fields to make it possible to track the path a given message has traversed
* reliable transport using [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]
* support [[Generic Security Services Application Program Interface|GSS-API]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]
* logging directly into various database engines.
* support for the upcoming new IETF syslog RFC series
* support for buffered operation modes where messages are buffered locally if the receiver is not ready

== History ==
The rsyslog project began in 2004, when [[Rainer Gerhards]], the primary author of rsyslog, decided to write a new strong syslog daemon to compete with [[syslog-ng]], because; and according to the author &quot;A new major player will prevent monocultures and provide a rich freedom of choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.gerhards.net/2007/08/why-does-world-need-another-syslogd.html |title=Why does the world need another syslog?|date=August 12, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rainer Gerhards worked on rsyslog inside his own society, Adiscon GmbH.

== Distributions ==
rsyslog is available for a number of Unix systems and Linux distributions, among others:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.rsyslog.com/index.php/Platforms| title=Platforms|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
