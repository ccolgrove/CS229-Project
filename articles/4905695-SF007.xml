'''GameTrailers''' ('''GT''') is a media website that specializes in video game related content. It provides free access to original programming (such as reviews and previews), game trailers and recorded game play. Along with [[standard definition]] (640x360), many of the [[video clips]] are offered in a higher resolution (960x540).

Users can upload videos, create blogs, and participate in forums. Users can also create factions for games or other interests. Factions have access to private forums. GameTrailers has before had a currency called GameTrailers Dollars (GTD), which can be earned by interacting with the website and used to purchase virtual items and real merchandise but now replaced and discontinued for a new currency called GameTrailers Points (GTP).

==Content history==
GameTrailers' first version of its magazine style show was GT Weekly and premiered in August 2005, hosted by [[Amanda Mackay]] and Daniel Kayser. After 44 episodes, in March 2007, the show was rebranded as GameOne and given a live chat where viewers could talk about the show.

On January 25, 2008, GameOne was replaced by GameTrailers TV, the rebranded version of [[Spike TV]]'s [[Game Head]], still hosted by [[Geoff Keighley]], but produced by GameTrailers and co-hosted by [[Amanda Mackay]] and Daniel Kayser. The show appears at 12:30 am on [[Spike TV]] every Thursday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/press_releases/GTTVPremiere.htm |title=GTTV Premiere - Tune In |publisher=Gametrailers.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, [[ScrewAttack]] started providing content including Top Tens, Video Game Vault entries and episodes of ''[[The Angry Video Game Nerd]]'' for GameTrailers. Shortly after, [[SpikeTV]]'s GameHead also started to cooperate with GameTrailers.

*'''Top 100 Trailers of All Time''' - A top 100 countdown list of the best video game trailers ever made as determined by the GameTrailers staff, which ran throughout September 1 to October 8, 2011. The first four episodes focused on a [[20 (number)| score]] of various game trailers and the top 20 trailers each received their own individual episode, all with commentary on each selection. Honorable mentions were also displayed during the episodes and the final episode focused on the ten video game trailers voted the best by GameTrailers viewers.

==Business history==
Gametrailers.com was founded by Geoff Grotz and Brandon Jones in 2002. Jon Slusser and his company Hornet Animation invested in the startup, and Jon took over as CEO. The company was then acquired by MTV Networks in November 2005 for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/11-22-2005/0004221765&amp;EDATE= |title=MTV Networks Acquires GameTrailers.com |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, MTV Networks restructured its entertainment division, merging Ifilm.com and SpikeTV.com into Spike.com, and grouping this new property, GameTrailers, and [[Xfire]], into Spike Digital Entertainment, with Jon Slusser as the new SVP in charge, Geoff Grotz as VP of Product Development, and Brad Winters as the new GM of Gametrailers.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-12|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/press_releases/MTVN%20ENTERTAINMENT%20GROUP%20PROMOTES%20BRAD%20WINTERS%20TO.htm|title=MTVN ENTERTAINMENT GROUP PROMOTES BRAD WINTERS TO GENERAL MANAGER OF GAMETRAILERS.COM  |publisher=GameTrailers }}&lt;/ref&gt;
