{{Politics of Philippines}}
A '''senatorial election''' in the [[Philippines]] was held on November 8, 1955. The 1955 elections were known as a midterm election as the date when the winners take office falls half-way through [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ramon Magsaysay]]'s  four-year term. Since Magsaysay was very popular midway through his term, there were 10 candidates who ran under the [[Nacionalista Party (Philippines)|Nacionalista]] banner. The top eight candidates were elected as senators. There was a special election held for the vacant seat of Senator [[Carlos P. Garcia]] after he won as Vice President in 1953. Roseller T. Lim won and served the unexpired term of Garcia from [[1955]] to [[1957]].
