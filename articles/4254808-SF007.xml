'''WinImage''' is a disk imaging [[Application software|application]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] created by Gilles Vollant Software. Its features include creating, reading and editing [[disk image]]s and also opening [[VMware]] and [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] hard disk images. WinImage is able to mount an ISO image using the freeware FileDisk driver.

Even though it has been a 32-bit program from its beginnings, it utilized the [[Win32s]] system API, so it could run on Windows 3.x. The last version of WinImage to run on Windows 3.x is version 6.1.

Some versions of WinImage bundle [[FileDisk]][http://www.winimage.com/filedisk.htm], a [[Virtual drive|disk emulator]].
