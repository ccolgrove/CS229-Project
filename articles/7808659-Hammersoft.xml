He was educated at and played for [[Chiyoda-ku|Gyosei Junior High]] and Ghosei High School in [[Tokyo]]. While he was a high school student, he was chosen as one of the Designated Players for Development by [[J. League]] and [[Japan Football Association|JFA]]. Because of this status, Maeda was able to register as a [[Tokyo Verdy 1969|Verdy Kawasaki]] player while he was still eligible to play for his high school club. However, he did not play any official match for Verdy. 

After graduating from his high school in 2000, he joined Jubilo Iwata. His first appearance as a professional player came on May 3, 2000 in a league match against [[Kawasaki Frontale]].

League Top Scorer]] with twenty goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfermarkt.de/de/news/33570/maeda-torschuetzenkoenig.html Maeda TorschÃ¼tzenkÃ¶nig]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 season, Maeda became the top scorer again, netting 17 times.

==International career==
Maeda played for [[Japan national under-20 football team|Japan U-20]] at the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in [[Argentia]]. He also played for [[Japan national under-23 football team|Japan U-23]] at the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics â Men's tournament|2004 Summer Olympics qualification]] but failed to be picked up to the squad for the finals in [[Greece]]. After impressive performance at club, Maeda made his international debut for Japan in a friendly against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] on August 22, 2007 at [[Åita Stadium]]. He scored his first international goal on October 17, 2007 in a friendly against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] at [[Nagai Stadium]] in [[Osaka]]. In 2011, Maeda participated in his first major full international tournament at [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] in [[Qatar]] and started all six games in Japan's Asian Cup winning campaign.
