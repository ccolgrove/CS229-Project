'''HotJava''' (later called '''HotJava Browser''' to distinguish it from [[HotJava Views]]) was a modular, extensible [[web browser]] from [[Sun Microsystems]] implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It was the first browser to support [[Java applet]]s, and was Sun's demonstration platform for the then new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Dave|title=A Quick Look at HotJava|url=http://www.scoug.com/os24u/2001/hotjava.html|publisher=The Southern California OS/2 User Group|accessdate=16 August 2010|date=21 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been discontinued and is now no longer supported. Furthermore, the Sun Download Center was taken down on July 31, 2011, and the download link on the official site points to a placeholder page saying so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Download Center decommission|url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/sdlc-decommission-333274.html|publisher=Oracle Corporation|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1994, a team of Java developers started writing WebRunner, which was a clone of the internet browser [[Mosaic browser|Mosaic]].  It was based on the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language.  The name WebRunner was a tribute to the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=Byous|title=Java Technology: An Early History|url=http://gcc.upb.de/www/WI/WI2/wi2_lit.nsf/7544f3043ee53927c12573e70058bbb6/abf8d70f07c12eb3c1256de900638899/$FILE/Java%20Technology%20-%20An%20early%20history.pdf|publisher=[[Sun Microsystems]]|accessdate=24 November 2010|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WebRunner's first public demonstration was given by [[John Gage]] and [[James Gosling]] at the [[Technology Entertainment Design]] Conference in [[Monterey, California]] in 1995. Renamed HotJava, it was officially announced in May the same year at the SunWorld conference.

==Usage==
HotJava had somewhat limited functionality compared to other browsers of its time.  

More critically, HotJava suffered from the performance limitations of Java virtual machine implementations of the day (both in speed and in memory consumption) and was consequently quite slow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=sX60mAi0eQUC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;lpg=PA378&amp;dq=hotjava+browser+performance+slow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UkKp0KW6bm&amp;sig=nY1_4NF3qt9UO1A2EizzpEqlZ-U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m0dWStLaGOSrjAeumrjfAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9 ''Web performance tuning'', Patrick Killelea, Edition	2, O'Reilly Books, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
