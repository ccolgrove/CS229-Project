==Rigid form factors==

===Bar===
[[Image:Nokia E51 Black.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nokia E51]], a typical &quot;candybar&quot; phone.]]
A '''bar''' ('''slab''', '''block''', or, commonly in the [[United States]], '''candybar''') phone takes the shape of a [[cuboid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobiletechnews.com/info/2006/04/06/114802.html Samsung showcases T509 Slim Bar Phone]; [2006-04-06]; retrieved on [2008-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conita.com/Mobile-Phones/Nokia/48.html 8310 Phone Review]; [2007-06-08]; retrieved on [2008-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt; It is named because of its resemblance to a [[candy bar]] in size and shape. This form factor is widely used by a variety of manufacturers, such as [[Nokia]] and [[List of Sony Ericsson products#Candybar phones|Sony Ericsson]]. Bar-type mobile phones normally have the screen and keypad all on one face. The [[Samsung SPH-M620]] is a unique take on the bar form factor, offering different devices on either side of the bar: a phone on one side, and a [[digital audio player]] on the other.

====Slate====
A '''slate''' phone is a subset of the bar form that, like a [[tablet computer#Slates|slate computer]], has minimal buttons, instead relying upon a [[touchscreen]] and virtual [[QWERTY]] keyboard.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Well-known slate smartphone manufacturers are [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[HTC]], [[LG Electronics]], [[Samsung Mobile]], and [[Nokia]].

==Moving form factors==
===Flip===

{{main|Flip (form)|l1=Flip}}
A '''flip''' (or '''clamshell''') phone consists of two or more sections that are connected by [[hinge]]s, allowing the phone to fold or &quot;flip&quot; in order to become more compact. When flipped open, the phone's speaker and microphone are placed closer to the operator's ear and mouth, improving usability. When flipped shut, the phone can become much smaller and more portable than when it is opened for use.

[[Motorola]] was once owner of a trademark for the term &quot;flip phone&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;US trademark #2157939, cancelled February 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but the term &quot;flip phone&quot; has become [[Genericized trademark|genericized]], and used more frequently than &quot;clamshell&quot; in colloquial speech. Motorola was the manufacturer of the famed [[Motorola StarTAC|StarTAC]] flip phone.

In 2010, Motorola introduced a different take on the flip phone with its [[Motorola Backflip|Backflip]] smartphone. When closed, one side is the screen and the other is a physical QWERTY keyboard. The hinge is on a long edge of the phone instead of a short edge, and when flipped out, the screen is above the keyboard.

===Slider===

A '''slider''' or '''slide''' phone is composed of usually two, but sometimes more, sections that slide past each other on rails. Most slider phones have a display segment which houses the speaker used for calls and the phone's screen, while another segment contains the keypad or keyboard and slides out for use. The goal of using a sliding form factor is to allow the operator to take advantage of full physical keyboards or keypads, without sacrificing portability, by &quot;retracting&quot; them into the phone when these are not in use.

The Siemens SL10 was one of the first sliding mobile phones in 1999{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. Some phones have an automatic slider built in which deploys the keypad. Many phones will &quot;pop out&quot; their keypad segments as soon as the user begins to slide the phone apart. Unique models are the 2-way slider (sliding up or down provides distinct functions) such as the [[Nokia N85]] or [[Nokia N95]].

A version of the slider form factor, the side slider or QWERTY slider, uses vertical access of the keyboard on the bottom segment. The side slider form factor is primarily used to facilitate faster access to the keyboard with both thumbs. The [[Danger Hiptop]] and the Sony [[Mylo (Sony)|Mylo]] are two primary examples.

===Swivel===

A '''swivel''' phone is composed of multiple (usually two) segments, which swivel past each other about a central [[axle]]. Use of the swiveling form factor has similar goals to that of the slider, but this form factor is less widely used.

===Mixed===

Some phone models use both a swivel and a flip axis, like the [[Nokia N90]].

==Brick==
&quot;Brick&quot; is a [[slang]] term often used to refer to large, outdated bar-type phones, though it can be applied to older flip, slider and swivel phones as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7432915|title= First cell phone a true 'brick'|accessdate= 2008-05-18|author= [[Associated Press]]|date= 2005-04-11|publisher= MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slipperybrick.com/2007/02/80s-brick-cell-phone|title= 80âs Brick Cell Phone|accessdate= 2008-05-18 |last= Olson|first= Darrin|date= 2007-02-19|work= SlipperyBrick.com|publisher= Pragmatic Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1082521|title= DynaTAC 8000X - the World's First Mobile Phone|date= 2003-07-03|work= [[h2g2]]|publisher= [[BBC]]|accessdate= 2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large, bulky phones such as the [[Motorola DynaTAC]] have been displaced by their newer, smaller counterparts, which offer greater portability thanks to smaller antennas and slimmer battery packs.
