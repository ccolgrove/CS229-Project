The '''Italian election of 1983''' was held on [[June 26]]. The '''ninth''' Parliament of republican Italy was selected.

The ''Pentaparty'' formula, the governative alliance between five [[centrism|centrist]] parties, caused unexpected problems to the [[Italian Christian Democracy|Christian Democracy]]. The alliance was fixed and universal, extended both to the national government and to the local administrations. Considering that the election result did not longer depend by the strength of the DC, but by the strength of the entire ''Pentaparty'', centrist electors began to look at the Christian Democratic vote as not necessary to prevent a Communist success. More, voting for one of the four minor parties of the alliance was seen as a form of moderate protest against the government without giving advantages to the PCI. Other minor effects of this election were a reduction of the referendarian [[Italian Radical Party|Radical Party]] and the appearance of some regional forces.

==Electoral system==
[[File:1983 Italian Senate election map.png|thumb|left|220px|Regional pluralities in Senate]]
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system for the Chamber of Deputies. [[Italian province]]s were united in 32 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at national level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

For the Senate, 237 single-seat constituencies were established, even if the assembly had risen to 315 members. The candidates needed a landslide victory of two thirds of votes to be elected, a goal which could be reached only by the German minorities in South Tirol. All remained votes and seats were grouped in party lists and regional constituencies, where a [[D'Hondt method]] was used: inside the lists, candidates with the best percentages were elected.

==Results==
The DC respected the pact of an alternance of leadership between the parties of the alliance and accepted the [[Socialist]] secretary, [[Bettino Craxi]], as the new [[Prime Minister of Italy]]. The Christian Democrats hoped that their minor responsibility could drive away some popular discontent from their party. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] so arrived to the highest office of the government for the first time in history. Differently from the DC, which had an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] structure, the PSI was strongly ruled by its secretary, so the Craxi's premiership resulted the longest one without any political crisis in post-war Italy, despite some international tensions with the [[United States]] about the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]. Craxi formed a renewed government in 1986, but could not survive in 1987 to a dispute with DC's secretary [[Ciriaco De Mita]], who was searching and effectively obtained an early national election, ruled by an electoral Christian Democratic government with old [[Amintore Fanfani]] as PM.
