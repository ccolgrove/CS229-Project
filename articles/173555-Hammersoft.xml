[[Image:Baseball SS.svg|thumb|right|The position of the shortstop]]

'''Shortstop''', abbreviated '''''SS''''', is the [[baseball positions|baseball fielding position]] between [[second base|second]] and [[third base]]. Shortstop is often regarded as the most dynamic [[Defense (sports)|defensive]] position in baseball, because there are more [[Right-handedness|right-handed]] hitters in baseball than [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly, so more balls go to the shortstop than any other position. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.

==Positioning==
In practice the shortstop ordinarily positions himself to the third-base side of second base, but ordinarily much closer to second base than toward third base.  Against an extreme pull hitter the shortstop may tend to a position about halfway between second base and third base for a right-hand hitter, and even on the first-base side of second base for a left-hand hitter.  Because the shortstop typically fields some of the [[ground ball]]s that have traveled farthest in the [[infield]] and has a longer throw to first base from the point at which he fields the ball than any infielder other than a third baseman and less time in which to make a throw, a shortstop must have one of the strongest throwing arms on the field. Because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to almost any other base, a shortstop must be extremely agile. On some bunt plays, the shortstop often must make a run to third base so that the third baseman can field the bunt and throw to third base in a [[fielder's choice]] play in which the shortstop makes the play at third base. Such makes the position unusually difficult to fill. Shortstops have included some of the weakest hitters in baseball, including [[Mario Mendoza]], for whom [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] coined the eponymous [[Mendoza Line]] to describe the lowest batting average among players who have significant time in the major leagues. 

In practice, a marginal fielder as a shortstop who hits well can be moved to almost any other position, especially second base or third base, whether early in their careers (examples: George Brett and [[Mike Schmidt]] were both tried early in their careers as shortstops)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brettge01.shtml |title=George Brett Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schmimi01.shtml |title=Mike Schmidt Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or later due to diminished [[fielding range]], slower reflexes, weaker throwing arms, increased risk of injury, or co-existence with another dominant shortstop, as with [[Ernie Banks]], [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]], [[Alex RodrÃ­guez]], [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], or [[Miguel Tejada]].           

Shortstops are required to [[covering a base|cover second base]] in [[double play]] situations when the ball is hit to the [[second baseman]], [[first baseman]], [[pitcher]], or [[catcher]].  They cover second when a runner is attempting a [[stolen base]], but only when a left-handed hitter is batting. This is because the chances of a ball being hit to the left side of the infield are almost cut in half.  They also must cover third at various times, including the rotation play; that is, when there are runners on first and second and a [[sacrifice bunt]] is attempted.  Shortstops generally are given precedence on catching pop-ups in the [[infielder|infield]] as well, so they end up calling off other players many times, although on deep pop-ups they fall back when called off by an [[outfielder]]. They often become the cutoff man on balls to any part of the outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and right field that are destined to second base. Depending on the system the shortstop may cut balls from left field heading home however, this is usually the role of a third basemen.
