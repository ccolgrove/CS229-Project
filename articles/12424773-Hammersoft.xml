'''53 Days''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|Rock]] [[Band (music)|band]] based in [[Western New York]].

==Band history==
===Early years===
John Moore began 53 Days in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1996. The original line-up of 53 Days consisted mainly of Moore (vocals, guitar and keyboards), Tom Robinson (bass), Steve Ryder (guitar) and Mike Sands (drums). The 53 Days original sound was essentially roots rock, alt-pop that was primarily melodic and lyrical music. 
In the early incarnation, 53 Days created two albums independently for Accidental Man Records through 2000 and one for the Buffalo Trax label in 2001. 
Their first LP, [[Why Would You Care]], sold slowly but spawned airplay with the upbeat single &quot;Whole Inside&quot;. Their second CD titled &quot;Hot Water Music&quot; sold better and received acclaim yet failed to garner much attention outside of the northeast. However, the band saw the song &quot;A Little Longer&quot; named the #1 song for 1997 on WBNY-FM, and had &quot;Nothing Hurts You Now&quot; used in the TV shows &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;The Promised Land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19990221225345/www.wnymusic.com/53days/gazette42498.htm The 'Water' is just right for local band 53 Days]&lt;/ref&gt;

A third album followed on the Buffalo Trax label produced by [[Gary Mallaber]] ([[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Eddie Money]], [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]]) called &quot;Concert Special&quot;. Fans have dubbed it the 'Red' CD. The single &quot;Get A Little Lost&quot; garnered regular rotation in Canada on [[CKEY-FM]] 101.1, Fort Erie/ Niagara Falls.

The band went on hiatus from summer 2002 until January 2005.

53 Days provided the song &quot;Shelter Me&quot; for the soundtrack album to the movie ''[[Lonestar State Of Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0269483/soundtrack Lone Star State of Mind (2002) - Soundtracks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The movie featured [[John Mellencamp]] in a role. The songs &quot;These Days&quot; and &quot;When it Goes 'round&quot; were used in the film &quot;Last Big Attraction&quot;, the latter over the closing credits.

53 Days recorded a cover of a [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] song with &quot;The Cross&quot; on the debut CD &quot;Why Would You Care&quot;
