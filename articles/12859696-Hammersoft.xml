The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Denver Broncos]] season''' was the franchise's 49th season for the team (their 39th season in the [[National Football League]]). They improved from their 7â9 record from [[2007]] but failed to make the playoffs with an 8â8 record. On December 30, 2008, two days after the regular season ended, Mike Shanahan was fired as the Broncos head coach.

==Coaching staff==
2008 marked head coach [[Mike Shanahan]]'s 14th year (1995 to 2008) with the Broncos. Shanahan was fired at the end of the season, a move considered surprising at the time.

==Offseason moves==
On February 29, 2008, LB [[Ian Gold]] and WR [[Javon Walker]] were released by the [[Denver Broncos]] in preparation for the NFL Draft and free agency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_8409167&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker was signed by the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3277219&lt;/ref&gt;    Long-time Broncos kicker [[Jason Elam]] was not resigned by the Broncos, and was then signed by the [[Atlanta Falcons]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/03/21-30/Falcons_sign_veteran_kicker_Elam.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2008, RB [[Travis Henry]] was cut by the team.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3422418&lt;/ref&gt; Seventh Round pick Josh Barrett signed on June 12,&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=11454&lt;/ref&gt; the first draft pick to sign with the team.  Wide receiver [[Rod Smith (American football)|Rod Smith]], a veteran of both of the Broncos Super Bowl victories, retired on the first day of training camp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/teams/denverbroncos/transactions?team=DEN&lt;/ref&gt;

If we donât have the injuries, Iâd be very disappointed if we didnât make the playoffs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/aug/01/broncos-shanahan-expecations/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Broncos began their 2008 campaign on the road against their AFC West rival, the [[Oakland Raiders]], in the second game of ESPN's [[Monday Night Football]] doubleheader.  In the first quarter, Denver ran out of the gates early as QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] completed a 26-yard TD pass to rookie WR [[Eddie Royal]] (who was filling in for WR [[Brandon Marshall]], due to his 1-game suspension).  In the second quarter, the Broncos continued their domination as kicker [[Matt Prater]] got a 26-yard field goal, while FB [[Michael Pittman]] got a 3-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Denver ran away with the game as Cutler completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR [[Darrell Jackson]], while Prater nailed a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Raiders spoiled the Broncos' bid for a shutout as QB [[JaMarcus Russell]] completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR [[Ashley Lelie]].  Denver ended its domination with RB [[Selvin Young]]'s 5-yard TD run and Pittman's 1-yard TD run.  Oakland ended the scoring with Russell completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR [[Ronald Curry]].

With the dominating win, the Broncos began their season at 1â0; with the rest of the division suffering losses, Denver, in Week 1, is in sole possession of 1st place.

Eddie Royal, in his NFL debut, had the best Week 1 stats of any wide receiver, getting 9 receptions for 146 yards and a touchdown.

In the second quarter, Denver replied with QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE [[Tony Scheffler]].

The Chargers would strike as their lead as QB [[Philip Rivers]] completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR [[Chris Chambers]], yet Denver retaliated with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR [[Brandon Marshall]].

In the third quarter, San Diego started to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, whil Kaeding kicked a 21-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Chargers took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles.  Fortunately, the Broncos responded with a 12-play, 80-yard drive (which included a [[Ed Hochuli#Memorable games|controversial officiating call]] that turned a Cutler fumble into an incomplete pass) that was capped off with Cutler's 4-yard TD pass to rookie WR [[Eddie Royal]], followed by Cutler's successful 2-point conversion pass to Royal.

With an exciting win, Denver improved to 2â0.

Brandon Marshall's 18 receptions would become a single-game franchise record and tie for 2nd most in league history.

The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] got off to a good start after they forced the [[Denver Broncos]] to punt. This was followed with a 65-yard run by [[Larry Johnson (American football)|Larry Johnson]] to set up a 23-yard field goal kick by [[Nick Novak]], putting the Chiefs on top 3â0. After recovering an [[Eddie Royal]] fumble early on Denver's next drive, Kansas City again failed to make it to the end zone and a 21-yard field goal by Novak put the Chiefs up 6â0.

The Broncos responded with an 8-play, 9-minute drive in the second quarter that ended in a touchdown pass from [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] to [[Brandon Marshall]], putting the Broncos briefly in the lead, 7â6. Later in the quarter, a fumble by Marshall was returned to the Broncos' 2-yard line by the Chiefs, followed 2 plays later by a Johnson touchdown run, putting the Chiefs up 13â7. The Broncos got the ball back, but a 28-yard field goal by [[Matt Prater]] went wide right. After forcing the Chiefs to punt, the Broncos got the ball back and Prater hit a 56-yarder near the end of the half, drawing the Broncos within 13â10.

The second half began with a Denver drive that resulted in a 51-yard Prater field goal, tying the game at 13â13. The Chiefs answered with a 43-yard Novak field goal, putting them back on top 16â13. On the next drive, Cutler threw an interception. However, Kansas City's very next play was a Larry Johnson fumble recovered by Denver, although 2 plays later Cutler threw another interception. Despite this exchange of turnovers (3 turnovers in 4 plays), there was no scoring for the rest of the 3rd quarter.

Early in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs extended their lead to 23â13 with a 10-yard touchdown pass from [[Damon Huard]] to [[Tony Gonzalez (tight end)|Tony Gonzalez]]. The Broncos, however, failed to capitalize on a sustained 16-play, 75-yard drive and settled with a Prater field goal, cutting the lead to 23â16. The Chiefs and Broncos then each got field goals on their next drives, bringing the score to 26â16. The Chiefs got a good return after the Prater field goal and put the game away with a 16-yard touchdown run from Johnson. With the 33â19 victory, the Chiefs snapped a league-leading 12 game losing streak dating back to week 7 of the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]].

Larry Johnson carried the Chiefs with 198 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Huard managed the game well for the Chiefs, throwing 21/28 for 160 yards and 1 touchdown. Denver was hurt by 4 turnovers compared to just 1 for the Chiefs, but despite 2 interceptions, Cutler still was able to throw for 361 yards on 29/49 passing.
