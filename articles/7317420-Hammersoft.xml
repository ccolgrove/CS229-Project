The '''Indian Naval Air Arm''' is part of the [[Indian Navy]] which is tasked to provide an aircraft carrier based strike capability, fleet air defence, maritime reconnaissance, and anti-submarine warfare. To undertake these tasks, the Indian Navy employs an aircraft carrier and a variety of manned and unmanned aircraft and helicopters. The [[INS Viraat]] carries a complement of [[Sea Harrier]] aircraft and Kamov, Sea King, Chetak and Dhruv helicopters. The [[Kamov Ka-27|Kamov Ka-31]] provides [[AEW]] support for the fleet. In the anti-submarine role, the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]], Ka-28 and the indigenously-built [[HAL Dhruv]] are used. The [[MARCOS (India)|MARCOS]] use Sea King and HAL Dhruv helicopters while conducting operations. Reconnaissance operations are carried out by [[Tupolev Tu-142]]s, [[Ilyushin Il-38]]s, [[Dornier Do 228]]s and also by [[HAL Chetak]] helicopters. The [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] arm consists of around 30 UAVs, such as [[IAI Heron|Heron]] and Searcher-IIs, that are operated from ships and shore for better surveillance. The Indian Navy also maintains an aerobatic display team, the [[Sagar Pawan]]. The Sagar Pawan team will be replacing the present [[HAL Kiran|HJT-16 Kiran]] with the [[HAL HJT-36|HJT-36]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://indian-navy.101center.net/ 101 Center]&lt;/ref&gt; The HJT-36 will also be used in training pilots.

== History ==
The first naval air station, [[INS Garuda Kochi|INS ''Garuda'']], was inaugurated in Cochin on 11 May 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=zLdeAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=INS+Garuda&amp;dq=INS+Garuda&amp;ei=c6RBSMHpD4TqiQGW0JmJBQ&amp;pgis=1 ''Military Year-book'' - India 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; This went hand-in-hand with the commissioning of the No.550 Squadron,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Timeline.html ''Bharat-Rakshak.com'' - Indian Navy Timeline - &quot;11 May 1953: First Naval Air Station, INS Garuda, inaugurated at Cochin.

1960 saw the No.300 White Tigers Squadron,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Timeline.html ''Bharat-Rakshak.com'' - Indian Navy Timeline - &quot;1960: No.300 White Tigers Squadron (consisting of Sea Hawk aircraft) commissioned.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of Sea Hawks&lt;ref name=&quot;warbirdsofindia.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.warbirdsofindia.com/wbgoanam03.html ''Naval Aviation Museum, Dabolim, Goa, India'' - http://www.warbirdsofindia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft being commissioned.

In the very next year (1961), [[INS Vikrant|INS ''Vikrant'']] (formerly HMS ''Hercules'') was acquired by the Indian Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=zLdeAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=INS+Vikrant&amp;dq=INS+Vikrant&amp;ei=j6tBSJy0GZOcjgGYtqCIBQ&amp;pgis=1 ''Military Year-book'' - India 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vikrant'''s initial airwing consisted of British [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] fighter-bombers and a French [[Breguet Alize|Alize]] anti-submarine aircraft. On 18 May 1961, the first jet landed on board, piloted by Lieutenant (later Admiral) R H Tahiliani. That year, the No.310 Cobras Squadron (consisting of Alize aircraft &lt;ref name=&quot;warbirdsofindia.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PY8CvlKC7kgC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=310+cobras+squadron&amp;ei=G61BSLPKHoa4jgHD1tiIBQ&amp;sig=FuSTnuxVRv1ZP7niCgxDweECKXM ''Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft'' By Richard Jones,  Chris Bishop,  Chris Chant,  Christopher Chant]&lt;/ref&gt;) was commissioned. After playing an important role in several major Indian military actions, specifically the liberation of Goa and the India-Pakistan war in 1971, she was decommissioned in January 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=kEj-2a7pmVMC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=INS+Vikrant+decommissioned&amp;ei=-LlBSLC_BojCiQGyws2IBQ&amp;sig=2tc2x_iM2z1dEfXFmxW5MMcHSY0 ''Students' Britannica India'' By Dale Hoiberg,  Indu Ramchandani]&lt;/ref&gt; and turned into a museum ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutiny.wordpress.com/2007/03/02/ins-vikrant-the-naval-museum/ ''INS Vikrant - the naval museum''] Posted by Nita&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alize1270.jpg|thumb|left|The Alize Anti-Submarine Aircraft used on the Vikrant]]
In 1976, the [[Indian Air Force]] handed over [[Super Constellation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warbirdsofindia.com/wbgoanam06.html ''Naval Aviation Museum, Dabolim, Goa, India'' - http://www.warbirdsofindia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  aircraft to the No.312 Albatross Squadron&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Timeline.html ''Bharat-Rakshak.com'' - Indian Navy Timeline - &quot;1976: No.312 Albatross Squadron (consisting of Super Constellation aircraft) commissioned.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dabolim]], Goa. Being fairly old aircraft at that point, these were withdrawn from active service by 1983. The No.315 Winged Stallions Squadron was commissioned in 1977&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Timeline.html ''Bharat-Rakshak.com'' - Indian Navy Timeline - &quot;01 October 1977: No.315 Winged Stallions Squadron (consisting of IL-38 aircraft) commissioned.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Ilyushin Il-38]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/IL-38.html Bharat-Rakshak ''Indian Navy Timelines'']&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft.

===Operation Vijay===

The [[INS Vikrant]] participated in [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]], the liberation of [[Goa]] from [[Portugal]]. Its role was primarily to deter foreign naval intervention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sankalpindia.net/drupal/?q=node/2413 Sankalp India Foundation - &quot;What happened during Operation Vijay (1961)?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; during the 40-hour long military action in December, 1961.

===India Pakistan War 1971===

The [[INS Vikrant]] played a major role in the successful Naval blockade of East Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PY8CvlKC7kgC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Vikrant+1971&amp;ei=ibFTSM_PMY6QtAPb4fm7Cw&amp;sig=-dy2013FLTEJScp0xIjPhdvxN8w Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft] By Richard Jones,  Chris Bishop,  Chris Chant,  Christopher Chant&lt;/ref&gt; Stationed off the [[Andaman &amp; Nicobar]] islands along with Indian naval ships, INS Bramhaputra and INS Beas, the Vikrant redeployed towards [[Chittagong]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj30oQuTBDU&amp;amp;feature=related YouTube documentary]&lt;/ref&gt; at the outbreak of hostilities. The morning of 4 December 1971, the eight Sea Hawk aircraft on the Vikrant launched an air raid on [[Cox's Bazaar]] from 60&amp;nbsp;nm away. That evening, the air group struck Chittagong harbour. Future strikes targeted Khulna and Mongla. A PTI message is supposed to have read, &quot;Chittagong harbour abalze as ships and aircraft of the (Pakistan) Eastern Naval Fleet bombed and rocketed. Not a single vessel can be put to sea from Chittagong&quot;. Air strikes staged from the Vikrant continued till 10 December 1971.

Given naval intelligence that indicated the intent of the [[Pakistan Navy]] to break through the Indian Naval blockade using camouflaged merchant ships, the Vikrant's Sea Hawks struck shipping in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar harbours, sinking or incapacitating most merchant ships there.

The [[PNS Ghazi]] submarine was deployed to sink the [[INS Vikrant]]. However, she sank off [[Visakhapatnam]] harbor under mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZcejlMRYNAAC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=PNS+Ghazi&amp;ei=LKdDSKG0H4KijgGs1qG-BQ&amp;sig=9YcFuLJttkAY3wIH965XTx6eU1Y Seapower: A Guide for the Twenty-first Century] By Geoffrey Till&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aircraft Carrier ==
[[Image:INS Viraat (R22) Malabar 07.jpg|left|thumb|INS Viraat in the [[Bay of Bengal]]]]
[[INS Viraat]] was originally commissioned in the [[Royal Navy]] as [[HMS Hermes (R12)|HMS Hermes]] on 18 November 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;bharat-rakshak.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Viraat.html - ''Centaur Class'' - http://www.bharat-rakshak.com]&lt;/ref&gt; While in the Royal Navy, Hermes was the flagship carrier during the [[Falkland Islands]] campaign. The vessel was acquired by the [[Indian Navy]] in April 1986 following an extensive refit at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]]. Another refit followed between 1999 and 2001, which is expected to extend her useful life till 2010. However, there is some uncertainty around this retirement date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/r-viraat.htm - ''R 22 Viraat Class HMS Centaur Class (UK) Aircraft Carrier'' - GlobalSecurity.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The second refit upgraded propulsion systems, added a package of sensors to sound emergency alerts, and introduced modern communication systems. In addition, long-range surveillance radar, weapon systems, and new hangar with fire curtains was installed. The lift system was revamped to reduce reaction time in the event of an attack and a new flood alarm system was installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;bharat-rakshak.com&quot;/&gt; Another year of down time followed while the ship received the Israeli [[Barak SAM|Barak surface-to-air missile]] system in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;bharat-rakshak.com&quot;/&gt; In a wartime scenario, the INS Viraat can embark up to 18 combat aircraft. INS Viraat is ideally suited for two missions: supporting amphibious operations and conducting ASW operations. Despite its age and range considerations, INS Viraat can quite effectively project naval and air power anywhere in the South Asia region.

* [[Mikoyan]] [[MiG-29K]] 
[[Image:MiG-29K on the MAKS-2009 (01).jpg|thumb|The Mig-29 Ks to be stationed on the [[INS Vikramaditya]]]]
The MiG-29K program was revived by Russia in response to the decision of the Indian Navy to acquire the [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/airdef/mig-29.htm MIG-29 FULCRUM (MIKOYAN-GUREVICH)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/MiG-29K.html MiG-29K/KUB FULCRUM-D at Bharat-Rakshak]&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by MiG Bureau, the Indian Navy's association with the MiG-29K began in Apr 2002 when a team led by Commander Gupta reached Moscow to evaluate the MiG-29K prototype for possible induction into the Indian Navy. The Team evaluated the aircraft on ground as well as in the air (the flight evaluation was conducted by a Navy Test Pilot Commander Ahuja). Some other aircraft were also evaluated but the MiG-29K was chosen. The first 4 of the 16 aircraft contracted for were inducted into the Indian Navy late 2009. The Indian Navy is likely to buy 29 more of these aircraft. On 20 January 2004, the Indian Navy signed a contract for 12 single-seat MiG-29K and 4 two-seat MiG-29KUB [http://research.scottrade.com/qnr/Public/Markets/Article?dockey=100-217c0885-1  11(9+2)of 16 delevered].

The aircraft has been made ready for aircraft carrier operation by hardening the undercarriage.  The aircraft also has much better over-the-nose vision to make it easy to land aboard a carrier at high angle of attack.  The Naval version also has additional fuel carrying capacity as also a capacity to carry more weapons since there are a total of nine stations as against only seven with the Air Force version.  The aircraft also has a full glass cockpit with three large size multi-function displays.  Modifications were made for Indian Navy requirement featured Zhuk-ME radar, RD-33MK engine, combat payload up to 5,500&amp;nbsp;kg, 13 hardpoints (inclusive of the multi-lock bomb carriers), additional fuel tanks situated in dorsal spine fairing and wing LERXs, increased total fuel capacity by 50% comparing to first variant of MiG-29 and updated 4-channel digital fly-by-wire flight control system. With special coatings MiG-29K radar reflecting surface is 4-5 times smaller than of basic MiG-29. Cockpit displays consist of wide HUD and 3 (7 on MiG-29KUB) colour LCD MFDs and French Sigma-95 satellite GPS module and [[Topsight E]] helmet-mounted targeting system.

The BAE Sea Harrier operates from the [[INS Viraat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlAiq2Umj1w Indian Navy Sea Harrier Operations video on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; The BAE Sea Harrier FRS Mk.51 / T Mk.60 fly with the INAS 300 and INAS 552 squadrons of the Indian Navy. They were first acquired by the Indian Navy in the mid-1980s. After years of undergoing maintenance in the UK, the Indian Navy launched Project Ashok to set up a maintenance facility in Kochi in 1994. A mid-life upgrade in 1999 for these aircraft was cancelled when the decision was made to purchase MiG-29K air defence fighters, to be deployed aboard the [[INS Vikramaditya]] (formerly Admiral Gorshkov). The Sea Harriers are armed with the Matra Magic-II AAM and the Sea Eagle Anti-ship missiles. The aircraft were upgraded with the [[Elta]] [[EL/M-2032]] radar and the [[Rafael Derby]] BVRAAM missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Galleries/AirArm/Harrier/ Bharat-Rakshak.com]: The White Tigers of Rewa&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Sea Harriers were expected to remain in service with the Indian Navy till 2012-15, limited upgrades are being performed on these Sea Harriers by [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL), to extend the life of the aircraft by 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/29/219935/india-to-extend-sea-harrier-by-15-years.html Flight Global]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tupolev Tu-142]]
The [[Indian Navy]] operates eight Tu-142 aircraft. The aircraft was inducted into service in the year 1988. Upgrading of the aircraft are taking place, which helps to extend the service life of the aircraft by sixteen years. One the upgraded aircraft has been handed over to the Indian Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.cnews.ru/news/line/indexEn.shtml?2007/10/10/269866 Modernized Tu-142 handed over to Indian Eastern Headquarters]&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft operates from INS Rajali and INS Hansa. Two Tu-142 aircraft are being fitted with the air launched version of the [[Brahmos]]. The aircraft will be the test platform for the Brahmos cruise missiles. The integration and tests of the missile is expected to be completed by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Forceindia.net&lt;/ref&gt; The eight aircraft will be fitted with the Brahmos cruise missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rusnavy.com/news/othernavies/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=10007 Upgraded ASW aircraft Tu-142ME delivered to Indian Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Aircraft Carriers ==
[[Vikrant class aircraft carrier|''Vikrant'' class aircraft carrier]]:In April 2005, India began construction of a 40,000&amp;nbsp;tonne ''Vikrant'' class aircraft carrier at a cost of {{INRConvert|40|b|1}} and scheduled to operate 30 aircraft, including [[HAL Tejas|Naval LCA]], [[MiG 29|MiG-29K]], and Sea Harrier combat aircraft, as well as [[HAL Dhruv]], [[Kamov Ka-31|Ka-31]], and [[H-3 Sea King|Sea King Mk.42]] helicopters. Four [[turbine]] engines will power the ship. The carrier is being constructed by state-run [[Cochin Shipyard]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/12/content_433517.htm India's construction of aircraft carrier.]&lt;/ref&gt; and will be commissioned by 2012-13. The Indian Minister of State for Defence, Pallam Raju, went on record in September 2006 stating that the aircraft carrier is likely to be commissioned by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEA20060913042608 IAC construction]&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to build more Indigenous aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://deccanherald.com/deccanherald/nov152006/national2344220061114.asp India to have â3-carrier Navyâ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Baku DN-SN-89-06990c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']] was sold to India for conversion into a STOBAR carrier to be named [[INS Vikramaditya]].]]
[[INS Vikramaditya]]: On 20 January 2004, after years of negotiations, [[Russia]] and [[India]] signed a deal for the sale of the ship, the then-[[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|Admiral Gorshkov]]. The ship was free, while India will pay US$800 million for upgrade and refit of the ship, as well as at least an additional $1bn for the aircraft and weapons systems. The Navy looked at equipping the carrier with the [[E-2D]], but decided not to. The deal also includes the purchase of 12 single-seat [[MiG-29K]] 'Fulcrum-D' (Product 9.41) and 4 dual-seat [[MiG-29K|MiG-29KUB]] aircraft (with an option for 14 more aircraft)$1bn, 6 [[Kamov Ka-31]] &quot;Helix&quot; reconnaissance and anti-submarine helicopters, torpedo tubes, missile systems, and artillery units. Facilities and procedures for training pilots and technical staff, delivery of simulators, spare parts, and establishment maintenance on [[Indian Navy]] facilities are also part of the contract.
The announced delivery date for INS Vikramaditya was August 2008, an ambitious schedule, but one that would allow the carrier to enter service in 2009, around the time as light carrier [[INS Viraat]] (formerly HMS Hermes, last of the Centaur class) was scheduled to retire. The new ship will berth at the new Indian Navy facility in [[Karwar]], on Indiaâs west coast. The INS Viraatâs retirement is now set for 2010-2012. The sea trials of [[INS Vikramaditya]] are expected to begin by 2010 and delivery is expected by 2012.

== Aircraft Under Development and Future Aircraft ==

*[[HAL Tejas]]:The naval variant of the Tejas will have strengthened landing gear and other necessary modifications for service on an aircraft carrier. Two Naval prototypes will be built, the NP-1 (Naval Prototype-1) which will be a two seat variant and NP-2 (Naval Prototype-2), a single seat variant for carrier operations. The Tejas is expected to be delivered before 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lca-tejas.org/naval%20tejas.html Naval Tejas]&lt;/ref&gt; The first flight of NP-1 is expected to take place by the end of 2008 but the carrier trials was delayed due to the delay in the delivery schedule of [[INS Vikramaditya]]. Hence the trials will have to be carried out at the SBTF (Shore-based Test Facility) under construction at the naval airbase INS Hansa in Goa. Indian Navy plans to operate two squadrons (40 aircraft) of carrier borne Tejas aircraft from the two aircraft carries, INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4818&amp;issueid=41&amp;Itemid=1 Gorshkov delay stalls carrier trials of naval LCA]&lt;/ref&gt; Indian navy has placed an order for six Naval LCAs.
