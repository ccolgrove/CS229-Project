'''One News''' is the news division of New Zealand television network [[TVNZ]]. The service is [[live television|broadcast live]] from TVNZ Centre in [[Auckland, New Zealand|Auckland]]. The flagship news bulletin is the nightly 6pm news hour, but ''One News'' also has midday, afternoon and late night news bulletins, as well as [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] shows such as Breakfast and Close Up.

The 6pm programme is New Zealand's most-watched news programme. As of July 2008, it has a market share of 44% (651,400+ each night).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/816457/1984361 &quot;Nine months of growth for One News&quot;]. ''TVNZ''. August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current editor of One News is Paul Patrick, and the head of TVNZ News and Current Affairs is Anthony Flannery.

''One News'' was judged ''Best News'' in the [[Qantas Media Awards]] in September 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

==History==

Television news in New Zealand started in 1960 with the introduction of television. These bulletins were broadcast from the main centres ([[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]]) operating completely independently of each other due to technical constraints. The [[Wahine disaster|Wahine Disaster]] in April 1968 highlighted the need for a nationwide new network, as footage from [[Wellington]] could not be easily shown in other centres around the country within a short space of time.

The first network news broadcast was live, airing on 3 November 1969 at 7:35pm to the whole country, read by [[Dougal Stevenson]]. This bulletin was possible due to microwave links being established between the four main centres; the programme was called [[NZBC]] Network News. Initially, it was read by [[Philip Sherry]], [[Dougal Stevenson]] or [[Bill Toft]] on a rotating roster.

Prior to the building of the [[Warkworth, New Zealand|Warkworth]] Station in 1971, international programmes could not be received live â the footage had to be flown into New Zealand and was often days old. [[Angela D'Audney]] was the first female newsreader in New Zealand, from 1973. The Network News featured many other newsreaders until the NZBC was dissolved in 1975. The programme was then renamed simply ''News''. Several regional news programmes were broadcast alongside the ''Network News'' to different regions of the country during this time. As the popularity of these bulletins decreased in the late 1980s, the main ''Network News'' bulletin was revamped in 1987. It was renamed ''Network News'' with [[Judy Bailey]] and [[Neil Billington]] presenting the show from the beginning. [[Richard Long (broadcaster)|Richard Long]] and Tony Ciprian alternately presented and produced sports news. Later that year Long took over from Billington as 'Network News' news co-anchor, the beginning of a partnership that would continue for much of the next fifteen years.Ciprian moved to the new commercial channel TV3, the station's first sports news producer. He was with 3 News for almost 20 years. 

Until 1990, four regional news programmes were broadcast â one in each of the four main regions: ''Top Half'' ([[Auckland]] and the upper [[North Island]]), ''Today Tonight'' ([[Wellington]] and the lower North Island and originally the upper South Island), ''The Mainland Touch'' ([[Christchurch]], [[Canterbury (New Zealand)|Canterbury]] and later the upper [[South Island]]) and ''The South Tonight'' ([[Otago]] and [[Southland Region|Southland]]). These programmes ran for 20 minutes during the main news programme at 6.30pm, between the sports and weather news, but were later moved to before the main broadcast to make way for the current affairs programme, ''Holmes'', which was first broadcast on 11 April 1989. It carried the famous tagline ''&quot;Those were our people today, that's Holmes tonight&quot;''. ''Holmes'' screened at 6.30pm weekdays, so the ''Network News'' was moved back to its current time of 6:00pm.

1989 saw the introduction of the first ''One News'' foreign correspondents â [[Liam Jeory]] in London and [[Susan Wood (New Zealand)|Susan Wood]] in Sydney.

In 1989, ''Network News'' was relaunched as ''One Network News'', due to competition from new broadcasting station [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]'s news programme ''[[3 News|3 National News]]''. In 1995, the main 6pm bulletin was extended from 30 to 60 minutes, coinciding with the unveiling of a new studio set. On 11 August 1997, the early morning ''Telstra Business'' and ''Breakfast'' shows were first aired; Telstra Business was hosted by [[Michael Wilson]]; [[Breakfast]] hosted by [[Susan Wood (television presenter)|Susan Wood]] and [[Mike Hosking]].

The end of 1997 saw the replacement of weekend news presenters [[Angela D'Audney]] and [[Tom Bradley (broadcaster)|Tom Bradley]] with husband and wife [[Simon Dallow]] and [[Alison Mau]]. Bradley resigned, but D'Audney stayed as a backup presenter for other bulletins until her death in February 2002, from a brain tumour.

In 1998, TVNZ signed [[3 News]] anchor [[John Hawkesby]] to replace Richard Long from the start of 1999. But when Haweskby began presenting ''One Network News'' at 6pm alongside Judy Bailey, there was a public outcry over the separation of Bailey and Long, that lead to Long reinstated as co-anchor at 6pm three weeks later. Hawkesby later took [[TVNZ]] to court, a dispute that he subsequently won.

The show was renamed again on 31 December 1999, this time to the current name of ''One News''.

2003 saw a major shake up of TVNZ's news and current affairs programming with entering head [[Bill Ralston]] making sweeping changes to the formats of many programmes. A new state-of-the-art studio came into use for ''One News'' programmes, but many presenters were culled. The changes saw the end of Long and Bailey's 15-year partnership; from January 2004, the main 6pm bulletin reverted to a single-headed broadcast with Judy Bailey as anchor. [[Jim Hickey (broadcaster)|Jim Hickey]], TVNZ's most popular weather presenter, and sports presenter [[April Bruce]] (nÃ©e Ieremia) also left in 2003. Jim returned to ''One News'' in 2007.

The current affairs programme, ''[[Close Up]]'' was launched in November 2004, when [[Paul Holmes (broadcaster)|Paul Holmes]], host of the ''Holmes'' programme, resigned following failed contract negotiations. ''Close Up'' followed the same format as ''Holmes'', but was hosted by [[Susan Wood (New Zealand)|Susan Wood]] until her sudden resignation in 2006. [[Mark Sainsbury (New Zealand)|Mark Sainsbury]] became the main host following her resignation.

In October 2005, TVNZ announced that it would not be renewing long-standing flagship broadcaster [[Judy Bailey]]'s contract; some observers believe this was a direct reaction to the programme's market share decline in [[Auckland]] to ''[[3 News]]''. An emotional Bailey signed off for the final time at the end of the 6pm ''One News'' bulletin on 23 December 2005. She was TVNZ's longest serving newsreader and had been reporting and presenting with both NZBC and TVNZ for 34 years. When the 6pm edition of ''One News'' returned after the Christmas break of 2005â2006, it reverted back to double-headed presentation with [[Wendy Petrie]] and [[Simon Dallow]] taking over from Bailey.

The weekend 6pm bulletin remained single-headed until September 2008, when popular presenter Peter Williams joined Bernadine Oliver-Kirby as co-anchor.

[[Paul Holmes (broadcaster)|Paul Holmes]] returned to TVNZ as the host on the new political programme ''Q+A'' in 2009.

TVNZ celebrated One News' 40th birthday on 3 November 2009 with some archival footage available on their website.

A Saturday edition of Breakfast will be broadcast from 3 September, hosted by [[Rawdon Christie]] and [[Toni Street]].

The main ''One News'' bulletin screens nightly at 6pm and is fronted by [[Simon Dallow]] and [[Wendy Petrie]] on weekdays, and [[Bernadine Oliver-Kerby]], and [[Peter Williams (broadcaster)|Peter Williams]] at weekends.

The bulletin leads with general news items for the first part of the show, with a weather update at about 6:25pm (showing maximum temperatures in towns and cities around the country and live Weather Camera shots in the six main centres).
