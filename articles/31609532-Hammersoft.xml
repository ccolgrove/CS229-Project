'''[[Turkish Football Federation|TFF]] SÃ¼per Kupa 2011''' is the 39th edition of the [[Turkish Super Cup]] since its establishment as ''Presidential Cup'' in 1966. The match is going to be contested between the [[2010â11 SÃ¼per Lig]] champions [[FenerbahÃ§e S.K. (football team)|FenerbahÃ§e]] and the [[2010â11 Turkish Cup]] winners [[BeÅiktaÅ J.K.|BeÅiktaÅ]]. The match was to be played on 31 July 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.org/default.aspx?pageID=471&amp;ftxtID=12830 TFF Super Cup to be held on 31 July]&lt;/ref&gt; but the TFF postponed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.org/default.aspx?pageID=471&amp;ftxtID=13033 TFF Super Cup postponed]&lt;/ref&gt; the game due to [[2011 Turkish football corruption scandal|match fixing scandal]] investigations. The venue for the final will be [[Erzurum Universiade Arena]] hosting its first [[Turkish Super Cup]] final.

==Background==
This is the 7th overall [[Super Cup|national super cup]] matchup between the teams since 1966, and the 3rd matchup since 2006, when the cup was rebranded as ''TFF SÃ¼per Kupa''. FenerbahÃ§e won in [[2007 Turkish Super Cup|2007]] and [[2009 Turkish Super Cup|2009]] against BeÅiktaÅ, while BeÅiktaÅ has yet to win their 2nd ''TFF SÃ¼per Kupa'' since their victory in the [[2006 Turkish Super Cup|inaugural tournament]]. Also, both teams created a pattern, playing against each other in every other odd year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.org/default.aspx?pageID=412 Turkish Super Cup history (in Turkish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path to the final==
FenerbahÃ§e were champions by 26 wins, 4 draws and 4 losses, collecting 82 points overall. They were trailed by [[Trabzonspor]], which collected the same amount of points but came second due to head to head record. This also meant setting a new national record for FenerbahÃ§e, as they grabbed their record 18th title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.org/default.aspx?pageID=487 2010â11 SÃ¼per Lig table]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, BeÅiktaÅ finished 5th in the ''SÃ¼per Lig'', but were more successful in the [[Turkish Cup|domestic cup]]. They won the playoff round against [[Mersin Ä°dmanyurdu]], and won the group stage by 3 wins and 1 loss. They eliminated quarter finalists [[Gaziantep BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅehir Belediyespor|Gaziantep B.B.]] and semi finalists [[Gaziantepspor]]. BeÅiktaÅ won their 9th cup by a decisive penalty shootout against first time finalists [[Ä°stanbul BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅehir Belediyespor (football team)|Ä°stanbul B.B.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.org/default.aspx?pageID=471&amp;ftxtID=11698 Turkish Cup winners]&lt;/ref&gt;
