'''Nicholas LaRoche''' (born July 29, 1983 in [[Gardner, Massachusetts]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]]. He was the 2002 US Junior National Champion.

==Biography==
He finished eleventh at both the  2006 and 2007 senior [[US Figure Skating Championships]], but disappointing Sectional results kept him from qualifying for the 2008 [[US Figure Skating Championships]]. His last competition was the 2009 nationals. On April 13, 2009, he announced his retirement on his official site.

LaRoche's private life has been marred by tragedy.  In 2003, his older brother, David, died at the age of 23.  On July 1, 2008, his father, William LaRoche, apparently bludgeoned to death Nicholas' mother, Bernadette, before killing himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080702&amp;content_id=49087&amp;vkey=ice_news icenetwork.com: Tragedy Strikes Figure Skating Family, June 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

He trains and coaches at the [[Toyota Training Center]] in [[El Segundo, California]]. LaRoche also runs the US Athletic Foundation, which he started with his sister Tricia, helping promising athletes in all sports get the funding they need for training.
