'''Mountain View College''' (or '''MVC''') is a [[private school|private]], [[co-educational]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]] college in [[Valencia City, Bukidnon|Valencia City]], [[Bukidnon]], [[Philippines]] which was established in 1953.
It has a semestral enrollment of more than 2000 students primarily from [[Mindanao]], although there are also quite a number from [[Luzon]] and the [[Visayas]].  International enrollment from [[Cambodia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Germany]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Micronesia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Myanmar]], [[South Korea]], the [[United States]], and other countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], comprises about five percent of the total populace.

== History ==
MVC was founded by [[Andrew Nelson|Andrew Nathaniel Nelson]] in response to the growing interest in Christian education within the Philippines.
A 584% increase for a six-year period in the college enrollment of [[Adventist University of the Philippines|Philippine Union College]],
where he was then president, necessitated the search for another site.
Based on a nine-point criteria founded on Adventist principles and prior experience in the founding of two other educational institutions
([[Seattle Junior Academy]] in 1915 and [[Japan Missionary College]] in 1925), Dr. Nelson came upon MVC's present
site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Manticao, Misamis Oriental]] served as MVC's temporary campus from 1949 to 1952, while the search was on for a site that met the criteria.
It was then known as Philippine Union Junior College.
In 1953, MVC moved to its present location and opened its doors to students from the Southern Philippines. The previous campus then became [[Mindanao Mission Academy]]. MVC's first offerings were certificates or associate degrees in business, education, and religion. It held its first graduation exercises in 1957, four years after its official opening.

As of 2009, the college has 132 full time and part-time teaching faculty members and 73 staff members in the industrial and support service departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Campuses==

Nebo]], [[Valencia City, Bukidnon|Valencia City]], with an area of 10.24&amp;nbsp;kmÂ², which includes farmlands, forests, and ranch lands ideal for industry work. The land has an ample supply of water that allows MVC to have its own [[hydroelectric plant]]s, providing the campus populace with enough electricity along with an abundant water supply for the homes and other college facilities.

An annex campus is located in [[Bagontaas]], [[Valencia City, Bukidnon|Valencia City]], which is occupied by the School of Nursing. It includes a solarium, dormitories, classrooms, offices, and a cafeteria.
