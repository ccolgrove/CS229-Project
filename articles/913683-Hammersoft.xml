'''WDTN''', [[virtual channel]] 2, is the [[NBC]]-affiliated [[television station]] for [[Ohio]]'s [[Miami Valley]]. Licensed to [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], it broadcasts a [[High-definition television|high definition]] digital signal on [[UHF]] channel 50 from a transmitter in the Frytown section of the city. The station can also be seen on [[Time Warner Cable]] channel 2 and in high definition on digital channel 1002. It is owned by the [[LIN TV Corporation]].

WDTN operates [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WBDT]] (owned by WBDT Television, LLC) through a [[local marketing agreement]]. The two stations share studios on South Dixie Drive in [[Moraine, Ohio|Moraine]] (which is in a Dayton [[ZIP code]]). However, [[master control]] and some internal operations of WDTN are based within [[centralcasting]] facilities at [[sister station]] [[WISH-TV]] in [[Indianapolis]]. 

[[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on this station includes: ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'', ''[[Swift Justice with Nancy Grace]]'', ''[[The Nate Berkus Show]]'', and ''[[Better (TV series)|Better]]''.

WDTN's logo is very similar to ones used by [[KMID]], [[WPRI-TV]], and [[WNAC-TV]].

==Digital programming==
WDTN's signal on UHF 50 is multiplex:

==History==
===Early years===
The license for what is now WDTN was granted to the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] of [[Cincinnati]], which was a subsidiary of the Aviation Corporation (later known as [[Avco]]), on March 3, 1947. It was the first broadcast television license granted by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to the Dayton [[media market|market]]. However due to several delays, it did not actually go on-the-air until March 15, 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The station originally signed onto channel '''5'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[call sign]] '''WLWD'''. Named for Crosley's [[flagship (broadcasting)#Radio|flagship]] Cincinnati radio station [[WLW]] ('''W'''orld's '''L'''argest '''W'''ireless) + '''D'''ayton, it identified on-air as &quot;WLWâD&quot;. WLWD's offices, studios, and studio-transmitter link KUQ-43 were established on South Dixie Highway in the Dayton suburb of Moraine, in a building that had previously housed a skating rink. The studios and offices remain there to this day.

WLWD was one of five stations which made up the Cincinnati-based WLW television network. Other stations included in this network were [[flagship (broadcasting)#Television|flagship]] [[WLWT]] in Cincinnati, WLWC (now [[WCMH-TV]]) in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], WLWA (now [[WXIA-TV]]) in [[Atlanta]] and WLWI (now [[WTHR]]) in [[Indianapolis]]. 

From its start, WLWD was affiliated with '''NBC'''. It also carried programming from [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The first program shown on WLWD was the ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' with [[Milton Berle]].

On April 27, 1953, WLWD switched from channel 5 to channel '''2'''.&lt;ref&gt;

WLWD lost DuMont in 1955, a few months before the network shut down. It lost ABC in 1965 (though it cleared some ABC daytime programming until 1971 as a [[Network affiliate#Dual affiliations|secondary affiliate]]) when then-[[Independent station (North America)|independent]] WONE-TV (now [[WKEF]]) picked up ABC's [[prime time#North America|prime time]] programming. 

Game show host and announcer [[Johnny Gilbert]] hosted his own local daytime variety/talk show immediately after the local airing of WLW television's ''[[The Paul Dixon Show|Paul Dixon Show]]'' in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnnygilbert.tv The Official Johnny Gilbert Web Site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeopardy.com/showguide/bios/johnnygilbert/ Johnny Gilbert's bio on the ''Jeopardy!'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phil Donahue]] (former news anchor and radio talk show host at [[WHIO (AM)|WHIO]]) began hosting a talk show on WLWD in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294869,00.html Entertainment Weekly: &quot;Donahue Dawns on Daytime&quot;, November 8, 1996.]&lt;/ref&gt; called ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'', that was more issue oriented (greatly reducing the station's program budget). Donahue's show went national in 1970. Since most programs on the WLW television regional network originated from WLWT in Cincinnati, it was the first time WLWD was the originator of a program. 

Aside from Paul Dixon's weekday morning show, other Cincinnati-based programming that aired on WLWD included: ''The 50-50 Club'', hosted by [[Ruth Lyons (broadcaster)|Ruth Lyons]] (hosted by [[Bob Braun]] after Lyons' 1967 retirement), and the Saturday evening country music program ''[[Midwestern Hayride]]''. 

Due to WLWD's heavy local and regional programming schedule, many network programs from NBC and ABC were recorded on film as a [[kinescope]] for later airing. On rare occasions when a program was unavailable (sometimes due to network technical difficulties or if fill time was available before or after a network sportscast), a half-hour series entitled ''Star Performance'', consisting mostly of drama [[television pilot|pilot]]s from the 1950s, would air. Fifteen minute mini-documentaries or newsreels would also air as a time filler under the title ''Miniature Theater''.

Avco's broadcasting division continued to operate under the Crosley Broadcasting name until 1968, when it took on the name of its parent company.

===WDTN===
In 1976, Avco decided to exit broadcasting. It sold WLWD to [[Grinnell College]] in [[Iowa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

(From April, 2003 until April, 2010, the WLWD call sign was used by an FM station licensed to [[Columbus Grove, Ohio]], serving the [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]] market with a rhythmic hits format. That station has since changed its call sign to [[WBKS]].)

===Switch to ABC===
By the mid to late-1970s, ABC was searching for stronger affiliates in order to cement its status as the leading network in the country.

Its existing affiliate, WKEF, had lower ratings than WDTN and WHIO-TV, and did not have a news department until 1979. ABC's Cincinnati affiliate, [[WKRC-TV]], and its Columbus affiliate, WTVN-TV (now [[WSYX]]), were both preempting certain of the network's daytime programs, late night shows, and some of its Saturday morning cartoons. Because of these preemptions, ABC also wanted a station in Dayton with a stronger over-the-air signal, able to reach Cincinnati and Columbus. In late 1979, ABC approached WDTN and reached a deal. 

Almost by default, NBC was then left with WKEF.

On January 1, 1980, WDTN and WKEF swapped affiliations. Under the deal, WDTN was exempt from running ABC's soap operas after 2 p.m. In place of ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[General Hospital]]'', WDTN ran cartoons and off-network sitcoms.

===As ABC affiliate===
In early September, 1981, [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Broadcasting]] bought the station.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

  | quote = via www.davidgleason.com
  | accessdate = June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 1980s, cartoons and sitcoms made way for first run talk shows such as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' (at 4 p.m.), ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', and ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''. WDTN would begin its talk block at 2 p.m. during the week.

In August, 1997, Hearst's television group merged with '''Argyle Television Holdings II''' to form what was then known as [[Hearst Television|Hearst-Argyle Television]]. Argyle had purchased Cincinnati's [[WLWT]] that January. WDTN's city-grade signal covered most of the Cincinnati area while WLWT's city-grade signal reached most of the Dayton area. Since 1996, the FCC allowed without a waiver common ownership of two stations whose Grade B (&quot;rimshot&quot;) coverage areas overlapped, but until [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]] began to be permitted in 2000, it would not even consider granting a waiver (let alone allowing common ownership) if the overlap was between city-grade signals. (Crosley/Avco's past ownership of both channels had been [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]].)

Faced with a choice between stations, Hearst-Argyle opted to keep WLWT and trade WDTN, together with [[WNAC-TV]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to '''Sunrise Television''' for [[WPTZ]] in [[Plattsburgh, New York]], [[WNNE]] in [[Hartford, Vermont]], and [[KSBW]] in [[Salinas, California]]. The sale was finalized on July 2, 1998. 

In 2000, [[Time Warner Cable]] (Dayton's largest cable system) dropped the Cincinnati network affiliates to make room for new cable channels. As a result, ABC soap viewers could no longer see ''One Life to Live'' or ''General Hospital'', while over-the-air viewers could still pick them up on [[WCPO-TV]] (which had become Cincinnati's ABC affiliate in 1996). As a result, in the fall of 2000, ''General Hospital'' was added to WDTN's schedule. ''One Life to Live'' would be preempted another two years. 

In May 2002, Sunrise merged with '''LIN TV'''.
 
After the LIN TV acquisition, ''One Life to Live'' was added to the station's schedule as well. From this point on, WDTN aired ABC's entire schedule until the station returned to NBC in 2004.

===Return to NBC===
On August 30, 2004, in a reversal of the 1980 switch, WDTN became an NBC affiliate for the second time to take advantage of the network's then stronger programming. In another reversal, ABC was left with WKEF by default. Ironically, several months after the affiliation shift, ABC's ratings overtook those of NBC.

On May 18, 2007, LIN TV announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company. In early June, WDTN's website (along with those of several other LIN TV-owned stations not affiliated with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] such as [[WNDY-TV]], [[WWHO]], [[WAND]], [[WWLP]], and [[WLFI-TV]]) underwent a redesign. The web addresses were then operated by the Local Media Network division of World Now for a little over a year until October, 2008, when LIN TV relaunched most of its station websites through [[Fox Interactive Media]]. Prior to the World Now contract, the web addresses were powered by Web Pros.

On October 3, 2008, LIN TV pulled WDTN (and its other stations) from Time Warner Cable, due to a dispute over &quot;retransmission fees.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2008/09/29/daily47.html|title=WDTN pulled from Time Warner|publisher=Dayton Business Journal|date=2008-10-03

WDTN ended its analog broadcast on [[VHF]] channel 2 on June 12, 2009 as part of the [[DTV transition in the United States]].&lt;ref name&quot;&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It remained on its digital channel (50)&lt;ref&gt;[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101234487&amp;formid=387&amp;fac_num=65690 CDBS Print&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; using [[PSIP]] to display its [[virtual channel]] as 2.

On June 4, 2010, it was announced LIN TV would begin operating CW affiliate WBDT (then owned by [[ACME Communications]]) through [[shared services|shared service]] and [[local marketing agreement|local sales]] agreements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/453317-LIN_ACME_Share_Services_in_Three_Markets.php &quot;LIN, ACME Share Services in Three Markets&quot;], from broadcastingcable.com, 6/4/2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/articles/2010/06/04/daily.5/ &quot;LIN and ACME in 3 new SSA Deals&quot;], from tvnewscheck.com, 6/4/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, LIN TV exercised an option to purchase that channel along with another LIN-operated ACME station, fellow CW affiliate [[WCWF]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/456657-LIN_Buys_Pair_of_Acme_Stations.php &quot;LIN Buys Pair of Acme Stations&quot;], from broadcastingcable.com, 9/2/2010&lt;/ref&gt; LIN TV requested WBDT's license be assigned to a subsidiary of Vaughan Media (owner of [[Austin, Texas]] CW affiliate [[KNVA]], which is also operated by LIN TV). The company holds a 4.5% equity stake in Vaughan Media, but controls most of that company's voting stock, effectively making it a [[shell corporation]] for LIN TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/09/21/45473/lin-seeks-ok-for-dayton-green-bay-duops LIN Seeks OK for Dayton, Green Bay Duops&quot;], from tvnewscheck.com, 9/21/2010&lt;/ref&gt; WBDT was integrated into WDTN's facilities and the merger between the two stations occurred sometime around October, 2010. WBDT originally had studios at Corporate Place in [[Miamisburg, Ohio|Miamisburg]], along Byers Road.

On March 4, 2011, LIN TV's contract with [[Dish Network|DISH Network]] expired, and all TV stations owned or operated by LIN, including WDTN and WBDT, were pulled from DISH.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/LIN-Mediaâs-Current-Retransmission-Contract-with-DISH-Network-Expires-Without-New-Agreement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/news/2011/03/01/dish-network-may-drop-wdtn.html|title=DISH Network may drop WDTN|publisher=Dayton Business Journal|date=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=135BB62C5E94F6D8&amp;p_docnum=3 |title=Channel 2, CW could go dark for Dish subscribers, DaytonDailyNews.com/services/archive, March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/wdtn-daytons-cw-go-dark-for-dish-network-subscribers-1098894.html|title=WDTN, Daytonâs CW go dark for Dish Network subscribers|publisher=Dayton Daily News|date=2011-03-06

==News operation==
In the 1970s and 1980s, WDTN used the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' branding. For most of its history, its newscasts have been a runner-up to market leader WHIO-TV. Broadcasts on WDTN remain in [[pillarbox]]ed [[4:3]] standard definition. 

On August 18, 2007, the station began to produce a nightly prime time newscast for WBDT, known as ''2 News at 10 on Dayton's CW''. This show achieved higher ratings than [[WRGT-TV]]'s nightly prime time news in Dayton's metered market households on the 26th day of its broadcast. That year, ''2 News'' won the &quot;[[Edward R. Murrow]] Award for Overall Excellence&quot; for the second straight year. 

In May 2011, the station changed the name of its weekday 5 a.m. &amp;ndash; 7 a.m. newscast from ''2 News Sunrise'' to ''2 News Today''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20110508100938/http://www.wdtn.com/ | title = Archive.org | date = May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 14, 2011, the station moved ''2 News Today'''s start time to 4:30 a.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/2-news-today-moves-to-400-am | title = 2 News Today moves to 4:30 am | date = November 10, 2011 | accessdate = November 19 ,2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/news/2011/11/10/wdtn-tv-expands-morning-show.html | title = WDTN-TV expands morning show | publisher = Dayton Business Journal | author = Ginger Christ | date = November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably in response to WHIO-TV's similar lengthening of its morning news on August 15.

In early January 2012, the station plans to replace its weekday hour-long newscast, ''2 News at Noon'', with a local lifestyle talk show called ''Living Dayton''. Anchor Marsha Bonhart and meteorologist Jamie Jarosik will deliver news and weather at the top of the broadcast, and the show will cover any breaking news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www3.wdtn.com/dpp/entertainment/call-for-lifestyle-show-hosts-experts |title = Call for lifestyle show hosts, experts |date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/seen_and_overheard/entries/2011/09/01/wdtntv_to_replace_noon_news_wi.html|title=WDTN-TV to replace noon news with lifestyle show |publisher=Dayton Daily News|author=Amelia Robinson|date=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WDTN maintains news partnerships with several area newspapers. In addition to its main studios, WDTN operates bureaus in [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]] (on West Main Street) and in [[Xenia, Ohio|Xenia]]â (in the ''Xenia Daily Gazette'' newsroom on South Detroit Street).
 
WDTN operates its own [[weather radar]] known on-air as &quot;Live Doppler 2X&quot;. The station's weather reports are sometimes branded as &quot;Live Doppler 2X&quot;, sometimes as &quot;Storm Team 2&quot;. 

For many years, [[Charlie Van Dyke]] was the voice heard on WDTN's [[station identification#Combining identification with promotion|station IDs]], news intros, [[promo (media)|promo]]s, and other [[voice-over]] work. In September, 2011, Van Dyke was replaced by [[Roger Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/participate/mailbag/marks-mailbag-october-21st |title = Mark's Mailbag: October 21st |date=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
