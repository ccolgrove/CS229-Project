The '''1950 Maryland Terrapins football team''' represented the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[college football]] in its [[1950 college football season|30th season]] as a member of the [[Southern Conference]].

Maryland was led by fourth-year head coach [[Jim Tatum]], who ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called &quot;the most successful major college coach in the game&quot; [[Maryland Terrapins football under Jim Tatum (1947â1955)|during his nine-year tenure]] at [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825833,00.html The Coach], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 3, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, Tatum remains the winningest Maryland football coach of the modern era, with a [[winning percentage]] of 0.819.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/acc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/07fbguide051056.pdf Records] (PDF), 2007 Maryland Terrapins Football Media Guide, University of Maryland, p. 55, retrieved 14 January 2009. [http://www.webcitation.org/5gbBdoqwJ Archived] 2009-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was led on the field by sophomore [[quarterback]] and future [[Heisman Trophy]] runner-up [[Jack Scarbath]] who made his first career start in the season-opener.&lt;ref name=&quot;p280&quot;/&gt;

The highlight of the season was Maryland's upset victory over second-ranked [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]], 34â7, in what was that team's only loss of the season. Two weeks later, however, the Terrapins' bowl game hopes were ended with a [[Homecoming]] defeat at the hands of [[North Carolina State Wolfpack football|North Carolina State]].

Georgia scored first in the opening period. In the second quarter, Maryland sophomore quarterback [[Jack Scarbath]] completed three passes in a 54-yard drive that culminated in a pitch to Bob Shemonski who ran around the right end and into the [[end zone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p280&quot;&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the game, Maryland head coach [[Jim Tatum]] said, &quot;We weren't ready for Georgia in a game as early as September 23 ... We weren't in shape and the [92 Â°F] heat killed us.&quot; The loss, however, did not affect Maryland's poll ranking as the situation surrounding the game was generally understood.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Week 2, the Terrapins played the inaugural game at the newly-completed [[Byrd Stadium]]. It was the first game against the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] in 16 years. [[Crab Bowl Classic|The series]] had been canceled in 1936 after Maryland accused Navy of an illegal play for their go-ahead score. Maryland had agreed to fill in a vacancy in the Navy schedule left open by a Georgetown cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Snider, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/aug/29/20050829-122511-3724r/ Ill will lingers at Navy, Maryland; Rivalry to restart in Crab Bowl], ''The Washington Times'', page 1, 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first quarter, Scarbath broke away for a 21-yard touchdown run. Then, in the second quarter, Scarbath linked up with end Stan Karnash for a 44-yard touchdown. Scarbath again passed for a 59-yard score to end Pete Augsburger. At halftime, the Terrapins led 21â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;p281&quot;&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Navy responded with a touchdown of their own in the third quarter. In the final quarter, Maryland end [[Elmer Wingate]] returned an interception 34-yards for a score. Fifty-four seconds later, Maryland end Lew Weidensaul recovered a Midshipmen fumble. [[Ed Modzelewski]] capped the ensuing Terrapins' possession with a five-yard rush into the end zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;p281&quot;/&gt;

The high-scoring game resulted in just the second-ever Maryland win in the 12th meeting of the intense in-state rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.stassen.com/ Stassen College Football Information], accessed 11 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan State College entered the game after beating first-ranked [[1950 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], 14â7, the week prior.

Michigan State responded with a touchdown of their own in the third quarter. In the final period, Scarbath scored on a [[quarterback sneak]]. End Pete Ladygo returned an intercepted pass 35-yards for a touchdown and later Bob Shemonski made an interception for a 37-yard touchdown return.&lt;ref name=&quot;p282&quot;&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maryland's defense held the high-powered Michigan State offense to 140 rushing yards, 67 of which were gained on a single run by [[Sonny Grandelius]]. Michigan State completed three of 20 pass attempts. Maryland intercepted six passes and returned two for scores.&lt;ref name=&quot;p282&quot;/&gt; After the upset victory, Maryland climbed to an AP Poll ranking of 8th in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;umd&quot;/&gt; It was the only loss of the season for Michigan State, which ended the season ranked eighth in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appollarchive.com/football/ap/seasons.cfm?seasonid=1950 1950 Final AP Football Poll], AP Poll Archive, retrieved 30 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the upset win over number-two Michigan State, Maryland rose in the AP Poll to become the second-ranked team in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appollarchive.com/football/ap/seasons.cfm?appollid=123 October 16, 1950 AP Football Poll], AP Poll Archive, retrieved January 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgetown entered the game as 27-point [[underdog (competition)|underdog]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;p283&quot;&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first quarter, Maryland executed an eight-play, 95-yard drive that culminated in an eight-yard touchdown rush by fullback [[Ed Fullerton]]. Georgetown tied the game at 7â7 with a fourth-down pass in the end zone. In the second quarter, Bob Shemonski scored on a six-yard [[end-around]] to end the half at 14â7. In the third quarter, Maryland recorded two [[safety (American football score)|safeties]] in quick succession: one when punter Joe Pallotta stepped outside of the end zone and the other when [[Bob Ward (American football)|Bob Ward]] tackled Frank Mattingly for a loss. With three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Georgetown scored another touchdown to narrow the deficit to 18â14. Fullerton then rushed for 24 yards to advance to the Georgetown six-yard line. Scarbath then ran into the end zone for the final result of 25â14.&lt;ref name=&quot;p283&quot;/&gt;

Despite the closeness of the contest, Maryland dominated the game statistically. The Terrapins rushed 342 yards to the Hoyas' 40. Georgetown compiled 128 yards through the air and Maryland 118. The Terrapins returned kicks and punts for a combined 225 yards, compared with the Hoyas' 66 yards on returns.&lt;ref name=&quot;p283&quot;/&gt;

Maryland advanced inside the NC State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, Mooney scored again to bring the score 0â16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from [[Jack Scarbath]] to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. Three passes to Augsburger led a 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory. A pass in the end zone was intercepted with seconds remaining and the game ended with a final score of 13â16. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;p284&quot;&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a steady downpour, 18th-ranked Maryland met North Carolina for the 17th time. North Carolina, Maryland head coach Tatum's [[alma mater]], possessed a nine-game winning streak in the series. The first quarter remained scoreless, but in the second, North Carolina fumbled a punt by Maryland's Jack Targarona. The Terrapins' Karney Scioscia recovered the ball on the Tar Heel 31-yard line. DeStefano completed a 17-yard pass to Karnash and then connected with Augsburger on the Carolina eight-yard line. In two subsequent plays, the Terps pushed to the four-yard line. DeStefano then pitched to Shemonski who ran around end and into the end zone. Maryland managed to stop two North Carolina drives on the Terrapins' 28- and eight-yard lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;p287&quot;/&gt; Late in the third quarter, Carolina mounted a drive into Maryland territory which continued into the fourth quarter. The Terrapins' defense held twice at their own one-yard line, but the Tar Heels' Bud Wallace pushed into the end zone on third down for the score. In the final minutes, Maryland drove to the Carolina 15-yard line. With five seconds remaining, guard Bob Dean missed on a field goal attempt, which resulted in a stalemate of 7â7.&lt;ref name=&quot;p287&quot;&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;
