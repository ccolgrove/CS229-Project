'''ZSNES''' is a [[free software]] [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] [[emulator]] written mostly in [[x86 assembly]] with official ports for [[Linux]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and an unofficial port for [[Xbox]].

==Background==
Development of ZSNES began on July 3, 1997 and the first version was released on October 14, 1997, for MS-DOS. Since then, official ports have been made for Windows and Linux. The emulator became free software under the GPL license on April 2, 2001. It is still being actively developed despite the departure of its original developers ''zsKnight'' and ''_Demo_''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=13245 |title=ZSNES is not dead, it is still under active development |author=badinsults |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the development efforts concentrate on increasing the emulator's portability, by rewriting assembly code in C and C++&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=grinvader|title=Re: Current Status FAQ|url=http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=204739#p204739|work=ZSNES board|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including a new [[GUI]] using [[Qt (framework)|Qt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZSNES GUI 3.0 the first screenshot|url=http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=11027|work=ZSNES board|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZSNES is notable in that it was among the first to emulate most [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|SNES enhancement chips]] at some level. Until version 1.50, ZSNES featured netplay via [[TCP/IP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]].

Due to being written in [[Low-level programming language|low-level]] [[assembly language]] for [[x86]] processors, it is not possible to port ZSNES to devices using [[RISC]] processors. Other than the first [[Xbox]], no mainstream gaming device has ever used an x86 processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=10713 |title=No Port requests |author=Deathlike2 |date=November 3, 2007 |accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''ZSNES'' is arguably the most popular and highest rated SNES emulator available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Nintendo Emulators - rating vote counts and results|url=http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/snes/|work=The Emulator Zone|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also reported as the best Super NES emulator available for Linux.&lt;ref name=kohler&gt;{{cite book|title=Retro Gaming Hacks|publisher=O'Reilly Media|chapter=Playing Classic Console Games|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; British game magazine [[Retro Gamer]] called ZSNES &quot;very impressive&quot; and praised the &quot;incredible toaster mode&quot; in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |year=2005 |title=Retro Coverdisc |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=15 |pages=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a reputation of being one of the fastest SNES emulators available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fastest SNES Emulator|url=http://forums.ngemu.com/showthread.php?t=21157|work=Emuforums.com|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, developers and advocates of competing emulators often criticize ZSNES for its relatively poor accuracy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=byuu|title=Why Accuracy Matters|url=http://byuu.org/bsnes/accuracy|work=byuu's homepage|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being written in x86 assembly, meaning non-portability across processor architectures and high difficulty to develop and maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=byuu|title=Re: bZSNES v1.51 released!|url=http://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=1522&amp;p=32625#p32625|work=byuu's message board|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
