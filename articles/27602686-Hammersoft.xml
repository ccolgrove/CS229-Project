Located in northern [[Klamath County, Oregon|Klamath County]] near the community of [[Gilchrist, Oregon|Gilchrist]], it is to be officially dedicated on June 11, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODFpress&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Oregon to dedicate the Gilchrist State Forest on June 11|url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODF/newsroom/newsreleases/2010/NR1024.shtml|publisher=[[Oregon Department of Forestry]]|date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest sits along [[U.S. Route 97 in Oregon|U.S. Route 97]] and will be {{convert|70000|acre}} in size.

==History==
Originally owned by the Gilchrist family and their logging company, the land in what became the state forest was sold to [[Crown Pacific Partners]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;buy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2010/02/oregon_buys_43000_acres_near_b.html|title=Oregon buys 43,000 acres near Bend for new state forest|last=Learn|first=Scott|date=February 10, 2010|work=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crown Pacific Partners struggled financially under a large debt load and filed for bankruptcy in June 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;pt&quot;/&gt; Creditors took over their remaining assets in December 2004 and created Cascade Timberlands, LLC.&lt;ref name=&quot;pt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=27661|title=Creditors bid adieu to Crown Pacific|first=Kristina Brenneman|date=December 24, 2004|work=[[The Portland Tribune]]|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidelity National Timber Resources purchased the forests that became the state forest from Cascade Timberlands in 2006, with Fidelity being a subsidiary of [[Fidelity National Financial]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nw1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/bend_oregon_rallies_around_community_forest/C509/L99/|title=Bend Leaders Rally Around Community Forest|last=Friedrichs|first=Joseph|date=January 7, 2007|work=New West Missoula|publisher=New West Publishing LLC|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nw2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Struckman|first=Robert|date=May 14, 2008|title=Montanaâs Cash Cowboy|journal=The New West Magazine|publisher=New West Publishing LLC|location=Missoula, Montana|url=http://www.newwest.net/magazine/article/montanas_cash_cowboy/C555/L555/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/index.ssf?/base/national-127/1275431841219940.xml&amp;storylist=orlocal|title=Ore. creating first new state forest since 1948|last=Barnard|first=Jeff|agency=The Associated Press|date=June 1, 2010|work=The Oregonian|publisher=OregonLive.com|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oregon Board of Forestry approved the purchase of {{convert|43000|acre}} of the Fidelity lands in [[Central Oregon]] in February 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;buy&quot;/&gt; The $15 million deal was for land with young pine trees, and was designed in part to prevent future development of the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;buy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;odf gilchrist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egov.oregon.gov/ODF/STATE_FORESTS/gilchristacquisition.shtml|title=State Forest Acquisition - Gilchrist Tract|publisher=Oregon Department of Forestry|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidelity's CEO at the time was developer Bill Foley, whose holdings included [[Whitefish Mountain Resort]] in Montana.&lt;ref name=&quot;nw2&quot;/&gt; [[Oregon Lottery]] funds were to be used to secure bonds for the purchase of the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;buy&quot;/&gt; The deal was finalized in March 2010, and the state of Oregon took title to the lands that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;odf gilchrist&quot;/&gt; 

Additionally, the non-profit group [[The Conservation Fund]] was to buy {{convert|25000|acre}} of adjacent land to prevent its development and eventually sell to the state once state funds became available.&lt;ref name=&quot;buy&quot;/&gt; Both the state owned lands and the non-profit owned lands were to be managed by the state as the {{convert|70000|acre|adj=on}} Gilchrist State Forest.&lt;ref name=&quot;odf gilchrist&quot;/&gt; The timber on the lands will not be large enough to harvest for several decades, as the land was logged in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt; Once logging resumes, the majority of the revenues will go to Klamath County.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt; A dedication ceremony is set for June 11, 2010 to officially open the new state forest.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt;
