'''TeleFutura''' is a  U.S. [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] broadcast [[television network]] owned by [[Univision]] with headquarters in [[Miami, Florida]].

==Overview==
TeleFutura Is Americaâs #2 Spanish-Language Network in [[prime time]]. The network started on January 14, 2002, a month behind [[Telemundo]]'s launch of its cable TV network, the bilingual [[mun2]], with programs such as the 3 hour gossip/Entertainment  show ''EscÃ¡ndalo TV'' (formerly &quot;EscÃ¡ndalo en el Medio Dia&quot;, but later changed due to a similarly named program airing in Mexico by Televisa S.A.) which was designed to compete with similar offerings like ''[[Cotorreando]]'' from [[NBC Universal]]'s Telemundo. Commercials for TeleFutura often air on the Univision network. Most of the stations that carry TeleFutura once aired the [[Home Shopping Network]].  Univision bought the stations from [[Barry Diller]]'s [[USA Broadcasting]] late in 2001.

TeleFutura's programming consists of [[telenovelas]] from Coral Productions, [[Televisa]], [[Venevision]], [[RCTV]], [[RCN TV|RCN]] and [[Rede Globo]] as well as movies often consisting of recent American releases dubbed into Spanish.  Movie titles are announced before the start of the broadcast, using the &quot;CinePlex&quot; (daytime movie, usually weekends), &quot;CineEscape&quot; (late night movie), &quot;Cine Especial&quot; (movie specials), or &quot;Cine de las Estrellas&quot; (prime-time movie) branding. The network also airs the reality courtroom show ''Veredicto Final'', ''FÃºtbol de la Liga Mexicana'' broadcasts, and sports news (including [[Contacto Deportivo]]).

In late 2005, TeleFutura started airing ''En Vivo y Directo'', a 7&amp;nbsp;pm newscast, opposite the taped 4&amp;nbsp;pm news on [[GalavisiÃ³n (USA)|GalavisiÃ³n]]). But the network eventually cancelled &quot;En Vivo y Directo&quot; due to low ratings after only a few weeks and have replaced the newscast with movies.

The network also offers a children programming block called [[Toonturama]] to fulfill the [[E/I]] requirements. Curiously, this block is shown both on Saturdays and Sundays, and includes mostly American and European series dubbed into Spanish, such as ''[[Flight Squad]]'' and ''[[Problem Child (TV series)|Problem Child]]''. An exception is ''[[Toad Patrol]]'', which it needs to dub into English to fix the speech. In the past, [[anime]] such as ''[[Lost Universe]]'', ''[[Tenchi Universe]]'', and ''[[Red Baron (anime)|Red Baron]]'' were shown in the block as well.

TeleFutura is also a part of the Spanish-language coverage of the [[FIFA World Cup]] [[soccer]] tournament, as UnivisiÃ³n owns exclusive US Spanish-language rights. For 2006 it carried eight live games, all in the last days of group play when games are played simultaneously, like [[ESPN2]] did with [[ESPN]] for English-language coverage.  It also had game replays and recap shows.  In addition, and in conjunction, TeleFutura also airs an exclusive [[Major League Soccer]] game of the week on Sunday afternoon/evening.

In late June 2006, UnivisiÃ³n was sold to an investment group including entertainment industry veteran [[Haim Saban]] for $13 billion. There are reports on media message boards that TeleFutura is being phased out and several key on air talents are being shifted to UnivisiÃ³n and GalavisiÃ³n channels. However these rumors have not been verified, nor will the shutdown of TeleFutura happen anytime soon: According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], in February 2007 TeleFutura made significant gains in viewership at the expense of Telemundo, actually taking over second place among Spanish-language networks in the Adults 18-34, Men 18-34 and Men 18-49 demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&amp;id=8151&amp;cha=7 |title=TeleFutura Delivers Highest Primetime Performance Ever in February Sweeps Among Key Hispanic Viewers |author=Rosemary Mercedes |publisher=Univision Networks  |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2009 TeleFutura launched the daily Gossip Show &quot;La Tijera&quot; with [[Charitin Goyco]], Liliana Rodriguez, [[Paul Bouche]], Carolina Sandoval and [[Augusto Valverde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enelbrasero.com/2009/03/10/el-publico-pide-que-corten-con-la-tijera-a-charitin/|title=El Publico Pide}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cast was gradually modified and incorporated Tanya Charry , Raul Garcia, Anabelle Blum, and Rodolfo Jimenez. The show was cancelled in October 2011. 

On February 26, 2010 TeleFutura, one of the largest Spanish-language networks in the U.S. and the ideal entertainment alternative for Hispanics across the nation, announced today that once again it secured the #2 Spanish-language network position with last nightâs  special broadcast of âBuscando La Doble de Selena: La Gran Finalâ (Search for Selenaâs Double) attracting an impressive 1.9 million Total Viewers 2+, 1.0 million Adults 18-49,  over half a million Adults 18-34 and 620,000 Persons 12-34, making it the highest-ranked entertainment special in the history of the network.

On October 10, 2011, TeleFutura will premiere a new daily Gossip Show ''[[TÃ³mbola]]''.

==TeleFutura HD==

In 2010, TeleFutura along with sister network UnivisiÃ³n began airing programming in [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] with a [[16:9]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. They were the last major over-the-air networks in the United States to have made the switch. DirecTV added the West Coast feed of the network in HD nationally on April 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dtv.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=464645 DIRECTV Launches Univision and TeleFutura in Crystal-Clear HD] DirecTV Press Release April 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Dish Network later added the West Coast feed on May 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/452575-Dish_To_Launch_Galavision_HD.php Dish To Launch Galavision HD] ''Multichannel News'' May 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; EscÃ¡ndalo TV is broadcasting in HD.
