At the end of March 2011, Microsoft Home Server 2011 was released to manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/windowshomeserver/archive/2011/03/29/windows-home-server-2011-is-ready-for-release.aspx Windows Home Server 2011 is Ready for Release.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-releases-windows-vail-server-to-manufacturing/9050 Microsoft releases Windows 'Vail' server to manufacturing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial speculation by technology columnist Mary Jo Foley fueled the idea that 'Vail' would integrate with Windows Media Center. This prompted the response &quot;Time will tell&quot; by Microsoft Windows Home Server Product Planner Todd Headrick&lt;ref name=&quot;ZDNet1&quot;/&gt;, but by the time of the public beta Microsoft had decided not to integrate Windows Media Center with 'Vail'.&lt;ref name=&quot;We Got Served2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticism of Drive Extender's removal is mainly related to it being seen as a core feature of Windows Home Server and a key reason for adoption.  Windows Home Server 2011 developer Michael Leworthy expressed concern that the implementation of Drive Extender might lead to &quot;data error issues.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
