&quot;For decades now, Arab terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon have staged raids and fired mortar shells into northern Israel, denying the Israelis peace of mind. In the early 1980s, the terrorists operating out of Lebanon were controlled by Yasser Arafat's [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (P.L.O.). After Israel's ambassador to Britain, Shlomo Argov, was shot in cold blood and seriously wounded by the Palestinian terror group Abu Nidal in London in 1982, fed-up Israelis sent tanks and troops rolling into Lebanon to disperse the guerrillas.&quot; (pp. 44â45)&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had been launching guerrilla attacks against Israel since the 1960s (see Palestine Liberation Organization). After the PLO was driven from Jordan in 1971, the organization established bases in southern Lebanon, from which it continued to attack Israel. In 1981 heavy PLO rocket fire on Israeli settlements led Israel to conduct air strikes in Lebanon. The Israelis also destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at [[Daura]] near [[Baghdad]].

In an attempt to destroy the PLO forces, Israel began bombing southern Lebanon and Beirut on 5 June 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-203066 &quot;Israel - War in Lebanon&quot;].

On three occasions, in 1970, 1972, and 1978, Israel had retaliated by ground operations carried out up to Lebanon's Litani River. ... Meanwhile Israel had conducted preemptive shelling and air strikes to deter PLO terrorist attacks on settlements in Galilee in northern Israel.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107652.html Israel], [[Infoplease]]. &quot;The PLO had long plagued Israelis with terrorist actions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Politics of Israel|Government of Israel]] launched the military operation after the [[Abu Nidal Organization]]'s assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Shlomo Argov]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahalani, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TRhE--Ru9mYC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=%22peace+for+galilee%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I17YTJu5JoS0lQfR59CACQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22peace%20for%20galilee%22&amp;f=false A Warriors Way], Shapolsky Publishers (1994) p. 299-301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey W. Kushner, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZOfkAoDb_2IC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=shlomo+Argov+abu+nidal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-r3s2tyQ_p&amp;sig=6SB9uccGQPkKUpbW8cD3n60TG6o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CB_vTN_8M8SAlAf70N2gDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shlomo%20Argov%20abu%20nidal&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of terrorism] Sage Publications (2003), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

By expelling the PLO, the removal of Syrian influence over Lebanon, and the installment of a pro-Israeli Christian government led by [[Bashir Gemayel]], Israel hoped to sign a treaty which [[Menachem Begin]] promised would give Israel &quot;forty years of peace.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas (2006). ''From Beirut to Jerusalem'', p. 157. Anchor Books, New York. ISBN 0385413726.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel would succeed in expelling the PLO from Lebanon. After attacking the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], as well as [[Syria]]n, leftist and [[Muslim]] [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] forces, Israel occupied southern Lebanon and eventually surrounded the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] and elements of the [[Syrian army]]. Surrounded in West [[Beirut]] and subjected to heavy bombardment, the PLO forces and their allies negotiated passage from Lebanon with the aid of Special Envoy [[Philip Habib]] and the protection of international peacekeepers.

However following the assassination of [[Bashir Gemayel]], Israel's position in Beirut became untenable and the signing of a peace treaty became increasingly unlikely. Outrage following Israel's role in the Christian-led [[Sabra and Shatila Massacre]] of Palestinian refugees and Israeli popular disillusionment with the war would lead to a withdrawal from Beirut to [[Israeli Security Zone|southern Lebanon]]. The Shi'a militant group [[Hezbollah]] was established in 1982 to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, leading to nearly [[South Lebanon conflict (1982-2000)|20 years of armed conflict]]. The [[Lebanese Civil War]] would continue until 1990, at which point [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syria had established complete dominance over Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
With the establishment of Israel and the [[1948 Arab-Israeli conflict]], Lebanon became home to more than 110,000 [[Palestinian refugees]] after fleeing their homes in the former [[British Mandate of Palestine]]. After its founding in 1964 and the radicalization among Palestinians, which followed the [[Six Day War]], the PLO became a powerful force, then centred in Jordan. The large influx of Palestinians from Jordan after â[[Black September (Jordan)|Black September]]â caused an additional demographic imbalance within Lebanese society and its democratic institutions established earlier by the [[National Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger, Henry (1999). ''Years of Renewal'', Phoenix Press. ISBN 1-84212-042-5. p. 1022. ''&quot;I think with sadness of these civilized men who in a turbulent part of the world had fashioned a democratic society based on genuine mutual respect of religion. Their achievement did not survive. The passions sweeping the area were too powerful to be contained by subtle constitutional arrangements. As it had attempted in Jordan, the Palestinian movement wrecked the delicate balance of Lebanon's stability. Before the peace process could run its course, Lebanon was torn apart. Over its prostrate body of writing all the factions and forces of the Middle East still chase their eternal dreams and act out their perennial nightmares.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Operation Litani ===
{{Main|Operation Litani}}
Continual violence near the Lebanese border occurred between [[Israel]] and the [[PLO]] starting from 1968; this had previously peaked during [[Operation Litani]] in 1978. The [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) was created after the incursion, following the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|Resolution]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|425]] in March 1978 to confirm Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, restore international peace and security, and help the government of Lebanon restore its effective authority in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With the completion of Israeli withdrawals from Sinai in March 1982, under the terms of the [[Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty]], the [[Likud]]-led government of Israel hardened its attitude to the Arab world and became more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, Avi (2007). ''Lion of Jordan; The life of King Hussein in War and Peace''. Allen Lane. p. 412. ISBN 978-0-7139-9777-4&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1976, Israel had been assisting Lebanese Christian militias in their sporadic battles against the PLO.&lt;ref name = &quot;Morris&quot;&gt;[[#refMorris1999|Morris, p. ???]]&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Litani]] in 1978, Israel established a security zone in southern Lebanon with mostly Christian inhabitants, in which they began to supply training and arms to Christian militias which would later form the [[South Lebanese Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moris1999p503&quot;&gt;[[#refMorris1999|Morris, p. 503]]&lt;/ref&gt; But Israel's main partner was to be the [[Maronites|Maronite]] [[Phalange]] party, whose paramilitary was led by [[Bashir Gemayel]], a rising figure in Lebanese politics&lt;ref name=&quot;Moris1999p503&quot; /&gt; Gemayel's strategy during the early stages of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] was to provoke the Syrians into retaliatory attacks on Christians, such that Israel could not ignore. In 1978, [[Menachem Begin]] declared that Israel would not allow a genocide of Lebanese Christians, while refusing direct intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMorris1999|Morris, p. 505]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of Lebanese militiamen began to train in Israel, at the IDF Staff and Command College. The relationship between Israel and the Maronites began to grow into a political-strategic alliance, and members of the Israeli government like [[Ariel Sharon]] began to conceive of a plan to install a pro-Israel Christian government in Lebanon, as it was known that Bashir wanted to remove the PLO and all Palestinian refugees in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMorris1999|Morris, p. 509]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors to war==

On 10 July 1981, violence erupted in [[South Lebanon]] and [[Northern Israel]] with the rocketing of Northern Israel by thousands of PLO forces who had come to occupy Southern Lebanon. Israel renewed its air strikes  in an attempt to trigger a war that would allow it to drive out the PLO and restore peace to the region.&lt;ref name=schiff&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=z99HgBsKp3sC&amp;pg=PA35 ''Israel's Lebanon War''] Schiff &amp; Yaari (1984), pp. 35â36&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July, the Israel Air Force launched a massive attack on PLO buildings in downtown Beirut. &quot;Perhaps as many as three hundred died, and eight hundred were wounded, the great majority of them civilians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benny Morris p507&quot;&gt;[[#refMorris1999|Morris, p. 507]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli army also heavily targeted PLO positions in south Lebanon without success in suppressing Palestinian rocket launchers and guns. As a result, thousands of Israeli citizens who resided near the Lebanese border headed south. On 24 July 1981, United States envoy Philip Habib brokered a ceasefire badly needed by both parties. Between July 1981 and June 1982, the Lebanese-Israeli border &quot;enjoyed a state of calm unprecedented since 1968.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;/&gt;

US Secretary of State, [[Alexander Haig]] filed a report with US President [[Ronald Reagan]] on Saturday 30 January 1982 that revealed Secretary Haig's fear that Israel might, at the slightest provocation, start a war against Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald (Brinkley, Douglas, (ed.) (2007). ''The Reagan Diaries''. Harper Collins. ISBN 978-0-06-087600-5 p. 66: Saturday, January 30&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 1982, after a landmine killed an Israeli officer while he was visiting a South Lebanese Army gun emplacement in [[Taibe]], Lebanon, the Israeli Air Force attacked the Palestinian-controlled coastal town of [[Damour]], killing 23 people.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Robert (2001). ''Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War''. Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-280130-9, and ISBN 978-0-19-280130-2 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May, Israeli aircraft again attacked targets in Lebanon. Later that same day, UNIFIL observed the firing of rockets from Palestinian positions in the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] region into northern Israel, but none of the projectiles hit an Israeli settlement&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. &quot;Israeli Jets Raid P.L.O. in Lebanon; Shelling follows&quot;. ''The New York Times'', 10 May 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;--the gunners had been ordered to miss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benny Morris p507&quot;/&gt; Major-General Erskine (Ghana), Chief of Staff of UNTSO reported to the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] and the [[Security Council]] (S/14789, S/15194) that from August 1981 to May 1982, inclusive, there were 2096 violations of Lebanese airspace and 652 violations of Lebanese territorial waters (Chomsky, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;195; Cobban, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;112).&lt;ref name=&quot;UN15194&quot;/&gt; There were more than 240 PLO attacks against Israeli targets, and Israel considered them violations of the ceasefire.&lt;ref name=herzog350-351&gt;Herzog &amp; Gazit (2005), pp. 350â351&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom of movement of UNIFIL personnel and UNTSO observers within the enclave remained restricted due to the actions of [[Amal Movement|Amal]] and the [[South Lebanon Army]] under Major [[Saad Haddad]]'s leadership with the backing of Israeli military forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN15194&quot;/&gt;

===International reaction===
Prior to establishing ceasefire in July 1981, U.N. Secretary-General [[Kurt Waldheim]] noted: &quot;After several weeks of relative quiet in the area, a new cycle of violence has begun and has, in the past week, steadily intensified.&quot; He further stated: &quot;There have been heavy civilian casualties in Lebanon; there have been civilian casualties in Israel as well. I deeply deplore the extensive human suffering caused by these developments.&quot; The President of the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]], [[Ide Oumarou]] of [[Niger]], expressed &quot;deep concern at the extent of the loss of life and the scale of the destruction caused by the deplorable events that have been taking place for several days in Lebanon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/43220e2368a3ddf7052568000052412c?OpenDocument UN Doc S/PV.2292], 17 July 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/feb2002/sab-f22.shtml Sharon's war crimes in Lebanon: the record]&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary Haig's critics have accused him of &quot;greenlighting&quot; the Israeli Invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. Haig denies this and says he urged restraint.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952421,00.html |title=Alexander Haig |newspaper=Time | location = New York |date=9 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American reaction was that they would not apply any undue pressure on Israel to quit Lebanon as the Israeli presence in Lebanon may prove to be a catalyst for the disparate groups of Lebanon to make common cause against both Syrian and Israeli forces. Haig's analysis, which [[Ronald Reagan]] agreed with, was that this uniting of Lebanese groups would allow President [[Elias Sarkis]] to reform the Lebanese central Government and give the Palestinian refugees Lebanese citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald (Brinkley, Douglas (ed.)) (2007). ''The Reagan Diaries''. Harper Collins. ISBN 978-0-06-087600-5 pp. 87â90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel's rationale for war===
&lt;!-- In response to Israeli air strikes,&lt;ref name=schiff/&gt; in July 1981 the PLO opened a heavy and indiscriminate artillery barrage on the Galilee panhandle using [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rockets and [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130mm gun]]s. This barrage lasted 10 days driving the residents of northern Israel underground into bomb shelters. Industry and commerce came to a standstill. Israelâs reaction was fierce and a ceasefire came into effect on 24 July.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Chaim, The Arab-Israeli Wars, New York, Random House (1982) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; 
Since the ceasefire, established in July 1981, until the start of the war, Israel recorded 240 âterrorist actionsâ committed by the PLO against Israeli targets including the assassination of an Israeli diplomat in Paris and encounters with PLO units attempting to cross from Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog (1982) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to  [[George Wildman Ball|George Ball]], the PLO had observed the ceasefire. Israel he says continued looking for the &quot;internationally recognized provocation&quot; that Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]] said would be necessary to obtain American support for an Israeli invasion of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, George W. ''Error and Betrayal in Lebanon'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Avi Shlaim]], the real driving force behind the Israeli invasion to Lebanon was the defense minster Ariel Sharon. One of his aims was the destruction of PLO military infrastructure in Lebanon and undermining it as a political organization, in order to facilitate the absorption of the West Bank by Israel. The second aim was the establishment of the [[Maronite]] government in Lebanon, headed by [[Bashir Gemayel]] and signing the peace treaty between two countries, the third aim was the expelling of Syrian army from Lebanon. 

The military plan with the code name &quot;Big Pines&quot;, prepared by IDF, envisaged invasion to Lebanon up to the highway  Damascus-Beirut and linking with Maronite forces. It was first presented to Israeli cabinet on 20 December 1981 by Begin, but rejected by the majority of ministers. According to Avi Shlaim, Sharon and chief of staff [[Rafael Eitan]], realizing that there was no chance in persuading the cabinet to approve a large-scale operation in Lebanon, adopted a different tactic and intended to implement &quot;Operation Big Pines&quot; in stages by manipulating enemy provocations and Israeli responses.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim 1999 pp. 396-397&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 3 June 1982 Israelâs ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Shlomo Argov]] was shot and seriously wounded in London by terrorists belonging to the [[Abu Nidal group|Abu Nidal terrorist organization]]. The organization was the longtime rival of PLO and its head was condemned to death by the PLO court, the British police reported that PLO leaders were on the &quot;hit list&quot; of the attackers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chomsk&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The PLO denied complicity in the attack but Israel retaliated with punishing air and artillery strikes against PLO targets in Lebanon. [[Sabra and Shatila]] refugees camps were bombed for four hours and the local &quot;Gaza&quot; hospital was hit there.  About 200 people were killed during these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky p.197&lt;/ref&gt; The PLO hit back firing rockets at northern Israel causing considerable damage and some loss of life{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

Yasser Arafat, at that time in Saudi Arabia, told the Americans through the Saudis that he was willing to suspend cross-border shelling. But that message was disregarded by the Israeli government. President Reagan also sent a message to Begin urging him not to widen the attack.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shlaim&quot;/&gt;

The 1982 Lebanon War was first a conventional war up to and including when the PLO were expelled from Beirut.&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot;&gt;Armies in Lebanon 1982-84, Samuel Katz and Lee E. Russell, Osprey Men-At-Arms series #165, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The war was limited by both Israel and Syria because they were determined to isolate the fighting, not allowing it to turn into an all-out war.&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt; Israeli forces were numerically superior, allowing Israel to maintain both the initiative and an element of surprise. The Syrian Army fielded six divisions and 500 aircraft, while Israel had eleven tank divisions and eleven infantry brigades, plus 600 aircraft. There were numerous other factions involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt;

===Palestinians===
====PLO====

Palestinian Liberation Organization forces continued to grow in Lebanon with full-time military personnel numbering around 15,000, although only 6,000 of these, including 4,500 regulars, were deployed in the south. They were armed with 80 aging tanks, many of which were no longer mobile, and 100 to 200 pieces of artillery. According to Israeli analysts [[Ze'ev Schiff|Schiff]] and [[Ehud Ya'ari|Ya'ari]] (1984), the PLO more than quadrupled its artillery from 80 cannons and rocket launchers in July 1981 to 250 in June 1982.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 83â84.&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors also refer to Israeli intelligence estimates of the number of PLO fighters in southern Lebanon of 6,000 as &quot;divided into three concentrations; about 1,500 south of the Litani River in the so-called [[Iron Triangle]] (between the villages of Kana, Dir Amas, and Juya), [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], and its surrounding refugee camps; another 2,500 of the Kastel Brigade in three districts between the Litani and a line running from Sidon to northeast of Nabatiye; and a third large concentration of about 1,500â2,000 men of the Karameh Brigade in the east, on the slopes of Mount Hermon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 134â135.&lt;/ref&gt;

PLO primary forces consisted of three conventional brigades each of 2,000 to 2,500 men and seven artillery battalions.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+lb0161%29 Lebanon. The Two-Week War. Section 1 of 1; Data as of December 1987 Library of Congress Country Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Each brigade was composed of contingents of the many PLO factions. The Yarmouk Brigade was stationed along the coastal strip while the Kastel Brigade was in the south. The Karameh Brigade was stationed on the eastern slopes of [[Mount Hermon]] in the area called [[Fatahland]].

The PLO had around 15,000 - 18,000 fighters (of whom about 5,000-6,000 were alleged to be foreign [[mercenary|mercenaries]] (or volunteers) from such countries as Libya, Iraq, India, Sri Lanka, Chad and Mozambique [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Lebanon_War.html]) and they were disposed as follows&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot;/&gt;:
* 6,000 in the Beirut, Ba'abda and Damour area,
* 1,500 in Sidon,
* 1,000 between Sidon and Tyre,
* 1,500 in Tyre,
* 1,000 deployed from Nabatiyeh to Beaufort Castle,
* 2,000 in Fatahland, and
* around 1,000 in the UNIFIL Zone.

Heavy weapons consisted of about 60 [[T-34]], [[T54]] and T55 tanks, most of which were dug in as [[bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]], up to 250 130mm and 155&amp;nbsp;mm artillery, many [[BM21]] [[Katyusha]] multiple rocket launchers plus heavy mortars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayigh|first=Y.|title=Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement, 1949-1993.|year=1990|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press.|isbn=0-19-829643-6|pages=524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-PLO groups====
Palestinian groups in the radical [[Rejectionist Front]] fought on the Muslim-leftist side. While others, such as [[Saiqa]], the Arab Liberation Front, the [[Palestine Liberation Army]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command]] (PFLP-GC) were essentially mercenary armies for foreign governments (Syria, Iraq, and Libya, respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/lebanon/lb_appnb.html APPENDIX B -- Lebanon, APPENDIX B -- Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===

[[Image:Syrian SAM.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Part of a Syrian [[SA-6]] site built near the Beirut-Damascus highway, and overlooking the [[Bekaa Valley]], in early 1982.]]

The [[Syrian Army]] deployed over 30,000 troops in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;# Armies in Lebanon 1982-84, Samuel Katz and Lee E. Russell, Osprey Men-At-Arms series #165, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest concentration was in the Bekaa Valley where the 1st Armoured Division consisting of the 58th Mechanised and the 76th and 91st Armoured Brigades. The 62nd Independent Armored Brigade and ten [[commando]] battalions were also assigned to the division. Syria deployed around 400 tanks in the Bekaa Valley. 19 Surface to Air missile batteries, including SA6's, were also deployed in the Bekaa Valley.

In Beirut and the Shouf Mountains were the 85th Infantry Brigade, the [[Palestine Liberation Army|PLA]], [[As-Sa'iqa]] and 20 commando battalions. Syria deployed around 200 tanks in this area. Their primary mission was to protect the [[Beirut-Damascus Highway]], which was Syria's primary supply line in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt;

===Israel===
[[File:Merkava-1-latrun-1.jpg|thumb|The Israeli [[Merkava]] Mark I tank was used throughout the First Lebanon War]]
IDF forces totalled 78,000 men, 1,240 tanks and 1,500 armoured personnel carriers. IDF troops were deployed in five divisions and two reinforced brigade-size units. The IDF maintained additional forces on the Golan Heights as an area reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt; IDF forces were divided into three main axis of advances called sectors&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt;:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Israeli Elite Units since 1948, Samuel Katz, Osprey Elite series 18,&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coastal Sector, (from [[Rosh HaNikra Crossing|Rosh Hanikra]] north to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Damour]] and Beirut.) -  Forces included [[91st Division (IDF)|Division 91]] with three brigades including the 211th and the [[Golani Brigade]].  The [[Paratroopers Brigade|35 Paratroop Brigade]] and the [[Nahal|Na'hal]] 50th Paratroop Battalion were attached to the division as needed. The [[Israeli Navy]] provided naval interdiction, shore gunfire support and landed a mixed brigade from [[96th Division (IDF)|Division 96]] at the mouth of the [[Awali River]] near Sidon. [[Shayetet 13|Israeli Naval commandos]] had landed there previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* Central Sector (from [[Beaufort Castle, Lebanon|Beaufort Castle]] to [[Nabatiyeh]]) - [[Jezzine]] was the main objective and then on to Sidon to link up with the coastal forces. IDF forces included the [[36th Division (IDF)|Divisions 36]] and [[162nd Division (IDF)|162]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt;
* Eastern Sector (from [[Rachaya Al Foukhar|Rachaiya]] and [[Hasbaya|Hasbaiya]] thru the Bekaa Valley around [[Lake Qaraoun]]) - IDF forces included Divisions 90 and 252, the [[Vardi Force]] and the Special Maneuver Force which was composed of two brigades of Infantry and paratroops who were trained for anti-tank operations. These forces were primarily used to contain the Syrians with orders not to initiate combat against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Lebanon===
[[Image:Lebanese Army APC, Beirut 1982.jpg|thumb|[[Lebanese Army]] APC, Beirut 1982]]

====Armed Forces====
[[Lebanese Army]] - By 1982 the Lebanese Army had largely disintegrated and what was left was a Christian-staffed force of about 10,000 men in five brigades (the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th) plus some smaller independent units. The Lebanese Army was officially neutral and followed the orders of the Lebanese government, but provided tacit and active support to the Lebanese Front.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; The Army had lost much of its heavy equipment due to defections of its units.

A Lebanese national army unit of 1,350 was under the operational control of the UNIFIL commander, HQ located at Arzun with sub-units attached to UNIFIL Battalions.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN15194&quot;&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/687deff0fe05590a85257019006e4036!OpenDocument UN Doc S/15194] of 10 June 1982 ''Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;armlab&quot; /&gt;

====Security Forces====
[[Internal Security Forces]]: the national police and security force of Lebanon.

===Paramilitary forces===
====Right wing====
* [[South Lebanon Army]], founded in 1979 the SLA fought against both the PLO and Hezbollah. The SLA was composed of Christians, Shias and Druze from the areas that it controlled but the officers were mostly Christians.

* [[Guardians of the Cedars]], exclusively Maronite with strong anti-Syrian views, 3,000-6,000 uniformed militiamen armed with modern small-arms. They were backed by a mechanized force consisting of a single [[M50 Super Sherman]] medium tank, a few [[M42 Duster]]s and [[Chaimite V200]]&lt;ref&gt;http://milinme.wordpress.com/category/v-200-chaimite â An ex-ISF V-200 Chaimite employed by the Guardians of the Cedar pictured at Houche-el-Oumara during the Battle for Zahle, AprilâJune 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[armoured car]]s backed by [[gun-truck]]s ([[Land-Rover]]s, [[Toyota]] [[Land Cruiser]]s, [[GMC]] and [[Ford]] light pick-ups, plus US [[M35A2]] 2-1/2 ton cargo trucks) fitted with [[heavy machine guns]] (HMGs), [[recoilless rifles]], and a few [[anti-aircraft]] [[autocannons]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alsminiature.com/m.34.gardien.cedre.htm â GoC M34 gun-truck with ZU-23-2 AA autocannon, c.1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Left wing====
* The [[Lebanese National Resistance Front]] forces totalled about 30,000 fighting men and women. It was the successor of the [[Lebanese National Movement]].

* The [[Druze]] were initially neutral but turned against the LF when the new government attempted to force their way into Druze territory. The militia of the [[Progressive Socialist Party]] consisted of 10,000 to 20,000 men and boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+lb0163%29&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] at the time had training camps in Lebanon, where they received support from the Syrians and the PLO. During the Israeli invasion all PKK units were ordered to fight the Israeli forces. A total of 11 PKK fighters died in the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK1&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/pkk-pr.cfm In the Spotlight: PKK (A.k.a KADEK) Kurdish Worker's Party]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK2&quot;&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kicadam/kurdistan/2_99/ocalan.html Abdullah Ãcalan en de ontwikkeling van de PKK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK3&quot;&gt;[http://www.niqash.org/content.php?contentTypeID=75&amp;id=2285&amp;lang=0 a secret relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious====
* The Christian [[Lebanese Front]], sometimes called the Kufur Front, was a coalition of mainly Christian parties formed in 1976, during the Lebanese Civil War. It was intended to act as a counter force to the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) of Kamal Jumblatt and others. Combined Lebanese Front forces totalled about 30,000 fighting men and women. These forces were mostly [[Phalangist]], though there were some men from [[Saad Haddad]]'s &quot;Free Lebanon forces&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Shahid&quot;&gt;Shahid, Leila. ''The Sabra and Shatila Massacres: Eye-Witness Reports''. Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 32, No. 1. (Autumn, 2002), pp. 36-58.&lt;/ref&gt; and other smaller right-wing militias, including [[al-Tanzim]].
* [[Shiite]] organizations
** [[Amal Movement]] the militia wing of the Movement of the Disinherited, a Shi'a political movement. Initially neutral. The Shia Amal guerrillas had been ordered by their leaders not to fight and to surrender their weapons if necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;
** [[Hezbollah]] the other Shiite militia ostensibly formed during the invasion around Beirut and backed by Iran.
** [[Pasdaran]] - In July 1982 Iran dispatched an expeditionary force of Revolutionary Guards to Lebanon, ostensibly to fight the Israeli invaders. The approximately 650 Pasdaran established their headquarters in the city of [[Baalbek]] in the Syrian-controlled Biqa Valley where they conducted guerrilla training, disbursed military matÃ©riel and money, and disseminated propaganda.&lt;ref name=&quot;locgov&quot;&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+lb0166%29&lt;/ref&gt;
** The political fission that characterized Lebanese politics also afflicted the Shia movement, as groups split off from Amal. Husayn al Musawi, a former Amal lieutenant, entered into an alliance with the Revolutionary Guard and established Islamic Amal.
** Other Shia groups included [[Jundallah (Lebanon)|Jundallah]] (Soldiers of God), the [[Husayn Suicide Commandos]], the [[Dawah]] (Call) Party, and the notorious [[Islamic Jihad Organization]], reportedly headed by [[Imad Mughniyyah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;locgov&quot;/&gt;

===Invasion===
On 6 June 1982, Israeli forces under direction of Defence Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] invaded southern Lebanon in &quot;Operation Peace for Galilee&quot;.

===Course of the fighting===
{{Main|South Lebanon conflict (1982â2000)|Siege of Beirut}}
Israel's publicly stated objective was to push [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] forces back {{convert|40|km|mi|spell=us}} to the north. Israeli forces pushed in from Southern Lebanon in a three-pronged offensive. They captured strategic positions throughout the country, with some of the fiercest fighting taking place at [[Beaufort Castle, Lebanon|Beaufort Castle]], [[Nabatieh]], and the Syrian-held town of [[Jezzine]]. In an effort to establish air superiority and greater freedom of action, the [[Israeli Air Force]] launched [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]]. During the course of the operation, the Israeli Air Force scored a dramatic victory over the Syrians shooting down more than 80 Syrian planes and also destroyed 30 Syrian anti-aircraft missile batteries, with no air to air losses of its own. However, one A-4 Skyhawk was lost to anti-aircraft fire on 6 June. Syria acknowledged the loss of 16 aircraft. Israeli aircraft also pounded PLO targets in Beirut, and Israeli gunboats shelled the coastal roads in order to cut PLO supply lines. Although Israeli forces managed to fight their way into the Syrian-held town of [[Sultan Yacoub]], they became surrounded. Although they successfully broke out, Sultan Yacoub was one of the few objectives the IDF failed to take over the course of the war. The Israelis swept through Lebanon, pushing towards Beirut. To cut off any PLO retreat routes, the [[Israeli Navy]] facilitated an amphibious landing of tanks, armoured vehicles, and paratroopers north of [[Sidon]]. The IDF soon reached Beirut and were determined to drive the PLO from southern Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/DTM.htm Lebanon 1982: The Imbalance Of Political Ends And Military Means&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] (major cities in [[South Lebanon]], still within the {{convert|40|km|mi|sing=on|spell=us}} limit) were heavily damaged, and the Lebanese capital Beirut was shelled by Israeli artillery, and bombed by Israeli aircraft for ten weeks, killing PLO members though some civilians were also killed. Israeli troops captured Beirut Airport and several southern suburbs of the city in heavy fighting.

During the course of combat operations, the [[Israeli Air Force]] conducted successful ground attack missions against Syrian and PLO targets, with Israeli attack helicopters inflicting heavy losses on Syrian armor. Israeli jets shot down between 82&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich, ''The Yom Kippur War'', Schocken Books (2004) p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; and 86 Syrian aircraft in aerial combat, without losses.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, ''The Arab-Israeli Wars'', Random House (1982) p347-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Walker &amp; the editors of Time-Life books, ''Fighting Jets: The Epic of Flight'', Time Life Books (1983) p162-63&lt;/ref&gt; A single Israeli A-4 Skyhawk and two helicopters were shot down by anti-aircraft fire and SAM missiles.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, p 347-348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p.162-63&lt;/ref&gt; This was the largest aerial combat battle of the jet age with over 150 fighters from both sides engaged. Syrian claims of aerial victories were met with skepticism even from their Soviet allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;hurley&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

The Soviets were so shaken by the staggering losses sustained by their allies that they dispatched the deputy head of their air defense force to Syria to examine how the Israelis had been so dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich, p. 510-11&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli Air Force also performed ground attacks, notably destroying the majority of Syrian anti-aircraft batteries stationed in Lebanon. [[AH-1 Cobra]] helicopter gunships were employed against Syrian armour and fortifications. IAF Cobras destroyed dozens of Syrian [[Armored fighting vehicle]]s, including some of the modern Soviet [[T-72]] [[main battle tank]]s. The war also witnessed the Israeli [[Merkava]] [[main battle tank|MBT]] make its first combat debut, squaring off against Syrian [[T-72]] tanks. During these engagements, the Merkava proved superior to the T-72 destroying a number of them without sustaining a single loss to T-72 fire.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; Former IAF commander, [[David Ivri]] would later recall a meeting with a high ranking member of the [[Warsaw Pact]], in which he was told that the dominance of Israeli and U.S. technology and tactics during the war was one of the factors that changed Soviet mind-set, leading to [[Glasnost]] and ultimately, the fall of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabinovich p. 510-11&quot;&gt;Rabinovich p. 510-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bekaa Valley War&quot;&gt;Rebecca Grant [http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2002/June%202002/0602bekaa.aspx.

An agreement was reached later in 1982. More than 14,000 PLO combatants evacuated the country in August and September, supervised by the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]], an international peacekeeping force with troops from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]. About 6,500 Fatah fighters relocated from Beirut to Jordan, Syria, [[Iraq]], [[Sudan]], both [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]], Greece, and Tunisiaâthe latter of which became the new PLO headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/30/newsid_2536000/2536441.stm | work=BBC News | title=1982: PLO leader forced from Beirut | date=30 August 1982 | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Habib]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s envoy to Lebanon, provided an understanding (i.e., assurance) to the PLO that the Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps would not be harmed. However, the United States Marines left West Beirut two weeks before the end of their official mandate following the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]].

===Sabra and Shatila massacre===
{{Main|Sabra and Shatila massacre}}

On 14 September 1982, [[Bachir Gemayel]], the newly elected President of Lebanon, was assassinated by [[Habib Tanious Shartouni|Habib Shartouni]] of the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seale |first=Patrick |title=Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East |page=391|year=1988|isbn=0-520-06667-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli forces occupied West Beirut the next day. At that time, the Lebanese Christian Militia, also known as the [[Kataeb Party|Phalangists]], were allied with Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcfb&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1779713.stm &quot;Flashback: Sabra and Shatila massacres&quot;], ''BBC News Online'' (London), 24 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli command authorized the entrance of a force of approximately 150 Phalangist fighters' into the [[Sabra and Shatila]] refugee camps, claiming there was a remaining force of approximately &quot;2000 PLO terrorists&quot; in the camps.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcfb&quot;/&gt; The result was the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] in which at least 800 civilians were slaughtered by the Phalangists, who themselves suffered only two casualties. Meanwhile, Israeli troops surrounded the camps with tanks and checkpoints, monitoring entrances and exits.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcfb&quot;/&gt; Further Israeli investigation by the [[Kahan Commission]] of Inquiry found that [[Ariel Sharon]] bore &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for failing to prevent the massacre, and for failing to act once he learned that a massacre had started, and recommended that he be removed as Defence Minister and that he never hold a position in any future Israeli government. Sharon initially ignored the call to resign, but after the death of an anti-war protester following an anti-war protest, he did resign as Israel's Defence Minister, however, he remained in Begin's cabinet as a Minister without portfolio.

==Outcome of the war==
===Casualties===
{{Main|Israeli casualties of war|Palestinian casualties of war}}

It is estimated that around 17,825 Lebanese were killed during the first year of the war, with differing estimates of the proportion of civilians killed. This number of civilian casualties is not the total number of civilian casualties from 1982-2000. Beirut newspaper ''An Nahar'' estimated that 5,515 people, both military and civilian, were killed in the Beirut area alone during the conflict, while 9,797 Syrian soldiers, PLO fighters, and other forces aligned with the PLO, as well as 2,513 civilians were killed outside of the Beirut area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title= Twentieth Century Atlas - Death Tolls and Casualty Statistics for Wars, Dictatorships and Genocides&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat3.htm#Lebanon|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gbBg9Jlu|archivedate=7 May 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 675 Israeli soldiers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Michael (2006). ''The Volunteer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Katz and Lee E Russell in their book Armies in Lebanon 1982-84&lt;ref&gt;Osprey Men-At-Arms series, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; puts the casualties as follows:

* Israel - 368 dead and 2,383 wounded
* PLO - 1,500 dead and an unknown amount wounded plus around 8,000 captured
* Syria - 1,200 dead and around 3,000 wounded plus 296 captured
* Lebanon - civilians 17,825 dead and around 30,000 wounded.
* Foreigners - 1800 foreigners from 26 countries on five continents, allegedly training in the Ein el Hilweh refugee camp near Sidon, were captured.

They also state that the extensive PLO political and military infrastructure in Lebanon, which had taken 15 years to build, had been destroyed.

Lebanese estimates, compiled from International Red Cross sources and police and hospital surveys, calculated that 17,825 Lebanese had died and over 30,000 had been wounded.&lt;ref&gt;LEBANON - A Country Study Library of Congress, Federal Research Division&lt;/ref&gt;

===The security buffer zone===
[[Image:Civil war Lebanon map 1983a.gif|thumb|Map showing power balance in Lebanon, 1983:

In September 1982, the PLO withdrew most of its forces from Lebanon. With U.S. assistance, Israel and Lebanon reached [[The Peace Treaty between Israel and Lebanon|an accord]] in May 1983 that set the stage to withdraw Israeli forces from Lebanon while letting them patrol a &quot;security zone&quot; together with the [[Lebanese Army]].

The instruments of ratification were never exchanged, however, and in March 1984, under pressure from Syria, Lebanon cancelled the agreement.

In January 1985, Israel started to withdraw most of its troops, leaving a small residual Israeli force and an Israeli-supported militia, the [[South Lebanon Army]] in southern Lebanon in a &quot;[[Israeli Security Zone|security zone]]&quot;, which Israel considered a necessary buffer against attacks on its northern territory. The Israeli withdrawal to the security zone ended in June 1985. Israel withdrew fully from Lebanon in 2000.

===Political results===
In the voting in the [[Knesset]] on the war, only [[Hadash]] opposed the war (and even submitted a [[no-confidence motion]] against the Israeli government). Hadash Knesset member [[Meir Vilner]] said in the Knesset plenary session that: &quot;The government is leading Israel to an abyss. It is doing something that in the course of time might lead to crying for generations.&quot; In response, they were condemned, and calls were heard, among others from the editor of [[Yedioth Ahronoth|Yediot Ahronoth]], to prosecute them for treason. Left-wing Knesset members, including [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Yossi Sarid]], were absent from the plenary for the vote.  Even the [[Labour (Israel)|Labour]] faction voted in support. By mid January 1983 Rabin was saying that the Israeli attempt to impose a peace agreement on Lebanon by the use of force was a &quot;mistake&quot; based upon an &quot;illusion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/Vol_85__1985.pdf American Jewish Committee Archives], American Jewish Yearbook 1985. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria backed the anti-Arafat PLO forces of [[Said al-Muragha|Abu Musa]] in the Beka valley from May 1983. When Arafat castigated the Syrian government for blocking PLO supplies in June 1983, the Syrian government declared Arafat a ''persona non grata'' on 24 June 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/Vol_85__1985.pdf American Jewish Committee Archives] American Jewish Yearbook 1985. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the withdrawal of the PLO leadership from Tripoli in December 1983 there was an Egyptian-PLO rapprochement, this was found to be encouraging by the Reagan administration but was condemned by the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/Vol_85__1985.pdf American Jewish Committee Archives] American Jewish Yearbook 1985. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

But heavy Israeli casualties, alleged [[disinformation]] of Israeli government leaders and the Israeli public by Israeli military and political advocates of the campaign, and lack of clear goals led to increasing disquiet among Israelis. This culminated in a large protest rally in [[Tel Aviv]], organized by the [[Peace Now]] movement, following the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]]. Organizers claimed 400,000 people participated in the rally, and it became known as the &quot;400,000 rally&quot;. Other estimates put the figure much lower, maybe reaching 100,000 Israelis but including thousands of reserve soldiers back from Lebanon, .&lt;ref&gt;Warschawski, Michel (AprilâMay 2006).

In 2000, when [[Ehud Barak]] was Israeli Prime Minister, Israel finally withdrew from the [[Israeli Security Zone|security zone]] to behind the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]]. Lebanon and Hezbollah continue to claim a small area called [[Shebaa Farms]] as Lebanese territory, but Israel insists that it is captured Syrian territory with the same status as the [[Golan Heights]]. The United Nations has not determined the final status of Shebaa Farms but has determined that Israel has complied with UNSC resolution 425. The UN Secretary-General had concluded that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]] of 1978, bringing closure to the 1982 invasion as far as the UN was concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html &quot;Security Council Endorses Secretary-General's Conclusion On Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon as of 16 June&quot;], UN Press release SC/6878, 18 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Sabra and Shatila massacre#MacBride commission report|l1=Sabra and Shatila massacre, section MacBride commission report}}

In 1982, an international commission investigated into reported violations of International Law by Israel during its invasion of the Lebanon. Chairman was [[SeÃ¡n MacBride]], the other members were [[Richard Falk]], [[Kader Asmal]], Brian Bercusson, GÃ©raud de la Pradelle, and Stefan Wild. The commission's report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that &quot;the government of Israel has committed acts of aggression contrary to international law&quot;, that the government of Israel had no valid reasons under international law for its invasion of Lebanon, and that
the Israeli authorities or forces were involved directly or indirectly in the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|massacres at Sabra and Shatila]].

==Consequences==
The 1982 Lebanon War had a number of  consequences:

*From the standpoint of the Israeli Military, the invasion removed [[PLO]] presence from Southern Lebanon and destroying its [[infrastructure]], as well as increasing deterrence on other Arab anti-Israeli militant organizations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Syrian military was weakened by combat losses, especially in the air.
*The political vacuum resulting from the Israeli withdrawal would eventually lead to the ''de facto'' Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Syria would gain much more power over Lebanon than what it enjoyed before 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;/&gt;
*The complete dominance of U.S. and Israeli technology and tactics over those of the [[Eastern Bloc]] was said to have been a factor that hastened the demise of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabinovich p. 510-11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bekaa Valley War&quot;/&gt;
*The failure of the larger Israeli objectives of resolving the conflict in Lebanon with [[May 17 Agreement|a peace treaty]],&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Arab-Israeli Wars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern+History/Centenary+of+Zionism/The+Arab-Israeli+Wars.htm |title=The Arab-Israeli Wars |author=[[Netanel Lorch]] |work=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of securing its hold on the [[West Bank]] by destroying effective Palestinian resistance,.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shlaim&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Shlaim, Avi |authorlink =Avi Shlaim |title=The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab world |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=422 |isbn=0-393-32112-6 | doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2011}}
*The Israeli-Maronite alliance dissolved, and Sharon's goal of installing a pro-Israel Christian government in Beirut was not accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMorris1999|Morris, p. 551]]&lt;/ref&gt; 850,000 Christians would emigrate during the Civil War, most of them permanently.&lt;ref&gt;Dagher, Carol. Bring Down the Walls: Lebanon's Post-War Challenge&quot; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;
*The invasion that also targeted many Shiite Lebanese, has brought about the switching of sides of [[Amal Movement]], which used to fight against the [[PLO]] prior to the invasion.
*The invasion is popularly held to be the major catalyst for the creation of the Iranian and Syrian supported [[Hezbollah]] organization, which by 1991 was the sole armed militia in Lebanon not supported by Israel and by 2000 had completely replaced the vanquished [[PLO]] in Southern Lebanon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
*The [[Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction]] estimated the cost of the damage from the invasion at 7,622,774,000 [[Lebanese pound]]s, equivalent to US$2 billion at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/0a660a16a0ef988d852568b60053c49a?OpenDocument E/CN.4/2000/22/Add.1 of 3 March 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Al-Qaeda leader [[Osama bin Laden]] said in a videotape released on the eve of the 2004 U.S. presidential elections that he was inspired to attack the buildings of the United States by the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon in which towers and buildings in Beirut were destroyed in the siege of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Arak, Joel (29 October 2004). [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/30/terror/main652425.shtml &quot;Osama Bin Laden Warns America: Terror Leader Admits For First Time That He Ordered 9/11 Attacks&quot;], CBS News.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The withdrawal of the IDF back to South Lebanon in the summer of 1983, led to one of the bloodiest phases of the Lebanese war, where the Christian Militia (the [[Lebanese Forces]]) was left alone to defend the &quot;Mountain&quot; area which comprised the [[Aley District|Aley]] and [[Chouf District|Chouf]] districts against a coalition of [[Druze]] [[Progressive Socialist Party|PSP]], Palestinian PLO, Syrian Army, Lebanese Communist, and [[Syrian Social National Party]]. The result was catastrophic on the civilian population from both sides (more than 5,000 killed from both sides). The war ended after the Christian forces and civilians withdrew to the town of Deir el Kamar where they were besieged for 3 months before all hostilities ceased and they were transported to East Beirut.
*Israelâs withdrawal from Lebanon led to pressure on the Syrians to withdraw their [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|occupation forces]] and this pressure intensified after the assassination of the popular Lebanese Prime Minister, [[Rafik Hariri]]. On 26 April 2005 the Syrian occupation forces withdrew from Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8372.doc.htm Security Council Press Release SC/8372]&lt;/ref&gt;
