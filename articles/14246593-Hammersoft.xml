The Knights began their season at home against South Carolina State.  Making his first start at quarterback, [[Michael Greco (quarterback)|Michael Greco]] had a difficult time trying to find his groove, completing 9-of-16 passing for 90 yards, and running 13 times for 57 yards.  But the defense remained strong and carried the team, holding the Bulldog offense to less than 22 minutes of play time, with Jason Venson catching an interception.

Greco's struggles continued when the Knights hosted USF for the last match in their &quot;War on I-4&quot; rivalry.  While the Bulls scored first, Joe Burnett answered back with a 91-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.  The Knights defense held as well as they could, holding the Bulls to 10 points in the first half and allowing the Knights to tie the game going into halftime.  However, the Knights had difficulty maintaining their discipline, and it cost them in penalties.  The Knights had 12 penalties for 148 yards, one of which negated a touchdown on an interception in the second quarter.

Although it appeared the Bulls would begin to run away with the game, scoring two touchdowns in the third quarter, Michael Greco finally awoke toward the end of the fourth quarter, leading two touchdown drives in the final minutes of regulation to force overtime.  However, they came up short on a fourth-down run on their turn, failing to answer a quick USF touchdown.

Although sluggish for most of the game, the Knights offense did not turn the ball over.  After their first two games, UCF has a +3 turnover ratio.

The unanticipated struggles for the Bulls dropped them back to their preseason #19 ranking in the AP poll despite the win.
