'''Catherine Parr''' ('''Katherine''', '''Kateryn''', '''Katheryne''' or '''Kathrine'''); 1512&lt;ref&gt;Her precise date of birth is not known; the ODNB says &quot;born in 1512, probably in August&quot;. Susan E. James, &quot;Katherine [Katherine Parr] (1512â1548)&quot;, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4893, accessed 26 Nov 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; â 5 September 1548) was Queen consort of England and Ireland and the last of [[Wives of Henry VIII|the six wives]] of King [[Henry VIII of England]]. She married Henry VIII on 12 July 1543. She was the fourth commoner Henry had taken as his consort, and outlived him. She was also the most-married English queen, as she had a total of four husbands.

Catherine enjoyed a close relationship with Henryâs three children and was personally involved in the education of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], both of whom became English monarchs. She was influential in Henry's passing of the [[Third Succession Act]] in 1543 that restored both [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Lady Elizabeth]] to the [[Line of succession to the English throne|line of succession]] to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Catherine was appointed [[Regent]] from July to September 1544 while Henry was on a military campaign in France and in case he lost his life, she was to rule as Regent until Edward came of age. However he did not give her any function in government in his will. On account of Catherine's [[Protestant]] sympathies, she provoked the enmity of powerful Catholic officials who sought to turn the King against her; a warrant for her arrest was drawn up in 1546; however, she and the King were soon reconciled. Her book ''Prayers or Meditations'' became the first book published by an English queen under her own name. She assumed the role of Elizabeth's guardian following the King's death; and another book, ''The Lamentations of a Sinner'', was published. 

Six months after Henry's death, she married her fourth and final husband, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley]]. The marriage proved to be short-lived as she died in September 1548, probably of complications resulting from childbirth.

==Early life==
Catherine was the oldest surviving child of [[Sir Thomas Parr]], Lord of the Manor of [[Kendal]] in [[Westmorland]] (now [[Cumbria]]), descendant of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], and the former [[Maud Green]] (1492 &amp;ndash;1531), daughter and co-heiress of [[Sir Thomas Green]], Lord of [[Greens Norton]], Northamptonshire. The Parrs were a substantial northern knightly family. She had a younger brother, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William]], later 1st Marquess of Northampton, and a sister, [[Anne Herbert, Countess of Pembroke|Anne]], later [[Earl of Pembroke|Countess of Pembroke]]. Sir Thomas was Sheriff of Northamptonshire, Master of the Wards, and Comptroller to [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. Sir Thomas Parr was also a close companion of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Her mother, Lady Parr, was a close friend and attendant of Queen [[Catherine of Aragon]]. Catherine was presumably named after Queen Catherine, who was also her godmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter&quot; /&gt;

Like the family of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry]]'s [[Anne Boleyn|second wife]], the Boleyns, the Parr family had gone up in the world as a result of royal favor and successful marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;starkey&quot;&gt;David Starkey. ''Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII'', HarperCollins, 2004. pg 690.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's ancestry was more distinguished than that of [[Thomas Boleyn]] and [[John Seymour]] and Catherine's lineage, unlike that of [[Henry VIII|Henry's]] wife, [[Anne Boleyn]], was better and more established at Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;starkey&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Strickland, ''Lives of the queens of England'', Vol V, Colburn, 1842. pg 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not of the aristocracy at the time, the Parrs were in the service of the royal family, in the household of Catherine's ancestor, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]. Their marriage alliance with the Ros (or Roos) family enhanced their standing.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Porter. ''Katherine, the queen'', Macmillan, 2010. pg 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine's grandfather, [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Kendal|William]], was part of King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]'s court. William held the office of [[comptroller of the household]] from 1471 to 1475 and again in 1481 till Edward's death in 1483.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Leslie Stephen, editor, ''Dictionary of National Biography'', Volume 43, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1895. pg 366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Household of Edward IV'', Manchester University Press ND. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ihu9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=william+parr+edward+iv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FoYrTs-3B87qgQe3utyvCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20parr%20edward%20iv&amp;f=false ''Google ebook'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.N.B. states Sir William Parr as Comptroller of the Household from 1471-1483. Household of Edward IV states Sir William Parr's office dates as 1471-1475 and again in 1481-1483.&lt;/ref&gt; William was held in high favour with the [[Edward IV of England|King]] and was one of only two courtiers to become [[Knight of the Garter]] in the second reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Sir William Parr could claim royal descent through [[John, King of England|King John of England]], [[William the Lion|King William &quot;the Lion&quot; of Scotland]], the [[Clan Bruce|Brus]] family from which came [[Robert the Bruce|Robert de Brus, King of the Scots]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Richardson, Kimball G. Everingham, ''Magna Carta ancestry: a study in colonial and medieval families'', Genealogical Publishing Com, 2005. pg 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir William's wife, [[Elizabeth FitzHugh, Baroness Vaux of Harrowden|Lady Elizabeth]], was the daughter of Henry, 5th Lord FitzHugh and Lady [[Alice Neville]]. Alice was sister to [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|&quot;Warwick, the Kingmaker&quot;]]. Lady Alice's family, the [[House of Neville|Neville]]'s, were already established at court being descendants of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]]'s illegitimate daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland|Lady Joan Beaufort]] and her second husband, [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmoreland]]. Catherine Parr was the only wife of Henry VIII to descend from the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] family. This connection made Catherine a fourth cousin through Henry's father and a second cousin once removed through his mother. Through Catherine's mother, [[Maud Green, Lady Parr|Maud]], she was also related to Henry by her ancestress Joan Wydville (or Woodville), sister of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers]], father of King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] consort, [[Elizabeth Woodville]]. When the [[Richard III of England|Duke of Gloucester]] became King in 1483, as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], both Elizabeth and her mother Alice were appointed ladies-in-waiting to Alice's niece, queen consort Lady [[Anne Neville]]. The profession would span five generations down to Catherine's sister, [[Anne Herbert, Countess of Pembroke|Anne]], who would serve all six of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Wives of Henry VIII|wives]]. 

It was first thought that Catherine Parr was born at [[Kendal Castle]] in [[Westmorland]], [[England]]. However, at the time of her birth, Kendal Castle was already in bad condition, and by 1572 it would be derelict.&lt;ref&gt;J. Nicholson &amp; R. Burn: 1777, 45-46, and the archaeological findings during the excavation of Kendal Castle by Barbara Harbottle as published in Abbot Hall ''Quarto'', V, no.4 (January 1968); VI, no. 4 (January 1969); VII, no.4 (January 1970); X, no.1 (August 1972), Kendal.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Maud Parr's pregnancy, she was at court attending the Queen, and  by necessity the Parr family was living in their home at [[Blackfriars]], London. Historians consider it unlikely that Catherine's father, Sir Thomas, would take his pregnant wife on an arduous two week journey north over execrable roads to give birth in a crumbling castle in which neither of them seemed to spend much time.&lt;ref&gt;William Farrer, ''Records Relating to the Barony of Kendal'', John F. Curwen (ed.), 3 vols, Kendal (1923-26), I, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot; /&gt; Her father died when she was young and she was close to her mother as she grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robin, Larsen and Levin | page=289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catherine's initial education was similar to other well-born women, but she developed a passion for learning which would continue throughout her life. She was fluent in French, Latin, and Italian and began learning Spanish when she was Queen. According to [[David Starkey]], Catherine was most likely better educated overall than [[Anne Boleyn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starkey&quot; /&gt; As a child, Catherine could not tolerate sewing and often ironically said to her mother &quot;my hands are ordained to touch crowns and scepters, not spindles and needles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter&quot; /&gt; 

Until recently, many sources stated that Catherine married the elderly [[Edward Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh]] in 1529, at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter&quot;&gt;Linda Porter. ''Katherine, the Queen''. Macmillan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, page 587.&lt;/ref&gt; However since the release of [[Antonia Fraser]] ''The Wives of Henry VIII'' in 1994, and [[David Starkey]]'s 2004 book on the six wives, Catherine's first husband has been identified as [[Sir Edward Borough]]. Some blame for this mistake could be attributed to 19th century historian [[Agnes Strickland]]'s book on the wives of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Research of documents (including Maud Parr's Will) conducted by [[Susan James]] and [[Linda Porter (historian)|Linda Porter]] for their biographies on Catherine confirm that she married the 2nd Baron's grandson, also called Edward. [[Sir Edward Burgh|Sir Edward Borough]] was the eldest son of the 2nd Baron's eldest son, [[Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh|Sir Thomas Borough]], who would become the 1st [[Baron Borough|Baron Burgh]] in December 1529 after his father was declared insane. In her will, dated May 1529, Maud Parr says she is 'indebted to Sir Thomas Borough, knight, for the marriage of my daughter'. At the time of his son's marriage, Thomas was thirty-five which would have made [[Sir Edward Burgh|Edward]] around Catherine's age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter&quot; /&gt; Edward was in his twenties and may have been in poor health. He served as a [[feoffee]] for Thomas Kiddell and as a justice of the peace. His father, Sir Thomas, [[Anne Boleyn]]'s chamberlain, also secured a joint patent in survivorship with his son for the office of steward of the manor of the [[Soke (legal)|soke]] of [[Kirton in Lindsey]]. The younger Sir Edward Borough died in the spring of 1533, never fulfilling the title of Lord (''Baron'') Borough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot;&gt;James, Susan E. Catherine Parr: Henry VIII's Last Love. Gloucestershire, England: The History Press, 2009. pg. 60-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Latimer==
In the year of 1533, it is thought that Catherine spent her time with the widow of her cousin Sir Walter Strickland, the Dowager Lady Strickland, Catherine Neville at the Strickland's family residence of [[Sizergh Castle and Garden|Sizergh Castle]] in [[Westmorland]] (now [[Cumbria]]). Parr was not only related to Neville by blood, but also by marriage. Catherine's great-aunt, Agnes Parr married Sir Thomas Strickland, son of Sir Walter and Douce Crofte.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Richardson, ''Plantagenet Ancestry'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Another relation was through Elizabeth Ros, daughter of Sir John Ros of Kendal and Catherine Strickland who married Sir William Parr; the two were Catherine's paternal great-great grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Scott. ''The Strickland's of Sizergh Castle'', Kendal, 1908, 82, 84, 88-89; L&amp;P, 4, iii, no. 680(10).&lt;/ref&gt; The Dowager Lady Strickland was kin to Parr's next husband, [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Latymer|John Neville]]. In the summer of 1534 she married [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Latymer]], of [[Snape, North Yorkshire]]. At age 40, Lord Latimer was twice Catherine's age. Latimer was her father's second cousin, a twice-widowed descendant of [[George Nevill, 1st Baron Latimer|George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer]], [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]], the 'Kingmaker's', 'idiot uncle'. From his first marriage to Dorothy de Vere, sister of the [[John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford|John de Vere, Earl of Oxford]], he had two children, [[John Nevill, 4th Baron Latimer|John]] and Margaret. Neville was one of fifteen children born to [[Richard Nevill, 2nd Baron Latimer|Richard Neville, Lord Latimer]] and Anne Stafford, daughter of Sir Humphrey Stafford. Latimer's branch of the [[House of Neville|Neville]] family was in line for the title of [[Earl of Warwick]] and because of this, Lord Latimer, dealt with quite a bit of sibling rivalry. Legal actions were taken by his younger brothers and Latimer, at the time of his marriage to Catherine, was having financial difficulties. But as Lady Latimer, Catherine now had a home of her own, a husband with a position and influence in the north, a ready-made family, and a title. Catherine would be the only female from the  Parr family, apart from her great-aunt, Mabel, to marry into the peerage. From the beginning of the marriage, Catherine made an attempt to be a good wife. Her affection for her husband would grow deep enough to cherish a remembrance of him, his New Testament with his name inscribed inside, which she kept until her death. Catherine would also prove to be a good step-mother to her step-children; a trait which she would again show after her marriage to the [[Henry VIII of England|King]]. Her teenage stepson, John, proved to be difficult. There is some indication that Margaret, his sister, was their father's favourite. Nevertheless, Catherine would continue a relationship with the two after her marriage to King Henry, bringing Margaret to court as her lady-in-waiting and securing a position for John's wife in her household.&lt;ref name=&quot;james3&quot;&gt;Susan E. James. ''Catherine Parr: Henry VIII's Last Love'', History Press, 2009 US edition. pg 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Latimer was a supporter of the [[Roman Catholicism|old religion]] and had bitterly opposed the king's divorce, his subsequent marriage to [[Anne Boleyn]] and its religious ramifications. In 1536, within two weeks of the riot in [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]], a mob appeared before the Latimer's home threatening violence if Lord Latimer did not join their cause. Catherine watched as her husband was dragged away by the rebels. As prisoner of the insurgents, conflicting stories of which side Latimer was truly on began to reach [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Cromwell]] and the King in London. The [[Pilgrimage of Grace|rebellion]] in [[Yorkshire]] put him in a terrible dilemma. If he was found guilty of treason his estates would be forfeited, leaving Catherine and her step-children penniless. The King himself wrote to the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] pressing him to make sure Latimer would 'condemn that villain Aske and submit [himself] to our clemency'.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters and Papers, Foreign &amp; Domestic of the Reign of Henry VIII'', II, no. 1174.&lt;/ref&gt; Latimer was more than happy to comply. Both Catherine's brother, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William Parr]] and uncle, [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton]] fought with the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and the [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]] against the rebellion. It is to most likely to Catherine's credit that Lord Latimer survived; both her brother and uncle probably intervened at one point and saved Lord Latimer's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;james3&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Snape Castle - geograph.org.uk - 467688.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Snape Castle]]]]
Between October 1536 and April 1537 Lady Latimer lived alone in fear with her step-children, struggling to survive. It is probable that, in these uncertain times, Catherine's strong reaction against the rebellion strengthened her adherence to the [[Church of England|reformed church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;james3&quot; /&gt; In January 1537, Catherine and her step-children were held hostage at [[Snape Castle]] during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|uprising of the North]]. The rebels ransacked the house and sent word to Lord Latimer, who was returning from London, that if he did not return immediately they would kill his family. When Lord Latimer returned to the castle, he somehow talked the rebels into releasing his family and leaving, but the aftermath would prove to be taxing on the whole family.&lt;ref name=&quot;james3&quot; /&gt;

The family would later move south after the executions of the rebels which pleased Cromwell and the King. Although no charges were found, Latimer's reputation, which reflected upon Catherine, was tarnished for the rest of his life. He spent the last seven years of his life blackmailed by Cromwell. Catherine would spend much of her time in the south during the years of 1537-42. Her husband was called away frequently to do the bidding of Cromwell and the King and be present during Parliament. With Cromwell's fall in 1540, the Latimers reclaimed some dignity and as Lord Latimer attended Parliament in 1542 he and Catherine spent time in London that winter. Her brother, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William]] and sister, [[Anne Herbert, Countess of Pembroke|Anne]] had been present at court. Anne entered court service in 1531 as maid-in-waiting to Henry's queens. It was here that she became acquainted with her future fourth husband [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Sir Thomas Seymour]]. The atmosphere of the court was much different from the rural and parochial estates. It was here that Catherine could find the latest trends, not only in religious matters, but in less weighty secular matters such as fashion and jewellery.&lt;ref name=&quot;james3&quot; /&gt;

By the winter of 1542, Lord Latimer's health had deteriorated. Catherine spent the winter of 1542-1543 nursing her husband. John Neville, Lord Latimer, died in 1543. In Lord Latimer's will, Catherine was named guardian of his daughter, Margaret, and was put in charge of Lord Latimer's affairs until his daughter's majority. Latimer left Catherine Stowe Manor and other properties. He also bequeathed money for supporting his daughter and in the case that his daughter did not marry within five years, Catherine was to take Â£30 per annum out of the income to support her step-daughter. Catherine was left a rich widow faced with the possibility of having to return north after Lord Latimer's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;james3&quot; /&gt; 

Using her late mother's relationship with Henry's first queen [[Catherine of Aragon]], Catherine took the opportunity to renew her friendship with [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary]]. By 16 February 1543, Catherine had established herself with Mary and was now part of her household. It was in the household of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]]'s daughter, [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary]], that Catherine Parr caught the attention of the King. After the death of Parr's second husband, Catherine began a relationship with [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Sir Thomas Seymour]], the brother of the late queen [[Jane Seymour]], but the King took a liking to her and she saw it as her duty to accept Henry's proposal over Seymour's. Thomas Seymour was given a posting in Brussels to remove him from court.

==Queen of England and Ireland==
[[Image:Coat of Arms of Catherine Parr.svg|thumb|left|upright|250px|Catherine Parr's arms as queen consort&lt;ref&gt;

Catherine married Henry VIII on 12 July 1543 at [[Hampton Court Palace]]. Her previous husband had died on 2 March 1543. She was the first Queen of England also to be [[Queen of Ireland]] following Henry's adoption of the title [[King of Ireland]]. As Queen, Catherine was partially responsible for reconciling Henry with his daughters from his first two marriages, who later became [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. She also developed a good relationship with Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]], later King Edward VI. When she became Queen, her uncle [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton|Lord Parr of Horton]] became her [[Lord Chamberlain]].

For three months, from July to September 1544, Catherine was appointed [[regent]] by Henry as he went on his last, unsuccessful, campaign in [[France]]. Thanks to her uncle having been appointed as member of her regency council, and to the sympathies of fellow appointed councillors [[Thomas Cranmer]] (the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]) and [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Hertford]], Catherine obtained effective control and was able to rule as she saw fit. She handled provision, finances and musters for Henry's French campaign, signed five Royal proclamations, and maintained constant contact with her lieutenant in the northern Marches, [[Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Shrewsbury]], over the complex and unstable situation with Scotland. It is thought that her actions as regent, together with her strength of character and noted dignity, and later religious convictions, greatly influenced her stepdaughter Lady Elizabeth (the future [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]).

Although she must have been brought up as a Catholic, given her birth before the [[Protestant Reformation]], she later became sympathetic to and interested in the &quot;New Faith&quot;. She came under suspicion that she was actually a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] by the mid-1540s, as we would now understand the term. This view is supported by the some strong reformed ideas that she revealed after Henry's death, when her second book, ''Lamentacions of a synner'' (Lamentations of a Sinner), was published in late 1547. The book promoted the Protestant concept of [[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]], which the Catholic Church deemed to be heresy. It is unlikely that she developed these views in the short time between Henry's death and the publication of the book. Her sympathy with [[Anne Askew]], the Protestant martyr who fiercely opposed the Catholic belief of [[transubstantiation]], also suggests that she was more than merely sympathetic to the new religion.[[Image:Catherine Parr Portrait at Lambeth Palace.jpg|thumb|alt=Katherine Parr Portrait at Lambeth Palace.jpg|According to Susan James and Linda Porter, this portrait is the earliest known portrait of Catherine Parr, probably painted around the time of her marriage to Lord Latimer. There has been some recent dispute as to whether or not this was mislabeled and is really the portrait of King Henry's first wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Susan.

The Queen's religious views were viewed with suspicion by Catholic and anti-Protestant officials such as [[Stephen Gardiner]] (the [[Bishop of Winchester]]) and [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Lord Wriothesley]] (the [[Lord Chancellor]]), who tried to turn the king against her in 1546. An arrest warrant was drawn up for her and rumours abounded across [[Europe]] that the King was attracted to her close friend, the [[Catherine Willoughby, 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby|Duchess of Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mistresses of Henry VIII |first=Kelly| last=Hart |edition=First |date=June 1, 2009 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |isbn=0752448358 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r6HGPAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she saw the warrant and managed to reconcile with the King after vowing that she had only argued about religion with him to take his mind off the suffering caused by his ulcerous leg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exclassics.com/foxe/foxe212.htm Foxe's Book of Martyrs]&lt;/ref&gt; The following day an armed guard who was unaware of the reconciliation tried to arrest her while she walked with the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Final marriage, childbirth and death==
Shortly before he died, Henry made provision for an allowance of Â£7,000 per year for Catherine to support herself. He further ordered that after his death, Catherine, though a [[queen dowager]], should be given the respect of a Queen of England, as if he were still alive. Catherine retired from court after the crowning of her step-son [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]] on 31 January 1547, to her home at [[Chelsea Manor|Old Manor]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. During this time, Catherine began having altercations with the Lord Protector, the King's uncle, the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] and a rivalry developed between Catherine and his wife, her former lady-in-waiting, the [[Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Duchess of Somerset]], which became particularly acute over the matter of Catherine's jewels. Catherine had personal jewels, including her wedding ring and many gifts from the King, but a question arose whether she still had the right to wear the jewelry worn by his former queens. These remained in a coffer within the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Susan, ''Catherine Parr'', (2009), 271; citing British Library, Add. Ms. 46,348, f.67b: Starkey, David, ed., ''The Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries (1998), 77-80; 122 items of jewellery.&lt;/ref&gt; The duchess argued that the jewels belonged to the Queen of England, and that as queen dowager, Catherine was no longer entitled to them. Instead she, as the wife of the protector, should be the one to wear them. Eventually, the duchess won the argument, which left her relationship with Catherine permanently damaged; the relationship between the two Seymour brothers also worsened as a result, since Lord Seymour saw the whole dispute as a personal attack by his brother on his social standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;james2&quot;&gt;James, Susan. Catherine Parr: Henry VIII's Last Love. (2009). pg 268-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

After having lived many years abroad on command of King Henry himself, Catherine's old love, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Sir Thomas Seymour]] returned to court. Catherine, who still harbored feelings for Seymour, was quick to accept when Seymour renewed his suit of marriage. Since only six months had passed since the death of King Henry, Seymour knew that the Regency council would not agree to a petition for the Dowager queen to marry so soon. Seymour decided to go directly to his nephew, King Edward, and ask for permission. Sometime near the end of May, Catherine was able to marry her old love in secret. The King and council were not informed of the union until summer 1547. When their union became public knowledge, it caused a small scandal. The King and Lady Mary were very much displeased by the union. After being censured and reprimanded by the council, Seymour wrote to the Lady Mary asking her to intervene on his behalf. Mary became furious at his forwardness and tasteless actions and refused to help. Mary even went as far as asking her half-sister, Lady Elizabeth, not to interact with the Dowager Queen any further.&lt;ref name=&quot;james2&quot; /&gt;

In November 1547, Catherine published her second book, ''[[Lamentations of a Sinner]]''. The book was a success and widely praised. 

In early 1548, Catherine invited Lady Elizabeth and her cousin, [[Lady Jane Grey]] to stay in the couple's household at Sudeley. The Dowager Queen promised to provide education for both. Queen Catherine's house came to be known as a respected place of learning for young women.

In March 1548, Catherine became pregnant for the first time at age thirty-five. This pregnancy was a surprise as Catherine had not conceived a child during her first three marriages. As sex during pregnancy was frowned upon during the sixteenth century,{{Fact|date=November 2011}} Seymour began to take an interest in Lady Elizabeth. Seymour had reputedly plotted to marry her before marrying Catherine, and it was reported later that Catherine discovered the two in an embrace. On a few occasions before the situation risked getting completely out of hand, Catherine appears not only to have acquiesced in episodes of sexually charged horseplay, but actually to have assisted her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Deposition of [[Kat Ashley|Katherine Ashley]] in [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YitDAAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s  ''A Collection of State Papers Relating to Affairs during the reigns of King Henry VIII, King Edward VI, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth'', ed., Samuel Haynes, (1740)] pp. 99-101; Christopher Hibbert (1990) ''The Virgin Queen''; Antonia Fraser (1992) ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII''; Alison Weir (1996) ''Children of England''; David Starkey (2000) ''Elizabeth''; Linda Porter (2010) ''Katherine the Queen''. Most biographers of Catherine, Seymour or Elizabeth refer to Catherine and Seymour tickling Elizabeth in her bed and Catherine holding down Elizabeth while her husband cut her dress into shreds. Although extant evidence does not support the notion of a fully fledged ''[[mÃ©nage Ã  trois]]'', or even that Seymour's flirtation with Elizabeth led to sexual intercourse with her, Starkey has speculated as to how such behaviour would play in front of a modern panel of social workers and paediatricians (''Elizabeth, op.cit.'') Nor is it clear from contemporaneous evidence that Catherine's &quot;pert and pretty stepdaughter&quot;, to use Starkey's description, was a wholly unwilling participant in such antics.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever actually happened, Elizabeth was sent away in May 1548 to stay with Sir Anthony Denny's household at [[Cheshunt]] and never saw her beloved stepmother again, although the two corresponded.
{{Henryviiiwives}}

Catherine gave birth to her only child â a daughter, [[Mary Seymour]], named after Catherine's stepdaughter Mary â on 30 August 1548, and died only six days later, on 5 September 1548, at [[Sudeley Castle]] in [[Gloucestershire]], from what is thought to be [[puerperal fever]] or puerperal sepsis, also called childbed fever. Coincidentally, this was also the illness that killed Henry's third wife, [[Jane Seymour]]. It was not uncommon, due to the lack of hygiene around childbirth. Nevertheless, a theory exists that Catherine's husband, Sir Thomas Seymour, may have poisoned her in order to carry out his plan to marry Lady Elizabeth Tudor.

Lord Seymour of Sudeley was beheaded for treason on 20 March 1549, and Mary Seymour was taken to live with the [[Catherine Willoughby, 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby|Dowager Duchess of Suffolk]], a close friend of Catherine's. Catherine's other jewels were kept in a coffer with five drawers at Sudeley and this was sent to the Tower of London on 20 April 1549, and her clothes and papers followed in May.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, David, ''The Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries (1998), pp. 94-96; jewel inventory of 116 items; pp. 434-437, wardrobe 133 items.&lt;/ref&gt; After a year and a half, on 17 March 1550, Mary's property was restored to her by an [[Act of Parliament]], easing the burden of the infant's household on the duchess. The last mention of Mary Seymour on record is on her second birthday, and although stories circulated that she eventually married and had children, most historians believe she died as a child at [[Grimsthorpe Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Susan, (2009), 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remains==
In 1782, a gentleman by the name of [[John Locust]] discovered the coffin of Queen Catherine at the ruins of the [[Sudeley Castle]] chapel. He opened the coffin and observed that the body, after 234 years, was in a surprisingly good condition. Reportedly the flesh on one of her arms was still white and moist. After taking a few locks of her hair, he closed the coffin and returned it to the grave.

The coffin was opened a few more times in the next ten years and in 1792 some drunken men buried it upside down and in a rough way.  When the coffin was officially reopened in 1817, nothing but a skeleton remained. Her remains were then moved to the tomb of [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Lord Chandos]] whose family owned the castle at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Sudeley Castle, ''Timeline'', 2011. [http://www.sudeleycastle.co.uk/history/timeline ''Official site'']&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb was carefully restored by order of the late Duchess of Buckingham, Lady Anne Greville, daughter of the [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos|3rd Duke of Chandos]].&lt;ref&gt;Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos: Sudeley Castle [http://www.dukesofbuckingham.org.uk/places/other/sudeley.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In later years the chapel was rebuilt by Sir John Scott and a proper altar-tomb was erected for Queen Catherine.

==Iconography==
[[Image:Catherine Parr.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Catherine Parr, once thought to depict [[Lady Jane Grey]].]]
The full length portrait of Catherine Parr by [[Master John]] in the [[National Gallery|National Portrait Gallery]] was for many years thought to represent [[Lady Jane Grey]]. The painting has recently been re-identified as Catherine Parr, with whose name it was originally associated. The full-length format was very rare in portraits of this date, and was usually used only for very important sitters. Lady Jane Grey, although of royal blood, was a relatively obscure child of eight when this was painted; it was to be another eight years before her disastrous and short-lived reign. The distinctive crown shaped jewel which the sitter wears can be traced to an inventory of jewels belonging to Catherine Parr and the cameo beads appear to have belonged to [[Catherine Howard]], from whom they would have passed to her successor as queen.&lt;ref&gt;David Williamson, ''Kings and Queens'', 2010, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clare Gittings. ''The National Portrait Gallery Book of The Tudors'', 2006, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, S.: &quot;Lady Jane Grey or Queen Kateryn Parr?&quot;, The Burlington Magazine, CXXXVIII, 1114 (January 1996), pp. 20-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
===Film and Stage===
Catherine first appeared in cinemas in 1934, in [[Alexander Korda]]'s film ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]''. [[Charles Laughton]] played the king, with actress Everley Gregg appearing as Catherine Parr.  The film makes no attempt to depict the historical Parr's character, instead portraying the Queen for comic effect as an over-protective nag.

In 1952, a romanticised version of [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]]'s obsession with [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] saw [[Stewart Granger]] as Seymour, [[Jean Simmons]] as the young Elizabeth and screen legend [[Deborah Kerr]] as Parr in the popular film ''[[Young Bess]]''.

In 1970, in &quot;Catherine Parr&quot;, a 90-minute BBC television drama (the last in a 6-part series, entitled ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'') Catherine was played by [[Rosalie Crutchley]] opposite [[Keith Michell]]'s Henry. In this, Catherine's love of religion and intellectual capabilities were highlighted. Crutchley reprised her role as Catherine Parr in Part 1 of a 6-part series on the life of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1971, called ''[[Elizabeth R]]'' with [[Glenda Jackson]] in the title role.

In 1973, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] played a matronly Catherine in ''[[Henry VIII and his Six Wives]]'', with Keith Michell once again playing Henry. In 2000, [[Jennifer Wigmore]] played Catherine Parr in the [[United States|American]] television drama aimed at teenagers, ''Elizabeth: Red Rose of the House of Tudor''. A year later, Caroline Lintott played Catherine in Professor David Starkey's documentary series on Henry's queens.

In October 2003, in a two-part British television series on ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]'', Catherine was played by [[Clare Holman]]. The part was relatively small, given that the drama's second part focused more on the stories of [[Jane Seymour]] and [[Catherine Howard]].

In March 2007, [[Washington University in St. Louis]] performed the [[A.E. Hotchner]] Playwriting Competition winner &quot;Highness&quot; which documents the life of Catherine Parr and her relationships with King Henry and his daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth I, to whom she was a [[stepmother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://news-info.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/8996.html | title=Performing Arts Department to debut Highness by Carolyn Kras 29 March to April 1  | last=Otten | first=Liam | publisher=The Record | date=2007-03-15 | accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been the subject of several novels, including two entitled ''The Sixth Wife,'' and she is a supporting character in both the fourth and fifth ''Matthew Shardlake mystery'', ''[[Revelation (C. J. Sansom novel)|Revelation]]'' and ''[[Heartstone (Sansom novel)|Heartstone]].''

She was portrayed by actress [[Joely Richardson]] on the fourth and final season of Showtimeâs ''[[The Tudors]]'', which was first broadcast in Spring 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/07/tudors-exclusive-joely-richardson-crowned-queen.html | title='Tudors' exclusive: Joely Richardson crowned Queen by Michael Ausiello | date=2009-07-21 | accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine features in ''The Dark Rose'', Volume 2 of [[The Morland Dynasty]] a series of historical novels by author [[Cynthia Harrod-Eagles]]. The lead female character, Nanette Morland, is educated alongside Catherine and is later re-acquainted with her when she becomes Queen.

===Music===
*[[Rick Wakeman]] recorded the piece &quot;Catherine Parr&quot; for his 1973 album, ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''. On his [[The Six Wives of Henry VIII Live at Hampton Court Palace|2009 live version of the album]] the track's spelling is changed to &quot;Katherine Parr&quot;.

==Historiography==
The popular myth that Catherine acted more as her husband's nurse than his wife was born in the 19th century from the work of Victorian moralist and proto-feminist, [[Agnes Strickland]]. This assumption has been challenged by [[David Starkey]] in his book ''Six Wives'' in which he points out that such a situation would have been vaguely obscene to the Tudors, given that Henry had a huge staff of physicians waiting on him hand and foot, and Catherine was a woman expected to live up to the heavy expectations of Queenly dignity. Parr is usually portrayed in cinema and television by actresses who are much older than the queen, who was in her early 30s when she was Henry's wife and was about 36 years old at the time of her death.

Catherine's good sense, moral rectitude, compassion, firm religious commitment, and strong sense of loyalty and devotion have earned her many admirers among historians. These include [[David Starkey]], feminist activist [[Karen Lindsey]], [[Lady Antonia Fraser]], [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]], [[Carolly Erickson]], [[Alison Plowden]] and Susan James and Linda Porter. Biographers have described her as strong-willed and outspoken, physically desirable, susceptible (like Queen Elizabeth) to roguish charm, and even willing to resort to quite obscene language if the occasion suited.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Susan James (2008) ''Katherine Parr''; Linda Porter (2010) ''Katherine the Queen''; Porter, ''History Today'', April 2010, pp 17-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Catherine Parr's writings are available from the [[Women Writers Project]].
