'''APT-RPM''' is a version of the [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] modified to work with the [[RPM Package Manager]]. It was originally ported to RPM by Alfredo Kojima and then further developed and improved by Gustavo Niemeyer, both working for the [[Conectiva]] [[Linux distribution]] at the time.

In March 2005 the maintainer of the program, [http://www.niemeyer.net/ Gustavo Niemeyer], announced that he would not continue developing it and that he would instead focus on [[Smart Package Manager]], which was planned as a successor to APT-RPM.

In March 2006 development was picked up again by [http://laiskiainen.org/ Panu Matilainen] from [[Red Hat]] at a [http://apt-rpm.org/ new home], introducing basic [[multilib]] functionality and support for [http://linux.duke.edu/projects/metadata common repository metadata].
