==History==
{{Main|History of Oregon State University}}

===Early years===
[[Image:Oregon State University clock tower.jpg|thumb|upright|OSU's Bell Tower]]&lt;/small&gt;
The university's roots date back to 1856, when '''Corvallis Academy''', the area's first community school for primary and preparatory education, was founded.  In 1858, the school's name was changed to '''Corvallis College''' and formally incorporated by members of the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2007/05/26/news/community/2loc10_munford.txt|title=Fraternal orders shaped Corvallis; Gazette Times; By Ken Munford; May 25, 2007, 2007|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2007/08/11/news/community/2loc06_munford.txt|title=Town, university have symbiotic relationship; Gazette Times; By Ken Munford; August 10, 2007|accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school offered its first college-level curriculum in 1865, under the administration of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]].

On August 22, 1868, official Articles of Incorporation were filed for Corvallis College. October 27, 1868, is known as OSU Charter Day, the day that the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] designated Corvallis College as the Agricultural College of the state of Oregon and the recipient of [[Land-grant university|Land Grant]] fund income. As part of this designation, the college was required to comply with the requirements set forth in the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|First Morrill Act]]. The name was changed to '''Corvallis State Agricultural College''' and was then authorized to grant the [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], and [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degrees. The first graduating class was in 1870, granting [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees.

===Oregon Agricultural College===
[[Image:Style show at Multnomah Hotel in Portland Oregon 1920.jpg|thumb|OAC Home Ec department at [[Multnomah Hotel]] in Portland, 1920]]
In 1890 the college became known as '''Oregon Agricultural College (OAC)'''. Orange was adopted as the school color, with black as the background. The [[Olmsted Brothers]] developed the first Campus Master Plan in 1909, emphasizing trees and an architectural harmony showcasing basic classical forms in brick. The current campus design generally follows this original plan and is laid on a grid of wide, tree-lined streets. Well-partitioned buildings accent open lawns along the main passages and are mostly surrounded by clusters of tall trees. The overall scheme gives it a quaint, early American institutional feel common to campuses found in the Midwest or Southern U.S. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The Division of College Extension was organized in 1911 with Ralph Dorn Hetzel as director and, in 1912, the first off-campus faculty were placed in Marion and Wallowa counties. The [[United States Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] became active in 1917, replacing the original Cadet Corps formed by students studying [[Military Science]]. In 1919, OAC began a horticultural products processing program, the first of its kind in the United States. Accreditation was granted in 1924 by the [[Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools]].

===Oregon State===
[[Image:Irish Bend Covered Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irish Bend Covered Bridge]] - The west side of campus is dedicated, primarily, to agricultural research. It is also home to this historic landmark.]]
1927 marked yet another name change, this time to Oregon State Agricultural College. The Oregon Unification Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly in 1929 placed the school under the oversight of the newly formed [[Oregon State Board of Higher Education]]. Doctoral education was first provided in 1935 with the conferral of four [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees. This year also saw the creation of the first summer session. The growing diversity in degree programs offered led to another name change in 1937, when the college became '''Oregon State College'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSU_1920_chron&quot;&gt;[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/archives/chronology/chron_1920.html Chronological history of Oregon State University - 1920 to 1929]. Accessed 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's current title, '''Oregon State University,''' was adopted on March 6, 1961 by a legislative act signed into law by Governor [[Mark Hatfield]].

In 2007, Scott Reed was named the Vice Provost for Outreach and Engagement as OSU Extension Service and [[Oregon State University Extended Campus|OSU Extended Campus]] were aligned under this new division.

The 2005 [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]] recognized Oregon State as a &quot;Comprehensive Doctoral with Medical/Veterinary&quot; university. This is one of only three such universities in the [[Pacific Northwest]] to be classified in this category. In 2006, Carnegie also recognized the university as having &quot;Very High Research Activity,&quot; which makes OSU the only university in Oregon to attain these combined classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/events/newsevents/carnegie.html Information about Oregon State University], oregonstate.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sea Grant Colleges|National Sea Grant College Program]] was founded in the 1960s. OSU is one of the original four Sea Grant Colleges selected in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistSeaGrant&quot;&gt;[http://www.seagrant.noaa.gov/aboutsg/historyofsg.html History of Sea Grant], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the [[OSU Radiation Center|Radiation Center]] was constructed at the edge of campus, housing a 1.1 [[megawatt|MW]] [[TRIGA]] Mark II Research [[Nuclear reactor|Reactor]]. The reactor is equipped to utilize [[Enriched uranium#Highly enriched uranium .28HEU.29|Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU)]] for fuel. Rankings published by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' in 2008 placed Oregon State eighth in the nation in graduate [[nuclear engineering]].

OSU was one of the early members of the federal [[Space grant colleges|Space Grant]] program.&lt;ref&gt; [http://spacegrant.oregonstate.edu/history-oregon-nasa-space-grant-consortium History of the Oregon NASA Space Grant Consortium], orst.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Designated in 1991, the additional grant program made Oregon State one of only 13 schools in the United States to serve as a combined [[Land-grant university|Land Grant]], Sea Grant, and Space Grant university. Most recently, OSU was designated as a federal [[Sun Grant Colleges|Sun Grant]] institution. The designation, made in 2003, now makes Oregon State one of only two such universities (the other being [[Cornell University]]), and the only public institution with all four designations.

In 1999, OSU finished a $40 million remodel to the campus library. Known as the [[Valley Library]], the totally remodeled building was selected by ''[[The Library Journal]]'' as their 1999 Library of the Year, the first academic library so named.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ranking&quot; /&gt;

In 2001, the university's Wave Research Laboratory was designated by the [[National Science Foundation]] as a site for tsunami research under the Network for [[Earthquake engineering|Earthquake Engineering]] Simulation. The [[O. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory]] is located on the edge of the campus and is one of the largest and most sophisticated laboratories for education, research, and testing in coastal, ocean and related areas in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRL-aboutus&quot;&gt;[http://wave.oregonstate.edu/About_Us/ About Us: O.

The city that Oregon State University calls home is the tenth largest city in the state. Still, [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]] is a relatively small community and many of the local events have a strong connection to the university. Oregon State has over 300 active student organizations and groups, the most of any university in the [[Oregon University System]]. The campus is located only a few hours driving distance from any number of outdoor recreation opportunities. Several federal and state natural forests and parks make up popular student destinations. These include the [[Cascade Range]], a rugged coastline, several large forests, a desert, and many rivers. [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon's largest city, is {{convert|85|mi|km|0}} north of the campus.

From 1930&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer_full.php?CISOROOT=/EAD&amp;CISOPTR=460&amp;REC=8#c01_18 Oregon State University Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; until 1968, Oregon State University was home to the Gamma chapter of [[Phrateres]], a philanthropic-social organization for female college students. Gamma was the third chapter of the organization, which eventually had over 20 chapters in [[Canada]] and the United States.

The majority of older students at Oregon State University live off-campus, but on-campus housing is available and typically home to incoming freshmen. There are 14 residence halls on campus, which are organized into individual Hall Councils. Residents make up the membership and each council holds their own elections to select management over the hall government. All of the councils are managed by the Residence Hall Association (RHA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/dept/rha/ Residence Hall Association], oregonstate.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The LaSells Stewart Center]] is the conference and performing arts center for the campus. Many famous speakers have graced the stage of the campus' main auditorium, [[Austin Auditorium]], while the [[Corvallis-OSU Symphony]] plays there frequently. The OSU Office of Conferences and Special Events is located within the auditorium.

The University is host to a radio station, [[KBVR (FM)|KBVR 88.7 FM]], a television station, [[KBVR]] TV 26, and an award-winning student newspaper, ''[[The Daily Barometer]].''

Two Oregon State students are members of the [[Oregon Student Association]] Board of Directors.

In a 2008 national ranking based on academics, athletic opportunity and overall performance, Oregon State was chosen as one of the &quot;premier&quot; universities in America. This ranking, performed by [[Stack magazine|''STACK'' magazine]], places Oregon State 29th in the nation's &quot;Elite 50&quot; universities and uncontested within the state that year.&lt;ref name=Elite50&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=132308| work=Stack |title=Elite 50|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the University of Oregon has joined Oregon State in the STACK rankings.

The history of Oregon State athletics dates back to 1893, when &quot;Jimmie the [[Coyote]]&quot; was chosen as the college's mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;alumni-mascothistory&quot;&gt;[http://alumni.oregonstate.edu/eclips/history/sportshistory05.html Part 5 of 20: A History of Athletic Mascots at Oregon State University], oregonstate.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced by the [[American Beaver|beaver]] in 1910; it has remained the school's mascot. In 1915, the college became one of the four charter members of the [[Pacific Coast Conference|Pacific Coast (Athletic) Conference]].

[[American football|Football]] is played in [[Reser Stadium]]. The current costumed mascot [[Benny Beaver|Benny the Beaver]] made his first appearance in 1952. The next year, 1953, saw the opening of the football facility, Parker Stadium (now named [[Reser Stadium]]). The Raising Reser campaign expanded the stadium from 35,000 seats to 46,200 throughout 2006â07. A [[time lapse]] video recording of the expansion is viewable on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcam.oregonstate.edu/reser1/ Reser Stadium construction], oregonstate.edu&lt;/ref&gt; 1962 saw OSU's (and the west coast's) first [[Heisman Trophy]] winner, quarterback [[Terry Baker]]. The [[University of Oregon]] is often seen as the school's key athletic rival, with the annual [[Civil War (college football game)|Civil War]] football game between the two teams being one of the nation's longest-lived rivalries.

[[Trysting Tree]] is the name of Oregon State's golf course, dedicated in 1988, the tournament level course has been recognized by ''[[Golfweek]]'' magazine as one of the top five collegiate golf courses on the West Coast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Its name is traced to a tree near Benton Hall where student couples would meet and make dates. [[Basketball]] is held in [[Gill Coliseum]], named after former Beavers coach [[Slats Gill]]. The [[Civil War (college rivalry)|Civil War]] is one of the most contested rivalries in the nation. [[Baseball]] is held in [[Goss Stadium at Coleman Field]].

Opened in April 2001, the $1.5 million dollar OSU Softball Complex seats 750.

Oregon State has a total of three [[NCAA]] championships. In addition to the two baseball titles, the Beavers won the 1961 [[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship]]. In 1975, the men's [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] Varsity-4 with coxswain team won the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] National Collegiate Rowing Championships in [[Syracuse, New York]], establishing a course record which stood for 15 years.&lt;ref name=osurow&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/index.aspx?sid=359&amp;gid=1&amp;verbiagebuilder=1&amp;pgid=400|publisher=OSU Alumni Association|title=The Year was 1975|accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 and 2008, the Oregon State racquetball team won the USA [[racquetball]] intercollegiate championship.&lt;ref name=osur&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.oregonracquetball.org/Portals/9/High%20School/OSU%20Wins%20Championships.pdf|format=PDF|title=Oregon State University Captures National Racquetball Title|date=April 2, 2006|publisher=Oregon High School Racquetball League|accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oregon State University is home to the oldest [[marching band]] in the [[Pacific-12 Conference|Pac-12]].

OSU football coach Mike Riley credits the marching band with 10 points at each home game and 6 at each away game.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Diversity==
