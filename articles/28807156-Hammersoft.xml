Since that time, various campus plans and architectural styles have been utilized. Today the campus consists of 156 acres and is bordered to the east by [[Mount Sentinel]] and the north by the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork River]].  The main campus comprises 64 buildings, a 23,500-seat football stadium and nine residence halls.

Constructed in 1922 following the 1918 Carsley-Gilbert campus master plan, this womenâs residence was intended to be part of two U-shaped clusters of menâs and womenâs dormitories. Its identical contemporary counterpart, Elrod Hall, and Corbin Hall were the only three buildings of the two âUâs erected before the plan was abandoned in the 1930s. Renowned Helena architects J. G. Link and C. S. Haire designed the handsome Renaissance Revival style facility with its striking red-brown brick faÃ§ade and simple cream-colored terra cotta ornamentation. Renamed Brantly Hall, the building functioned as a womenâs residence until 1987.

The construction of this womenâs residence hall, completed in 1927, marks the end of an era. It was the last building erected in strict accordance with the Carsley-Gilbert campus master plan and placed within the intended U-shaped dormitory arrangement. George Carsley and Missoula architect C. J. Forbis collaborated on the design of this Renaissance Revival style building. It was to be Carsleyâs last contribution to the campus and one of the last of his prolific career. Red-brown brick, cream-colored terra cotta, and green Spanish roof tile mirror the features of Brantly Hall, but the omission of a horizontal line on the third story visually diminishes their differences in size.

Fronting the Oval at the heart of the campus, the universityâs oldest standing building, also known as Main Hall, proudly represents the birth of this noble institution. Celebrated Missoula architect A. J. Gibson designed the Richardsonian Romanesque style building that, along with its now-demolished companion Science Hall, comprised the campus at the schoolâs opening in 1899. During the universityâs dedication ceremony in 1898, corn, oil, and water symbolizing plenty, joy, and peace were poured over the buildingâs cornerstone. Today the hourly chiming of the bells in the majestic bell tower serves as constant reminder of the enduring solidity of the university.

===Aber Hall===
*Built 1967
*Named after ''William M. &quot;Daddy&quot; Aber'' -
Member of the university's original five-person faculty
*abv. '''DABE'''

Aber Hall is a smoke-free, 11-story residence hall. Floors 2-10 house about 40 students on each floor. Each floor is L-shaped and occupied by students of the same sex. Elevators and stairs serve all floors. Aber Hall attracts students with a variety of interests in recreation (both intramural and outdoor activities) and wellness programs. A basement recreation room and facilities located just outside the building, such as tennis courts, an outdoor basketball court, and volleyball court, make Aber the perfect place for students interested in wellness. The Grizzly Pool, Washington-Grizzly stadium, The Rec Center, and trailhead to the &quot;M&quot; are also nearby.

===Craig Hall===
''(The University of Montana Historic District Contributing Property)''
*Built 1952
*Named after ''Oscar J. Craig'',
University's first president
*abv. '''DCRA'''
Construction of this womenâs residence, dedicated in 1903, attests to Montanaâs early commitment to coeducation. Architect A. J. Gibson chose the simple, elegant Second Renaissance Revival style for his third campus building. Deviating from the specifications of the original campus master plan, the building faces the end, rather than the center of the Oval. Room and board could be had for eighteen dollars a month with space for seventy-two students. Renamed Craig Hall in 1911 after first university president Oscar Craig, the building also housed the schoolâs first two sororities. When a new womenâs dormitory opened in 1924, Craig Hall was extensively remodeled for classroom use.

The hall is situated at the south end of the campus. Craig Hall is T-shaped and very popular due to its larger rooms. Triple, double and single rooms are available throughout Craig's four floors, each of which is divided into three wings. The bottom two floors house males and the upper two floors house females. A resident assistant and approximately 30 residents are located on each wing.

===Duniway Hall===
*Built 1957
*Named after ''Clyde Augustus Duniway'',
University's second president
*abv. '''DDUN'''

All of the rooms are used as double rooms.
There are four floors in the hall, two of which are occupied by females. Each floor has 2 resident assistants and houses about 60 students. Duniway Hall connects Craig and Elrod Hall and residents of Duniway share Elrod's facilities.

===Elrod Hall===
''(The University of Montana Historic District Contributing Property)''
Originally ''South Hall''
*Built 1921
*Named after ''Dr. Morton J. Elrod'',
esteemed professor
*abv. '''DELR'''
The first menâs residence on campus renamed Elrod Hall, opened in 1923 with seventy student rooms. Like its near-twin Brantly Hall, the facility was originally intended to be part of two U-shaped residential complexes. The Helena architectural firm of Link and Haire drew the blueprints for the Renaissance Revival style hall, which reflects the exuberance of spirit in campus buildings constructed under the Carsley-Gilbert campus master plan. Each floor is organized into horizontal divisions typical of the style. Red-brown brick, cream-colored terra cotta, and green Spanish roof tile label the building part of the Carsley-Gilbert group.

Elrod houses 109 male students on four floors. Due to the rooms having sinks and the availability of single rooms, Elrod is one of the more popular halls on campus. Elrod Hall is a smoke-free residence hall connected to Duniway Hall. Students living in Duniway Hall share Elrod's facilities.

===Jesse Hall===
*Built 1967
*Named after ''Dr. Richard H. Jesse'', First Dean of Men
*abv. '''DJES'''

The hall is an 11-story high-rise located on the west edge of campus. Jesse Hall is a twin to Aber Hall. The L-shaped floors are occupied by students of the same sex and an elevator provides easy access to all floors. Except for the first and eleventh floors, each floor accommodates 40 students.  It was built with the same layout as Aber Hall.

===Knowles Hall===
*Built 1963
*Named after ''Eloise Knowles'',
One of the first two graduates of the University of Montana
*abv. '''DKNO'''

Knowles Hall, located directly north of the Lommasson Center, is a four-story residence hall housing 260 students. Each floor is divided into two wings, one of which is occupied by males and the other by females. An elevator provides easy access to all floors. Knowles Hall is a smoke-free building and very popular because of its central location. Spaces are reserved in Knowles for International students and members of the Honors College. The fourth floor is designated Substance-Free. The floor's residents sign a contract stating they will not possess, use or be under the influence of alcohol or illicit substances within the living environment.  This option is becoming very popular and rooms fill up quickly.

===Miller Hall===
*Built 1965 renovated 1996
*Named after ''J. Earl &quot;Burly&quot; Miller'',
dean of men for two decades
*abv. '''DMIL'''

Miller's renovation, completed in 1996, made substantial changes not only to the interior but also the exterior of the building creating additional single-living spaces that have proven popular with UM students.
Miller Hall has a capacity of 326 students living in either three bed suites (96), single penthouse rooms (40) or regular double rooms (190), sharing bathroom facilities located on each wing.
The suites consist of three bed rooms (approximately 8' X 10') entering into a shared living space. The penthouse rooms are located on the &quot;fifth&quot; floor, which is tucked under a peaked roof with each room having a gabled window. The rooms are furnished with moveable furniture allowing some flexibility in living space arrangements. Each floor is divided into two wings, each wing being occupied by a different sex.

===Pantzer Hall===
*Built 1995
*Named after ''Robert Pantzer'',
UM's president from 1966â1973
*abv. '''DPAN'''

Located on the southwest side of campus, creating a plaza with Elrod/Duniway and Miller Halls, Pantzer Hall has a capacity of 201 with 184 of the assignments within four-person suites. There are also 8 single rooms with private bathrooms available.
Each suite has four private bedrooms, two bathrooms, common living room, storage closet, refrigerator and microwave oven. During the academic year, weekly custodial service is provided for the bathroom areas. Included in each room are cable TV and High-Speed internet ports.  Each room is also wired for phone services should the residents choose to opt in to this service.  Pantzer Hall is accessible to students with disabilities. Parking, outdoor basketball and volleyball courts are nearby.

===Turner Hall===

The placement of this womenâs residence hall prohibited further development of a womenâs U-shaped dormitory complex as outlined by the Carsley-Gilbert campus master plan of the previous decade. Architects H. E. Kirkemo of Missoula and J. Van Teylingen of Great Falls designed the building, completed in 1939, in the Renaissance Revival-inspired style outlined by the older plan. Yet the architects were not to be bound by Renaissance Revival. Liberal modern touches such as a towered entryway and asymmetrically placed windows deny emphasis of the older style, and suggest the subtle encroachment of Art Deco ideas. The former womenâs residence, renamed Turner Hall, now houses offices.

Turner Hall, originally called New Hall, was built in 1939. In 1956, the hall was renamed in honor of Mrs. Belle B. Turner, who served as a dorm mother in Craig, Corbin, and New Halls.
Located at the center of campus, Turner Hall offers double rooms with a sink in each room. The larger rooms, which average 14'9&quot; X 11'2&quot;, make the hall an attractive facility for women. The smoke-free hall has four levels and houses 116 women. The Dell Brown Room is a very attractive lounge on the first floor, which many students enjoy.

Red-brown brick, cream terra cotta, and huge Tudor style windows belie the utilitarian function of this lofty building. Missoula architects Ole Bakke and Clarence Forbis ingeniously applied the Renaissance Revival style of other contemporary campus buildings, completing the plant in 1922. The smokestack, boilers, mechanical works, and the tall coal-storage structure tucked onto the buildingâs east side were designed by the engineering firm of Charles L. Pillsbury Company of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Though situated just outside the edge of the plan designed by Carsley and Gilbert, the buildingâs design makes an important contribution to the overall quality of the universityâs historic architecture.

Missoula architect C. J. Forbis ushered in a new campus building phase in 1935 with the construction of this student union. The buildingâs placement and modern Art Deco faÃ§ade broke ranks with the Renaissance Revival style called for in the old Carsley-Gilbert campus master plan. The old plan had contained no such facility, and the new building was sited contrary to the previous symmetrical campus arrangement. Partially funded by Public Works Administration funds so important to the university during the Depression, in concept and form the building provided an architectural statement of renewed vigor and growth. It now serves as the Fine Arts Building.

This enduring landmark was the fifth and final contribution to the campus by renowned Missoula architect A. J. Gibson. A work of exquisite craftsmanship and the universityâs only example of Neo-classical architecture, the dramatic classical portico on the front of the building is typical of this style, which peaked during the early twentieth century. The interior was extensively remodeled in 1923 to accommodate the University Law School, and again in 1961 to house the Psychology Department. In 1983, the building was renamed Rankin Hall after 1902 graduate Jeannette Rankin, the first United States congresswoman.

Completion of this facility in 1922 provided the School of Forestry a permanent home. In the Renaissance Revival style specified by Carsley-Gilbertâs master plan, Missoula architect Ole Bakke designed a distinctive building that vividly proclaims its discipline. Simple lines enhance the beautiful green pine and ax emblem repeated in terra cotta thirty-seven times around the building. Murals within depicting the history of forestry in Montana by Helena artist Irvin âShortyâ Shope further individualize this unique facility. The buildingâs only significant alteration is a greenhouse added in 1951, named in memory of six students who perished fighting the 1949 Mann Gulch fire.

A Public Works Administration loan and bonds funded the construction of this facility, completed in 1939. Architects R. C. Hugenin of Butte and Norman DeKay of Helena designed the distinctive building amidst criticism over the unusual mixing of styles. The rusticated red-brown brick and horizontal division between the first and second floors are elements of the Renaissance Revival style seen in earlier campus buildings. A central projecting pavilion, however, reminiscent of Beaux Arts Classicism, interrupts the faÃ§ade with a vertical focus. Even though an animal laboratory (1951) and skywalk (1981) have been added to the building, the faÃ§ade retains its original appearance.

Architects designing campus buildings between 1935 and 1939 were faced with a dilemma. Should they choose the Renaissance Revival style of most previous campus buildings or opt for the modern designs prevailing throughout the nation? In a compromise, three of the five buildings constructed during this phase allude to the previous style, but the Student Union and this building proudly illustrate the modern Art Deco architectural movement. Very simple in design, the building features a flat roof, windows framed in terra cotta, and a stepped parapet. Completed in 1937, the building was financed by the Womanâs Club of Missoula and the PWA. It originally served as a clubhouse and art building housing the first art museum in the inland Northwest. Later occupied by the Alumni Association, the building now accommodates Continuing Education and the Womanâs Club of Missoula.

The first building added to the campus after 1908 was this facility, which housed the most modern equipment for all branches of life science research, including a stereopticon and motion picture apparatus. Begun in 1917 and completed in 1919, it was the first of eight campus buildings designed according to the new Carsley-Gilbert master plan, which inspired ordered expansion of the University. Architects McIver, Cohagen, and Marshall of Billings chose the Renaissance Revival style thus setting the standard for the remaining Carsley-Gilbert plan buildings added between 1922 and 1927. In 1977, the facility was renamed the Botany Building in honor of its sole remaining occupant.

This 1938 addition to the Renaissance Revival style Botany Building (formerly Natural Science) offers an excellent example of the importance of Public Works Administration funds during the Depression Era to the expansion of the University of Montana. The U-shaped annex of brick and glass originally contained a fully equipped botanical laboratory, experimental animal rooms, and a greenhouse. Equipped now solely for use by the Botany Department, the annex, with its red-brown exterior and hipped roof, was carefully designed to be architecturally compatible with the older building.

Dean Arthur Stone pitched four tents near the Oval in 1914, thereby founding the Universityâs School of Journalism. An old bicycle shed and later World War I army barracks served as quarters for this discipline, then considered ânon-essential.â After a long struggle, the Public Works Administration appropriated building funds. Architects R. C. Hugenin of Butte and Norman DeKay of Helena designed the 1937 Renaissance Revival-inspired building, adding liberal modern touches and asymmetrically placed windows. Home of the university newspaper, The Kaimin, and dedicated to Dean Stone, this building represents the hard-won acceptance of journalism as an academic discipline.

Helena architect George Carsley and New York architect Cass Gilbert designed the campus master plan implemented between 1918 and 1927. Although Carsley continued as consultant on other buildings erected under the plan, this 1922 gymnasium is the only university building that he designed exclusively. It is also the only one of the group deviating from the Renaissance Revival style Gilbert and Carsley specified. Strong vertical emphasis, blocky massing, and stylized decoration characterize this early expression of the Art Deco style, while materials used in construction visually conform to other Carsley-Gilbert campus buildings. Renamed Schreiber Gym, the facility now houses ROTC.

Of the eight campus buildings constructed on the Carsley-Gilbert master plan, the library appropriately best expresses the Renaissance Revival style. Billings architects McIver and Cohagen designed this architectural gem with its Spanish tile roof, simple terra cotta ornamentation, and distinctive windows, symbolizing in form and function the heart of the University. In 1955, a four-story utilitarian addition and division of the lofty reading room on the second story into two floors expanded the space. A new library opened in 1974 and the building changed in function, but its stately presence remains the symbolic heart of campus.

===Alumni Center===

Architects designing campus buildings between 1935 and 1939 were faced with a dilemma. Should they choose the Renaissance Revival style of most previous campus buildings or should they opt for the modern designs prevailing throughout the nation? In a compromise, three of the five buildings constructed during this phase allude to the previous style, but the Student Union and the Alumni Center proudly illustrate the modern Art Deco architectural movement.

The building now houses Continuing Education.

===The Oval===
''(The University of Montana Historic District Contributing Property)''
*Created 1896

Professor Frederick Scheuch and first university President Oscar Craig created the original campus master plan in 1895. The plan specified that the entrances of all immediate and future campus buildings were to face the center of a large oval. Ovals were a formal element commonly used in landscape design of the late nineteenth century, especially on academic campuses. Although only Main Hall and Science Hall (razed in 1984) were placed exactly according to the Craig-Scheuch plan, the beautifully landscaped Oval, surrounded by its eclectic collection of early buildings, remains a focal point of the campus.

===Prescott House===
''(The University of Montana Historic District Contributing Property)''
*Built 1898

Prominent state legislator and county commissioner Charles R. Prescott homesteaded here in 1891, planting a vast orchard of plum, cherry, pear, and apple trees. In 1898, Prescott replaced his original log dwelling with this beautiful Queen Anne style residence. The home was patterned after the childhood home of Prescottâs wife Julia, a schoolteacher, who had come to Montana from Pennsylvania in 1880. Today the Prescott homestead is one of the few remaining links to the agricultural foundations of Missoula. The property was owned by the family until 1955 when the University of Montana purchased the Prescott acreage. Son Clarence Prescott, Jr., was then granted life tenancy of the house and {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}}.
