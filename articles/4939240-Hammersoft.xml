The special features include [[deleted scenes]], [[storyboards]]/[[animatic]]s, and commentaries. 

This is the first season release following the series of five Simpson family member shaped boxes. The character-themed packaging continues and, as with those seasons, this set was released in two different packagings: A &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; plastic packaging molded to look like [[Krusty the Clown]]'s head, and a standard rectangular cardboard box featuring Krusty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Simpsons-Complete-11th-Season-Limited-Edition-Krusty-Head/8086 |title=The Simpsons - The Complete 11th Season (Lisa Head) |accessdate=2009-04-11 |publisher=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous seasons, the Collector's Edition packaging is a removable molded face attached to a cardboard sleeve, as opposed to a fully plastic clamshell. Both versions have changed from a [[digipak]] style of disc tray in previous seasons, to an accordion-style series of cardboard sleeves into which the discs slide. Following the release of the set there were a number of complaints regarding the style of packaging; David Lambert of [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]] described the set as &quot;functionally defective.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Simpsons - Editorial: Season 11: Worst...
