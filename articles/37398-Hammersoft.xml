}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded on October 16, 1923, by [[Walt Disney|Walt]] and [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]] Disney as the '''Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio''', Walt Disney Productions established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and travel. Taking on its current name in 1986, The Walt Disney Company expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theatre, radio, [[publishing]], and [[online media]]. In addition, it has created new divisions of the company in order to market more mature content than it typically associates with its flagship family-oriented brands.

The company is best known for the products of its film studio, the [[Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group]], and today one of the [[Major film studio|largest and best-known studios]] in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. Disney also owns and operates the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast television network; cable television networks such as [[Disney Channel]], [[ESPN]], and [[ABC Family]]; [[publishing]], [[merchandising]], and theatre divisions; and owns and licenses [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|14 theme parks around the world]]. The company has been a component of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] since May 6, 1991. An early and well-known cartoon creation of the company, [[Mickey Mouse]], is the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company.

==Corporate history==
{{See also|Timeline of The Walt Disney Company}}

===1923â1928: The silent era===
In early 1923, [[Kansas City, Missouri]] animator Walt Disney created a short film entitled ''[[Alice's Wonderland]]'', which featured child actress [[Virginia Davis]] interacting with animated characters. Film distributor [[Margaret J. Winkler]] contacted Disney with plans to distribute a whole series of ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' based upon ''Alice's Wonderland''. The contract signed, Walt and his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]] moved to Los Angeles. On October 16, 1923, they officially set up shop in their uncle Robert Disney's garage, marking the beginning of the '''Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;corporate.disney.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/corporate/complete_history_1.html |title=Company History }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few months, the company moved into the back of a realty office in downtown Los Angeles, where production continued on the ''Alice Comedies'' until 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;studioservices.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://studioservices.go.com/disneystudios/history.html |title=The Walt Disney Studio History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the studio moved to a newly constructed studio facility on Hyperion Avenue in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] district of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;studioservices.go.com&quot;/&gt;

After the demise of the ''Alice'' comedies, Disney developed an all-cartoon series starring his first original character, [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], which was distributed by Winkler Pictures through [[Universal Pictures]]. Disney only completed 26 ''Oswald'' shorts before losing the contract in February 1928, when Winkler's husband [[Charles Mintz]] took over their distribution company. Mintz hired away all of Disney's animators except [[Ub Iwerks]] to start his own animation studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;corporate.disney.go.com&quot;/&gt;

===1928â1934: Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies===
[[File:Silly symphony.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Original poster for ''Flowers and Trees'' (1932)]]
In 1928, to recover from the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Walt Disney and [[Ub Iwerks]] created [[Mickey Mouse]]. Disney's first sound film ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', a cartoon starring Mickey, was released on November 18, 1928. It was the third Mickey Mouse cartoon, behind ''[[Plane Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''. It was also the first cartoon to feature [[sound film|synchronized sound]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1928/steamboatwillie.html Disneyshorts.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Disney used [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers']] Cinephone system, created by Powers using [[Lee De Forest]]'s [[Phonofilm]] system. ''Steamboat Willie'' premiered at B. S. Moss's Colony Theater in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shubertorganization.com/theatres/broadway.asp Broadway Theater Broadway | The Shubert Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; now [[The Broadway Theatre]].

Disney continued to produce cartoons with Mickey Mouse and other characters, and began the [[Silly Symphonies]] series, which was advertised as &quot;Mickey Mouse Presents a Walt Disney Silly Symphony&quot;. In 1932, Disney signed an exclusive contract with [[Technicolor]] (through the end of 1935) to produce cartoons in color, beginning with ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' (1932). Disney released cartoons through Powers' Celebrity Pictures (1928â1930), [[Columbia Pictures]] (1930â1932), and [[United Artists]] (1932â1937). The popularity of the Mickey Mouse series and the Silly Symphony series allowed Disney to plan for his first feature-length animation.

===1934â1945: ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' and World War II===
[[File:Disney's honorary award for snow white.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The honorary [[Academy Award]] given to Walt Disney for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.]]
Deciding to push the boundaries of animation even further, Disney began production of his first feature-length animated film in 1934. Taking three years to complete, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', based upon the [[Grimm Brothers]]' fairy tale, premiered in December 1937 and became highest-grossing film of that time by 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;GablerBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Gabler|first= Neal|year= 2007|title= Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|location= New York |publisher=Random House|isbn= 0-679-75747-3|pages= 276â277}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Snow White'' was released through [[RKO Radio Pictures]], which had assumed distribution of Disney's product in July 1937,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1937.htm |title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company | publisher=islandnet.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; after United Artists attempted to attain future television rights to the Disney shorts.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Cinema: Man &amp; Mouse| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758747-5,00.html|work=TIME |accessdate=May 17, 2010|date=December 27, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the profits from ''Snow White'', Disney financed the construction of a new {{convert|51|acre|m2|adj=on}} studio complex in [[Burbank, California]]. The new [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], in which the company is headquartered to this day, was completed and open for business by the end of 1939. The following year, Walt Disney Productions had its [[initial public offering]].

The studio continued releasing animated shorts and features, such as ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942). After World War II began, box-office profits declined. When the United States entered the war after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], many of Disney's animators were drafted into the armed forces. The U.S. and Canadian governments commissioned the studio to produce training and propaganda films. By 1942 90% of its 550 employees were working on war-related films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iU4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Walt Disney Goes to War | work=Life | date=1942-08-31 | accessdate=November 20, 2011 | pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as the feature ''[[Victory Through Air Power]]'' and the short ''[[Education for Death]]'' (both 1943) were meant to increase public support for the war effort. Even the studio's characters joined the effort, as Donald Duck appeared in a number of comical propaganda shorts, including the Academy Award-winning ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1943).

===1946â1954: Post-war and television===
With limited staff and little operating capital during and after the war, Disney's feature films during much of the 1940s were &quot;package films,&quot; or collections of shorts, such as ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944) and ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948), which performed poorly at the box-office. At the same time, the studio began producing live-action films and documentaries. ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946) and ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1948) featured animated segments, while the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series, which included such films as ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Vanishing Prairie]]'' (1954), were also popular and won numerous awards.

The release of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' in 1950 proved that feature-length animation could still succeed in the marketplace. Other releases of the period included ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951) and ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), both in production before the war began, and Disney's first all-live action feature, ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1950). Other early all-live-action Disney films included ''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952),''[[The Sword and the Rose]]'' (1953), and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954). Disney ended its distribution contract with RKO in 1953, forming its own distribution arm, [[Buena Vista Distribution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

In December 1950, Walt Disney Productions and [[The Coca-Cola Company]] teamed up for Disney's first venture into television, the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] television network special ''An Hour in Wonderland''. In October 1954, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network launched Disney's first regular television series, ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]]'', which would go on to become one of the [[List of longest running U.S. primetime television series|longest-running primetime series]] of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/corporate/complete_history_2.html |title= Company history (continued)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Disneyland'' allowed Disney a platform to introduce new projects and broadcast older ones, and ABC became Disney's partner in the financing and development of Disney's next venture, located in the middle of an orange grove near [[Anaheim, California]].

===1955â1965: Disneyland===
[[File:Waltopening.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Walt Disney opens [[Disneyland]], July 1955.]]
In 1954, Walt Disney used his ''Disneyland'' series to unveil what would become [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time. On July 18, 1955, Walt Disney opened Disneyland to the general public. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by [[Art Linkletter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. After a shaky start, Disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world. A major expansion in 1959 included the addition of America's first [[Disneyland Monorail System|monorail system]].

For the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], Disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors, each of which would find its way to Disneyland in one form or another. During this time, Walt Disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second Disney theme park. In November 1955, &quot;Disney Planet&quot; was announced, with plans for theme parks, hotels, and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida.

Disney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s. Its weekday afternoon children's [[television program]] ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', featuring its roster of young &quot;Mouseketeers&quot;, premiered in 1955 to great success, as did the ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' [[miniseries]], starring [[Fess Parker]] and broadcast on the ''Disneyland'' anthology show. Two years later, the ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series would prove just as popular, running for two seasons on ABC, as well as separate episodes on the ''Disneyland'' series. Despite such success, Walt Disney Productions invested little into television ventures in the 1960s, with the exception of the long-running anthology series, later known as ''The Wonderful World of Disney''.

Disney's film studios stayed busy as well, averaging five or six releases per year during this period. While the production of shorts slowed significantly during the 1950s and 1960s, the studio released a number of popular animated features, like ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961), which introduced a new [[xerography#Xerography in animation|xerography]] process to transfer the drawings to [[Cel|animation cels]]. Disney's live-action releases were spread across a number of genres, including historical fiction (''[[Johnny Tremain (film)|Johnny Tremain]]'', 1957), adaptations of children's books (''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'', 1960) and modern-day comedies (''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', 1959). Disney's most successful film of the 1960s was a live action/animated musical adaptation of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', which received five [[37th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] [[Julie Andrews]].

===1966â1971: The deaths of Walt and Roy Disney and the opening of Walt Disney World===
On December 15, 1966, Walt Disney died of lung cancer, and [[Roy Disney]] took over as chairman, CEO, and president of the company. One of his first acts was to rename Disney World as &quot;Walt Disney World,&quot; in honor of his brother and his vision.

In 1967, the last two films Walt actively followed were released: the animated feature ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' and the musical ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]''. The studio released a number of comedies in the late 1960s, including ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes]]'' (1969), which starred another young Disney discovery, [[Kurt Russell]]. The 1970s opened with the release of Disney's first &quot;post-Walt&quot; animated feature, ''[[The Aristocats]]'', followed by a return to fantasy musicals in 1971's ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.

On October 1, 1971, Walt Disney World opened to the public, with Roy Disney dedicating the facility in person later that month. Two months later, on December 20, 1971, Roy Disney died of a stroke, leaving the company under control of [[Donn Tatum]], [[Card Walker]], and Walt's son-in-law [[Ron W. Miller|Ron Miller]], each trained by Walt and Roy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/corporate/complete_history_3.html |title=Company History (continued)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972â1984: Theatrical malaise and new leadership===
While Walt Disney Productions continued releasing family-friendly films throughout the 1970s, such as ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'' (1975) and ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (1976), the films did not fare as well at the box office as earlier material. However, the animation studio saw success with ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973), ''[[The Rescuers]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981).

Inspired by the popularity of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', the Disney studio produced the science-fiction adventure ''[[The Black Hole]]'' in 1979. ''The Black Hole'' was one of the first Disney releases to carry a [[Rated PG|PG]] rating, the first being ''[[Take Down (film)|Take Down]]'', also released in 1979. In 1980, Disney has joined venture with [[Paramount Pictures]] on the production of the 1980 film adaptation of ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'', which was a critical failure, yet a moderate box office success. Disney joined with Paramount again in the 1981 fantasy epic ''[[Dragonslayer]]'', which was more mature than anything Disney was ever involved with at the time, though it was a box office failure. The releases of these and other PG-rated Disney films such as the boldly innovative ''[[Tron]]'' (1982) led Disney CEO Ron Miller to create [[Touchstone Pictures]] as a brand for Disney to release more adult-oriented material. Touchstone's first release was the comedy ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' (1984), which was a box office success.

With ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' remaining a prime-time staple, Disney returned to television in the 1970s with syndicated programing such as the anthology series ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'' and a brief revival of the ''Mickey Mouse Club''. In 1980, Disney launched Walt Disney Home Video to take advantage of the newly-emerging videocassette market. On April 18, 1983, [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] debuted as a subscription-level channel on cable systems nationwide, featuring its large library of classic films and TV series, along with original programming and family-friendly third-party offerings.

Walt Disney World received much of the company's attention through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In 1978, Disney executives announced plans for the second Walt Disney World theme park, [[Epcot|EPCOT Center]], which would open in October 1982. Inspired by Walt Disney's dream of a futuristic model city, EPCOT Center was built as a &quot;permanent World's Fair&quot;, complete with exhibits sponsored by major American corporations, as well as pavilions based on the cultures of other nations. In Japan, the [[Oriental Land Company]] partnered with Walt Disney Productions to build the first Disney theme park outside of the United States, [[Tokyo Disneyland]], which opened in April 1983.

Despite the success of the Disney Channel and its new theme park creations, Walt Disney Productions was financially vulnerable. Its film library was valuable, but offered few current successes, and its leadership team was unable to keep up with other studios, particularly the works of [[Don Bluth]], who defected from Disney in 1979. In 1984, financier [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]] launched a [[hostile takeover]] bid for Walt Disney Productions, with the intent of selling off its various assets. Disney successfully fought off the bid with the help of [[White knight (business)|friendly investors]], and [[Sid Bass]] and Roy Disney's son [[Roy E. Disney|Roy Edward Disney]] brought in [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] from [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Frank Wells]] from [[Warner Bros.]] to head up the company.

===1984â2004: The Eisner era===
:''See also, 1984â2004 under [[Timeline of The Walt Disney Company]].''
Since [[Walt Disney|Walt]]'s death in 1966, The Walt Disney Company had narrowly survived takeover attempts by corporate raiders. Its shareholders [[Sid Bass]] and [[Roy E. Disney]] brought on Eisner and former Warner Brothers chief [[Frank Wells]] to replace [[Ron W. Miller]] in 1984 and strengthen the company.

During the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, Disney revitalized. Beginning with ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), and later, ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), its [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|flagship animation studio]] enjoyed a [[Disney Renaissance|series of commercial and critical successes]]. In addition, the company successfully entered the field of television animation with a number of lavishly budgeted and acclaimed series such as ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', ''[[Duck Tales]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. Disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when then Disney Studio Chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] acquired [[Miramax Films]] in 1993. Disney acquired many other media sources during the decade, including a merger with [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities/ABC]] in 1996 which brought broadcast network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and its assets, including the [[ESPN]] networks, into the Disney fold.

During the early part of the 1990s, Eisner and his partners set out to plan &quot;The Disney Decade&quot; which was to feature new parks around the world, existing park expansions, new films, and new media investments. While some of the proposals did follow through, most did not. These included the ''Euro Disney Resort'' (now [[Disneyland Paris]]), ''Disney-MGM Studios'' (now [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]), [[Disney's California Adventure Park]], ''Disney-MGM Studios Paris'' (eventually opened in 2002 as [[Walt Disney Studios Park]]), and various film projects including a ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' franchise.

Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994 (''[[The Lion King]]'', which went on to become the most successful hand-drawn animated picture of all time, was dedicated to his memory). Shortly thereafter, Katzenberg resigned and formed [[Dreamworks SKG]] with partners [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] because Eisner would not appoint Katzenberg to Wells' now-available post. Instead, Eisner recruited his friend [[Michael Ovitz]], one of the founders of the [[Creative Artists Agency]], to be President, with minimal involvement from Disney's board of directors (which at the time included Oscar-winning actor [[Sidney Poitier]], the CEO of [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] [[Stephen Bollenbach]], former [[U.S. Senator]] [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]], [[Yale School of Architecture|Yale]] dean [[Robert A. M. Stern]], and Eisner's predecessors [[Raymond Watson]] and [[E. Cardon Walker|Card Walker]]). Ovitz lasted only 14 months and left Disney in December 1996 via a &quot;no fault termination&quot; with a [[severance package]] of $38&amp;nbsp;million in cash and 3 million [[stock options]] worth roughly $100&amp;nbsp;million at the time of Ovitz's departure. The Ovitz episode engendered a long running [[derivative suit]], which finally concluded in June 2006, almost 10 years later. Chancellor [[William B. Chandler, III]] of the [[Delaware Court of Chancery]], despite describing Eisner's behavior as falling &quot;far short of what shareholders expect and demand from those entrusted with a [[fiduciary]] position...&quot; found in favor of Eisner and the rest of the Disney board because they hadn't violated the letter of the law (namely, the [[duty of care]] owed by a corporation's officers and board to its shareholders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=In re The Walt Disney Company Derivative Litigation|vol=907|reporter=A.2d|opinion=693|court=Del. Ch.|date=August 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Save Disney&quot; campaign and Eisner's ouster====
In 2003, [[Roy E. Disney]], the son of Disney co-founder [[Roy O. Disney]] and nephew of [[Walt Disney]], resigned from his positions as the company's vice chairman and chairman of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], accusing Eisner of [[micromanagement]], flops with the ABC television network, timidity in the [[theme park]] business, turning the Walt Disney Company into a &quot;rapacious, soul-less&quot; company, and refusing to establish a clear succession plan, as well as a string of box-office movie flops starting in the year 2000.

On March 3, 2004, at Disney's annual shareholders' meeting, a surprising and unprecedented 43% of Disney's shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and [[Stanley Gold]], withheld their [[proxy voting|proxies]] to re-elect Eisner to the board. Disney's board then gave the chairmanship position to Mitchell. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive.

On March 13, 2005, Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired. On September 30, Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors, and, severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company's [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] headquarters. Eisner's replacement was his longtime assistant, [[Bob Iger|Robert Iger]].

[[File:022306-CelebrationFL01.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A view of downtown [[Celebration, Florida]]: the city was planned by The Walt Disney Company]]
On July 8, 2005, Walt Disney's nephew, [[Roy E. Disney]] returned to The Walt Disney Company as a consultant and with the new title of Non Voting Director, Emeritus. [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] celebrated the 50th Anniversary of [[Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] on July 17, and opened [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] on September 12. [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] released ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'', the company's first film using 3-D animation. On October 1, [[Robert Iger]] replaced Michael Eisner as CEO. Miramax co-founders [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] also departed the company to form their own studio. On July 25, 2005, Disney announced that it was closing DisneyToon Studios Australia in October 2006, after 17 years of existence.

Aware that Disney's relationship with Pixar was wearing thin, President and CEO Robert Iger began negotiations with leadership of [[Pixar Animation Studios]], [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Ed Catmull]], regarding possible merger. On January 23, 2006, it was announced that Disney would purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4&amp;nbsp;billion. The deal was finalized on May 5; and among noteworthy results was the transition of Pixar's CEO and 50.1% shareholder, [[Steve Jobs]], becoming Disney's largest individual shareholder at 7% and a member of Disney's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;PixarAcquisitionNYTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=January 17, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/business/25disney.html|title=Disney Agrees to Acquire Pixar in a $7.4&amp;nbsp;billion Deal  |work=The New York Times | first=Laura M. | last=Holson | date=January 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PixarDisneySubsidiary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=January 17, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/06/business/media/06pixar.html|title=Pixar Becomes Unit of Disney|publisher=The New York Times &amp; The Associated Press | date=May 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Catmull took over as President of Pixar Animation Studios. Former Executive Vice-President of Pixar, [[John Lasseter]], became [[Chief Creative Officer]] of both [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and Pixar Animation Studios, as well assuming the role of Principal Creative Adviser at [[Walt Disney Imagineering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PixarDisneySubsidiary&quot;/&gt;

After a long time working in the company as a senior executive and large shareholder, Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney died from stomach cancer on December 16, 2009. At the time of his death, he had roughly 1% of all Disney shares which amounted to 16 million. He is seen to be the last member of the [[Disney family]] to be actively involved in the running of the company and working in the company altogether.

On December 31, 2009, Disney acquired [[Marvel Entertainment]], Inc. for $4.24&amp;nbsp;billion. Disney has stated that their acquisition of the company will not affect Marvel's products, neither will the nature of any Marvel characters be transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.enewsi.com/news.php?catid=190&amp;itemid=15744 |title=Disney Announces Acquisition of Marvel Entertainment Inc |author=Jay Cochran |date=August 31, 2009|publisher=enewsi.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Disney Channel president [[Rich Ross]], hired by Iger, replaced [[Dick Cook]] as chairman of the company and, in November, began restructuring the company to focus more on family friendly products. Later in January 2010, Disney decided to shut down Miramax after downsizing Touchstone, but one month later, they began selling the Miramax brand and its 700-title film library. On March 12, [[ImageMovers Digital]], [[Robert Zemeckis|Robert Zemeckis's]] company which Disney had bought in 2007, was shut down. In April 2010, [[Lyric Street]], Disney's country music label in Nashville, was shut down. In May 2010, the company sold the [[Power Rangers]] brand, as well as its 700-episode library, back to [[Haim Saban]]. In June, the company canceled [[Jerry Bruckheimer|Jerry Bruckheimer's]] film project ''Killing Rommel''. In September 2010, [[Disney Interactive Studios]] was downsized. In November, two ABC stations were sold.

With the release of ''[[Tangled (2010 film)|Tangled]]'' in 2010, Ed Catmull said that the &quot;princess&quot; genre of films was taking a hiatus until &quot;someone has a fresh take on it â¦ but we don't have any other musicals or fairytales lined up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-disney-fairytale-has-an-unhappy-ending-20101128-18caf.html The Disney Fairytale Has An Unhappy Ending],&quot; ''Sydney Morning Herald'' November 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that they were looking to get away from the princess era due to the changes in audience composition and preference. However, in the official Facebook page for Disney, Ed Catmull stated that this was just a rumor.

In April 2011, Disney broke ground on [[Shanghai Disney Resort]]. Costing $4.4 billion, the resort is slated to open in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barboza|first=David|coauthor=Barnes, Brooks|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/business/media/08disney.html| title=Disney Plans Lavish Park in Shanghai|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 2011|accessdate=27 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zl43ocMn|archivedate=27 June 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in August 2011, Bob Iger stated on a conference call that after the success of the [[Pixar]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] purchases, he and the Walt Disney Company are looking to &quot;buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of creating great characters and great stories.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhasin|first=Kim|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/disneys-looking-to-buy-up-some-more-stables-of-characters-2011-8| title=Disney Is Looking To Buy Even More Stables Of Characters|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|date=August 10, 2011|accessdate=13 August 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Criticism of The Walt Disney Company}}
Some of Disney's animated family films have drawn fire for being accused of having sexual references hidden in them, among them ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). Instances of sexual material hidden in some versions of ''[[The Rescuers]]'' (1977) and ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988) resulted in recalls and modifications of the films to remove such content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp |title=Disney (Disney Films) |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some religious welfare groups, such as the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]], have opposed films including ''[[Priest (1994 film)|Priest]]'' (1994) and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=&quot;CL2001&quot;/&gt;  A book called ''Growing Up Gay'', published by Disney-owned [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion Press]] and similar publications, as well as the company's extension of benefits to [[homosexuality|same-sex]] [[domestic partners]], spurred [[boycott]]s of Disney and its advertisers by the Catholic League, the [[Assemblies of God USA]], the [[American Family Association]], and other conservative groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;CL2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =75 Organizations Asked To Join Showtime Boycott| work=Catalyst Online| publisher=[[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]| date =May 29, 2001| url =http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=381| accessdate =August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CL1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Disney Boycott Expands| work=Catalyst| publisher=[[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]| year =1996| month =October| url =http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst.php?year=1996&amp;month=October&amp;read=151| accessdate =August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CL1997&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Petitions and Boycott Stir Disney| work=Catalyst Online| publisher=[[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]| year =1997| month =October| url =http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst.php?year=1997&amp;month=October&amp;read=414| accessdate =August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycotts were discontinued by most of these organizations by 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Southern Baptists end 8-year Disney boycott| publisher=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]| date =June 22, 2005| url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8318263/| accessdate =January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these social controversies, the company has been accused of human rights violations regarding the working conditions in factories that produce their merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Beware of Mickey: Disney's Sweatshop in South China| publisher=[[Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations]]| date =February 10, 2007| url = http://www.somo.nl/monitoring/reports/hkcic01-02.htm| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070210015136/http://www.somo.nl/monitoring/reports/hkcic01-02.htm| archivedate =February 10, 2007| accessdate =August 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Staff writer| title =Disney's duds are tops in sweatshop labour, Oxfam| work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC.com]]| date =June 20, 2001| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2001/06/18/sweatshops_010618.html source| accessdate =August 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate social responsibility==
[[File:FriendsForChange2.jpg||thumb|right|140px|Friends for Change Promotional Poster]]Many animation studios are currently setting up arms for conducting activities related to [[Corporate social responsibility|Corporate Social Responsibility]]. Though many studios are still yet to have fully functional wings for these programs, the Walt Disney Company has already set up many programs in order to cement its image as an entity that is socially responsible.

Among the many programs initiated by Disney are the annual Enviroports (i.e. environmental report) that Disney now publishes yearly to keep its shareholders in touch with exactly how it attempts to optimize the company's operational impact on environmental issues such as reduction of waste, fossil-fuel use, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improved eco-system protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.disney.go.com/environmentality/enviroport/2007/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to appreciation by many third parties such as the Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship and Reputation Institute, which ranks Disney 2nd in a Corporate Social Responsibility Index, with a score of 81.33, devised in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/10/13/jj-walt-disney-krafts-foods-top-csr-ranking&lt;/ref&gt; The report also establishes that Disney has improved its performance year-on-year and is second on two out of the three categories listed for measurement.
