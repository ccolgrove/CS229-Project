AurÃ©lie and Geof, Marie and Geoffray are a couple, this is their secret, however, La Voix decided to switch AurÃ©lie with Geoffray, and Marie with Geof. . The twins, Zelko and Zarko are the masters of the underground labyrinth. They have a huge power, being able to choose who they want to see nominated every week and forever until the eviction of the housemate they chose. They chose Morgan, Sabrina and Simon, and have only until Tuesday to change their mind if they want. Anthony and Elizabeth were automatically nominated for eviction after ten minutes of entrance, viewers decided to keep Anthony and Elizabeth was evicted

* '''Saturday - Day 2''': Ayem and Daniel managed to discover that they are a fake couple. Morgan believes that the two couples in the House have a link together. Zarko triggered the secret alarm, and believes that Geoffrey and AurÃ©lie's secret is that they are a look-a-like of Barbie and Ken. Zarko chose to confirm his &quot;buzz&quot;, however, that is not their secret which cost Zarko â¬5,000. The Masters of the Underground decided to change their nominations to Rudy, Juliette and Zarko (one of the masters, to prevent other housemates from exposing their secret). Rudy was very angry about this decision, while Juliette was sad and hopes that the &quot;Masters of Underground&quot; don't choose her to be nominated for all evictions. Ayem and Daniel decided to pretend that they are attracted to each other so their secret is more believable.

* '''Sunday - Day 3''': La Voix offered housemates the chance to break their permanent nomination. If any of the housemates successfully solve it, they will break their permanent nomination, however, no one solved it. Zarko &amp; Zelko once again chose to change their nominations, but this time they swapped Juliette with Julie.  Today, Daniel triggered the secret alarm, believing that Geoffrey and AurÃ©lie are siblings, he confirmed his buzz, but it was incorrect and cost him â¬5,000. Marie decided to convince other housemates that Geoffrey is in fact gay, with some believing her, Geoffrey was not happy about this, and confronted her, with Marie apologizing and saying she didn't like that AurÃ©lie and Geoffrey are not playing the game.

* '''Monday - Day 4''': Marie had a discussion with Geof (AurÃ©lie's boyfriend), and thinks that she is playing a double game and is jealous of Marie. Jonathan and Zelko had an argument as Jonathan does not like how Zelko behaves, thinking he is false and is putting on a show purely for cameras. Today, for the third time Zarko and Zelko changed their nominations, but this time they decided that it will be Ayem who will face every eviction and becomes permanently nominated, she will save herself from eviction if she exposes who is responsible for her nomination, however, all housemates believe that the people responsible are in an Intruder House. La Voix offered a secret mission to Geoffrey. For â¬1,000, he must kiss AurÃ©lie, at first he accepted the secret mission but after he repeated the mission to AurÃ©lie, he preferred to give up the secret mission.

* '''Tuesday - Day 5''': Ayem was disappointed that Anthony told Daniel that he finds her too seductive behind her back, and Ayem said that she doesn't even try to seduce Anthony or is attracted to him. La Voix offered housemates a task in which they have to memorise the rules (commandments) off by heart. Today, hosuemates nominated for the first time with females nominating males housemates. Anthony, Daniel and Zelko received most votes and were nominated for eviction, with Ayem being permanently nominated, she was also up for eviction. Zelko was confused as to why he was nominated, while Daniel was not expecting it, Daniel also said to Zelko and Anthony that he lost confidence in the girls. Morgan noticed a hand in the ventilation opening. and believes that the intruders are living in the underground, he thinks that Elizabeth, who was evicted shortly after entering the house is in there. However, the hand belonged to Zelko. However no one realised that the twin brothers were in the confessional at the time of Morgan's discovery.

* '''Wednesday - Day 6''': Rudy tried to talk to the intruders that the house believes exist via an air vent, but no intruders actually exist. The Masters of Underground sent a message to Geof and Marie, saying &quot;Games of chances are doing good things&quot;, but neither of them understand it's meaning, however, AurÃ©lie thinks that the Masters of Underground are aware about the secret of both couples and that Masters of Underground think that Geof actually enjoys pretending to be a couple with Marie, which really worries AurÃ©lie as she is becoming doubtful of her future with Geof. Today is Morgane's 21st birthday, and La Voix set up a party for her and other housemates, during the party, Morgane and Geoffrey danced, with some seeing it as a sultry dance, which upset Marie, and said to Geof and Geoffrey never dances with her like that, Marie's and Geoffrey's relationship seems to be on the verge of collapse.

* '''Thursday - Day 7''': In the garden, Morgane talked to Marie, she thinks that the reason why Marie never mentions the name of Geof, is that she is afraid to slip out the name Geoffrey (as Geof and Geoffrey are the same names), Morgane realises the possibility that the couples partners were inverted. The Masters of Underground sent a new message to housemate and more precisely to Rudy and AurÃ©lie: &quot;Rudy, AurÃ©lie, follow our tips&quot;. Ayem thinks spies are in the House and there is no intruder house. Daniel received a secret mission, he must kiss Ayem on the mouth but Daniel revealed his secret mission to Ayem. Marie-JosÃ©e triggered the secret alarm, she believes Geoffrey and Marie are brother and sister. The Masters of Underground sent a new message again, the message says: &quot;Marie and Geof, AurÃ©lie and Geoffrey, Two separate worlds do not fit easily&quot;.

==Nominations==
Nominations follow a different formula than is typical of the Big Brother franchise. Each week the housemates alternate nominations: male housemates nominate female housemates one week, and female housemates nominate male housemates the following week. In some weeks housemates are only permitted to nominate one housemate, rather than the typical two; this, usually occurs when at least one housemate has been already nominated by La Voix (Big Brother). Also, during some weeks, twist occur which affect the nomination procedure.
