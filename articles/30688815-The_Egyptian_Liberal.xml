The '''Yemeni Congregation for Reform''', frequently called '''Islah''' or '''Al-Islah''',&lt;ref name=&quot;economist_alislah&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feb3_DayRage_aljaz&quot; /&gt; ({{lang-ar|Ø§ÙØªØ¬ÙØ¹ Ø§ÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙØ¥ØµÙØ§Ø­  ''al-tajammuÊ¿ al-yamanÄ« lil-iá¹£lÄá¸¥''}}), is the main opposition [[political party|party]] in [[Yemen]]. At the last [[legislative]] [[elections in Yemen|elections]], 27 April 2003, the party won 22.6 % of the popular vote and 46 out of 301 seats.

==Foundation==

The party was created in September 13, 1990 in Sana'a, Yemen, by Yemeni members of the Muslim Brotherhood.{{Cn|date=November 2011}}

==General structure, leadership==
Al-Islah has been described as consisting of &quot;three components. The first is the political faction, Yemenâs [[Muslim Brotherhood]], led by [[Mohammed Qahtan]]. The second is the tribal confederacy which was led by top tribal chief [[Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar|Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar]] until his death in 2007 at which time he was succeeded by his son Sadeq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yementimes.com/defaultdet.aspx?SUB_ID=33126 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110405191505/http://www.yementimes.com/defaultdet.aspx?SUB_ID=33126 |archivedate=April 5, 2011 |title=Ruling party defies Al-Ahmar family, threatens unity of Hashid tribe |publisher=Elaf political independent weekly |date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Hamid al-Ahmar]] is Sadeq's younger brother and is active in politics.) The third is the mainstream [[Salafi|Salafists]] in Yemen, led by the countryâs most prominent Sunni religious scholar, [[Abdul Majeed al-Zindani]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfor.com/yemen_election_realignment Yemen: An Election Realignment] STRATFOR, September 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Yemeni parliamentary election, 2003|2003 parliamentary election]], Al-Islah won 46 seats. {{As of|2010}}, 13 of Al-Islah's [[Assembly of Representatives (Yemen)|parliament]] members are women, including human rights activist and Nobel laureate [[Tawakel Karman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Feb3_DayRage_aljaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brechtforum_Karman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The United States &amp; Yemen â Destroying Lives in the Name of National Security|work=|publisher=Brecht Forum|date=2010|url=http://brechtforum.org/civicrm/event/info?id=11729|format=|doi=|accessdate=2011-02-01|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wBGBE8nf|archivedate=2011-02-01|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created the activist group Women Journalists Without Chains in 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;T_Karman_Jun2010_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Al-Sakkaf| first =Nadia| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Renowned activist and press freedom advocate Tawakul Karman to the Yemen Times: &quot;A day will come when all human rights violators pay for what they did to Yemen&quot; | work =| publisher =Women Journalists Without Chains| date =2010-06-17| url =http://womenpress.org/articles.php?id=309 |format =| doi =| accessdate =2011-01-30 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w8NYbYFU |archivedate=2011-01-30  |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the first Yemeni and Arab woman to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2011.

==Policies==
===National===
Al-Islah party says that those thinking of fighting for the Yemeni government against the [[Sa'dah insurgency]] of the [[Houthis]], should instead keep well out of the war because Yemenis must not help Yemenâs pro-Western government, which deserves to be overthrown.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist_alislah&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Mazrak | last=Camp | pages= | language =| title=Yemen's War - Pity those caught in the middle | date=2009-11-19 | publisher=[[The Economist]] | url=http://www.economist.com/node/14920092?story_id=14920092 |accessdate=2011-02-16 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wY4End4c |archivedate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Islah is agitating, at the moment, against a draft amendment to the [[constitution of Yemen]] that could allow the president to run for life. The party is also involved in organising demonstrations for the ongoing [[2011 Yemeni protests]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Feb3_DayRage_aljaz&quot; &gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title=New protests erupt in Yemen | date=2011-01-29 | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129112626339573.html |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w8S9MZ1r |archivedate=2011-01-30 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal rights===
Senior member of Al-Islah [[Tawakel Karman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Feb3_DayRage_aljaz&quot; /&gt; removed her [[niqÄb]] (face veil) at a human rights conference in 2004 and since then has called for &quot;other women and female activists to take theirs off&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;T_Karman_Jun2010_interview&quot; /&gt;
