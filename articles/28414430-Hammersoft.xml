==History==

WEST VISAYAS STATE UNIVERSITY in Pototan was established during the post- world war period, with refresher classes under the administration of the Iloilo High School in 1945. It was ubsequently renamed from Pototan Regional High School, to Iloilo Provincial High School in 1946 and Pototan High School  from 1947-1957. 

On June 22, 1957,  Pototan High School was converted to Pototan Vocational School by virtue of R.A. 1924.  For 26 years, this school had been the training ground for technical-vocational education.

On June 24, 1983, it was converted into Pototan College of Arts and Sciences. Degree programs in education were added to the trade-technical courses. More buildings and classrooms were built and additional facilities were acquired.

On January 29, 1999, pursuant to Special Provision NO. 9 of R.A. 8760 Pototan College of Arts and Sciences was integrated to West Visayas State University System.  The integration officially started on August 22, 2000, through  the issuance of CHED Memorandum Order  27, s. 2000.  The school was renamed West Visayas State University-Pototan Campus. Degree programs in teacher education, industrial, information, business and management technology were then added to the College's program offerings.&lt;ref&gt;http://wvsu.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=65&amp;Itemid=105&lt;/ref&gt;
