The '''2009â10 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball team''' represented [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]  in the [[2009â10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2009â10]] [[college basketball]] season. This was [[Paul Hewitt]]'s tenth season as head coach. The Yellow Jackets compete in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] and played their home games at [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]]. They finished the season 23&amp;ndash;13, 7&amp;ndash;9 in ACC play. They advanced to the championship game of the [[2010 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament]] as the 7 seed before losing to regular season champion [[2009â10 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]]. They received an at&amp;ndash;large bid to the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], earning a 10 seed in the Midwest Region. They upset 7 seed [[2009â10 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team|Oklahoma State]] in the first round before falling to 2 seed and AP #5 [[2009â10 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]] in the second round.
==Pre-Season==
On Thursday, September 24, it was announced that the Georgia Tech Men's basketball team had cancelled their trip to [[Canada]], which was to take place the weekend of October 2-5, due to concerns over NCAA regulations. The Yellow Jackets were to depart October 2 for [[Windsor, Ontario]] to play two games against the {{cbb link|year=2009â10|school=University of Windsor|team=Windsor Lancers|title=Windsor Lancers Men's Basketball team}} and one against the {{cbb link|year=2009â10|school=University of Western Ontario|team=Western Ontario Mustangs|title=Western Ontario Mustangs Men's Basketball team}}.  The issue revolved around [[NCAA]]rules prohibiting teams from taking trips within 30 days of the official start of pre-season practice. The trip did fall within Georgia Tech's [[fall break]] from classes. NCAA regulations allow teams to take an international trip once every four years, but the trip must occur before the 30-day period leading up to the official start of pre-season practice, which this year is October 16. Georgia Tech had asked for and received a waiver from the NCAA, but ultimately decided against taking the fall break trip amid concerns over the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
