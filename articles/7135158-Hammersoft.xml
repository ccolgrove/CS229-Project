==Career==
===Early years===
Olga Poutchkova, coached by her father [[Alex Poutchkov]], was No 1 in the World in the ITF U12 rankings in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olga Poutchkova profile&quot;/&gt; Â Olga won the U12 category in the [[Eddie Herr]] in 1999, where she beat [[Shahar Pe'er]] 6â2, 6â2 in the final,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juniortennis.com/Tournaments/tourna_live_home.php?tid=1286 Eddie Herr 1999], Juniortennis.com&lt;/ref&gt; and a week later was runner up in the U12 category at the [[Orange Bowl (tennis)|Orange Bowl]], where qualifier [[Tatiana Golovin]] beat her 6â4, 3â6, 6â4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juniortennis.com/Tournaments/tourna_live_home.php?tid=1364 Orange Bowl 1999], Juniortennis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Olga made her debut on the U18 circuit August 13, 2000 at the USTA Junior International Grass Court Championships where she was defeated in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100000646&amp;event=1100003977 USTA Junior International Grass Court Championships 2000], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Just a week later, at the USTA Junior International Hard Court Championships she secured her first win in a U18 doubles match playing alongside Brazilian [[Caroline Neves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100000658&amp;event=1100004036 USTA Junior International Hard Court Championships 2000], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside American [[Nicole Pitts]] she won her first U18 Junior tournament (out of 2 in doubles) in [[Ecuador]], January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournamentoverview.asp?tournament=1100001786 Nicolas Macchiavello Almeida Cup 2001], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; She won her only U18 Junior title in singles at the US Junior International Hard Court Championships in 2003, beating [[Jessi Robinson]] 6â2, 6â2 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournamentoverview.asp?tournament=1100005079 US Junior International Hard Court Championships 2003], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ITF Circuit===
Poutchkova started her [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] professional career in March 2002, when she played in four tournaments in Australia, reaching the quarterfinals at [[Warnambool]] and [[Benalla]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo910.tripod.com/cgi-bin/wta.pl?p1=5117&amp;p2=2002 Olga Poutchkova 2002 results], www.photo-tennisdatabase.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 she reached the final at [[Miami]] in January and the semifinal at [[Houston]] in June, and won her first professional tournament at [[Baltimore]] in July 2003 when she beat [[Jewel Peterson]] 6â2, 6â4 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo910.tripod.com/cgi-bin/wta.pl?p1=5117&amp;p2=2003 Olga Poutchkova 2003 results], www.photo-tennisdatabase.com&lt;/ref&gt; Â She won her second professional title July 11, 2004 in [[College Park, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentoverview.asp?tournament=1100010033 $25,000 College Park, MD 2004], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo910.tripod.com/cgi-bin/wta.pl?p1=5117&amp;p2=2004 Olga Puchkova 2004 results], www.photo-tennisdatabase.com&lt;/ref&gt; She defeated first seeded [[Maureen Drake]] in the second round and [[Rossana de los RÃ­os]] in the final: 7â5, 4â6, 6â2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100010033&amp;event= $25,000 College Park, MD 2004 Results], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pelham, Alabama]] she reached another final, but was defeated 4â6, 6â4 6â0 by [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[Zuzana ZemenovÃ¡]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100010126&amp;event= $25,000 Pelham, AL 2004], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; She reached her fifth ITF final in August 2005, beating [[StÃ©phanie Dubois]] en route. In the final, [[Ashley Harkleroad]] was too strong as she beat Poutchkova 6â2, 6â1 to claim the [[Washington, D.C.]] title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100012084&amp;event= $75,000 Washington, DC 2005], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006: Breakthrough Year===
In 2006 she made her [[WTA Tour]] main draw debut in [[Hobart]], Australia as a [[qualifier]]; however she lost in the first round to [[Mara Santangelo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wta1&quot;&gt;[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/2/players/playerprofiles/PlayerBio2.asp?PlayerID=310717 Olga Poutchkova (Rus) 2006 in detail]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards she tried to qualify for the [[2006 Australian Open]], but failed. She returned to the ITF tour and reached another final in [[Hammond, Louisiana]] at the end of March. She comfortably won the final, beating [[Andrea HlavÃ¡ÄkovÃ¡]] 6â3, 6â4 to win her third ITF Title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100013152&amp;event= $25,000 Hammond, LA 2006], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first WTA Tour main draw win in [[Birmingham]] followed in June, beating fellow qualifier [[Viktoriya Kutuzova]]. She then lost her second round match against 4th seed fellow Russian [[Elena Likhovtseva]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wta1&quot;/&gt; Back in the IFF Tour she cruised to the final in [[Felixstowe]]'s grass tournament, where she turned out to be way too strong for Australian [[Trudi Musgrave]] who was beaten by 6â2, 6â1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100013977&amp;event= $25,000 Felixstowe 2006], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; As being second seed in [[Bronx, New York]] she won yet another ITF title. First seed [[Melinda Czink]] was already beaten in the first round by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Elise TamaÃ«la]]. Poutchkova herself won all her matches and faced [[Belarus]]ian [[Tatiana Poutchek]] final, which was easily won by Poutchkova 6â3, 6â1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100013962&amp;event= $50,000 Bronx, New York 2006], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to qualify for the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon earlier in 2006, she successfully qualified for the [[2006 US Open - Women's Singles|2006 US Open]], beating [[Virginie Pichet]], [[StÃ©phanie Cohen-Aloro]] and [[Ryoko Fuda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100014312&amp;event=1100081658 U.S. Open 2006 qualification], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; She then faced [[Marion Bartoli]] in the first round and was not able to excel against the 26th seed (6â4, 6â0).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100014312&amp;event= U.S. Open 2006 main], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Poutchkova reached her first WTA Tour final in [[Kolkata]], India, in September 2006, losing to [[Martina Hingis]] (6â0, 6â4), but beating seventh seed [[Nicole Pratt]] en route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100014502&amp;event= Kolkata 2006], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; A week previously she had reached her first Tour singles quarter-final at the Tier III [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]] notching up her first top 20 victory along the way when beating [[Ana IvanoviÄ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/womens/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?tournament=1100014500&amp;event= Bali 2006], [[International Tennis Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the season, Olga reached her second WTA Tour final in [[Quebec City]], Canada. She lost to [[Marion Bartoli]] 6â0 6â0, becoming the first woman since 1993 to lose by that scoreline in a Tour final, although she was injured during the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.challengebell.com/horaire_resultats/horaire_resultats.asp Challengebell Open results], Challengebell.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 to present===
Puchkova made her Top 100 debut in 2006, and peaked at a high of World No. 32 on June 17, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;wta1&quot;/&gt; Â However, her results soon began to tail off, and she didn't reach another quarterfinal until her last tournament of the 2007 season in [[Quebec City|Bell Challenge]]. Prior to that she failed to win back-to-back matches on the season, although after the Bell Challenge she managed to reach the final of an ITF event in [[Pittsburgh]], losing to [[Ashley Harkleroad]] in three sets. Â By the end of the season, Puchkova's ranking had fallen to 92, and her recordÂ 

At the [[2008 Australian Open]], she won her first round match, but lost 6â1, 7â5 to World No. 1 [[Justine Henin]] in the second round. Â Her year would improve slightly as she finished runner-up in the [[Charlottesville]] ITF event falling to [[Alexis King]] ranked 640 in the world. Â She had to attempt to qualify for the [[2008 French Open]] before falling to eventual quarterfinalist [[Carla SuÃ¡rez Navarro]] of Spain in the qualifying playoff round. Â She then fell at the same stage in [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] qualifying to [[Eva HrdinovÃ¡]]. Â She failed to qualify for another main draw of a tour-level tournament in 2008, but did receive direct entry into the Bell Challenge before losing in the second round to [[Melanie Oudin]] 6-1, 7-6(3). Â Her last event ended in a first round loss in [[San Diego]], and her ranking dipped to 159. Â She went 15-28 on the season.

She fell in the final round of qualifying yet again in the [[2009 Australian Open]], and didn't enter into a WTA tournament until she was given the opportunity to qualify for the Bell Challenge. Â She did manage to qualify, but lost to [[Amra Sadikovic]] in the opening main draw round. Â 19-22 by the end of the season, Puchkova's woes continued and she was ranked 226 in her last tournament of the year in [[Toronto]].
