The '''2009 Jupiter [[impact event]]''', occasionally referred to as the '''Wesley impact''', was a July 2009 impact on [[Jupiter]] that caused a black spot in the planet's atmosphere.  The spot was similar in area to the planet's [[Atmosphere of Jupiter#Oval_BA|Little Red Spot]], approximately the size of the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeleypr&quot;&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/07/21_bruise.shtml Jupiter pummeled, leaving bruise the size of the Pacific Ocean]. University of California, Berkeley press release, July 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The impacter is estimated to have been about 200 to 500 meters in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;PR2011&quot;/&gt;

==Discovery==
[[amateur astronomy|Amateur astronomer]] Anthony Wesley discovered the impact at approximately 13:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on 19 July 2009 (almost exactly 15 years after the Jupiter impact of [[comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]], or SL9). He was at his home [[observatory]] just outside [[Murrumbateman, New South Wales|Murrumbateman]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], using stacked images on a {{convert|14.5|in|cm|adj=on|1}} diameter [[reflecting telescope]] equipped with a low light machine vision video camera attached to the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mackey, Robert|title=Amateur Finds New Earth-Sized Blot on Jupiter|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/amateur-astronomer-finds-new-earth-size-impact-mark-on-jupiter/|date=July 21, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley stated that

{{quote|When first seen close to the limb (and in poor conditions) it was only a vaguely dark spot, I [thought] likely to be just a normal dark polar storm. However as it rotated further into view, and the conditions improved I suddenly realised that it wasn't just dark, it was ''black'' in all channels, meaning it was truly a black spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesley, Anthony|title=Impact mark on Jupiter, 19th July 2009|url=http://jupiter.samba.org/jupiter-impact.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iTsIBdEs|archivedate=2009-07-22|publisher=(jupiter.samba.org)|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wesley sent an e-mail to others including the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]] reporting his observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O'Loughlin, Toni and agencies|title=Amateur astronomer spots Earth-size scar on Jupiter|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jul/21/jupiter-scar-comet-asteroid-crash|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-07-21 | location=London | date=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
[[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators confirmed the sighting. They had time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck II]] telescope in [[Hawaii]], and had been planning to observe [[Fomalhaut b]], but they spent some of their time looking at the Jupiter impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;keckpr&quot;&gt;[http://keckobservatory.org/index.php/news/jupiters_adds_a_feature/ Jupiter adds a feature]. Keck Observatory observations, July 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Infrared observation by Keck and the [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility]] (IRTF)&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeleypr&quot;/&gt; at Mauna Kea showed a bright spot where the impact took place, indicating the impact warmed a 190 million square km area of the lower atmosphere at 305 W, 57 S near Jupiter's south pole.&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeleypr&quot;/&gt;

The spot's prominence indicates that it is composed of high-altitude aerosols similar to those seen during the SL9 impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;keckpr&quot;/&gt; Using [[Near-infrared#Different_regions_in_the_infrared|near-infrared]] wavelengths and the IRTF, Glenn Orton and his team detected bright upwelling particles in the planet's upper atmosphere and using mid-infrared wavelengths, found possible extra emission of [[ammonia]] gas.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;{{cite web|author=Martinez, Carolina|title=New NASA Images Indicate Object Hits Jupiter|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/jup-20090720.html|date=July 20, 2009|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force of the explosion on Jupiter was thousands of times more powerful than the suspected comet or asteroid that [[Tunguska event|exploded over the Tunguska]] River Valley in Siberia in June 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;hubblesite&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Hubble Captures Rare Jupiter Collision |publisher=Hubblesite (STScI-2009-23) |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/23/full |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This would be over a million times more powerful than [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the bomb dropped on Hiroshima]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Longo | first = Giuseppe | contribution = The Tunguska event |editor-last = Bobrowsky | editor-first = Peter T. | editor2-last = Rickman | editor2-first = Hans | title = Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, An Interdisciplinary Approach | chapter = 18 | pages = 303â330 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | place = Berlin Heidelberg New York | publication-date = 2007 | contribution-url = http://www-th.bo.infn.it/tunguska/Asteroids-Chapter-18.pdf  | isbn=3-540-32709-6 | year = 2007 | postscript = .}}.

Astronomers will further observe the impact area with a variety of instruments, including the Keck&lt;ref name=&quot;keckpr&quot;/&gt; and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[STS-125|recently installed]] [[WFC3|Wide Field Camera 3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeleypr&quot;/&gt;

==Impactor==
The object that hit Jupiter was not identified before Wesley discovered the impact. A 2003 paper estimated comets with a diameter larger than 1.5 kilometers impact Jupiter about every 90 to 500 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Kevin |last=Zahnle |first2=Paul |last2=Schenk |first3=Harold |last3=Levison  |first4=Luke |last4=Dones |year=2003 |month= |title=Cratering rates in the outer Solar System |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume= 163|issue=163 |pages=263â289 |url=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~espoclass/homework/5830_2008_homework/Zahnle2003CrateringRates.pdf |format=pdf |bibcode=  2003Icar..163..263Z|issn= |quote=1.5-km-diameter comets is currently N(d &gt; 1.5 km) = 0.005 +0.006 -0.003 per annum|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5icdGOsFF|archivedate=2009-07-29|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-07-27|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00048-4 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 1997 survey suggested that the astronomer [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Cassini]] may have recorded an impact in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Isshi |last=Tabe |first2=Jun-ichi |last2=Watanabe |first3=Michiwo |last3=Jimbo |year=1997 |month=February |title=Discovery of a Possible Impact SPOT on Jupiter Recorded in 1690 |journal=Publ. of the Astronomical Society of Japan |volume=49 |issue= |pages=L1âL5 |bibcode=1997PASJ...49L...1T |issn= |quote=Jupiter has been continuously monitored for almost 400 yr |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the impacter is believed to have been an asteroid with a diameter of about 200 to 500 meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;PR2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Visibility===
Assuming it was an inactive comet (or asteroid) about 1&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, this object would have been no brighter than about [[apparent magnitude]] 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hergenrother&quot;/&gt; (Jupiter shines about 130 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] times brighter than a 25th magnitude object.)&lt;ref&gt;([[Apparent magnitude|5th root of 100]])^(25-(-2.8))=131 billion (1.3E+11)&lt;/ref&gt; Most asteroid surveys which use a wide field of view do not see fainter than about magnitude 22 (which is 16x brighter than magnitude 25).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hergenrother&quot;/&gt;  Even detecting satellites less than 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter orbiting Jupiter is difficult and requires some of the best telescopes in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=New Satellites of Jupiter Discovered in 2003 |publisher=Carnegie Institution (Department of Terrestrial Magnetism) |author=[[Scott S.
