==Before the season==
===Roster changes===
The Golden Flashes lost four seniors from their 2008â09 roster.  These seniors include the starters [[Al Fisher]], [[Jordan Mincy]], and [[Julian Sullinger]].  Fisher was the team's leading scorer, averaging 14.4 points per game.  The team also lost [[Rashad Woods]], who was suspended last year due to a violation of team rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coles soon to become Miami's win leader |first=Elton |last=Alexander |newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer |date=2009-04-13 |url=http://www.cleveland.com/collegesports/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1231839015183500.xml&amp;coll=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To compensate for the team's losses, four new players joined the Flashes for the 2009â10 basketball season.  Only one of these four players is a freshman, while one sophomore and two juniors are recruits from junior colleges.
