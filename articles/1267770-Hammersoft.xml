'''Social injustice''' is a concept relating to the claimed unfairness or [[justice|injustice]] of a [[society]] in its divisions of rewards and burdens and other incidental inequalities. The concept is distinct from those of justice in law, which may or may not be considered moral in practice, or from the concept of justice within a coherent ideological system, which focuses on just process rather than on incidental inequalities. Opposition to social injustice is increasingly a platform of emerging [[political party|political parties]]. Social injustice arises when the distribution of advantages and disadvantages in society aren't equal.{{Vague|date=July 2009}} ([http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ethics_%28Aristotle%29/Book_Eight?oldid=383658''Aristotle's'' principle of injustice])

Historically, authors have used literature to denounce or to satirize perceived social injustices in their societies.  Some examples are [[Niyi Osundare]], [[Tatamkhulu Afrika]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Charles Dickens]],  [[Dario Fo]], [[Minfong Ho]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Harper Lee]], [[James A. Michener]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Osamu Tezuka]], [[Alan Paton]], and [[George Orwell]].

Social injustice is caused by certain barriers that prevent full social justice.  Some of the major barriers include: [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], [[oppression]], [[racism]], [[casteism]], [[classism]], [[ableism]], [[ageism]], [[stereotyping]] and [[sexism]].
