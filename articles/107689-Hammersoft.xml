Retrieved 2010-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.temple-city.ca.us/ City of Temple City]. Retrieved 2010-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]].   Temple City is part of a cluster of cities, along with [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], [[Rosemead, California|Rosemead]], [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]], [[San Marino]], and [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], in the west [[San Gabriel Valley]] with a rapidly growing [[Asia]]n population. Temple City also has a [[Cuban American|Cuban]] and [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] community, among other [[Latino]] nationalities.  The population was 35,558 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town of Temple was originated on May 30, 1923 when Walter P. Temple (June 7, 1870 - November 13, 1938), ([[Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villageprofile.com/california/templecity/01/topic.html |title=Temple City, History, California, Walter P. Temple, Los Angeles, Historic Society of Temple City |publisher=Villageprofile.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; purchased {{convert|400|acre|km2|0|2}} of land four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) east of San Gabriel which had been part of [[Lucky Baldwin]]'s [[Rancho Santa Anita]].  

Temple, the son and tenth child &lt;ref name=&quot;City of Temple City&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.temple-city.ca.us/rsvp.asp |title=City of Temple City |publisher=Ci.temple-city.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Francisco P. Temple|Pliny Fisk Temple]] and [[Workman-Temple family|William Workman]]'s daughter Antonia Margarita Workman, was born on [[Rancho La Merced]], which is today part of the city of [[Montebello]].&lt;ref name=&quot;californiamissions1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiamissions.com/morehistory/sangabriel.html |title=More California Mission History: San Gabriel |publisher=Californiamissions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the site of the original [[San Gabriel Mission]], founded by the Franciscan Fathers next to the rich bottom lands of the San Gabriel River. Historically called âRio de los Tembloresâ, which means the River of the Earthquakes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerry Jambazian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jerry Jambazian |url=http://www.templecitychamber.org/history.html |title=History of Temple City |publisher=Templecitychamber.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it is today  known as the [[Santa Ana River|Santa Ana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;californiamissions1&quot;/&gt; 

In actuality, these are two separate streams. The Santa Ana River rises in the mountains above San Bernardino and flows through Santa Ana Canyon, thence across central Orange County, reaching the sea at Newport. The San Gabriel reaches the sea along the  boundary between Los Angeles and Orange counties at the east end of Long Beach. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Temple envisioned building a community where average people could afford to live and own their homes.  He then divided the area into lots and laid out the park facing Las Tunas Drive. He named other streets after friends and family:  Workman, Kauffman, Temple and Agnes.  Bond issues initiated by Temple were responsible for street paving and electricity.  Temple also petitioned the [[Pacific Electric Railway Company]] to extend its Los Angeles to [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] line to a depot adjacent to Temple City Park.  The extension of the railway contributed to the steady growth of Temple City.&lt;ref name=&quot;City of Temple City&quot;/&gt;

The town was originally called &quot;City of Temple&quot;, but the Postmaster General demanded a name change in 1926 because the mail was instead being directed to the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] suburb of [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]. It was officially was designated [[Temple City]] but remained a City in name only until after the post-[[World War II]] population explosion.  The redundancy in the name City of Temple City came when Temple City incorporated on May 25, 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerry Jambazian&quot;/&gt;

Currently, Temple City is a destination for [[East Asian]], [[Eastern European]], [[Middle East]] and [[Latino]] immigrants, esp. [[Chinese-American]]s form a large component. Rosemead Boulevard is evidence of its' business [[strip malls]] catering to a largely Asian but diverse customer base. There was a formerly [[African American]] neighborhood in Temple City, the evergrowing presence of [[Indian Americans]] and [[Little Bohemia (Temple City, California)]] where a [[German-American]] community thrived in the early 20th century. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Political corruption==	
Beginning in January 2009, The Los Angeles County district attorney began investigating allegations that Temple City's mayor, Judy Wong, along with city council members David Capra, and former mayor Cathe Wilson &lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=June 10, 2009&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;11:33 am |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/06/temple-citys-mayor-and-two-others-indicted-on-bribery-charges-.html |title=Temple City mayor, two others indicted on bribery, perjury charges &amp;#124; L.A.

Temple City's lawsuit asks that the property, at Las Tunas Drive and Rosemead Boulevard, be returned to the city because of the delays after two groundbreaking ceremonies.

Wong is serving a 16-month sentence at Chowchilla &lt;ref name=&quot;Whit2&quot;/&gt; after pleading no contest to 10 felony counts of bribery, solicitation of bribery and perjury, and she is required to pay $16,700 in restitution to developer Randy Wang. She will have to pay about $16,300 in fines and fees. The judge denied a request from Wong's attorney seeking probation for the onetime politician. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_16041990?source=rss_viewed&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cathe Wilson is charged with three counts each of perjury and bribery. The perjury charges included one count of lying to the [[Los Angeles County]] Grand Jury in 2008 and two counts of submitting false material in Fair Political Practices reports. Although she maintains her innocence, she choose not to plea, and her case was continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_15165705 |title=Former Temple City Councilwoman Judy Wong pleads no contest in corruption case, faces 16 months in state prison |publisher=Pasadena Star-News |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 30, 2011, Cathe Wilson pleaded innocent to all charges. &quot;Oh, yes, I've got to prove my innocence,&quot; Wilson, 78, said at the [[Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center]] when asked if she was going forward with the trial. &quot;I wouldn't put my life savings...if I didn't believe in my innocence. It's all a crock.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_17692490&lt;/ref&gt; In May, 2011 she was convicted  on six felony counts.  &lt;ref name=&quot;Whit2&quot;/&gt; She was sentenced on June 23, 2011 to four years in state prison and to pay more than $10,000 in restitution to the developer&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_18191227?source=rss_viewed&lt;/ref&gt;.

Former candidate Scott Carwile,  Wilson's protege, pleaded guilty to felony perjury and was granted
probation in exchange for testifying against Wilson. &lt;ref name=&quot;Whit2&quot;/&gt;

===Temple City Library===
A new mural was mounted on the west exterior wall of the newly remodeled Temple City Library in the summer of 2011. The mural, which was painted by more than 20 Temple City students  under the tutelage of West Los Angeles-based muralist Art Mortimer, is the first project of the city's public art advisory group formed in February.  The creation of the 8-foot high, 28-foot wide mural was a partnership between the city, the advisory group, Los Angeles County and the Temple City Unified School District and designed by Temple City High school students.  It shows famous authors, and is an &quot;interesting and unique way of showing what's inside the library,&quot; Mortimer said.  Further stating that  &quot;The way they depict famous writers throughout history, the things they put in the background, such as books with wings, and their ways of showing the importance of the library in the community was very charming the way they did it.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgvtribune.com/ci_18571300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual events==
===Camellia Festival===
'''History''': In 1944 a contest held by the Woman's Club of Temple City brought forth a slogan &quot;Temple City, Home of Camellias&quot;, from which stemmed the annual Camellia Festival.
It was in recognition of the significance of family life  that the Camellia Festival was founded. The festival, which has attracted national recognition in ensuing years, is sponsored by the City of Temple City. Its purpose is to encourage every youngster in the community to belong to one of recognized youth organizations and to participate in the affairs of their community.
Only members of recognized organizations are  eligible to enter the Camellia Festival Parade.  The Royalty Coronation of two first graders is held the first Friday of February. 

The annual Temple City Camellia Festival takes place the last weekend in February. A parade begins the celebration on Saturday morning. The parade commences at the corner of  Las Tunas Drive and Rosemead Blvd.  Commercial floats are not allowed in the parade,  all work is done by the youth and carry the theme of the year.   A carnival is part of the three-day festivities, where the public may enjoy the hometown atmosphere in Temple City Park, while they participate in games booths and food booths, manned by local service and youth organizations. Varied Cultural entertainment events are open to the community and welcomed guests.&lt;ref&gt;http://74.6.146.127/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=temple+city+camellia+festival&amp;fr=moz35&amp;u=www.ci.temple-city.ca.us/Camellia%2520Festival/2009%2520Camellia/2009%2520Camellia%2520History.pdf&amp;w=temple+city+camellia+festival&amp;d=d4-3RO8_U5Cq&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us&amp;sig=lazKXxuPLzbdNentgxQwEw--&lt;/ref&gt;

What began in 1944 started by the Womenâs Club of Temple City as a small parade of youngsters who tossed camellia blossoms to parade watchers, has now become a signature event in Temple City attracting an estimated 5000 children and more than 20,000 visitors to Temple City each year.
The Camellia Festival is held on the last weekend in February which is only a part of the three day festival. A carnival in Temple City Park as well as an Art show.&lt;ref&gt;http://templecitytribune.com/community/67th-camellia-festival-kick-off-breakfast-announces-grand-marshal-and-other-dignitaries/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parish Fiesta===

The Temple City Board of Education proclaims their district as &quot;A District of Distinguished Schools&quot; because every school in the Temple City district has been designated a &quot;distinguished school&quot; by the [[State of California]], at some time. This honor indicates that Temple City Schools are in a higher [[percentile]] in categories such as academics, deportment and other scholastic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ |title=California School Recognition Program (CA Dept of Education) |publisher=Cde.ca.gov |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
