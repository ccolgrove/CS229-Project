'''Reuben James''' (c. 1776 â 3 December 1838) was a [[Gunner's Mate (United States Navy)|Boatswain's Mate]] of the [[United States Navy]], famous for his heroism in the [[Barbary Wars]].

==Career==
Born in [[Delaware]] around 1776, James joined the United States Navy and served on several ships, including the frigate {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}}. During the Barbary Wars, the American frigate {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|2}} was captured by the [[Barbary pirates]] when it ran aground in the city of [[Tripoli]], on the southern shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]], along with a group of volunteers that included Reuben James, entered the harbor of Tripoli under the cover of darkness in an attempt to burn the ''Philadelphia'' so that the pirates could not use her.

The volunteers boarded the ''Philadelphia'' on 16 February 1804 and were met by Barbary pirates who were guarding their prize.  In the ensuing hand-to-hand combat, Reuben James, with both of his hands already wounded, positioned himself between Lieutenant Decatur and a sword-wielding pirate. Willing to give his life for his captain, James took a blow from the sword and survived. 

James continued his Naval career, serving many years with Decatur. He was forced to retire in January 1836 because of ill health. He died in 1838 at the U.S. Naval Hospital in [[Washington, DC]].

==Influence==
[[USS Reuben James|Three warships]] of the Navy have been named ''Reuben James'' in his honor:
* {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|3}}, a four-stack {{sclass|Clemson|destroyer}}
* {{USS|Reuben James|DE-153|3}}, a {{sclass|Buckley|destroyer escort}}
* {{USS|Reuben James|FFG-57|3}}, an {{sclass|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate}}

There are two songs with the title ''Reuben James'':
* ''[[Reuben James (Woody Guthrie song)|The Sinking of the Reuben James]]'' is a folk song written by [[Woody Guthrie]] about the ship {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|3}} and her sinking while on convoy duty shortly before the U.S. entered [[World War II]]. It became a hit by the [[The Kingston Trio|Kingston Trio]].
* The second song has no connection with the mariner. It was a hit for [[The First Edition|Kenny Rogers and the First Edition]] in 1969, written by [[Barry Etris]], and is devoted to his father (see the details at [http://www.barryetris.com/article-032389.html The Art &amp; Music of Barry Etris]).

[[James Island (San Juan Islands)|James Island]] of Washington state was named for James.&lt;ref name=majors&gt;{{Cite book| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | page = 23 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 9780918664006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
