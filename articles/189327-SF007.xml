'''SpiderMonkey''' is the code name for the first-ever [[JavaScript engine]], written by [[Brendan Eich]] at [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape Communications]], later released as [[open source]] and now maintained by the [[Mozilla Foundation]].

==History==
Eich &quot;wrote JavaScript in ten days&quot; in 1995,&lt;ref name=BE201106&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=BrendanEich.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
having been &quot;recruited to Netscape with the promise of âdoing [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]â in the browser&quot;.&lt;ref name=BE200804&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/

(The idea of using Scheme itself was abandoned when &quot;engineering management [decided] that the language must âlook like Javaâ&quot;.&lt;ref name=BE200804/&gt;)
In fall 1996, Eich, needing to &quot;pay off [the] substantial [[technical debt]]&quot; left from the first year, &quot;stayed home for two weeks to rewrite Mocha as the codebase that became known as SpiderMonkey&quot;.&lt;ref name=BE201106/&gt; The name SpiderMonkey was chosen as a reference to the movie [[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]], in which the character Tom Anderson mentions that the title characters were &quot;whacking off like a couple of spider monkeys.&quot;&lt;ref name=BE201108&gt;{{cite web

  |first=Brendan |last=Eich |authorlink=Brendan Eich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, Eich transferred &quot;ownership&quot; of the SpiderMonkey code to Dave Mandelin.&lt;ref name=BE201106/&gt;

==Standards==
SpiderMonkey implements ECMA-262 edition 5 ([[ECMAScript]]), along with ECMA-357 ([[E4X]]) and several additional features.

Even though SpiderMonkey is used in Firefox, it does not itself provide host environments such as [[Document Object Model]] (DOM).

==Internals==
SpiderMonkey is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and contains a [[compiler]], [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]], two [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilers ([[JÃ¤gerMonkey]] and [[TraceMonkey]]), [[decompiler]], [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]], and standard classes.  A new JIT compiler, [[IonMonkey]], is currently in development.&lt;ref name=&quot;mozilla1&quot;&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Features/IonMonkey&lt;/ref&gt;

===TraceMonkey===
Mozilla has added optimization using [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz/Site/pubs-pdf/ICS-TR-07-12.pdf &quot;Trace Trees&quot;] to SpiderMonkey. Released June 30, 2009, [[Mozilla Firefox 3.5|Firefox 3.5]] includes this new optimization technique which offers &quot;performance improvements ranging between 20 and 40 times faster in some cases&quot; (compared to [[Firefox 3]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080822-firefox-to-get-massive-javascript-performance-boost.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because of improvements to JÃ¤gerMonkey, it became unneeded and been disabled. It will be removed in Firefox 11.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.mozilla.com/nnethercote/2011/11/01/spidermonkey-is-on-a-diet/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== JÃ¤gerMonkey ===
JÃ¤gerMonkey is an additional optimization to the engine in [[Firefox 4]]. It improves speed in cases where TraceMonkey optimizations fail to improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailopan.net/blog/?p=683&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hunted/&gt;

The most publicized optimization in JÃ¤gerMonkey is &quot;method-based JIT&quot; (that compiles code one method at a time) using [[inline threading]] (see &lt;ref&gt;http://blog.mozilla.com/dmandelin/2008/08/27/inline-threading-tracemonkey-etc/&lt;/ref&gt;) and implements [[Polymorphic Inline Cache|PICs]], but there were multiple other optimizations implemented for Firefox 4.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/JaegerMonkey&lt;/ref&gt; To implement method JIT, Mozilla reused the assembler from Nitro, [[WebKit]]'s JavaScript engine.&lt;ref name=hunted&gt;http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/03/mozilla-borrows-from-webkit-to-build-fast-new-js-engine.ars&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between TraceMonkey and JÃ¤gerMonkey JIT techniques and the need for both was explained in [http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/03/improving-javascript-performance-with-jagermonkey/ a hacks.mozilla.org article]. A more in-depth explanation of the technical details was provided by Chris Leary, one of SpiderMonkey developers, [http://blog.cdleary.com/2010/09/picing-on-javascript-for-fun-and-profit/ in a blog post]. More technical information can be found in other developer's blogs: [http://www.bailopan.net/blog/ dvander], [http://blog.mozilla.com/dmandelin/ dmandelin].

===IonMonkey===
IonMonkey is the name of Mozillaâs new JavaScript JIT compiler, which aims to enable many new optimizations in the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;mozilla1&quot;/&gt;

The new JIT infrastructure will feature [[Static single assignment form|SSA]] compiler [[intermediate representation]]s, which will facilitate advanced optimizations such as type specialization, [[function inlining]], linear-scan [[register allocation]], [[dead code elimination]], and [[loop-invariant code motion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/05/ionmonkey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
SpiderMonkey is intended to be embedded in other applications that provide host environments for JavaScript. An incomplete list follows:
* [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], [[SeaMonkey]], and other applications that use the [[Mozilla application framework]]
* [[Adobe Acrobat]] and Adobe Reader, [[Adobe Flash Professional]], and [[Adobe Dreamweaver]].
* [[GNOME]] desktop environment, version 3 and later.
* [[Yahoo! Widgets]] (formerly known as &quot;Konfabulator&quot;)
* [[UOX]]3, an ''[[Ultima Online]]'' server emulator.
* [[Sphere (program)|Sphere]] suite of applications primarily intended to aid in the design of [[role-playing game]]s.
* The [[Methabot]] web crawler uses SpiderMonkey in a multi-threaded environment for running user-provided filetype and URL parsers.
* It is also used in [[CouchDB]] database system written in [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] - JavaScript is used for defining maps, filters, reduce functions and viewing data for example in HTML format.
* [[MongoDB]], another [[NoSQL]] database system uses SpiderMonkey for server-side JavaScript execution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Building+Spider+Monkey&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[FreeSWITCH]], open-source telephony engine, uses SpiderMonkey to provide users with ability to write call management scripts in JavaScript.
* [[SPOT SIP Engine]], a standards-based commercial computer telephony product
* [[ELinks]], a text-based web browser, uses SpiderMonkey to support JavaScript.&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxjournal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolso|first=Erik Inge|title=2005 Text Mode Browser Roundup|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8148?page=0,1|publisher=[[Linux Journal]]|accessdate=5 August 2010|date=8 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parts of SpiderMonkey are used in the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project's [[Jscript]] (re-)implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-cvs/2008-September/047548.html wine-cvs mailing list], September 16, 2008: âjscript: Added regular expression compiler based on Mozilla regexp implementationâ&lt;/ref&gt;
* SpiderMonkey is also used in a number of other open-source projects, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/FOSS
* [[Riak]] uses SpiderMonkey as the runtime for Javascript MapReduce operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basho.com/blog/technical/2010/02/03/the-release-riak-0.8-and-javascript-mapreduce/|accessdate=2011-04-24|title=The Release Riak 0.8 and JavaScript Map/Reduce}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Synchronet]], a BBS, E-Mail, Web and application server using the SpiderMonkey engine.
* [[JavaScript OSA]], a SpiderMonkey [[inter-process communication]] language for the [[Macintosh computer]]

SpiderMonkey includes a JavaScript Shell for interactive JavaScript development and for command-line invocation of JavaScript program files.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Several{{quantify|date=December 2010}} large organizations use SpiderMonkey for managing their JavaScript for front-end applications.
