'''[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City Football Club]]''' is an [[England|English]] professional [[association football|football]] club founded in 1880 as ''St Marks (West Gorton)'' and currently based in east [[Manchester]], [[Sportcity]] near [[Gorton]] where the club originally originated. The club's main colour is a distinctive light blue.

As ''St Marks (West Gorton)'' they played in a [[black]] strip from 1884â1887 and then in blue and white strips as ''Ardwick F.C.'' during 1887-1894. Since their inception as ''Manchester City Football Club'' in [[1893â94 Ardwick A.F.C. season|1894]], the club's main colour evolved over time into the colour of [[Light blue (color)|light blue]] and have always maintained this as the main home colour in all of their kits to date.

The club runs a series of partnerships and sponsorships with various companies. Their main partnership is with [[Etihad Airways]] with the club having a deal until 2021 which features broad agreement across many fronts unlike other football club sponsorship deals. Other partnership deals include [[EA Sports]] and [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] with a deal expected with [[Disney]]-owned [[ESPN]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mega-bucks Manchester City taking the Mickey as Disney snub Chelsea for rivals |last=Lawton |first=Matt |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1314406/Manchester-City-taking-Mickey-Disney-snub-Chelsea-rivals.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=1 September 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Manchester City is often referred to as '''Man City''' purely out of convenience as a shorter name. The club are perhaps the most known club with the title of City in their name, hence why the club are often just referred to as '''City'''. Other nicknames include '''The Blues''' and '''The Citizens''', which is more often used outside England.

==Traditional colours==
===Sky blue===
The first use of sky blue for a Manchester City was the season in which Manchester City formed in 1894 changing from Ardwick.

===Black===

Reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City pp. 14â15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red and black===
A booklet entitled ''Famous Football Clubs â Manchester City'' published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black.

In the 1960s, [[Malcolm Allison]], then assistant manager to [[Joe Mercer]] insisted on the club wearing red and black striped away shirts. The belief was Allison wished to replicate the colours of [[AC Milan]] to inspire his players and give the team confidence.

Strangely enough, the idea worked and in the ensuing years won the [[1969 FA Cup Final]] and 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup in red and black and were recognised as one of the most exciting teams in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The top 50 football kits |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2537973.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kit was revived in 2004 for one season. But when the 2010-11 season saw past City greats such as [[Malcolm Allison]], [[Neil Young (footballer born 1944)|Neil Young]] and [[Mike Doyle (footballer)|Mike Doyle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mike Doyle 1946-2011 |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Club-news/Mike-Doyle-1946-to-2011 |work=Manchester City F.C. |date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; pass away the red and black strips were revived in the away kit for the 2011-12 season. The club unveiled the red and black away kit at the homecoming parade in May 2011 when the club paraded their first FA Cup triumph since the red and black team of the 1960s and early 70s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=City revive red and black for 11/12 away kit |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/club-news/2011/may/manchester-city-revive-red-and-black-for-next-seasons-away-kit |work=Manchester City F.C. |date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home kit===

Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white, which have been since Ardwick F.C. consolidated into Manchester City in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historical Football Kits - Manchester City |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Manchester_City/Manchester_City.htm |publisher=historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current kit features a tonal soundwave across the chest of the shirt, taken from the [[Manchester City F.C. supporters|Manchester City supporters]] singing their rendition of &quot;[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=New City home kit launched |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Club-news/2011/July/New-Manchester-City-home-kit-revealed |work=Manchester City F.C. |date=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Away kit===
Traditional away [[kit (football)|kit]] colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several different colours have been used. One of the most famous City away kits is the black and red striped shirt, reminiscent of [[AC Milan]]'s home shirt. The idea for red and black away colours came from former assistant manager [[Malcolm Allison]], who believed that adopting the colours of [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] would inspire City to glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Nicking the shirts off their backs| work=The Guardian| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1643916,00.html| accessdate=18 December 2006 | location=London | first=Georgina | last=Turner | date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another favourite is the 1998 navy blue and luminous yellow stripes shirt, which was used in the 1998 Division 2 play-off final.&lt;ref name=&quot;yb&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clayton |first=David |title=Everything Under The Blue Moon |isbn=1-84018-687-9}} pp. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  The shirt is considered lucky as Manchester City scored two late goals in stoppage time and draw the game and went on to seal a remarkable victory on penalties after extra time.&lt;ref name=&quot;yb&quot;/&gt;

===Special kits===
Two known special kits have been known to have been used on occasion. In 1956, Manchester City featuring players such as [[Don Revie]], [[Bert Trautmann]] and [[Ken Barnes]] went to Wembley for the FA Cup Final in a special maroon pinstriped kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=English FA Cup Finalists  1950â59 |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1950-1959.html |publisher=historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club also wore a sky blue kit without sponsorship during the 2007â08 league [[Manchester derby]] at [[Old Trafford]] to mark the [[Munich Air Disaster#50th anniversary|50th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd 1â2 Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7223971.stm |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scarves==
[[File:Roberto Mancini - side.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Roberto Mancini]] popularised the use of split blue and white scarves in the colours of Manchester City]]
In recent years, the club has become synonymous with plain blue and white 'split' scarves which were common in the pre-1970s in football. The blue and white scarf gained prominence under manager [[Roberto Mancini]] who continued his tradition of wearing a scarf of the club's colours which he manages. Mancini first wore a scarf when taking over as manager of Manchester City in December 2009 subsequently the club sold out of the scarves.

In 2011, the red and black colours worn by City in the last 1960s and early 1970s were revived in scarf form. During Manchester City's FA Cup run in 2010-11, the club were drawn against [[Leicester City]]. City bowed to pleas from [[Manchester City F.C. supporters|Manchester City supporters]] to honour [[Neil Young]], the scorer of Manchester City's winning goal in the [[1969 FA Cup Final]] and who had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Consequently the club decided to produce special red and black scarves for supporters to take to Leicester for the third round tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Roberto Mancini to lead red-and-black scarf tribute to Manchester City FA Cup hero Neil Young |last=Ogden |first=Mark |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/8246770/Roberto-Mancini-to-lead-red-and-black-scarf-tribute-to-Manchester-City-FA-Cup-hero-Neil-Young.html |work=Daily Telegraph |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidently, the red and black colours were introduced by former City manager [[Malcolm Allison]] who died earlier in the season and poignantly City won the [[2010-11 FA Cup]], their first since the famous red and black team of 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=A fitting tribute to Neil Young, the man who shone in black and red |last=William |first=Richard |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/jan/11/neil-young-manchester-city |work=Guardian Media Group |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Manchester City decided to commission a tartan to commemorate the links between Selkirk and Manchester City where [[Bobby Johnstone]] was born. The tartan partern will be on various merchandise for winter 2011 including a scarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Selkirk-born football player inspires tartan |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-14253790 |work=BBC |date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest==
City have previously worn two other crests on their shirts. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current crest, inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of [[Lancashire]].

===Current crest===
The current club crest was adopted in 1997, the exact reason of the crest change is believed to have been down to problems copyrighting the pre-1997 crest with the club stating: &quot;''an unsatisfactory situation had developed at Manchester City regarding the licensing out of the round badge on an ad hoc basis which has led to a number of problems with counterfeit goods. This we felt was leading to a devaluing of the Manchester City brand, and consequently its badge in both the modern market and in football.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crestmc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Club Crest |url=http://mcivta.com/club/history.html |publisher=mcivta.com |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some claim this is not the true reason for the new crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City and its Crest |url=http://blog.umbro.com/2009/06/15/city-and-its-crest/ |publisher=blog.umbro.com |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The badge is based on the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the city of [[Manchester]], and consists of a shield in front of a [[golden eagle]]. The shield features a ship on its upper half representing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], and three diagonal stripes in the lower half, for the city's three rivers. The bottom of the badge bears the [[Latin]] motto ''Superbia in Proelio'' which translates as ''Pride in Battle''. Above the eagle and shield are three stars, which are purely decorative. As of 2010 the club has no intention of revising the current crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Points of Blue 15th September 2009 |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Club-news/2009/October/~/media/Files/Final%20Points%20of%20Blue%20Minutes%20090915.ashx |publisher=mcfc.co.uk |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the element of the [[eagle]] in the new badge design was not well received by famous City fan [[Noel Gallagher]], &quot;''It looks like the Lazio badge with that eagle on it. The last badge had a little ship on it going down the Manchester Ship Canal and the rose of Lancashire. When was the last time you saw an eagle in Manchester?''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MCFC Quotes |url=http://www.bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk/Fans/MCFCQuotes.aspx |publisher=bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever Manchester City plays in a major cup final or at [[Wembley]], the club maintains a unique tradition of not wearing the usual crest;&lt;ref name=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Club Info |url=http://mcivta.com/club/ |publisher=mcivta.com |accessdate=12 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead shirts bearing a badge of the [[City of Manchester]] coat of arms are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event.&lt;ref name=&quot;badge&quot;/&gt; This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club.&lt;ref&gt;David Clayton, ''Everything Under the Blue Moon'' (Mainstream Publishing, 2002), 21&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of arms were used since the 1926 FA Cup Final to all major finals at Wembley or in European competition until the [[1981 FA Cup Final]].

The shield base is red with three gold bands diagonally across to the right hand side representing the three rivers of Manchester: the [[River Medlock|Medlock]], the [[River Irwell|Irwell]] and the [[River Irk|Irk]]. The top segment shows a ship in full sail, a reference to the city's trading base and to the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. On a multicoloured wreath is a terrestrial [[globe]], which symbols Manchester's world trade. In the globe, [[bee]]s are depicted in heraldic terms represents efficient industry and the Manchester bee is symbol seen around the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;badge&quot;/&gt; To this day the bee is often used as a shorthand emblem of Manchester and the black and gold colour has been used in Manchester City's kit to represent the Manchester bee. 

The last official acknowledgement that the Manchester coat of arms would adorn the Manchester City shirt at a [[Wembley]] or cup final was when the club released a press release in 1997 revealing their new crest, in which the club stated: &quot;''The new club crest is based on elements from the original &quot;Arms of the City of Manchester&quot;, the crest which is still used by Manchester City PLC today and worn on the team shirt for all Wembley occasions''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crestmc&quot;/&gt;

The home shirt planned for the [[2011 FA Cup Final]] will have the current crest but will have the Manchester coat of arms involved in the numbers on the back of the kit, rather than replacing the current Manchester City crest on the front of the shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Cup final shirt to feature coat of arms |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/club-news/2011/may/manchester-coat-of-arms-on-cup-final-shirt |work=Manchester City F.C. |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etihad partnership ===
The partnership will see Etihad having naming rights to the [[City of Manchester Stadium]], shirt sponsorship, areas in the Eastlands development named after Etihad and investment of Etihad Airways in the Manchester region. The deal has been estimated at a possible value to Manchester City from anywhere of Â£100 to Â£400 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester City bank record Â£400m sponsorship deal with Etihad Airways |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jul/08/manchester-city-deal-etihad-airways |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; over ten years, which takes into account the value of shirt sponsorship, stadium naming rights and naming rights for future, new developments surrounding the stadium.

Manchester City has always maintained close links to [[Umbro]], the company being formed locally in [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]] and currently based in nearby [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] close to Manchester City.

==Motto==
Manchester City's [[Latin]] motto is &quot;''Superbia in Proelio''&quot; which means &quot;''Pride in Battle''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Which clubs have Latin on their badges? |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/aug/31/theknowledge.sport |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=31 August 2004 |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What's in a motto? |quote=Man City's motto means &quot;pride in battle&quot; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6248670.stm |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club motto was adopted in 1997 to coincide with the new club crest.&lt;ref name=&quot;crestmc&quot;/&gt;

==Mascot==
Like all clubs in the [[Premier League]], Manchester City have a mascot, two in this case. Both are [[anthropomorphic]] [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], called Moonchester and Moonbeam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchester City Mascot: Moonchester |url=http://www.footballmascots.co.uk/ManchesterCity.php |publisher=footballmascots.co.uk |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a play on words with ''Moon-'' named after the club's unofficial anthem, &quot;[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]&quot; and ''-chester'' being the last part of [[Manchester]], where the club was formed and is based. Both aliens come from the planet 'Blue Moon'.
