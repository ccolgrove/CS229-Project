== History ==
[[File:Carmonahymn.ogg|250px|thumb|right|Carmona Hymn - Carmona, Cavite]]
According to a research conducted in 1982, by Sangguniang Bayan members composed of Ernesto Zamora, Salvador P. Manahan, Pio Purificacion, Narciso Levardo, Romy Laurito, assisted by Municipal Secretary Rogelio D. Paular, it was found out that the history of Carmona began during the 15th century. As related by reliable informant, three brothers coming from the mountain of [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]] were said to be the first settlers in the place which was then called  âLatagâ, a tagalog word for âplainâ due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. The settlement was not known to other residents of Silang until some of them also went down to the place, cleared some forest areas and established their residence.

In 1595, Silang became a town and '''Latag''' was annexed as a part since then. Latag gradually developed into a community whose residents struggled hard to make it a town. Their burning desires were filled with hopes and fulfillment in 1856 when their move for the conversion of Latag into a town was spearheaded by a leader named Tiburcio Purificacion. Finally, by virtue of a decree issued on February 20, 1857 by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de Norzagaray, Latag became a separate municipality with the name as it bears today: [[Carmona]], that choose to the town of Carmona in the province of [[Province of Seville|Seville, Spain]]. Yet until now, it is not known where the name originated.

During the Philippine Revolution in 1896, the gobernadorcillo of Carmona was Kapitan Damian Ermitano after the administrations of Tiburcio Purificacion, Mariano Mapanoo and Donald C.Virtucio,augusto manaog and Fabian Tenedero .

After the revolution and the occupation of the country by the Americans in 1901, the first local executive of Carmona was Martin Reyes who was followed next by Marcelo Reyes, Prudencio Torres, Juan Alumia, Estanislao Paular, Marciano Mapanoo, and Juan Zamora.

The mayors who assumed office after World War II were the following honorable men: Bernardo Hebron, Eulalio Reyes and Cesar Casal and Felino L. Maquinay. In 1959, the district of San Gabriel and San Jose of Barangay Kabilang Baybay was purchased by the National Government for the relocation of squatters from [[Metro Manila]]. On March 14, 1981, the relocation site, which teemed with people from almost every part of the country and was more popularly known as resettlement area became an independent municipality called [[Gen. Mariano Alvarez, Cavite|General Mariano Alvarez]].

There are 217 farmers in the Municipality engage in planting and farming. Crops and livestock farmers are distributed in 14 barangay of Carmona.

However, with the implementation of CALABARZON growth area, the municipality of Carmona has slowly become an industrial enclave in the province. The advent of industrialization has threatened the agricultural base of Carmona. As of April 1999, land used for rice production has gone down; sugarcane plantation has decreased considerably and those land uses for other crops and vegetables totaled 84.5 hectares during the same year.

At present, the programs and services of the Department of Agriculture (DA) are focused on five priority programs such as sustained self-sufficiency program for rice and corn, strengthening of production market linkage, acceleration of livelihood program, aggressive assistance to organizational development of farmers and assistance to agriculture related priority program of other government agencies.

Based on reports of the municipal Agricultural Officer, the total livestock and poultry production in the municipality is still below the sufficiency level for beef, pork meat and eggs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carmona.com.ph/eco_agriculture.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===

Industrialization in the 90s account for the rapid growth of Carmona's business community from an otherwise quaint agricultural town in the 1950s.  Brought about by huge capital from the national government, the industrial complexes bolstered the increase of the municipality's revenues and the change in the people's lifestyle.

===Festivals===

* '''Sorteo Festival'''

Carmona is the only municipality in the Philippines that observes a triennial draw of its communal lands among its locals - a practice that dates back to the country's Spanish colonization period. It is celebrated every 3 years from February 16 to 22.

After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as &quot;SORTEO&quot; . Since then, &quot;sorteo&quot; has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on land ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. The traditional practice of &quot;Sorteo&quot; defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions on land conflicts.

An age-old tradition celebrating the town as an agricultural haven which is celebrated every 3 years. It is highlighted by an agro-industrial fair.

[[Image:St.josephparishchurch.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The St. Joseph Parish Church.]]
[[Image:Churchduringamass.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Inside in St. Joseph Parish Church during a mass.]]

[[Saint Joseph]], the spouse of Mary, has been one of the most popular patron saints in Cavite. This is attested by the fact that four parishes and numerous barangays of Cavite are dedicated to him.

Carmona was the first parish in Cavite to have been dedicated to St. Joseph. Originally, Carmona was a barrio of Silang. Its old name was Latag, a Tagalog word which means âplain.â The town (its barrios before) constituted a vast expanse of leveled land. This plain was cleared by settlers and became mostly rice fields. As a barrio, it was civilly and ecclesiastically under Silang.

Silang got into a conflict with the hacienda administrator of the Dominican Hacienda of BiÃ±an. In this dispute, it seemed that the local leaders of Silang conducted themselves with great propriety and dignity. The Spanish government recognized this effort. So pleased was the King of Spain that when this honorable people sent a petition to the King, the latter did not hesitate to grant their request. On April 14, 1746, King Ferdinand VI issued a royal decree selling the land that was part of Silang comprising the barrio of Latag to the local principalia. Latag was acquired for the amount Two Thousand Mexican pesos. Don Pedro Calderon (the oidor) and Don Alejo Aviles (the escribano) signed the document of sale in the Kingâs behalf while Don Bernabe Javier Manalo and Don Gervacio dela Cruz signed on behalf of the people of Silang. From that time on, a big portion of Latag became a communal land where people could take turns in farming. It was a unique privilege given to them.

The Franciscans were the first to evangelize Silang and its neighboring towns like Indang and Maragondon. It is then safe to say that Latag may have been ministered by the Franciscans, as well. However, in 1599, the Jesuits took over the administration of the parish in Silang. They became ardent propagators of the Christian faith. They went to the different parts of upland Cavite building churches and teaching the faith. It was customary then that the Spanish religious priests concentrated their efforts in the poblacion. It was also customary practice to get Filipino secular clerics who would serve as assistants. They were usually sent to more difficult areas of the parish, usually far from where the center was. Although the road connecting Latag and Silang was too bad, they said masses for the natives and baptized these nativesâ children. The Filipino priest B. D. Eulogio Fabian is believed to have ministered the people.

On February 20, 1857, the King of Spain through Governor General Don Fernando de Norzagaray created the new town of Carmona. Latag was renamed Carmona after the town in Seville, Spain.

By 1854, the administration of Silang was handed over to the Spanish Recollect friars. Imus and DasmariÃ±as were then haciendas owned by the Recollects and were under their spiritual care. From 1768 to 1857, the Filipino priest Eulogio Fabian took care of Latag. On December 15, 1857, the new town of Carmona became an independent parish with St. Joseph as its patron. Fr. Ramon Zueco de San Joaquin became its first Recollect parish priest. The Jesuits who were the former evangelizers must have been influential in choosing St. Joseph as patron of the new town and the Our Lady of the Holy Rosary became its second patroness. A church made of stone and a massive convent was built.&lt;ref&gt;http://stjosephcarmona.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The education sector in Carmona improved in many aspects of endeavor. In line with the local government's thrust of enhancing quality education, the Department of Education (DepEd) particularly the District of Carmona and Carmona National High School, with the full support of the local government unit, implemented various programs and projects that intensified the education sector in achieveing its goals.

As early as 1995, various programs for the improvement of quality education started with a vision of producing competitive students from both the elementary and secondary levels. Carmona posted a literacy rate of 89%. The local government started with the computerization of all schools. Each public school was given computer units and students were provided with computer lessons. This is in consonance with the belief that modern technology and equipment are considered factors in enhancing better education. To address the increasing number of enrollees and students, the LGU conceptualized the construction of 2-storey buildings in different schools in Carmona.

At present, the municipality has substantial number of classrooms and teachers to meet the learning needs of the school age population. As of School Year 2005-2006, the municipality has 50 educational institutions, 28 of which are public schools while 17 are privately run. The public schools are categorized into 18 pre-schools, 9 elementary, 1 secondary, and 1 tertiary school. The private educational institutions are composed of 10 pre-schools, 7 elementary, 3 secondary/high school, and a computer college.&lt;ref&gt;http://carmonagov.net/home/for-residents/education.html&lt;/ref&gt;
