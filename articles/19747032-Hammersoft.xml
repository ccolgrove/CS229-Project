The '''2008â09 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team''' is currently representing [[Gonzaga University]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] men's [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college basketball|competition]]. The Bulldogs, also nicknamed the Zags, have emerged in recent years as a legitimate national power despite playing in the [[mid-major]] [[West Coast Conference]], having appeared in every [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] since their [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]] run to the West Regional finals.

This edition of the Zags was highly touted as one, if not the best, Gonzaga teams of all time. Gonzaga is also scheduled to have one of their toughest schedules ever, by playing teams like Oklahoma State, Maryland, Tennessee (on two occasions), Arizona, Washington State, Portland State, Connecticut, Utah, Memphis, and St. Mary's. Also by being ranked in the top 10, and winning their first seven games, Gonzaga improved their all-time regular-season record to 53â2, while ranked in the top 10, their only two losses being to then #3 Connecticut in a Maui Invitational Championship game, and #4 Memphis. During the course of the season Gonzaga lost to unranked Arizona and Portland State, Arizona becoming the first team to beat Gonzaga as an unranked team while &quot;the Zags&quot; were ranked in the top 10 during the regular season, as well as #2 Connecticut, making UConn the first team to beat Gonzaga twice under these circumstances, Gonzaga's current record while ranked in the top 10 during the regular season is now 54â5. During the streak of losing to #2 UConn in overtime, Portland State, and Utah, Gonzaga lost three games in a row for only the second time in eight years.

The Zags, however, would recover in conference play, becoming one of only two men's teams in NCAA Division I to finish the 2008â09 regular season unbeaten in conference playâthe other being [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] in [[Conference USA]]. They punched their ticket to the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] by crushing [[Saint Mary's College of California|Saint Mary's]] 83â58 in the [[2009 West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|WCC Tournament final]]. Going into the NCAA Tournament, their only loss since New Year's Day was to Memphis, considered a potential #1 seed in the &quot;Big Dance&quot; and ultimately a #2 seed.
