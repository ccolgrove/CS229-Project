The '''Italian elections of 1968''' were held on [[May 19]]. The '''fifth''' Parliament of republican Italy was selected, while voters were 35,566,681 for the [[italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and 33,003,249 for the [[Italian Senate]], with an increment of some 3,000,000 in both elections from 1963.

[[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Democrazia Cristiana]] (DC) remained stable around 38% of the votes. They were marked by a victory of the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party]] (PCI) passing from 25% of [[Italian general election, 1963|1963]] to c. 30% at the Senate, where it presented jointly with the new [[Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity]] (PSIUP), which included members of [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PSI) which disagreed the latter's alliance with DC. PSIUP gained c. 4.5% at the Chamber. The [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] and the [[Italian Social Democratic Party|Democratic Socialist Party]] (PSDI) presented together as the [[Unified Socialist Party (Italy)|Unified Socialist Party]], but gained c. 15%, far less than the sum of what the two parties had obtained separatedly in 1963.

==Electoral system==
[[File:1968 Italian Senate election map.png|thumb|left|220px|Regional pluralities in Senate]]
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system for the Chamber of Deputies. [[Italian province]]s were united in 32 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at national level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

For the Senate, 237 single-seat constituencies were established, even if the assembly had risen to 315 members. The candidates needed a landslide victory of two thirds of votes to be elected, a goal which could be reached only by the German minorities in South Tirol. All remained votes and seats were grouped in party lists and regional constituencies, where a [[D'Hondt method]] was used: inside the lists, candidates with the best percentages were elected.

==Results==
The election was a test for the new organization of the socialist area, which was divided between the new revolutionary and Communist-allied [[Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity]] and the governmental social-democratic federation between PSI and PSDI. The polls said that the split of the PSIUP in [[1964]] had not been a purely parliamentary operation, but the reflex of divisions into the leftist electorate. The result shocked the PSI's leadership, causing the sudden sinking of the social-democratic federation, and an alternance of provisional retirements by the government, firstly led by [[lifetime senator]] [[Giovanni Leone]] and then, through two political crisis, by DC's secretary [[Mariano Rumor]]. Unsuccessfully trying to recover its lost leftist electors, the PSI returned to the alliance with the PCI for the [[Italian regional elections, 1970|regional elections of 1970]], so causing another crisis and a new change of premiership, then led by [[Emilio Colombo]], but the government coalition had continuous problems of instability. Influent [[Giulio Andreotti]] tried to resurrect the [[centrism|centrist]] formula in [[1972]], but he failed, opening the way to the first early election of the republican history.
