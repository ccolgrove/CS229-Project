{{self-ref|For a discussion of case-sensitivity in Wikipedia page titles, see [[Help:Page name]] and [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)]].}}

Text sometimes exhibits '''case sensitivity'''; that is, words can differ in meaning based on differing use of [[majuscule|uppercase]] and [[Lower case|lowercase]] letters. Words with capital letters do not always have the same meaning when written with lowercase letters.
For example, ''Bill'' is the first name of former U.S. president [[Bill Clinton|William Clinton]], who could sign a ''[[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]'' (which is a proposed [[law]] that was approved by [[United States Congress|Congress]]). And a [[Poland|Polish]] person can use [[polishing|polish]] to clean something. In food, the [[Calorie]], with a capital C, is sometimes used to denote 1000 [[calorie]]s of energy.

In computers, some examples of usually case sensitive data are

*[[username]]s
*[[password]]s
*[[filename]]s
*[[Tag (metadata)|tags]]
*[[Command (computing)|commands]]
*[[Variable (programming)|variable]] names
*searching for a [[text string]] within electronic text

Some [[programming language|computer languages]] are case-sensitive ([[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[C (programming language)|C]],&lt;ref name=&quot;k&amp;r1e&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kernighan | first = Brian W. | authorlink = Brian Kernighan | coauthors = [[Dennis M. Ritchie]] | chapter=Chapter 2: Types, Operators and Expressions |pages=33 | title = [[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]] | edition = 1st | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | month = February | year = 1978 | location = [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] | isbn = 0-13-110163-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Matsumoto| first = Yukihiro| authorlink = Yukihiro Matsumoto | chapter=Chapter 2: Language Basics |pages=9 | title = Ruby in a nutshell | edition = 1st | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] | month = January | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-596-00214-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[XML]]). Others are case-insensitive (i.e., not case-sensitive), such as most [[BASIC]]s (an exception being [[BBC BASIC]]), [[SQL]]&lt;ref&gt;Although one can explicitly set a single database or column [[collation]] to be case-sensitive&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]].  There are also languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Prolog]], in which the capitalization of an identifier encodes information about its [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]].

It takes more work for a program to ignore case when comparing data, depending on the data being compared. Usually it suffices in text coded in character sets like [[ASCII]] or [[EBCDIC]] to merely convert the comparand and the data temporarily to one case and then compare. However, it becomes far more challenging in a multi-lingual environment, e.g., using [[Unicode]], since case-conversion rules differ between some languages. 

Case-insensitive operations are sometimes said to '''fold case''', from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lower-case letters coincide. The alternative '''smash case''' is more likely to be used by someone that considers this behaviour a misfeature or in cases wherein one case is actually permanently converted to the other.

In Unix filesystems filenames are usually case sensitive. Current Windows filesystems ([[VFAT]], [[FAT32]], [[NTFS]]) are not case sensitive (there cannot be a readme.txt and a Readme.txt in the same folder) but [[Case preservation|case preserving]], i.e. remembering the case of the letters. The original [[FAT12]] was case insensitive.
