'''Fred Meijer White Pine Trail State Park''' is a {{convert|92|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[Linear park|linear]] [[state park]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]].

The trail extends from northern [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] to [[Cadillac, Michigan|Cadillac]], and it lies on the path graded for the [[Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad]]. The White Pine Trail is a [[rail trail]] park. It was named the &quot;Fred Meijer White Pine Trail State Park&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=508&amp;type=SPRK Fred Meijer White Pine Trail State Park] [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]]&lt;/ref&gt; after a donation by [[Fred Meijer (businessman)|Fred Meijer]].

== History ==
As the railroad ceased operation in the mid-1980s, the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] came to own the rail bed. By 1994 the property was transferred to the [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]], which began replacing the rails with a trail for public recreational use.

== Current Condition ==
The trail extends from Ann Street in Grand Rapids north to Cadillac. The trail has three paved sections: one extending {{convert|22|mi|km}} between [[Comstock Park, Michigan|Comstock Park]] and [[Sand Lake, Michigan|Sand Lake]], another {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch between [[Big Rapids, Michigan|Big Rapids]] and [[Reed City, Michigan|Reed City]], and a 16 mile stretch between Leroy and Cadillac. The Michigan DNR has plans to pave {{convert|7.6|mi|km}} of trail from Russel Road near Cedar Springs to Sand Lake during the summer of 2007.(Completed)

Unpaved sections of the trail are surfaced with packed gravel or [[cinder]]s.

Snowmobiles are permitted to ride the trail North of the Russell Road trailhead to South Street in Cadillac.

Due to reduced public funding for state parks in Michigan, the trail's upkeep depends largely on volunteers.

== Communities Along Trail ==

*[[Comstock Park, Michigan]]

==Plans==
According to the Friends of the White Pine Trail, there are plans to extend the paved areas of the trail. The trail may also be connected to other trail systems in the state, including the Kent Trails system in Grand Rapids and the Musketawa Trail, much as the White Pine Trail already connects with the [[Pere Marquette State Trail]] in [[Reed City, Michigan|Reed City]].
