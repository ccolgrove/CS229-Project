The '''Galt Red Wings''' were a [[junior ice hockey]] team based in [[Galt, Ontario]], now a part of the city of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. They played in the [[Ontario Hockey League|Ontario Hockey Association]] from 1944 to 1947 and were operated as an affiliate of the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Their home arena was the [[Galt Arena Gardens]].

The team was previously the [[Galt Canadians]] during the 1943-44 season. The team gained NHL sponsorship, becoming the Galt Red Wings. The sponsorship lasted for three seasons, with Galt finishing near the top of the league each year. New ownership renamed the team the [[Galt Rockets]] in 1947.

During the 1944-45 season, Galt was led on ice by future [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r [[Gordie Howe]]. The Galt Red Wings reached the league finals for the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]] in 1945, but lost to [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] in four games. The Red Wings returned to the  finals again in 1946-47, led by future Hall of Fame goaltender, [[Terry Sawchuk]], but lost the finals again in four games to the Majors.
