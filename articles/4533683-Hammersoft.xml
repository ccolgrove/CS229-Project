'''''Fallout 3''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] released by [[Bethesda Game Studios]], and the third major installment in the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' series]]. The game was released in North America, Europe and Australia in October 2008, and in Japan in December 2008 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. ''Fallout 3'' takes place in the year 2277, 36 years after the setting of ''[[Fallout 2]]'' and 200 years after the [[post-apocalyptic fiction|nuclear apocalypse]] that devastated the game's world in a future where international conflicts culminated in a Sino-American war in the second half of the 21st century.

The player character is an inhabitant of Vault 101, a survival shelter designed to protect up to 1,000 humans from the [[nuclear fallout]]. When the player character's father disappears under mysterious circumstances, the player is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of [[Washington, D.C.]] to track him down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of human survivors and must battle a myriad of enemies that inhabit the area now known as the &quot;Capital Wasteland&quot;. The game has an attribute and combat system typical of an [[action game|action]] [[Strategy video game|strategy game]] but also incorporates elements of [[survival horror]] games.

Following its release, ''Fallout 3'' received very positive reviews from critics and a number of Game of the Year awards, praising the game's open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system. The [[NPD Group]] estimated that ''Fallout 3'' sold over 610,000 units during its initial month of release in October 2008, performing better than Bethesda Softworks' previous game ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', which sold nearly 500,000 units in its first month. The game has also received post-launch support with Bethesda releasing five [[Fallout 3 expansions|downloadable add-ons]]. The game received controversy upon release, including the use of morphine in the game for Australia, religious and cultural sentiments in India, and sensitivity in Japan due to a mission involving an atomic detonation.

==Gameplay==
===Attributes===
[[Image:Fallout3 special.jpg|thumb|left|The Pip-Boy 3000, shown displaying the player's current skill ratings.]]
The game begins with the main character as a newborn, whereupon the player determines the race, the gender, and the general appearance of their character. As a one year-old baby, the infant reads a child's book titled ''[[SPECIAL (role-playing system)|You're SPECIAL]]'', where the player can set the character's starting S.P.E.C.I.A.L. [[Statistic (role-playing games)|primary attributes]]: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. The character gains a set of Skills with base levels determined by these attributes. At age 16, the player takes the Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test (G.O.A.T.) to determine the three Skills they wish the character to focus on.&lt;ref name=&quot;gspy&quot;/&gt;

As the character progresses through the game, experience points are earned that are used to achieve levels of accomplishment. Upon achieving a new level, the player receives a set of skill points that can be assigned to improve any of the Skill percentages. For instance, increasing the lock pick skill grants the player the ability to pick harder locks to unlock doors and supply crates. A Perk is granted at each level, which offers advantages of varying quality and form. Many Perks have a set of prerequisites that must be satisfied, and new Perks are unlocked every two levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;gspy&quot;/&gt;

An important statistic tracked in the game is [[karma]]. Each character has an aggregate amount of karma that can be affected by the decisions and actions made in the game. Positive karmic actions include freeing captives and helping others. Negative karmic actions include killing good characters and stealing. Beyond acting as flavor for the game's events, karma can have tangible effects to the player, primarily affecting the game's ending. Other effects include altered dialogue with [[non-player character]]s (NPCs), or unique reactions from other characters. Actions vary in the level of karma change they cause; thus, pickpocketing produces less negative karma than the killing of a good character. However, the player's relationships with the game's factions are distinct, so any two groups or settlements may view the player in contrasting ways, depending on the player's conduct. Some Perks require specific karma levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNprev&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/912/912469p1.html |title=Fallout 3 Week: Skills and Perks |last=Clayman |first=David |date=2008-09-23 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and weapons===
Health is separated into two types: general and limb. General health is the primary damage bar, and the player will die if it is depleted. Limb health is specific to each portion of the body, namely the arms, legs, head, and torso. Non-human enemies will sometimes have additional appendages. When a limb's health bar is depleted, that limb is rendered &quot;crippled&quot; and induces a negative status effect, such as blurred vision from a crippled head or reduced movement speed from a crippled leg. Health is diminished when damage is taken from being attacked, falling from great distances, and/or accidental self injury. General health can be replenished by sleeping, using medical equipment (stimpaks), eating food, or drinking water. Limbs can be healed directly by injecting them with stimpaks, by sleeping, or by being healed by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207651/11-tips-for-surviving-fallout-3/|title=11 Tips For Surviving Fallout 3|first=Cameron|last=Lewis|publisher=[[GamePro]]|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2011-08-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100129212821/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207651/11-tips-for-surviving-fallout-3/|archivedate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the health, there are 20 bobbleheads that can be found throughout the game that will give the player bonuses to attributes and skills. Each bobblehead is an iconic Vault-Tec Boy figurine with a different pose. Three of them have to be found in different time periods in the gameplay; otherwise they will be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallout3bobbleheads.com|title=Fallout 3 Bobbleheads|first=Barney|last=Woodland|publisher=[[Fallout 3 Bobbleheads]]|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are secondary health factors that can affect performance. Chief among these is radiation poisoning: most food is irradiated to a small degree, and parts of the world have varying levels of background radiation. As the player is exposed to radiation, it builds up, causing negative effects and eventually death if left untreated. Radiation sickness must be healed by special medicine or doctors. The player can become addicted to drugs and alcohol, and then go through withdrawal symptoms if denied those substances. Both afflictions can blur the player's vision for a few seconds and have a negative effect on SPECIAL attributes until the problem is corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/fallout-3-radiation/|title=Fallout 3 Radiation|publisher=Mahalo|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Items can become degraded and become less effective. Firearms do less damage and may jam during reloading, and apparel becomes gradually less protective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amrich |first=Dan |year=2008 |month=March |title=Fallout 3 |journal=[[Official Xbox Magazine]] |url=http://www.oxmonline.com/article/previews/a-f/fallout-3-0 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080405181101/http://www.oxmonline.com/article/previews/a-f/fallout-3-0 |archivedate=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will eventually result in the item breaking altogether. Items can be repaired for a price from special vendors, or, when the player has two of the same item (or a comparable item), one can be repaired using salvage parts from the other.
Players have the option to create their own weaponry using various scavenged items found in the wasteland. These items can only be created at workbenches, and only if the player possesses the necessary [[schematic]]s or Perk. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each schematic has three copies that can be found. Each copy improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench. A higher repair skill will result in a better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Jacek | last = Halas | url= http://guides.gamepressure.com/fallout3/guide.asp?ID=5791 | title = Fallout 3 Game Guide Unique Weapon Schematics | publisher = Game Pressure | accessdate = 2011-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===V.A.T.S.===
[[Image:Fallout 3 V.A.T.S. Screen.PNG|thumb|V.A.T.S. shown being used. Real-time action is stopped and the player can see the probability of hitting each enemy body part through percentage ratio.]]
The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., plays an important part in combat. While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is paused, and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of &quot;[[bullet time]]&quot;, creating a combat system that the Bethesda developers have described as a hybrid between turn-based and real-time combat. Various actions cost action points, limiting the actions of each combatant during a turn, and the player can target specific body areas for attacks to inflict specific injuries; head shots can be used for quick kills or blinding, legs can be targeted to slow enemies' movements, opponents can be disarmed by shooting at their weapons, and players can drive certain enemies into a [[berserker]] rage by shooting out things like antennae on various overgrown insects and combat inhibitors on armored robots. However, the use of V.A.T.S. also eliminates most of the first-person shooter elements of the game; aiming is taken over by the computer, and the player is unable to move as a means of avoiding attacks. Each body part has a percentage of hit chance, and generally the closer the player character is to an enemy the higher that percentage. The higher level the character using V.A.T.S is, the more likely that character will hit their enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Erik|last=Brudvig|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/912/912254p1.html|title=Fallout 3 Week: Tools of Survival|publisher=IGN|date=2008-09-22|accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allies===
The player can have a maximum [[party (role playing games)|party]] of three, consisting of the player's character, an [[Australian Cattle Dog]] named Dogmeat, and a single [[non-player character]]. Dogmeat can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation and he cannot be replaced (this was changed with the introduction of ''Broken Steel'': the level 22 &quot;Puppies!&quot; perk allows the player to gain a puppy follower if Dogmeat dies);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lopez |first=Miguel | date=2008-03 |title=Fallout 3 Preview |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/fallout-3/865671p1.html |accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;howardpodcast&quot; /&gt; it is possible to not encounter Dogmeat at all depending on how the game is played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DeSanto |first=Mark |date=2008-10 |title=Ars Reviews Fallout 3 |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2008/10/fallout-3-review.ars/3 |publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other NPC can travel with the player at any time, and in order to get another NPC to travel, the first one must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat.

==Plot==
===Setting===
{{Main|Fallout (series)}}
''Fallout 3'' takes place in the year 2277, 200 years after a war over resources that ended in nuclear holocaust in 2077. The setting is a [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]], [[Retro-futurism|retro-future]], covering a region that includes [[Washington, D.C.]], northeast [[Virginia]] and parts of [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fallout.bethsoft.com/eng/info/faq.html|title=FAQ|publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]]|date=2008-05-05|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's landscape includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such as the [[White House]], the [[Jefferson Memorial|Jefferson]] and [[Lincoln Memorial]]s, [[Arlington National Cemetery]] and the [[Washington Monument]]. The area that the game is set in, known in-game as the Capital Wasteland, holds a number of small settlements of the descendants of survivors from the Great War. Many inhabitants were killed during the nuclear holocaust and the Wasteland is now little more than a barren land nearly devoid of healthy water, food, plant and animal life due to the extreme radiation levels, however there is a small settlement in the north of the Capital Wasteland where trees are overgowing the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crispygamer.com/features/2009-08-10/50-things-to-do-in-the-capital-wasteland.aspx|title=50 Things to Do in the Capital Wasteland|publisher=Crispy Gamer|date=2009-08-10|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player begins the game inside Vault 101, where s/he believes s/he is originally born, before venturing out into the Capital Wasteland and facing its many dangers. The Capital Wasteland is home to a number of mutated species of creatures such as two-headed cattle called Brahmin, radscorpions, molerats, and mirelurks. Many of these creatures are generally hostile to the player and will attack on sight. The Wasteland and the city proper is home to several hostile groups, including super mutants, feral ghouls, raiders, slavers, mercenaries, and robots. Of note are the various Vaultsâunderground structures designed as shelters to protect inhabitants from the dangers of nuclear war (and also for more sinister purposes). In the Washington, D.C. area, many of the roads are blocked off with giant piles of rubble. The player can navigate around the city using a system of underground metro tunnels that connect with other locations (loosely based on the real-life [[Washington Metro]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jacek|last=Halas|url=http://guides.gamepressure.com/fallout3/guide.asp?ID=5694|title=Fallout 3 Game Guide|publisher=Game Pressure|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the game takes place following a nuclear war, cultural advancements have stagnated and, as a result, the game contains a 1950s utopian theme as evidenced in-game through posters and billboards with music from the time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jacek|last=Halas|url=http://guides.gamepressure.com/fallout3/guide.asp?ID=5698|title=Fallout 3 Game Guide|publisher=Game Pressure|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
The introductory sequence introduces the player to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, [[Book of Revelation|Revelation 21:6]], which speaks of &quot;the waters of life&quot;. 

The main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his police force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at its center, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ, Three Dog, give the player the moniker of &quot;The Lone Wanderer&quot;. The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the [[Tidal Basin]] and eventually the entire [[Potomac River]] with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.

After investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a [[virtual reality]] program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), an invention of Braun's that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself, his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel. With Project Purity still inoperational even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. With the aid of Fawkes, a highly intelligent, civilized and friendly Super Mutant, the player acquires the G.E.C.K., but is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.

At the Enclave base at [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex|Raven Rock]], the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, [[President of the United States|President]] John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers he is actually a sentient [[supercomputer]] who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in ''Fallout 2'' on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat [[Fallout 2|the plan of then-President Dick Richardson]] using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic &quot;purity&quot; as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. Eden gives the The Wanderer a sample of the new F.E.V. and is allowed to leave or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock with the help of Fawkes and returns to the Citadel. 

With the knowledge they possess the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to enter the extremely irradiated purifier and must enter the code hinted at throught the game, that being [[Book of Revelations|21:6]], and immediately dies from a radiation spike. The player also has the possiblity to enter the F.E.V. sample into the water prior to activation, having adverse effects on the games side quests post-ending.

==Development==
===Interplay Entertainment===
{{See|Van Buren (Fallout 3)}}

''Fallout 3'' was initially under development by [[Black Isle Studios]], a studio owned by [[Interplay Entertainment]], under the working title ''[[Van Buren (Fallout 3)|Van Buren]]''. Black Isle Studios was the developer of the original ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' and ''[[Fallout 2]]''. When Interplay Entertainment went bankrupt and closed down Black Isle Studios before the game could be completed, the license to develop ''Fallout 3'' was sold for a $1,175,000 minimum guaranteed [[advance against royalties]] to [[Bethesda Softworks]], a studio primarily known as the developer of ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Herve |last=Caen |title=Interplay |version=Q2 2004 |publisher=[[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] [[EDGAR]] |date=2004-10-13|url=http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/fetchFilingFrameset.aspx?FilingID=3222135&amp;Type=HTML |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927215630/http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/fetchFilingFrameset.aspx?FilingID=3222135&amp;Type=HTML |archivedate=2007-09-27 |format=[[Form 10-Q]] |accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethesda's ''Fallout 3'' however, was developed from scratch, using neither Van Buren code, nor any other materials created by Black Isle Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tor|last=Thorsen|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/fallout2/news/6198577/video-qanda-fallout-3s-endgame|title=Video Q&amp;A: Fallout 3's Endgame|publisher=GameSpot|date=2008-10-04|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, a playable technology demo of the canceled project was released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Buren Tech Demo|url=http://www.fileplanet.com/176640/170000/fileinfo/Van-Buren-Tech-Demo-%5BCancelled-Fallout-3-Project%5D|publisher=[[FilePlanet]]|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Boyarsky]], art director of the original ''Fallout'', when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said:
{{quote|To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed that we did not get the chance to make the next ''Fallout'' game. This has nothing to do with Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that ''Fallout'' was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe|last=Blancato|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_77/440-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Troika |title=The Rise and Fall of Troika |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=2006-12-26|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bethesda Softworks started working on ''Fallout 3'' in July 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]]|date=2004-07-12|url=http://www.bethsoft.com/news/pressrelease_071204.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061004195839/http://www.bethsoft.com/news/pressrelease_071204.htm|archivedate=2006-10-04|title=Bethesda Softworks to Develop and Publish Fallout 3|accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but principal development did not begin until after ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and its related extras and plug ins were completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fallout 3 360-bound? |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6236061.html |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethesda Softworks decided to make ''Fallout 3'' similar to the previous two games, focusing on non-linear gameplay, story, and [[black comedy]]. Bethesda also chose to pursue an [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating of M (for mature) by including the adult themes, violence, and depravity characteristic of the ''Fallout'' series. They also decided to shy away from the self-referential gags of the game's predecessors that broke the illusion that the world of ''Fallout'' is real. ''Fallout 3'' uses a version of the same [[Gamebryo]] engine as ''Oblivion'',&lt;ref name=&quot;engine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/07/09/1655222/Bethesda-Speaks-On-Gamebryo-Engine-Final-emFallout-3em-DLC |title=Bethesda Speaks On Gamebryo Engine, Final Fallout 3 DLC |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |publisher=Slashdot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed by the team responsible for that game.&lt;ref name=&quot;shacknews20080208&quot;&gt;{{cite interview |last=Hines |first=Pete |title=Interview: Bethesda Softworks' Pete Hines |url=http://www.shacknews.com/extras/2007/020807_petehines_2.x |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070210053336/http://www.shacknews.com/extras/2007/020807_petehines_2.x |archivedate=2007-02-10 |date=2007-02-08 |program=[[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liam Neeson]] was cast as the voice of the player's father.&lt;ref name=&quot;neeson&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Bethesda Softworks Announces Award-Winning Actor Liam Neeson to Play Lead Role in Fallout 3 |url=http://bethsoft.com/news/pressrelease_050807.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070710175056/http://bethsoft.com/news/pressrelease_050807.htm |archivedate=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Bethesda stated that the game was &quot;a fairly good ways away&quot; from release, but that detailed information and previews would be available later in the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;shacknews20080208&quot;/&gt; Following a statement made by Pete Hines that the team wanted to make the game a &quot;multiple platform title&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/529/529773p1.html |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2009-11-25 |title=Talking Fallout 3 |publisher=IGN |first=David |last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; the game was announced by ''[[Game Informer]]'' to be in development for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gameinformer&quot;/&gt;

DO NOT CHANGE THE NUMBERS RELATING TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ENDINGS OF THE GAME IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH. THESE NUMBERS (12 AND 200) ARE CORRECT ACCORDING TO THE OXM MARCH PODCAST AS SOURCED. ANOTHER RELIABLE, VERIFIABLE, AND CURRENT SOURCE (MEANING PUBLISHED AFTER THE MARCH 21, 2008 PODCAST) WOULD BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE THESE NUMBERS SHOULD THEY BE OUTDATED.
--&gt;
During a March 21, 2008 ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' podcast interview, [[Todd Howard]] revealed that the game had expanded to nearly the same scope as ''Oblivion''. There were originally at least 12 versions of the final cutscene, but with further development this expanded to over 200 possible permutations in the final release, all of which are determined by the actions taken by the player.&lt;ref name=&quot;howardpodcast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxmpodcast.com/?p=134|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080327192729/http://www.oxmpodcast.com/?p=134|archivedate=2008-03-27|title=OXM Podcast #107|work=[[Official Xbox Magazine]]|date=2008-03-21|accessdate=2008-08-26}} &lt;!-- The moment of the podcast when the endings are mentioned is 00:37:45 - 00:41:00. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Bethesda Softworks attended [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] [[E3 2008|2008]] to showcase ''Fallout 3''. The first live demo of the Xbox 360 version of the game was shown and demonstrated by Todd Howard, taking place in downtown Washington, D.C. The demo showcased various weapons such as the Fat Man nuclear catapult, the V.A.T.S. system, the functions of the Pip-Boy 3000, as well as combat with several enemies. The demo concluded as the player neared the Brotherhood of Steel-controlled [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] and was attacked by an Enclave patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/882301/fallout-3/videos/fallout3demo1_071408.html |title=''Fallout 3'' Xbox 360 Gameplay |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio====
Several actors of film and video games lent their voices to ''Fallout 3'', including Liam Neeson as James,&lt;ref name=&quot;neeson&quot;/&gt; [[Ron Perlman]] as the game's narrator, [[Malcolm McDowell]] as President John Henry Eden, and [[Odette Yustman]] as Amata Almodovar. Veteran voice actors [[Dee Bradley Baker]], [[Wes Johnson]], [[Paul Eiding]] and [[Stephen Russell]] also provided voice overs for the game. The ''Fallout 3'' soundtrack continued the series' convention of featuring sentimental 1940s big band American popular music, the main theme, and few other side songs recorded by [[The Ink Spots]] and [[The Andrews Sisters]]; in addition to a score written by composer [[Inon Zur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Peckham|url=http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=11669 |title=Gadget review: ''Fallout 3'' |date=2008-10-31 |work=DigitalArts|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack of the game included artists such as [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Billy Munn]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[Bob Crosby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Owen|last=Good|url=http://kotaku.com/5081270/all-the-songs-of-fallout-3 |title=All the Songs of Fallout 3 |date=2008-11-09 |publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and release==
===Trailers===
A teaser site for the game appeared on May 2, 2007, and featured music from the game and concept art, along with a timer that counted down to June 5, 2007. The artists and developers involved later confirmed that the concept art, commissioned before ''Oblivion'' had been released, did not reveal anything from the actual game.&lt;ref name=1up&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/bethesda-launches-teaser-site-real |title=Bethesda Launches Teaser Site For Real ''Fallout 3'' |last=Klepek |first=Patrick |publisher=1UP.com|date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2007-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the countdown finished, the site hosted the first teaser trailer for the game, and unveiled a release date of &quot;Fall 2008&quot;.&lt;ref name=next-gen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5864&amp;Itemid=2 |title=''Fallout 3'' Coming Fall â08 |last=Graft |first=Kris |date=2007-06-05 |work=Next Generation |accessdate=2007-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2007, Bethesda released the ''Fallout 3'' [[teaser trailer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fallout.bethsoft.com/teaser/teaser.html |title=''Fallout 3'' teaser trailer |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2009-11-11 |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press kit released with the trailer indicated that Ron Perlman would be on-board with the project, and cited a release date of Fall 2008. The trailer featured The Ink Spots song &quot;I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire&quot;, which the previous ''Fallout'' developer Black Isle Studios originally intended to license for use in the first ''Fallout'' game. The trailer, which was completely done with in-engine assets, closed with Ron Perlman saying his trademark line which he also spoke in the original ''Fallout'': &quot;War. War never changes&quot;. The trailer showed a devastated Washington, D.C., evidenced by the partially damaged Washington Monument in the background as well as the crumbling buildings that surrounded a rubble-choked city thoroughfare.&lt;ref name=FalloutWashington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/fallout-3/794187p1.html |title=Fallout 3 Trailer Released |accessdate=2007-07-11 |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |date=2007-06-05 |first=Allen 'Delsyn' |last=Rausch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second trailer was first shown during a [[GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley|GameTrailers TV]] E3 special on July 12, 2008. The trailer zoomed out from a ruined house in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, and provided a wider view of the capital's skyline including the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]] and Washington Monument in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2008-fallout-3/36197 |title=E3 2008: Microsoft Press Conference Cam Walkthrough |publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 2008, an extended version of this trailer was made available, which besides the original content, included a Vault-Tec advertisement and actual gameplay. Both versions of the trailer featured the song &quot;[[Dear Hearts and Gentle People]]&quot; as recorded by [[Bob Crosby|Bob Crosby and the Bobcats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/882301/fallout-3/videos/fallout3_security_071408.html |title=''Fallout 3'' Extended E3 Teaser (Requires membership) |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film festival===
On July 11, 2008, as a part of promoting ''Fallout 3'', Bethesda Softworks partnered with [[American Cinematheque]] and ''[[Geek Monthly|Geek Monthly magazine]]'' to sponsor &quot;A Post-Apocalyptic Film Festival Presented by ''Fallout 3''&quot;. The festival took place on August 22â23 at Santa Monica's Aero Theater. Six post-apocalyptic movies were shown which depict life and events that could occur after a world-changing disaster, including ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'', ''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'', ''[[A Boy and His Dog]]'', ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', ''[[The Omega Man]]'', and ''[[Twelve Monkeys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fallout.bethsoft.com/eng/home/pr-071108.php |title=A Post-Apocalyptic Film Festival Presented by Fallout 3 |accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downloadable content==

Bethesda's Todd Howard first confirmed during E3 2008 that [[downloadable content]] (DLC) would be prepared for the Xbox 360 and Windows versions of ''Fallout 3''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoPS3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/888/888898p1.html |title=E3 2008: ''Fallout 3'' to Have Console Exclusive Downloadable Content |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-07-14 |first=Jack |last=DeVries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edge MUM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/bethesda-mum-fallout-3-dlc-exclusivity-deal |title=Bethesda Mum on Fallout 3 DLC Exclusivity Deal |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Online]] |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-07-21 |first=Kris |last=Graft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claudine|last=Beaumont|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/3520398/Fallout-3-downloadable-content-announced.html|title=Fallout 3 downloadable content announced|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five DLCs: ''Operation: Anchorage'', ''The Pitt'', ''Broken Steel'', ''Point Lookout'', and ''Mothership Zeta'', released in that order. Of the five, ''Broken Steel'' has the largest effect on the game, altering the ending and allowing the player to continue playing past the end of the main quest line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/exclusive-fallout-3s-broken-steel-to-change-the-end-of-the-game |title=EXCLUSIVE: Fallout 3's &quot;Broken Steel&quot; to Change the End of the Game: Games: UGO |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=2009-11-11 |first=Russ |last=Frushtick |date=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, there was no downloadable content announced for the PlayStation 3 version of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoPS3&quot;/&gt; Although Bethesda had not offered an official explanation as to why the content was not released for PlayStation 3, [[Lazard Capital Markets]] analyst Colin Sebastian speculated that it may have been the result of a money deal with Bethesda by [[Sony]]'s competitor, [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edge MUM&quot; /&gt; When asked if the PlayStation 3 version would receive an update that would enable gameplay beyond the main quest's completion, Todd Howard responded, &quot;Not at this time, no.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/01/23/no-ending-update-ps3-fallout/ |title=Bethesda Wonât Commit To PS3 âFallout 3â² Getting Ability To Play Post-Ending Â» MTV Multiplayer |publisher=MTV |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2009-01-23 |first=Patrick |last=Klepek}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May 2009, Bethesda announced that the existing DLC packs (''Operation: Anchorage'', ''The Pitt'' and ''Broken Steel'') would be made available for the PlayStation 3; the later two (''Point Lookout'' and ''Mothership Zeta'') were released for all platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bethesda-doing-more-fallout-3-dlc |title=Bethesda doing more Fallout 3 DLC |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2009-11-11 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Robert |last=Purchese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2009, a [[Xbox Live#New Xbox Experience|New Xbox Experience]] premium theme for the game was released for the Xbox 360. Consumers could pay 240 Microsoft Points, or by having downloaded all other downloadable content. The PlayStation 3 received a free theme, featuring a Brotherhood of Steel Knight in the background, and includes symbols from the game as icons on the PS3 home menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/17/fallout-3-premium-theme-available-now-free-to-loyal-dlc-buyers/ |title=Fallout 3 premium theme available now, free to loyal DLC buyers |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2009-09-17 |first=Alexander |last=Sliwinski}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games.gearlive.com/playfeed/article/q309-free-fallout-3-premium-theme-dlc/ |title=Bethesda gives free Fallout 3 premium theme to DLC buyers |publisher=Playfeed |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2009-10-01 |first=Andru |last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5360741/free-fallout-3-premium-360-theme-for-dlc-fans |title=Free Fallout 3 Premium 360 Theme For DLC Fans |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2009-09-16 |first=Mike |last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008 the official [[Level editor|editor]], known as the G.E.C.K.

''Fallout 3'' received critical universal acclaim, with an average [[GameRankings]] score of 92.79% for the Xbox 360,&lt;ref name=&quot;GR 360&quot; /&gt; 90.77% for the PC&lt;ref name=&quot;GR PC&quot; /&gt; and 90.06% for the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR PS3&quot; /&gt; [[1UP.com]]'s Demian Linn praised its open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system. While the V.A.T.S. system was called &quot;fun&quot;, enemy encounters were said to suffer from a lack of precision in real-time combat and little variety in enemy types. The review concluded, ''Fallout 3'' is a &quot;hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1UP.com review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/fallout-3|title=Fallout 3 Review|first=Demian |last=Linn|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] editor Erik Brudvig praised the game's &quot;minimalist&quot; sound design, observing, &quot;you might find yourself with nothing but the sound of wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across the barren plains ... ''Fallout 3'' proves that less can be more&quot;. The review noted that the &quot;unusual amount of realism&quot; combined with the &quot;endless conversation permutations&quot; produces &quot;one of the most truly interactive experiences of the generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/924/924165p1.html|title=Fallout 3 Review A bleak, twisted, yet utterly wonderful game.|last=Brudvig|first=Erik |date=2008-10-27|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-06-23|page=5}} &quot;The difference in looks between the two console versions is small compared to the leap that comes with a top of the line PC&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the game for [[Kotaku]], Mike Fahey commented that &quot;While Inon Zur's score is filled with epic goodness, the real stars of ''Fallout 3'''s music are the vintage songs from the 1940s&quot;.&lt;ref name=kotaku&gt;{{cite web|title=Fallout 3 Review: Wasting Away Again In Radiationville |date=2008-10-29 |first=Mike |last=Fahey |publisher=Kotaku|url=http://kotaku.com/5070394/fallout-3-review-wasting-away-again-in-radiationville|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Will Tuttle of [[GameSpy]] commended the game for its &quot;engaging storyline, impeccable presentation, and hundreds of hours of addictive gameplay&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/fallout-3/924342p3.html|title=Fallout 3|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' awarded the game 7 out of 10, in a later anniversary issue it placed the game 37th in a &quot;100 best games to play today&quot; list, saying &quot;â¬''Falloutâ­ â¬3â­'' â¬empowers,â­ â¬engages and rewards to extents that few games have ever achieved&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edge list&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/100-best-games-play-today|title=100 Best Games to Play Today|publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Online]]|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical issues===
Shortly before the game's release, IGN posted a review of the game citing numerous bugs and crashes in the PlayStation 3 release.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Neoseeker&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/9108-ign-edits-fallout-3-review-to-remove-mention-of-major-issue-bug-found-in-ps3-version/ |title=IGN edits Fallout 3 review to remove mention of &quot;major issue&quot; bug found in PS3 version |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2009-11-18 |first=Kevin |last=Spiess |publisher=Neoseeker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also contained a bug causing the game to freeze and the screen to blur when friends signed out of and into the [[PlayStation Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Neoseeker&quot; /&gt; The IGN review was edited shortly thereafter, removing all references to the PS3 version's bugs, causing controversy in the PlayStation communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Neoseeker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PlayStation Network IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theplaystationetwork.com/ign-fallout-3-review-theres-been-some-changes/ |title=IGN Fallout 3 ReviewâThereâs Been Some Changes |date=2008-10-29 |first=Anthony |last=Barlow |publisher=The PlayStation Network |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, reviewers found that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, and other bugs requiring a restart of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;digital chumps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalchumps.com/game-reviews/35-ps3/3990-fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition.html |title=Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition |first=Nathaniel |last=Stevens |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2009-11-18 |publisher=Digital Chumps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spawnkill&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spawnkill.com/review-fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition/ |title=Review: Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2009-11-18 |publisher=Spawn Kill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even IGN recursively cited bugs with the original release, as well as the Game of the Year edition, calling it &quot;a fantastic game&quot;, but warning players to &quot;be aware that you might have to deal with some crashes and bugs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN GotY&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/103/1035569p5.html |title=Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition Review |first=Erik |last=Brudvig |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-18 |date=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug references===
On July 4, 2008, ''Fallout 3'' was refused classification by the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|ACB]] in Australia, thus making it illegal to distribute or purchase the game in the country. In order for the game to be reclassified, the offending content in the Australian version of the game would have had to be removed by Bethesda Softworks and the game resubmitted to the ACB.&lt;ref name=&quot;No AUS Release&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/find.nsf/d853f429dd038ae1ca25759b0003557c/ae87cbba1093d4b0ca25767100791a27?OpenDocument  |title=OFLC listing for ''Fallout 3'' |publisher=Classification by Australian Government |accessdate=2011-09-04|date=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/887/887547p1.html |title=''Fallout 3'' Officially Refused Classification in Australia |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-07-09 |first=Jimmy |last=Thang}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ACB board report, the game was refused classification due to the &quot;realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method [bringing] the 'science-fiction' drugs in line with 'real-world' drugs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OFLC Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2008/07/olfc_report_why_fallout_3_was_banned_in_australia/ |title=OFLC Report: Why Fallout 3 Was Banned In Australia |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-07-10 |first=Logan |last=Booker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revised version of the game was resubmitted to the ACB and reclassified as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or not suitable for people under the age of 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;No AUS Release&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AUS Revised&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason|last=Hill|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/articles/fallout-3-ban-lifted-in-australia/2008/08/12/1218306838907.html |title=Fallout 3 ban lifted in Australia |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ACB board report, the drug content was not removed entirely from the revised version of the game, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug content was still enough to warrant a refused classification rating, despite the admission that the portrayal of the drugs was appropriate within the context of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/898/898386p1.html |title=Fallout 3 Censorship Report |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-08-12 |first=Patrick |last=Kolan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later interview with UK gaming magazine ''Edge'', Bethesda Softworks revealed that there would be only one version of ''Fallout 3'' released worldwide, and that this version would have all real world drug references removed. It was later clarified that the only change made would be that [[morphine]], a real world drug that would have appeared in the game, would instead be renamed to the more generic &quot;Med-X.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/54651/fallout-3-censorship-goes-global |title=Fallout 3 Censorship Goes Global |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-09-09 |first=Blake |last=Ellison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release in India===
On October 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that the game would not be released in India on the Xbox 360 platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotaku-India&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5067039/fallout-3-not-coming-to-india |title=Fallout 3 Not Coming To India |publisher=Kotaku |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |first=Mike |last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason. Microsoft stated, &quot;Microsoft constantly endeavors to bring the best games to Indian consumers in sync with their international release. However, in light of cultural sensitivities in India, we have made the business decision to not bring ''Fallout 3'' into the country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/fallout-3-withheld-from-india |title=Fallout 3 withheld from India |publisher=Games Industry |accessdate=2009-12-01 |first=Jason |last=Lee |date=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific reason was not revealed in public, it is possible that it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, or that [[Brahmin]] is also the name of a class of religious scholars in India, or its similarity to the spelling of [[brahman (cattle)|brahman]], a type of cow that originated in India.  Brahman, a breed of [[Zebu]], are revered by [[Hindu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Are-Brahmin-The-Reason-For-Fallout-3-s-Cancellation-in-India-12947.html |title=Are Brahmin The Reason For Fallout 3's Cancellation in India? |publisher=Gaming Blend |accessdate=2011-09-04 |date=2008-10-22 |first=Pete |last=Haas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitivity to Japan===
Bethesda Softworks changed the side quest &quot;The Power of the Atom&quot; in the Japanese version of ''Fallout 3'' to relieve concerns about depictions of atomic detonation in inhabited areas. In non-Japanese versions, players are given the option of either defusing, ignoring, or detonating the dormant atomic bomb in the town of Megaton. In the Japanese version, the character Mr. Burke has been taken out of this side quest, making it impossible to detonate the bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bethsoft.com/jpn/news/20081110a.html|title=Bethesda Softworks Statement of Fallout 3 Censorship|accessdate=2009-12-02|publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the Japanese release, the &quot;Fat Man&quot; nuclear catapult weapon was renamed &quot;Nuka Launcher,&quot; as the original name was a reference to [[Fat Man|the bomb used on Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Statement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/11/japanese-fallou/ |title=Fallout 3 Pulls Nuke References for Japan |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2009-11-11 |date=2008-11-11 |first=Jean |last=Snow}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tetsu Takahashi, responsible for localizing ''Fallout 3'' to Japan under his company Zenimax Asia, the available actions prior to localizing &quot;The Power of the Atom&quot; and the ability to kill civilians almost got the game banned by [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] before it got an Adult Only Rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamecareerguide.com/news/25670/interview_zenimax_asias_.php|title=Interview: Zenimax Asia's Takahashi on Bringing Western Games to Japan|date=2009-11-24|accessdate=2009-12-02|publisher=Game Career Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
