The '''Copa del Rey 1903''' was the first official edition of the [[Copa del Rey]]. 

The competition started on April 6, 1903 and concluded on April 8, 1903 with the Final, held at the [[Estadio del HipÃ³dromo|HipÃ³dromo]] in [[Madrid]], in which [[Athletic Bilbao]] lifted the trophy for the first time as ''Athletic Bilbao''(won in [[1902]] as ''Club Vizcaya'').
The 1902 competition was won by Club Vizcaya, a team made up of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC. In 1903, these two clubs merged as Athletic Club Bilbao, the modern Athletic Bilbao. As a result, the tally of Copa wins by Athletic Bilbao is disputed. The 1902 cup is on display in the Athletic museum, and the club includes the victory in its honours list. However LFP and RFEF official statistics do not include this as an Athletic win, so this season Athletic Bilbao won its first title.
