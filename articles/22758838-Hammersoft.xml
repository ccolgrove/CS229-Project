'''Abdullah Abdullah''' ({{lang-fa|Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯Ø§ÙÙÙ}}) is an [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan politician]] and a [[doctor of medicine]]. He was an adviser and friend to [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], legendary anti-Taliban leader and commander known as the &quot;Lion of Panjshir&quot;. After the fall of the [[Taliban]] regime, Dr. Abdullah served as Afghanistan's Foreign Minister from 2001 until 2005. In 2009 Abdullah ran as an independent candidate in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|Afghan presidential election]] and came in second place with 30.5% of the total votes. On November 1, 2009, Abdullah quit the [[runoff election]] that would have taken place six days later, on November 7, due to large-scale allegations of fraud against his opponent [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091101/ap_on_re_as/as_afghanistan Afghan's Karzai effectively handed 2nd term]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Abdullah created the [[Coalition for Change and Hope]] which is the leading democratic opposition movement in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AN2TM20101124  | title=Afghan opposition says new parliament can check Karzai | accessdate=  | publisher=Reuters| date=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khaama Press&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.khaama.com/?p=1302  | title=2010 Afghan Parliamentary Election: Checks and Balances of Power | accessdate=  | publisher=Khaama Press| date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Abdullah was born in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drabdullah.af/index.php?page=en_Dr+Abdullah+Abdullah Official website of Dr. Abdullah]&lt;/ref&gt; Until he became a government minister, he had only one name, Abdullah; demands from Western newspaper editors for a second name led him to adopt the name Abdullah Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter Filkins, ''The Forever War'' (New York: Vintage Books/Random House, 2009; orig. ed. 2008), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most [[Afghan people|Afghans]], he was raised in a devout [[Muslim]] family. Abdullah Abdullah is of mixed [[Tajik people|Tajik]] and [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/past-issues/volume-7---2001/volume-7---issue-10/post-taliban-afghanistan/]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6018945/Afghan-election-Hamid-Karzais-rival-Abdullah-Abdullah-crosses-ethnic-divide.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Afghan election: Hamid Karzai's rival Abdullah Abdullah crosses ethnic divide | first=Ben | last=Farmer | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poll shows Afghan vote headed for second round |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE57D0SE20090814 |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Ghullam Muhayuddin Khan, was from the [[Kandahar]] region, and was a high ranking government official who had risen through the ranks. Abdullah's early years were split between living in Kandahar and [[Kabul]], where his father was serving as an administrator in the land survey and subsequently the inspection section of the Prime Ministerâs office. A number of his ancestors had worked in the court of the [[Emirate of Afghanistan|royal house of Afghanistan]] in past centuries. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Eventually, Abdullahâs family settled in Kabul where his father was appointed as a senator by King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]. Abdullahâs father had a great impact on his son's life.

== Education and medical career==

Abdullah was a top student throughout his elementary and high school years. He graduated from Naderia High School in 1976 and went on to study [[ophthalmology]] at [[Kabul Medical University|Kabul Universityâs Department of Medicine]] where he graduated and received his M.D. degree in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Transition to Democracy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/5105/transition_to_democracy_in_afghanistan_and_the_challenges_ahead.html?breadcrumb=%2Feducators%2Fmultimedia%3Fgroupby%3D3%26filter%3D2002%26page%3D2|title=The Transition to Democracy in Afghanistan and the Challenges Ahead |date=October 17, 2002|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving his degree, Abdullah served as the resident ophthalmologist at Noor Eye Institute in Kabul until 1986. Starting in 1985, Abdullah left the country due to the social and political unrest during the [[leftist]] government and went on to work at the Syed Jamaluddin Afghani Eye Hospital for Afghan Refugees in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]].

==Resistance against invasion==
===Soviet war in Afghanistan===

In September 1985 Abdullah became the Head of the Health Department for the Panjshir Resistance Front coordinating treatments and health care for the resistance fighters and the civilian population. Abdullah soon became a close associate and advisor to Commander [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] in the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1672882.stm|title=Profile: Abdullah Abdullah|date=22 March 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the withdrawal of [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet troops from Afghanistan]] the [[Wall Street Journal]] named Massoud &quot;the Afghan who won the Cold War&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001 |url =http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2911290068493351924# |title = Charlie Rose March 26, 2001| publisher = [[CBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic State of Afghanistan===

After the fall of the [[communist]] [[Najibullah]]-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an [[interim government]]. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{blockquote|&quot;The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government. [...] With the exception of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]], all of the parties [...] were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. [...] Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and [[Kabul]] generally. [...] Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date= |url =http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands|title = Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan expert [[Amin Saikal]] concludes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'':
{{blockquote|&quot;Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in [[Central Asia]]. [...] [[Islamabad]] could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders [...] to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions. [...] Had it not been for the ISI's logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets, Hekmatyar's forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=352| publisher = I.B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd., London New York | isbn=1-85043-437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] was defeated militarily in Kabul in late 1994 by then minister of defense Ahmad Shah Massoud's forces. Abdullah worked as an advisor for Massoud. In 1995 Abdullah became the Spokesperson for the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]].

===Taliban Emirate versus United Front===

On September 27, 1996, the [[Taliban]] seized power in Kabul with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following the capture of Kabul by the [[Taliban]], the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]] (Northern Alliance) was created under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Dr. Abdullah became the United Front's Minister of Foreign Affairs. [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] elements of the United Front, including the Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, remained Afghanistan's internationally recognized government. The Taliban Emirate received no diplomatic recognition from the international community (except from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates). 

In early 2001 Abdullah traveled with Ahmad Shah Massoud to Brussels where Massoud addressed the [[European Parliament]] asking the [[international community]] to provide [[humanitarian]] help to the people of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament (2)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60|title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 see video]) Dr. Abdullah translated when Massoud stated that the Taliban and [[Al Qaeda]] had introduced &quot;a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]&quot; and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60|title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this visit to Europe Massoud also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign ministry===
In October 2001 the Taliban regime was overthrown by [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] including NATO and United Front forces.
As a result of the [[International Conference on Afghanistan (2001)|Bonn conference]] on Afghanistan, Abdullah was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Interim Administration in December 2001. 

Following the [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghanistan Presidential Elections]], Abdullah was one of the few people who kept their position from the Transitional Government and was re-appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs for another year. In 2005 he resigned his position.&lt;ref name=&quot;new cabinet&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2004/12/24/top5.htm|title=Afghan President Karzai appoints new cabinet|date=24 December 2004|work=Pakistan Times|accessdate=2009-05-15}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 presidential election ===
[[File:John Kerry with Abdullah Abdullah in 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John Kerry]] with Dr. Abdullah in October 2009.]]
On May 6, 2009, Abdullah registered as an Independent candidate for the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 Afghan presidential election]], running against incumbent president [[Hamid Karzai]]. Abdullah selected as his running mates Humayun Shah Asefi as his First Vice President and Dr. Cheragh Ali Cheragh (a surgeon from Kabul who is a practicing [[Shia]]) as Second Vice President. Afghanistan has an [[Executive Branch|Executive]] structure featuring two [[Vice President]]s, a First VP and a Second VP, to help ensure a stable government by attempting to provide ethnic and religious balance to senior government leadership positions. Unofficial and non-certified electoral results were announced during the day on September 16, 2009, showing that Abdullah was in second position with 27.8% of the total votes cast. President Karzai did not achieve the 50.01% vote majority required to avoid a runoff election. A large number of fraudulent ballots, mostly belonging to Karzai's camp, were disallowed by the Independent Afghan Electoral Commission. Karzai came under intense international political and diplomatic pressure from  international leaders because of allegations of large-scale fraud. Hamid Karzai eventually agreed to participate in a designated head to head runoff election (held between the contenders with the two largest numbers of total votes in the first election) which was scheduled nationwide for November 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1925090,00.html?xid=rss-topstories  | title=Why Karzai's Rival Abdullah Won't Budge on Runoff  | accessdate=2009-09-21  | publisher=Time | date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2009, Abdullah announced that he had decided to withdraw from the runoff election, citing his lack of faith in the President Karzai government's ability to hold a &quot;fair and transparent&quot; second election process. Subsequently Hamid Karzai was declared the winner by the Afghan Electoral Commission (essentially winning by default).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apakistannews.com/abdlullah-quits-afghan-presidential-race-144977 Abdlullah Quits Afghan Presidential Race]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114350537 Karzai Challenger Drops Out Of Runoff Election]{{dead link|date=November 2011}} by ''National Public Radio''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalition for Change and Hope===

After the 2009 Afghan Presidential Elections, Abdullah created the [[Coalition for Change and Hope]] (CCH). The CCH presents the leading democratic opposition movement against the government of [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khaama Press&quot;/&gt;

In the September 18, 2010, parliamentary election the Coalition for Change and Hope won more than 90 seats out of 249 seats becoming the main opposition party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khaama Press&quot;/&gt; As a result, it is assumed that the new Parliament will introduce some checks and balances on the Presidential power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khaama Press&quot;/&gt;

Regarding the [[Taliban]] insurgency and Karzai's strategy of negotiations Dr. Abdullah stated:
:&quot;I should say that Taliban are not fighting in order to be accommodated. They are fighting in order to bring the state down. So it's a futile exercise, and it's just misleading. ... There are groups that will fight to the death. Whether we like to talk to them or we don't like to talk to them, they will continue to fight. So, for them, I don't think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such. Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily. In terms of the Taliban on the ground, there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country, we can attract them to the peace process; provided, we create a favorable environment on this side of the line.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Public Radio (NPR)&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130757482| work=National Public Radio (NPR)| accessdate= | title=Abdullah Abdullah: Talks With Taliban Futile | first=| last=| date=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [http://www.masoudfoundation.org/ Massoud Foundation] ===
Abdullah has been the Secretary General of the Massoud Foundation since June 2006. The Massoud Foundation is an independent, non-aligned, non-profitable and non-political organization established by people who have been affected by the life of Massoud. It provides humanitarian assistance to Afghans especially in the fields of health care and education. It also runs programs in the fields of culture, construction, agriculture and welfare.
