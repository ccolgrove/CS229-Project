==History==
The first game between [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|BC]] and [[UMass Minutemen|UMass]] was held in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] on December 8, 1905 and was won by UMass, then known as the Massachusetts Agricultural College. In 1995, the series was officially designated as the &quot;Commonwealth Classic&quot; by then-Massachusetts Governor [[William Weld]] and members of the [[Massachusetts General Court]] who were among the nearly 20,000 spectators to watch the game at the new '''FleetCenter''' (now the [[TD Banknorth Garden]]). It was the first college basketball game played in the new arena. The 1995 game holds the record for college basketball attendance in New England. The series has been held annually since 1995.

==UMass Dominance in the 1990s==
The 1990s were the best decade of UMass Minutemen Basketball as the Minutemen went to the 1996 Final Four and went 6-0 in the decade against Boston College. Their longest winning streak ever against their cross-state rivals. 

==BC Dominance in the 2000s==
After going 0-6 against UMass in the 90's, BC has bounced back and won the first seven games in the 2000s, going 7-0. This streak was snapped on December 12, 2007 when UMass edged BC 83-80.

The 2010 game was played at [[TD Garden]] at a part of the Boston Tip-Off Classic, benefiting Childrenâs Hospital Boston &amp; Alâs Angels.[http://www.bostontipoffclassic.com/]
