The English Party constitution states that the Liberal Democrats in England &quot;shall determine the policy of the Party on matters affecting England which fall outside the remit of the Federal Party&quot; This can be achieved by structures established by the English Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libdems.org.uk/siteFiles/resources/PDF/Constitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
As no policy making structures are currently in place, policy making has been passed up to federal level and English policies discussed at federal party conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/how_we_make_policy.aspx |title=The Liberal Democrats, How We Make Policy |publisher=Libdems.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
