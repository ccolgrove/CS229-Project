The '''Denver Broncos''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. They are currently members of the [[AFC West|West Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Broncos began play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFLâNFL merger]] of 1970. 

The team is one of the most successful teams in NFL history, having won two [[Super Bowl]]s and six [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]]s. They play at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]], and have four players in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]: [[John Elway]], [[Floyd Little]], [[Gary Zimmerman]], and [[Shannon Sharpe]].

{{details|History of the Denver Broncos}}
{{See|List of Denver Broncos seasons}}
===1960â1969: AFL era===
The '''Denver Broncos''' were founded on August 14, 1959 when [[minor league baseball]] owner [[Bob Howsam]] was awarded an American Football League charter franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;profootballhof1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=10 |title=Team â Pro Football Hall of Fame |publisher=Profootballhof.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Broncos won the first-ever American Football League game over the [[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]], 13â10, on September 9, 1960. On August 5, 1967, they became the first ever AFL team to defeat an NFL team after beating the [[Detroit Lions]], 13â7, in a preseason game.&lt;ref name=&quot;profootballhof1&quot;/&gt; However, the Broncos were largely not successful in the 1960s, compiling a record of 39â97â4 in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/Broncos.htm |title=Denver Broncos: American Football League Charter Members|work=Conigliofamily.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denver came close to losing its franchise in [[1965 Denver Broncos season|1965]], but a local ownership group took control that year and began to rebuild the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/denver_broncos/team_history.html |title=Denver Broncos Team History |work=Nflteamhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team's first superstar, &quot;Franchise&quot; [[Floyd Little]], due to his signing in [[1967 Denver Broncos season|1967]] and his Pro Bowl efforts on and off the field, was instrumental in keeping the team in Denver. They were the only original AFL team never to have played in the title game during the upstart league's 10-year history, as well as the only original AFL team never to have a winning season while a member of the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/ |title=Denver Broncos Team Encyclopedia |work=Pro-football-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970â1982: &quot;Orange Crush&quot;===
In 1972, the Broncos hired former [[Stanford University]] coach [[John Ralston (coach)|John Ralston]] as their head coach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverbroncos.com/resources/custom/PDF/RecordBook/2008/AllTimeCoaches.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[1973 Denver Broncos season|1973]], he was [[UPI]]'s choice as AFC Coach of the Year after Denver achieved its first-ever-winning season at 7â5â2. In five seasons with the Broncos, Ralston guided the team to winning seasons three times, the franchise's only three winning seasons up to that time. Even though Ralston finished the [[1976 Denver Broncos season|1976]] season with a winning record of 9â5, the team, as was the case in Ralstonâs previous winning seasons, still failed to qualify for the playoffs. Following the 1976 season several prominent players publicly voiced their discontent with Ralstonâs leadership which soon led to his dismissal by the team owner.

Rookie coach, Red Miller, along with the [[Orange Crush Defense]] (a nickname originating in the early '70's, also the brand of [[Orange Crush|a popular orange-flavored soft drink]]) and aging quarterback [[Craig Morton]], promptly took the Broncos to their first playoff appearance in [[1977 Denver Broncos season|1977]], and ultimately first Super Bowl, where they were defeated by the [[1977 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], 27â10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/1977.htm |title=1977 Denver Broncos Statistics |work=Pro-football-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Broncos owner [[Gerald Phipps]], who had purchased the team in May 1961 from the original owner Bob Howsam, sold the team to Canadian Financier, [[Edgar Kaiser|Edgar Kaiser, Jr.]], grandson of shipbuilding industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcchiefs.com/news/2008/02/21/rand_dressing_up_the_old_afl/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=James |last=Paton |title=Clock runs out for ex-Broncos owner |date=October 2, 2008 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/ex-broncos-owner-denied-chance-buy-back-team/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983â1998: John Elway era===
Quarterback [[John Elway]], who played college football at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]], arrived in [[1983 Denver Broncos season|1983]]. Originally drafted by the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] as the first pick of the draft, Elway proclaimed that he would shun football in favor of [[baseball]] (he was drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] to play [[center field]] and was also a pitching prospect), unless he was traded to a selected list of other teams, which included Denver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/elway/timeline.html |title=John Elway Timeline |work=Sportingnews.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Elway, Denver had over 24 different starting quarterbacks in its 23 seasons to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football.com/nfl/denverbroncos/index.html |title=Denver Broncos |work=Football.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080605052411/http://www.football.com/nfl/denverbroncos/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elway would remain the quarterback through five Super Bowls, with the Broncos winning two of them. The Broncos lost [[Super Bowl XXI]] to the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], 39â20; [[Super Bowl XXII]] to the [[1987 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], 42â10; and [[Super Bowl XXIV]] to the [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], 55â10, the latter of which is, to date, the most lopsided scoring differential in Super Bowl history.

In [[1995 Denver Broncos season|1995]], the Broncos debuted a new head coach, [[Mike Shanahan]], and a new rookie running back, [[Terrell Davis]]. In [[1996 Denver Broncos season|1996]], the Broncos were the top seed in the AFC with a 13â3 record, dominating most of the teams that year. The fifth-seeded [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], however, upset the Broncos, 30â27 in the divisional round of the playoffs, ending the Broncos' 1996 run. During the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|1997 season]], both Elway and Davis would help guide the Broncos to their first Super Bowl victory, a 31â24 win over the defending Super Bowl champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. Although Elway completed only 12 of 22 passing attempts, throwing one interception and no touchdowns (he did, however, have a rushing touchdown), Davis rushed for 157 yards and a Super Bowlârecord three touchdowns to earn the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP Award]] â this while overcoming a severe migraine headache that caused him blurred vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbxxxii |title=Super Bowl XXXII box score |work=NFL.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos repeated as Super Bowl champions the following season, defeating the [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] (led by Elway's longtime head coach [[Dan Reeves]]) in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], 34â19. Elway was named Super Bowl MVP, completing 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, with an 80-yard touchdown to wide receiver [[Rod Smith (American football)|Rod Smith]] and one interception.

===1999â2008: post-Elway era===
John Elway retired following the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998]] season, and [[Brian Griese]] started at quarterback for the next four seasons. After a 6â10 record in [[1999 Denver Broncos season|1999]], the Broncos recovered in [[2000 Denver Broncos season|2000]], earning a Wild Card playoff berth, but losing to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, former [[Arizona Cardinals]]' quarterback [[Jake Plummer]] replaced Griese in [[2003 Denver Broncos season|2003]], and would lead the Broncos to two straight 10â6 seasons, earning Wild Card playoff berths both years. However, the Broncos went on the road to face the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in back-to-back seasons and were blown out by more than 20 points in each game, allowing a combined 90 points.

After losing the [[2005 Denver Broncos season|2005]] season opener, the Broncos won five straight games. Plummer and the Broncos clinched their first [[AFC West]] division title since 1998 on December 24, and finished with an 8â0 home record and a 13â3 overall record. The Broncos entered the [[2005â06 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] for the third consecutive year with the momentum of a four-game winning streak. After a first round bye, the Broncos defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[New England Patriots]], 27â13, denying New England from becoming the first NFL team ever to win three consecutive Super Bowl championships. The Broncos' playoff run came to an end next week, after losing at home to the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the AFC Championship Game, 34â17. Denver turned the ball over four times and were outscored in the first half, 24â3. The Steelers went on to win [[Super Bowl XL]].

The Broncos' defense began the first five games of the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|2006 season]] allowing only one touchdown, an NFL record, but struggled down the season stretch. Plummer led the team to a 7â2 record, only to lose two straight and be replaced by rookie quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]. Cutler went 2â3 as a starter, and the Broncos finished with a 9â7 record, losing the tiebreaker to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] for the final playoff spot. Cutler's first full season as a starter in [[2007 Denver Broncos season|2007]] became the Broncos' first losing season since 1999, with a 7â9 record.

The [[2008 Denver Broncos season|2008]] season ended in a 52â21 loss at the [[San Diego Chargers]], giving the Broncos an 8â8 record and their third straight season out of the playoffs. [[Mike Shanahan]], the longest-tenured and most successful head coach in Broncos' franchise history, was fired on December 30, 2008, after 14 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Shanahan-Broncos-Part-Ways/d25552b8-7892-11df-ba56-acc8e62813e9 Shanahan, Broncos Part Ways&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009âpresent: post-Mike Shanahan era===
On January 11, 2009, two weeks after [[Mike Shanahan]] was fired, the Broncos hired former [[New England Patriots]]' offensive coordinator [[Josh McDaniels]] as the team's new head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Broncos Introduce McDaniels |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-Introduce-McDaniels/d228740c-7892-11df-ba56-acc8e62813e9 |publisher=denverbroncos.com |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, the team acquired [[quarterback]] [[Kyle Orton]] as part of a trade that sent [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] to the [[Chicago Bears]].

Under McDaniels and Orton, the Broncos jumped out to a surprising 6â0 start in [[2009 Denver Broncos season|2009]]. However, the team lost eight of their next ten games, finishing 8â8 for a second consecutive season and missing the playoffs. After the season, Pro Bowl [[wide receiver]] [[Brandon Marshall]] was traded to the [[Miami Dolphins]], and the Broncos set a new franchise record for losses in a single season, with a 4â12 record in [[2010 Denver Broncos season|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Stapleton, Arnie |title=Broncos lose franchise-record 12th game as Chargers win 33â28 |url=http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-chargers-broncos-10211-txt,0,3858640.story |publisher=kdvr.com |date=January 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 2010, McDaniels was fired following a combination of the team's poor record and the fallout from a highly-publicized [[2010 Denver Broncos season#Videotaping scandal|videotaping scandal]]. Running backs coach [[Eric Studesville]] was named interim coach for the remaining four games of the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Klis, Mike |title=McDaniels fired as Broncos coach after controversy, losses pile up |url=http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_16791509 |publisher=denverpost.com |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to start rookie first-round draft choice [[Tim Tebow]] at quarterback for the final three games.

After the season, [[Joe Ellis (American football)|Joe Ellis]] was promoted from the Chief Operating Officer to team president, while [[John Elway]] was named the team's Executive Vice President of Football Operations on January 5, 2011. In this capacity, Elway will report to Ellis and will oversee the position held by the General Manager ([[Brian Xanders]]) and head coach positions. On January 13, 2011, the Broncos hired former [[Carolina Panthers]]' coach [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] as the team's 14th head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Klis, Mike |title=Broncos officially announce Elway hire, promote Ellis to president |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_17015369 |publisher=denverpost.com |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Caldwell, Gray |title=Fox Takes the Reins |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Fox-Takes-the-Reins/b6952341-7bf3-4c0a-9ff7-855588e9c380 |publisher=denverbroncos.com |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 1â4 start to the [[2011 Denver Broncos season|2011]] season, it was announced on October 11, 2011, that Tim Tebow would replace Kyle Orton as the Broncos' starting quarterback. In his first start, Tebow would lead the Broncos in a come-from-behind 18â15 overtime victory over the Miami Dolphins, after being down 15â0 with under three minutes to go in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Klis, Mike |title=Tim Tebow named Broncos' starting quarterback |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_19087742 |publisher=denverpost.com |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 2011, Kyle Orton was waived and since the quarterback change, the Broncos have gone 6â1, including three consecutive game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime vs. the [[2011 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in Week 11, against the [[2011 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] in Week 12 and against the [[2011 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] in Week 13.

==Rivalries==
===Kansas City Chiefs===
:*First met in 1960 (with the Chiefs based in Dallas from 1960 through 1962 and named the Dallas Texans)
:*55â47 Kansas City leads series (Denver leads playoffs 1â0)
:*'''Signature moment:''' The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] were victimized by eight of [[John Elway]]'s legendary fourth quarter game-winning drives, the most he had against one NFL team. Perhaps the most notable comeback occurred on October 4, 1992, at [[Mile High Stadium]]. The Broncos were trailing the Chiefs 19â6 late in the 4th quarter, and hadn't scored a touchdown in the previous 12 quarters. After the two-minute warning, Elway threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to [[Mark Jackson (American football player)|Mark Jackson]] to pull within 19â13, with 1:55 remaining. After the Chiefs subsequently went three-and-out, the Broncos returned a punt to the Chiefs' 27-yard line. Three plays later, Elway tossed a 12-yard touchdown pass to [[Vance Johnson]] with 38 seconds remaining that gave the Broncos a thrilling 20â19 comeback win. However, the Chiefs got their revenge in the 1992 season finale, with an emphatic 42â20 win at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] that denied the Broncos a playoff berth.
:*'''Signature moment:''' Former [[San Francisco 49ers]]' quarterback [[Joe Montana]] finished his career in Kansas City, and led the Chiefs to a memorable comeback at Mile High Stadium on October 17, 1994.
:*'''Signature moment:''' After suffering a last-second defeat at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium in the 1997 regular season, Denver redeemed themselves with a 14â10 win at Kansas City in the playoffs, eventually winning [[Super Bowl XXXII]].
:*'''Signature moment:''' November 14, 2010 â The Broncos stormed to a 35â0 lead against the visiting Chiefs before the second half, leading to a 49â29 victory. The Chiefs head coach, [[Todd Haley]], was distraught enough after the game that he refused to shake the hand of then-Broncos coach, [[Josh McDaniels]]. [[Tim Tebow]] threw his first NFL pass for a touchdown.

===Oakland Raiders===
:*First met in 1960
:*59â42â2 Oakland leads series (Playoffs tied 1â1) (from 1982 through 1994, the Raiders were based in Los Angeles)
:*'''Signature moment:''' The Broncos beat the Raiders in 1977 to win their first AFC Championship.
:*'''Signature moment:''' September 26, 1988 â The Broncos led the Raiders 24â0 at halftime on [[Monday Night Football]], but the Raiders sparked one of the largest comebacks in NFL history, winning 30â27 in overtime. After serving as an offensive assistant under [[Dan Reeves]] in the mid-80s (and again in the early-90s), [[Mike Shanahan]]'s first season as an NFL head coach was with the Raiders in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], before he was fired four games into the [[1989 NFL season|1989]] season.&lt;ref&gt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260474-the-top-10-most-memorable-moments-in-the-raiders-broncos-rivalry#page/5 The 10 Most Memorable Moments in the Raiders-Broncos Rivalry&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Signature moment:''' In the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season finale]], the Raiders scored an overtime victory against the Broncos to make the playoffs, setting up another game between the two in Los Angeles [[NFL playoffs, 1993-94|the following week]]. Outspoken Raiders' owner [[Al Davis]] commented before the playoff game that the Broncos were &quot;scared to death of us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/sports/football/15raiders.html?ref=sports |title=The Raiders Are a Nation That Is Divided and Downtrodden |first=Karen |last=Crouse |publisher=New York Times |date=2006-10-14 |accessdate=2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Broncos' protests, the Raiders made their owner's words stand up, winning 42â24.
:*'''Signature moment:''' In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], former Raiders coach Mike Shanahan, who was at the time in an ongoing contract dispute with Al Davis, became the Broncos' new head coach, heightening an already contentious AFC West rivalry. Prior to Shanahan's arrival in Denver, the Broncos had lost 13 out of 15 games against the Raiders from 1988â1994, but during Shanahan's 14 seasons as the Broncos' head coach, the Broncos went 21â7 against Oakland.
:*'''Signature moment:''' September 16, 2007 â As Raiders kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] kicked what would have been a game-winning field goal during overtime, Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan had called a timeout right before Janikowski made it. After the timeout, Janikowski again attempted the field goal, but this time it hit the upright and was no good. Denver then proceeded to win the game on a field goal by kicker [[Jason Elam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270916007 Broncos convert in OT after Raiders' second-chance kick fails&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Signature moment:''' October 24, 2010 â The Raiders score 38 points in the first half in Denver. Oakland goes on to beat the Broncos 59â14, not only making it the most points scored in a single game in the Raiders' franchise history, but also tying the highest point total that the Broncos have allowed in a single game, since a 59â7 loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Klis, Mike |title=Raiders blast Broncos 59â14; fans express their displeasure |url=http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_16422877?_requestid=20990762 |publisher=''denverpost.com'' |date=October 24, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Diego Chargers===
[[Image:DenverBroncosoffense2008.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Denver Broncos playing against the San Diego Chargers]]
:*First met in 1960 (with the Chargers based in Los Angeles in 1960 prior to relocating to San Diego in 1961)
:*55â48â1 Denver leads series (No playoff matches)
:*'''Signature moment:''' November 17, 1985 â [[Dennis Smith (American football)|Dennis Smith]] blocks two consecutive field goal attempts, and San Diego takes the ball to the Broncos 24 in the first overtime possession. Dennis Smith blocks a Bob Thomas field goal attempt only to see the block brought back by a time-out Denver had mistakenly called. Thomas tries a second attempt and this try is also blocked by Smith and returned by [[Louis Wright (American football)|Louis Wright]] for a 60 yard touchdown and the win.&lt;ref&gt;Stadium Stories, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Signature moment:''' September 14, 2008 â With 52 seconds remaining in the game, the Chargers were leading 38â31. The Broncos hiked the ball on 2nd &amp; Goal from the Chargers 1-yard line. [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] began to roll out to the right and before he brought his arm forward he fumbled the ball, which was then recovered by [[Tim Dobbins]] of the Chargers. However, referee [[Ed Hochuli]] had called the play dead as he believed it to be an incomplete pass, so the ball was returned to the Broncos at the 10 yard line (the spot where the ball hit the ground after the incomplete pass). Two plays later, on 4th &amp; Goal from the 4, Jay Cutler completed a touchdown pass to rookie [[Eddie Royal]], bringing the score to 38â37. Instead of kicking a PAT to tie the game and most likely send it to overtime, Coach [[Mike Shanahan]] opted for the 2-point conversion. Jay Cutler completed the conversion with another pass to Royal, giving the Broncos the controversial 39â38 victory. However, San Diego would have their revenge with an emphatic 52â21 win in the [[2008 Denver Broncos season|2008]] season finale, denying the Broncos a place in the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280914007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland Browns===
:*First met in 1971
:*18â5 Denver leads series (Denver leads playoffs 3â0)
:*'''Signature moment:''' Over three playoffs in four years, Cleveland lost to Denver in the AFC Championship game. In January 1987, after the 1986 season, John Elway led &quot;[[The Drive]]&quot; to secure a tie in the waning moments at old [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]; the Broncos would go on to win in overtime. In January 1988, at Mile High Stadium, after the 1987 season, Cleveland nearly had its own comeback drive, but [[Earnest Byner]]'s costly [[The Fumble|fumble]] saved the day for Denver. The game after the 1989 season was not as close, easily won by the Broncos.

Backed up to their own 1-yard line and facing a punt, Patriots head coach [[Bill Belichick]] ordered an intentional safety that gave the Broncos a 26â23 lead. After a free kick backed up the Broncos to their own 15-yard line, they immediately went three and out. After a Broncos punt gave the Patriots great field position at their own 42-yard line with 2:15 remaining, New England drove 58 yards in 6 plays, culminating in an 18-yard touchdown pass from [[Tom Brady]] to [[David Givens]] with 35 seconds remaining that gave the Patriots a 30â26 win.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=231103007 Patriots take safety for field position&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Denver Broncos alternate logo.svg|right|thumb|Broncos alternate logo (1997âpresent)]]

When the Broncos debuted in {{nfly|1960}}, their original uniforms drew as much attention as their play on the field.  It featured white and mustard yellow jerseys, with contrasting brown helmets, brown pants, and vertically striped socks.&lt;ref&gt;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1434/660608396_8eb6da94e0.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the team unveiled a new logo featuring a bucking horse, and changed their team colors to orange, royal blue and white. The {{nfly|1962}} uniform, designed by Laura North-Allen, consisted of white pants, orange helmets, and either orange or white jerseys.

In {{nfly|1968}}, the Broncos debuted a design that became known as the &quot;Orange Crush.&quot; Their logo was redesigned so that the horse was coming out of a &quot;D.&quot; Additionally, the helmets were changed to royal blue, with thin stripes placed onto the sleeves, and other minor modifications were added. From 1969â1971, and again from 1978â1979, the team wore orange pants with their white jerseys.

The Broncos wore their white jerseys at home throughout the [[1971 NFL season|1971]] season, as well as for {{nfly|1980}} home games vs. the [[San Diego Chargers]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]], the latter in hopes to bring out the &quot;blue jersey jinx&quot; which has followed the Cowboys for decades (it worked, Denver won 41â20). Denver wore its white jerseys for {{nfly|1983}} home games vs. the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]], but would not wear white at home again for two decades ''(see below)''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Endzone&quot;&gt;http://www.uniwatchblog.com/white-at-home-in-the-nfl/ White at Home in the NFL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://endzonesportscharities.org/gunews.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nfly|1994}}, in honor of the 75th anniversary season of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the Broncos wore their {{nfly|1965}} [[throwback uniforms]] for two gamesâa Week 3 home game against the Los Angeles Raiders, as well a road game at the [[Buffalo Bills]] the following week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Endzone&quot;/&gt;

The Broncos then radically changed their logo and uniforms in {{nfly|1997}}, a design that the team continues to use to this day. Navy blue replaced royal blue on the team's color scheme. The current logo is a profile of a horse's head, with an orange mane and navy blue outlines. They began wearing navy blue jerseys, replacing their longtime orange jerseys that had been the team's predominant home jersey color since 1962. This new uniform design also features a new word mark, numbering font and a streak that runs up and down the sides of both the jerseys and the pants. On the navy blue jerseys, the streak is orange, with an orange collar and white numerals trimmed in orange, while on the road white jerseys, the streak is navy blue, with a thin orange accent strip on both sides, a navy collar and navy numerals trimmed in orange. When they debuted, these uniforms were, once again, vilified by the press and fans, until the Broncos won their first ever [[Super Bowl XXXII|Super Bowl]] in the new design that same season. The navy blue jerseys will remain as the team's primary home jersey until the end of the {{nfly|2011}} season (''see next paragraph'').

In {{nfly|2002}}, the Broncos introduced an alternate orange jersey that is a mirror image of the aforementioned navy blue jerseys, but with orange and navy trading places. Like the road white jerseys, the white pants with the navy blue streaks running down the sides are worn with this uniform. This jersey was used only once in the 2002 and {{nfly|2004}} seasons, and were used twice per season from 2008â2011, most recently in an October 30, 2011 game vs. the [[Detroit Lions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Henson, Max |title=Lions Defeat Broncos 45-10 |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Lions-Defeat-Broncos-45-10/7a3d004e-286e-47b0-865b-847a62003b0e |publisher=denverbroncos.com |date=October 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] was not a big fan of the alternate orange jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Broncos' RBs turn in uneven performances |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_15671807 |publisher=''denverpost.com'' |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos previously wore orange jerseys as a throwback uniform in a [[Thanksgiving Classic|Thanksgiving Day]] game at the Dallas Cowboys in {{nfly|2001}}. Beginning in {{nfly|2012}}, the modern orange jerseys will become the team's new primary home jersey, while the aforementioned navy blue jerseys will be designated as the new alternate jersey. The move was made due to overwhelming fan support to return to orange as the team's primary home jersey color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orange2012&quot;/&gt;

The team also introduced navy blue pants in {{nfly|2003}}, with orange streaks to be worn with the navy blue jerseys. These pants are primarily used for select prime-time and late-season home games. Though they were part of the uniform change in 1997 and most players wanted to wear them, the only player who vetoed wearing them was [[John Elway]], thereby delaying their eventual introduction.

On November 16, 2003, the Broncos wore their white jerseys at home for the first time since 1983, in a game vs. the San Diego Chargers.  This was compensation for a uniform mix-up, after the teams' first meeting at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]'s [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in Week 2 earlier that season, when the Chargers were the team that was supposed to declare their uniform color.  The Chargers were planning to wear their white jerseys, but the visiting Broncos came to the stadium in white, and were fined $25,000 by the NFL as a result.  When the two teams met at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|INVESCO Field at Mile High]] later that season (Week 11), the NFL allowed the visiting Chargers to choose their uniform color in advance, and they chose navy blue, forcing the Broncos to wear their white jerseys at home.&lt;ref&gt;http://uniforms-i.com/football-uniforms.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nfly|2009}}, in honor of their 50th anniversary season as one of the eight original [[American Football League|AFL]] teams, the Broncos wore their 1960 throwback uniforms (brown helmets, mustard yellow and brown jerseys) for games against two fellow AFL rivalsâa Week 5 home game vs. [[New England Patriots]], as well as the following week at the San Diego Chargers.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d81029dc6&amp;template=without-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true|title=NFL announces 2009 AFL 'Legacy Games'|last=National Football League|publisher=NFL|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/premium/broncos/ci_13530153|title=Even if they win, the Broncos figure to look bad in their throwback uniforms Sunday|last=Klis|first=Mike |date=2009-10-10|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home field==
[[File:Invesco Field at Mile High.jpg|thumb|Sports Authority Field at Mile High, when it was known as INVESCO Field at Mile High]]
For most of their history they played in [[Mile High Stadium]]. The AFL Broncos played at the [[University of Denver]]'s [[DU Stadium|Hilltop Stadium]] from time to time, including the first-ever victory of an [[American Football League|AFL]] team over an [[NFL]] team: The Broncos beat the [[Detroit Lions]] on August 5, 1967, in a preseason game.

The team has sold out every home game (including post-season games) since the NFL merger in 1970, with the exception of two replacement games during the 1987 strike (but both were sold out before the strike). During home games, the attendance is announced to the crowd, along with the number of no-shows (the fans subsequently boo the no-shows). The fans are also known to chant &quot;IN-COM-PLETE&quot; every time the visiting team throws an [[Forward pass|incomplete pass]].

The stadium's legendary home-field advantage is regarded as one of the best in the NFL, especially during the post-season. The Broncos have had the best home record in pro football over the past 32 years (1974â2006, 191â65â1). Mile High Stadium was one of the NFL's loudest stadiums, with [[steel]] flooring instead of [[concrete]], which may have given the Broncos an advantage over opponents.

In [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the team moved into [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|INVESCO Field at Mile High]], built next to the former site of the since demolished old Mile High Stadium. Sportswriter [[Woody Paige]], along with many of Denver's fans, however, often refuse to call the new stadium by its full name, preferring to use &quot;Mile High Stadium&quot; because of its storied history and sentimental import. Additionally the [[Denver Post]] had an official policy of referring to the stadium as simply &quot;Mile High Stadium&quot; in protest, but dropped this policy in 2004.

On August 16, 2011, [[Colorado]]-based sporting goods retailer [[Sports Authority]] claimed the naming rights of Invesco Field, which became known as '''Sports Authority Field at Mile High'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Broncos stadium renamed Sports Authority Field at Mile High |url=http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_18693613 |publisher=''denverpost.com'' |date=August 16, 2011 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colorado altitude has also been attributed as part of the team's home success. The stadium displays multiple references to the stadium's location of {{convert|5280|ft|mi}} above sea level, including a prominent mural just outside the visiting team's locker room.

[[Dave Logan (American football)|Dave Logan]] is the play-by-play announcer, with former Broncos' quarterback [[Brian Griese]] serving as the color commentator. Until 2010, preseason games not selected for airing on national television were shown on [[KCNC-TV|KCNC]], channel 4, which is a [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station]], as well as other CBS affiliates around the [[Rocky Mountain]] region. On May 26, 2011, the Broncos announced that [[KUSA-TV|KUSA]] channel 9, an [[NBC]] affiliate also known as 9NEWS in the Rocky Mountain region, will be the team's new television partner for preseason games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Caldwell, Gray |title=Broncos Partner with KUSA-TV |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-Partner-with-KUSA-TV/dadca969-e9d6-4ae2-8dd9-bfd3700b4d99 |publisher=''denverbroncos.com'' |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable fans and in the media==

*Tim McKernan, a.k.a. [[Barrel Man (Denver Broncos)|Barrel Man]], began wearing a barrel in 1977 after making a $10 bet with his brother, Scott, that by wearing one he could get on television. McKernan won the bet, and the barrel he had painted to look like an Orange Crush soda can became his signature costume, and resulted in him becoming one of the Broncos' most recognized fans and a popular mascot. McKernan died on December 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_13934615 Tim McKernan, &quot;Barrel Man&quot; to Broncos fans, dies at 69&lt;/ref&gt;
*The animated television show [[South Park]], set in [[Park County, Colorado]], often mentions the Denver Broncos; show creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] both grew up in Colorado as devout Broncos fans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.footballbabble.com/football/fans/celebrity/&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[You Only Move Twice]]&quot;, Hank Scorpio gives Homer Simpson the Denver Broncos as a thank-you gift for helping him.  Homer complains that he wanted to own the [[Dallas Cowboys]] (the Broncos are playing very sloppy football on his front lawn while he says this).  Incidentally, the Broncos were 13â3 that year, and won the Super Bowl the next 2 seasons.  In another episode, Homer picks the Broncos to win the Super Bowl (the second of which aired on Fox, home of ''The Simpsons'').
*Many Broncos from the two Super Bowls are now in Sports Broadcasting. This includes, [[Shannon Sharpe]], [[Mark Schlereth]], [[Alfred Williams]], and [[Terrell Davis]].
