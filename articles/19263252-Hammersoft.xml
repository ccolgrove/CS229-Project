RahXephon O.S.T. 2 is the second [[soundtrack]] album from the [[anime]] series ''[[RahXephon]]''. All music and lyrics are by [[Ichiko Hashimoto (musician)|Ichiko Hashimoto]] and performed by her. She is again joined by her sister Mayumi Hashimoto on the song &quot;Yume no Tamago (Egg of the Dream)&quot;. [[Houko Kuwashima]], the voice of [[Characters in RahXephon|Quon]], also sings on this album.

Hashimoto described this as &quot;more organic&quot; than [[RahXephon O.S.T. 1|the first soundtrack]], and it contains some music that was recorded after the series had begun airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The theme of &quot;La, la Maladie du Sommeil&quot; is from [[Polovetsian Dances]]. This track is featured on the album {{nihongo|''[[Junsyoku Brilliant]]''|ç·è²brilliant}} (VICL-61796).

====Content and use====
The track &quot;Huge Suites&quot; ({{audio|RahXephon Huge Suites.ogg|sample}}&lt;!-- FAIR USE of RahXephon Huge Suites.ogg: see file description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:RahXephon_Huge_Suites.ogg for rationale --&gt;) features a melody played in turn by different instruments, over a [[snare drum]] rhythm and a [[counter-melody]], beginning quietly and rising in a [[dynamics (music)|crescendo]]. This track thus shares some of its structure with [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[BolÃ©ro]]''. The initial rhythmic pattern in &quot;Huge Suites&quot; is simpler than that in ''BolÃ©ro'', consisting of only 6 beats. The track as a whole is more ornate, however, with transitions in [[theme (music)|melody theme]] and rhythmic pattern. While the main melody of ''BolÃ©ro'' transitions back and forth between two themes ({{audio-nohelp||Theme A}} {{audio||Theme B}}), this track transitions back and forth between four themes. The first rhythmic change is at 1:23, coinciding with the third theme transition. At 2:00, the string section returns to the original rhythmic pattern while the percussion does not; the previous rhythm thus becomes a counter-rhythm. In contrast, ''BolÃ©ro'' keeps the same rhythmic pattern going all the way until the end. &quot;Huge Suites&quot; has its final transition at 2:18, where the counter melodies end and both the rhythm and theme dive into a crescendo that builds for the last 40 seconds of the track. The main theme from this track is also used for the song &quot;Brave&quot; on the [[RahXephon O.S.T. 3|next album]].

RahXephon O.S.T. 3 is the third and last [[soundtrack]] album from the [[anime]] TV series ''[[RahXephon]]'', but it is followed by the [[RahXephon Pluralitas Concentio O.S.T.|soundtrack to the ''RahXephon'' movie]]. All music and lyrics are by [[Ichiko Hashimoto (musician)|Ichiko Hashimoto]] and performed by her and supporting musicians. [[Houko Kuwashima]], the voice of [[Characters in RahXephon|Quon]], sings an intentionally distorted theme from [[Alexander Borodin]]'s [[Polovetsian Dances]] on track 18 &quot;Way to the Tune&quot;.

====Content and use====
The album opens on &quot;Midday Dream&quot;, a slightly chaotic jazz improvisation that is followed by two tracks with shouting vocals: &quot;Guten Morgen&quot; and &quot;First Explosion&quot;. &quot;Mad Wing&quot; takes the chaos to a crescendo. &quot;Brave&quot; has a fast-beat backing track heavy on [[Percussion instrument|percussions]] with occasional [[electric guitar]] solos and English vocals performed by Hashimoto; the melody is the main theme from &quot;Huge Suites&quot; on the [[RahXephon O.S.T. 2|previous album]]. Track 6 &quot;Tailspins&quot; is a fast-beat track that was used for the air battle in [[List of RahXephon media|the series episode]] 1. 

Tracks 7 through 12 are [[piano]] sonatas; the first one, &quot;Innocent World&quot;, is playful and up-tempo while the rest are calmer, meditative pieces similar to &quot;Solitudes&quot; from [[RahXephon O.S.T. 1|the first album]]. 

Track 14 &quot;Writes herself&quot; was used for episode 19, as was track 16 &quot;Second Sorrow&quot;, which is a version of the ending theme &quot;Yume no Tamago&quot;. Track 15 &quot;Reverse Point&quot; is a piece performed by a double [[string quartet]] (an [[octet (music)|octet]]) and used for the planning scene in episode 21.

&quot;Object Float&quot; is used in the &quot;tuning&quot;, along with &quot;My Soundscape&quot;, which also appears in some &quot;[[eyecatch]]es&quot; ([[commercial bumper]]s) in previous episodes. &quot;Way to the Tune&quot; starts out as a distorted version of ''Gliding Dance of the Maidens'' from [[Polovetsian Dances]] performed by [[Houko Kuwashima]], receding into synthesizer [[Ambient music|ambience]].

&quot;Before you know&quot; is used for the ending credits of the final episode. It starts out as symphonic piece with [[french horn]]s, strings, [[harp]] and [[wood block]]s. [[Clarinette]] and [[flute]] then play the lead, joined by strings. A string bridge takes the track to a transition where the lead is played by drawn strings accentuated by [[pizzicato]] violin, while an electronic [[hi-hat]] and brush beat fades into the symphony. The melody transitions into a version of &quot;Yume no Tamago&quot;, brought to the fore with [[tubular bell]]s and [[grand piano]], while a pronounced [[snare drum]] is added to the beat.

The final track &quot;Previous notice&quot; is a short and fast composition for piano and [[drum kit]] that was used for the episode previews.

'''&quot;Tune the Rainbow&quot;''' is the 12th single by Japanese singer [[Maaya Sakamoto]]. The lyrics to the title track were written by [[Yuho Iwasato]] and the music was composed and arranged by [[Yoko Kanno]].  It was used as the ending theme for the [[anime]] [[television movie]] ''[[RahXephon: Pluralitas Concentio]]'' in which Sakamoto also voiced a character. It was included in both the soundtrack album ''[[RahXephon Pluralitas Concentio O.S.T.]]'' and in the ''[[Single Collection+ Nikopachi]]'' single collection.

The single features a track called &quot;The Garden of Everything&quot;, with lyrics by Sakamoto and [[Chris Mosdell]], and sung by [[Steve Conte]] and Sakamoto. This track is also composed by Kanno, with a submelody from [[Alexander Borodin]]'s [[Polovetsian Dances]].

The single reached the weekly top ten [[Oricon]] ranking, but {{As of|2008|lc=on}} it is the fifth most-sold single of Maaya Sakamoto, and had not sold as many copies as &quot;[[Kiseki no Umi]]&quot;, &quot;[[Hemisphere (song)|Hemisphere]]&quot; or &quot;[[Loop (song)|Loop]]&quot;, although those singles peaked lower in the ranking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/artists/s/211060/|title= Maaya Sakamoto singles data at Oricon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
