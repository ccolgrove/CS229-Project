}}'''''Secret Story 2008''''' was the fourth edition of the [[France|French]] version of the reality show [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]] carrying on from the previous similar show, [[Loft Story]]. It aired on [[TF1]] and was presented by the same presenter of [[Loft Story]] and Secret story 1 , [[Benjamin Castaldi]]. The series started on 27 June 2008, when 15 people entered a purpose-built house on the outskirts of [[Paris]].

==Principle==

The principle is similar to that of [[Loft Story]]. The contestants are kept locked away for 10 weeks in a house, called ''&quot;La Maison des Secrets&quot;'' (the House of Secrets) measuring 1600mÂ² styled on the UK Big Brother house including a swimming pool, jacuzzi, a lounge, a big bedroom divided by a shattered glass, bathroom with showers and 5 secrets room (Crystal room, Love cave, Museum of Secrets, White Room, Bedsit [like BBUK5]). All of the rooms are installed with cameras, (except the toilet due to a law imposed by the ''Conseil SupÃ©rieur de l'audiovisuel''). ''The Voice'' speaks to the contestants at times, and acts like &quot;Big Brother&quot; in other countries. Each contestant has to conceal a secret. Everyone else has to try and discover it. If a contestant does, that contestant wins the jackpot of the contestant whose secret they have guessed. Each secret is worth â¬10,000. Each Tuesday, 2 contestants are nominated and put up against the public vote to be evicted on the Friday. The girls and boys nominate the opposite sex, alternating weekly.

The second series of the show lasted 10 weeks, with 16 candidates. Out of these  candidates, 15 candidates entered the house during the launch night with 3 of them put in the Crystal Room. The last candidate, Nicolas, was dubbed as the Mystery Candidate and enter the house on Day 7.
