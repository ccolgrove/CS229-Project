The '''Aspen Institute''' is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1950 as the '''Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies'''. The organization is dedicated to &quot;fostering enlightened leadership, the appreciation of timeless ideas and values, and open-minded dialogue on contemporary issues.&quot; The institute and its international partners promote the pursuit of common ground and deeper understanding in a nonpartisan and nonideological setting through regular seminars, policy programs, conferences, and leadership development initiatives. The institute is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[USA]], and has campuses in [[Aspen, Colorado]] (its original home) and near the shores of the Chesapeake Bay at the Wye River in Maryland. It has partner Aspen Institutes in [http://www.aspeninstitute.de/ Berlin], Rome, Madrid, Lyon, Tokyo, New Delhi, and Bucharest, as well as leadership initiatives in the United States and in Africa, India, and Central America.

The Aspen Institute is largely funded by foundations such as the [[Carnegie Corporation]], The [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] and the [[Ford Foundation]], by seminar fees, and by individual donations. Its board of trustees includes leaders from politics, government, business and academia who also contribute to its support. Board members include [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Sylvia Earle]], [[Henry Louis Gates]], [[David Gergen]], [[David H. Koch]], [[Queen Noor of Jordan]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/about/leadership-board |title=Leadership and Board of Trustees |publisher=The Aspen Institute |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Isaacson]] is President and CEO.

==Mission==
On July 27, 2008, the Aspen Institute Board of Directors approved a new mission:
* To foster values-based leadership, encouraging individuals to reflect on the ideals and ideas that define a good society, and to provide a neutral and balanced venue for discussing and acting on critical issues.

The Aspen Institute does this in four ways:
* Seminars, which help participants reflect on what they think makes a good society, thereby deepening knowledge, broadening perspectives and enhancing their capacity to solve the problems leaders face.
*Young-leader fellowships around the globe, which bring leaders together for an intense multi-year program and commitment. The fellows become better leaders and apply their skills to major challenges.
*Policy programs, which serve as nonpartisan forums for analysis, consensus building, and problem solving on a variety of issues.
*Public conferences and events, which provide a commons for people to share ideas.

==History==
The Institute was largely the creation of [[Walter Paepcke]], a [[Chicago]] businessman who had become inspired by the [[Great Books]] program of [[Mortimer Adler]] at the [[University of Chicago]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  In 1945, Paepcke visited [[Bauhaus]] Artist and Architect [[Herbert Bayer]], AIA, who had designed and built a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist home outside the decaying former mining town of Aspen, in the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork Valley]].  Paepcke and Bayer envisioned a place where artists, leaders, thinkers, musicians could gather. Shortly thereafter, while passing through Aspen on a hunting expedition, Oil Industry maverick [[Robert O. Anderson]] (soon to be Founder &amp; CEO of [[Atlantic Richfield]]) met with Bayer and shared in Paepcke's and Bayer's vision. In 1949, Paepcke organized a 20-day international celebration for the 200th birthday of [[Germany|German]] [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. The celebration attracted over 2,000 attendees, including [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Jose Ortega y Gasset]], [[Thornton Wilder]], and [[Arthur Rubinstein]].

In 1950, Paepcke founded the Aspen Institute; and later the [[Aspen Music Festival]] and eventually (with Bayer and Anderson) [[the International Design Conference at Aspen]] (IDCA). Paepcke sought a forum âwhere the human spirit can flourish,â especially amid the whirlwind and chaos of modernization. He hoped that the Institute could help business leaders recapture what he called  &quot;eternal verities&quot;: the values that guided them intellectually, ethically, and spiritually as they led their companies. Inspired by philosopher [[Mortimer Adler]]âs Great Books seminar at the [[University of Chicago]], Paepcke worked with Anderson to create the Aspen Institute Executive Seminar. In 1951, the Institute sponsored a national [[photography]] conference attended by [[Ansel Adams]], [[Dorothea Lange]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Berenice Abbott]], and other notables. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Institute added organizations, programs, and conferences, including the [[Aspen Center for Physics]], the [[Aspen Strategy Group]], [[Aspen Institute Communications and Society Program|Communications and Society Program]] and other programs that concentrated on [[education]], [[communications]], [[justice]], [[Asia]]n thought, [[science]], [[technology]], [[the environment]], and [[international affairs]].

In 1979, through a donation by [[Corning Glass]] industrialist and philanthropist [[Arthur A. Houghton, Jr.]] the Institute acquired a 1,000-acre (4 kmÂ²) campus on the eastern shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Maryland]], known today as the [[Wye River Conference Centers]].

In 2005, it held the first [http://www.aspeninstitute.org/ideasfest Aspen Ideas Festival], featuring leading minds from around the world sharing and speaking on global issues. The Institute, along with ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', hosts the festival annually.

Today, the Aspen Institute seminar programs include sessions such as Global Values and Leadership and Pursuing the Good Life.

In 2011, the Institute hired [[Ronald Schiller]], who was at the time a fundraising executive with [[National Public Radio]].  Schiller became the center of a widely publicized controversy when a secretly recorded tape was released. In the recording Schiller meets with a pair of self-described [[Muslims]] who claim to wish to donate money to NPR because they approve of the political slant of its coverage.   Schiller is recorded calling members of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] &quot;seriously [[racist]], racist people&quot;, characterizing the group as &quot;fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very [[fundamental Christian]] â I wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird [[evangelical]] kind of move,&quot; and saying that NPR &quot;would be better off in the long run without [[federal funding]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/03/what-james-okeefes-latest-video-means-for-npr-funding/72198/ |title=What James O'Keefe's Latest Video Means for NPR Funding |first=Chris |last=Good |publisher=The Atlantic |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/03/tea-party-secret-video-npr-funding-/1 | work=USA Today | first=Catalina | last=Camia | title=NPR executive calls Tea Party supporters 'racist' | date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott |first=Mark |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/08/134358398/in-video-npr-exec-slams-tea-party-questions-need-for-federal-funds?ft=1&amp;f=1001 |title=In Video: NPR Exec Slams Tea Party, Questions Need For Federal Funds : The Two-Way |publisher=NPR |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/npr-executive-caught-calling-tea-partiers-racist/ | work=The New York Times | first=Brian | last=Stelter | title=NPR Executive Caught Calling Tea Partiers âRacist' | date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41970138/ns/politics-more_politics/ |title=NPR exec caught bashing Tea Partiers as 'racist' |publisher=TODAY News |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the exposure, Schiller resigned from what was to be his post as the new director of the Aspen Institute Arts Program and Harman-Eisner Artist-in-Residence Program, stating that &quot;he does not feel that it's in the best interests of the Aspen Institute for him to come work [there].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Embattled NPR exec won't take Aspen Institute post |first=Janet |last=Urquhart |url=http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20110310/NEWS/110309825/1077&amp;ParentProfile=1058 |newspaper=[[The Aspen Times]] |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2011 |quote=âRon Schiller has informed us that, in light of the controversy surrounding his recent statements, he does not feel that it's in the best interests of the Aspen Institute for him to come work here,â said a brief announcement from James Spiegelman, vice president of communications and public affairs at the Aspen Institute in Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
