==History==
Acer was founded by [[Stan Shih]] (æ½æ¯æ¦®), his wife [[Carolyn Yeh]], and a group of five others as Multitech in 1976, headquartered in [[Hsinchu City]], Taiwan.

It began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital.  Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the [[Micro-Professor MPF-I]] training kit, then two [[Apple II clone]]s; the [[Microprofessor II]] and [[Microprofessor II|III]] before joining the emerging [[IBM PC compatible market]]âand over time becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed Acer in 1987.

In 1993, Acer posted record profits of $75 million; 43 percent of that year's net was generated by the DRAM joint venture, considered &quot;the most efficient in the DRAM industry&quot; by some observers. Total sales grew to $3.2 billion in 1994, and net income increased to $205 million, as Acer America turned its first annual profit in the 1990s.  From 1994 to 1995, Acer advanced from 14th to ninth among the world's largest computer manufacturers, surpassing Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and Toshiba.

In 1995, the Aspire PC was unveiled. In 1996, Acer expanded into consumer electronics, introducing many new, inexpensive videodisc players, video telephones, and other devices to boost global market share,&lt;ref name=CentRes/&gt; and in 1997 extended its laptop efforts by buying [[Texas Instruments]]' [[Texas Instruments#Consumer electronics and computers|mobile PC division]].

In 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. Two years later that corporate restructuring did not appear to have made a significant impact on the company overall, and stock prices were falling. Shih restructured again. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales vs. contract manufacturing businesses, Shih spun off the contract business, renaming it Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. The restructuring also resulted in Acer breaking off several of its smaller operations, including semiconductor design, consumer electronics, and liquid-crystal displays.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycBus2&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early signs indicated that the spinoff strategy had worked well, especially in Europe, where Acer became a popular PC brand. In 2003, company sales increased 48 percent to $4.6 billion, and helped Acer surpass Japan's Toshiba and [[NEC]], making it the world's fifth largest maker of PCs.&lt;ref name=EncycBus2/&gt;

Acer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels.  By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide.  Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003&lt;ref name=&quot;Gianfranco Tutti&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Acquisitions===
On 27 August 2007, Acer announced plans to acquire its US-based rival [[Gateway Inc.]] for US$710 million. Acer's chairman, [[J.T. Wang]], stated that the acquisition &quot;completes Acer's global footprint, by strengthening our United States presence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20458321/|title=Taiwan's Acer to buy PC maker Gateway - World business |publisher=MSNBC|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in this acquisition was the [[eMachines]] brand.

In January 2008, Acer announced that it had acquired a controlling interest of 75% of [[Packard Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/31/AR2008013101390.html|title=Acer Buys 75 Percent of Packard Bell making it the 2nd largest computer maker in the world|work=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-04-07 | date=2008-01-31| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqx42YJw | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Acer acquired: [[E-TEN]] and 29.9% of [[Olidata]].

In August 2010, Acer and [[Founder Technology]] signed a memorandum of mutual understanding to strengthen their long term PC business cooperation.

In July 2011, Acer Inc. will buy iGware Inc. for $320 million to try possible potentially lucrative cloud market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/acer-to-buy-cloud-computing-firm-igware/article2104667/?utm_medium=Feeds%3A%20RSS%2FAtom&amp;utm_source=Home&amp;utm_content=2104667 Acer to buy cloud computing firm iGware - The Globe and Mail]&lt;/ref&gt; iGware creates cloud software and infrastructure tools for devices. &lt;ref&gt; Don Reisinger, CNET. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20081409-17/acer-to-acquire-cloud-service-provider-igware/ Acer to acquire cloud-service provider iGware].&quot; July 21, 2011.

==Operations==
===North America===
[[File:Acer-America-Offices.jpg|thumb|220px|Right|Headquarters of Acer America at San Carlos St. San Jose, CA]]
Acer America Corporation, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a member of the Acer Group. Acer's R&amp;D, engineering, manufacturing and marketing operations in the United States and Canada are handled by Acer America. In September 1990, Acer acquired Altos Computer Systems, one of the top manufacturers of multi-user and networked [[Unix]] computer systems for commercial markets. In February 1997, Acer acquired [[Texas Instruments]] Mobile Computing business, including the award-winning TravelMate and Extensa notebook lines, making Acer the fourth-leading notebook manufacturer in the United States. In 2007 Acer acquired PC maker [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]]. The acquisitions marked Acerâs return to the US consumer market that it abandoned in 1999 after losing $45m struggling to build brand awareness. Acer America's Canadian office, in Mississauga, Ontario, handles repair of Acer, Gateway, and E-Machine Notebooks and Desktop PCs for Eastern Canada. Acer has several facilities in Temple, Texas including a repair facility, a parts warehouse, and a call center. In the words of its Chief Executive, J.T. Wang, âBuilding a brand is very different in the US. The investment at the initial stage has to be very bigâotherwise there is almost no impactâ.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Einhorn, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Australian subsidiary of Acer is Acer Computer Australia (ACA). The subsidiary was established in 1990, and is currently Australia's third largest personal computer vendor, behind Hewlett-Packard Australia and Dell Australia and New Zealand. Acer Computer Australia has Australia's highest overall market share in notebook PC and tablet PC sales. The company is also Australia's leading PC vendor in government and education markets. Acer Computer Australia has 480 employees as of 2006.

===India===
Acer's subsidiary in India is '''Acer India (Pvt) Limited''', and was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Acer Computer International, Ltd. in 1999. It is a notable vendor in key segments such as education, desktop computers and low profile notebooks for education. The headquarters are in [[Bangalore]], India. It has however been extensively criticized for poor after sales service and multiple other issues that have plagued its customers.

==Linux==
Acer has shipped some of their notebooks and more recently netbooks, with various [[Linux]] [[operating system]] distributions including [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Linpus Linux|Linpus]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (in a dual boot environment with [[Windows XP]]), and [[Google Chrome OS]].

==Environmental record==

In 2005, Acer published its first environmental report, for which the company used the GRI guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a multi-stakeholder process and independent institution whose mission is to develop and disseminate globally applicable Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.&lt;/ref&gt; All of Acerâs tier-one suppliers have acquired ISO 14001 certification.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14001 was released in 1996 with the intent that companies manage all of the activities, products and services that can significantly impact the environment&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Acer was ranked 12th place out of 15 in [[Greenpeace]]âs re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics, with the a score of 2.9 points out of 10. The Guide ranks electronics makers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics - Greenpeace International|accessdate= November 16 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Greenpeace criticized the company for not setting out targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as intended in 2010 and for not providing external verification for the GHG emissions it reports for its operations and business travel. It also scored badly on the Products criteria receiving no points on product life cycle while Greenpeace noted that a higher percentage of its products need to meet or exceed Energy Star standards in order for it to score more points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;/&gt;  

It received some praise for launching new products which are free from polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and the company informed Greenpeace 
that the majority of its products will be PVC/BFR free in the near future. Acer also scored well on chemical management for lobbying for restrictions on organo-halogens and was commended for reporting on GHG emissions from its first tier suppliers and investigating its second tier. &lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;/&gt;
