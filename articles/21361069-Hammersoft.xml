Dunn, mmn = Franklin&lt;/ref&gt;''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 9 January 1920) is a retired English actor, comedian and [[author]], best known for his role as [[Lance-Corporal Jack Jones]] in the [[BBC]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Dad's Army]]''.

==Early life==
Born in [[Covent Garden]], [[Westminster]], Dunn is the cousin of actress [[Gretchen Franklin]]. As a child, he almost died while having a [[supernumerary nipple]] removed. 

==Education==
Dunn was educated at [[Sevenoaks School]], an [[independent school|independent]] boarding school for boys (now coeducational), in the town of [[Sevenoaks]] in [[Kent]] in south east England. After leaving school, Dunn studied at the independent [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts]], in London.

==Life and career==
Dunn played small film roles from the 1930s onwards, appearing alongside [[Will Hay]] in the films ''[[Boys Will Be Boys (film)|Boys Will Be Boys]]'' (1935) and ''[[Good Morning, Boys]]'' (1937). After a break for service in the army with the [[4th Queen's Own Hussars]], during the [[Second World War]], during the course of which he spent four years in prisoner-of-war and labour camps in Austria,&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube2005&quot;&gt;&quot;We Are the Boys&quot;, BBC documentary (2005) This link no longer works--&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BT0TiXbGNQ&lt;/ref&gt; he worked for many years in music halls and theatres. In 1956 and 1957, Dunn appeared in both series of ''[[The Tony Hancock Show]]'' and the army reunion party episode of ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'' in 1960. In the 1960s he made many appearances with [[Tony Hancock]], [[Michael Bentine]], [[Dora Bryan]] and [[Dick Emery]], among others, before winning the role of Jones in ''Dad's Army'' in 1968.

From an early time his trademark character was that of a doddering old man. This first made an impression in the show ''[[Bootsie and Snudge]]'', a spinoff from ''[[The Army Game]]''. Dunn played the old [[dogsbody]] at a slightly seedy [[Gentlemen's club (traditional)|gentlemen's club]] where the characters Pvt. &quot;Bootsie&quot; Bisley ([[Alfie Bass]]) and Sgt. Claude Snudge ([[Bill Fraser]]) found work after leaving the [[British Army|Army]].

In 1967 he made a guest appearance in an episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', playing the proprietor of a toy shop in &quot;Something Nasty in the Nursery&quot;. He was also one of the alien voices in the Cadbury's Smash advertisements in the 1970s, alongside ''Dad's Army'' co-star [[Bill Pertwee]].

Dunn was one of the younger members of the ''Dad's Army'' cast when, at 48, he took on the role of the elderly [[butcher]] whose military service in earlier wars made him the most experienced member of the [[Walmington-on-Sea]] [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]], as well as being one of the most decrepit.  Previous actors considered for the role were Jack Haig and [[David Jason]].&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube2005&quot;/&gt;

Dunn's staunch [[Socialist]] beliefs often caused him to fall out with [[Arthur Lowe]], who played Captain Mainwaring and who was an active [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. When the series ended and Dunn finally accepted an [[OBE]], after many offers, it was reported that Lowe would only accept a higher-rated honour from the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Graham McCann &quot;Dad's Army, The Story of a Classic Television Show&quot; ISBN 1-84115-309-5&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Dad's Army'' ended, Dunn capitalised on his skill in playing elderly character roles by playing the lead in the slapstick children's TV series ''Grandad'', from 1979 to 1984 (he played the caretaker at a village hall).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ECdcra6m64&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=77168A35E2C6FEAC&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=38&lt;/ref&gt;  He had previously had a [[chart-topper|number one]] [[hit single]] with the [[song]] &quot;[[Grandad (song)|Grandad]]&quot; on his 51st birthday in January 1971, accompanied by a children's choir.  The song was written by bassist [[Herbie Flowers]]. He performed the song four times on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]  of &quot;Grandad&quot;, &quot;I Play The Spoons&quot;, also received considerable airplay. After the cancellation of ''Grandad'' in 1984, he effectively disappeared from the screen, retiring to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://home.btconnect.com/howejam/dadsarmy/news_archive/1992_permissionspeak.htm Permission to Speak, Sir?] Saga magazine (February 1992) accessed 15 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
