Geauga County is part of the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]&amp;ndash;[[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]]&amp;ndash;[[Mentor, Ohio|Mentor]] [[Greater Cleveland|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Geauga County was founded on March 1, 1806 as the second county in the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], originating from [[Trumbull County, Ohio]]. Geauga County is named after the  [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word &quot;Sheauga&quot; meaning &quot;[[raccoon]]. In 1808, the size of Geauga County was reduced by the creation of [[Ashtabula County, Ohio|Ashtabula County]] and [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]]. 

The present-day boundaries were established in 1840 following the creation of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]]. A disagreement about the location of the county seat began in 1808 when commissioners from [[Trumbull County, Ohio|Trumbull County]] began the process of identifying the seat of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stith|first=B.A.|title=Lake County, Ohio: 150 Years of Tradition|year=1989|publisher=Windsor Publications|location=Northridge, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Residents in the northern townships wanted the seat in Champion, renamed [[Painesville, Ohio]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=stith&gt;{{cite web|last=Stith|first=B.A.|title=A Vision Divided|url=http://www.case.edu/artsci/wrss/documents/Stith_000.pdf|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Residents in southern townships desired a centrally-located county seat and took advantage of a tract of land donated by Peter Chardon Brooks called [[Chardon, Ohio]]. Despite Chardon being selected in 1809, the argument was never really settled. Over the next two decades, population growth in the seven northern townships exceeded the remaining sixteen southern townships, further fueling the disagreement. On January 21, 1840, a petition to create Lake County from seven townships in northern Geauga County and [[Willoughby, Ohio|Willoughby Township]] from [[Cuyahoga County]] were presented to the Ohio House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=stith/&gt; [[Seabury Ford]] presented petitions against its creation. Lake County was established in March 1840 by the Ohio state legislature. As the newly-formed Lake County did not have sufficient territory to meet the requirements for a county, the northern border included submerged land beneath the waters of [[Lake Erie]].

The first settlement in Geauga, was at [[Burton, Ohio]] in the year 1798, when three families settled there from [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Henry|title=Historical Collections of Ohio|year=1852|publisher=Bradley &amp; Anthony|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=187â190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|408|sqmi|1}}.{{convert|404|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|5|sqmi|1}} (1.13%) is water.

Geauga County receives the most precipitation of any county in northern Ohio, with most of the county receiving over 42&amp;nbsp;inches annually in an average year, and some parts exceeding 44&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocs.orst.edu/pub/maps/Precipitation/Total/States/OH/oh.gif &quot;Average Annual Preciptation: Ohio&quot;, Map, Published by Oregon State University, Data from 1961-1990.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drainage System===
The [[geography]] of Geauga County was radically changed by [[Illinoian glaciation|Illinoian]] and [[Wisconsinan glaciation]], which is evident in the deranged [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]], landscape change, and [[Till|glacial till]]. The [[headwater]]s of three [[river|watercourses]] in the [[Lake Erie]] [[drainage basin|basin]] are located in Geauga County. These include the [[Cuyahoga River]], [[Chagrin River]], and [[Grand River (Ohio)|Grand River]]. Portions of all three are designated [http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/tabid/985/Default.aspx Ohio Scenic Rivers].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scenic Rivers|url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/tabid/985/Default.aspx|work=Ohio Scenic Rivers Program|publisher=Ohio Dept of Natural Resources (ODNR)|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out-of-county fares are two times the posted in-county fares. Service is provided 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM Monday through Friday. Reservations are suggested with at least three days notice, but can be made up to one week in advance. [http://www.geaugatransit.org/ Geauga County Transit]
