==Biography==
He was born to [[Spanish settlement in Argentina|Argentine parents of Spanish descent]] in Spain, and thus held dual Argentine and Spanish citizenship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 2007, he acquired Japanese citizenship automatically as a result of his father's naturalization. Escudero is a cousin of [[DamiÃ¡n Escudero]] and nephew of [[Osvaldo Escudero]].

==Career==
When Escudero was three years old, he moved to [[Japan]] because of his father's work and joined the local club team. After living in Japan for five years, he moved to [[Argentina]] and Escudero began his career with the [[Club AtlÃ©tico VÃ©lez SÃ¡rsfield|VÃ©lez SÃ¡rsfield]] youth team, where his father, also named Sergio Ariel Escudero and uncle [[Osvaldo Salvador Escudero]] have played. Then he was called up to the U-15 [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]] training camp.

In 2001, Escudero returned to Japan and joined [[Kashiwa Reysol]] junior youth team in Chiba and later moved to [[Urawa Red Diamonds]] junior youth team in Saitama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Language icon|ja|Japanese}} [http://www.urawa-reds.co.jp/Team/Players/s_a_escudero.html ãã¼ã ãã­ãã£ã«ï½æµ¦åã¬ãããã¤ã¤ã¢ã³ãºå¬å¼ãµã¤ãï½URAWA RED DIAMONDS OFFICIAL WEBSITE]&lt;/ref&gt; He scored many goals in youth level league matches and contracted with Urawa Reds in 2005. Playing as a [[striker|forward]], Escudero made his debut as a professional on April 15, 2005, against [[Albirex Niigata]] at the age of 16 years, 8 months and 21 days and he became the second youngest [[J. League]] Division 1 player after [[Takayuki Morimoto]]. In 2006, German outfit [[VfB Stuttgart]] were interested in him but Urawa refused to release him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Language icon|de|German}} [http://www.kicker.de/content/news/artikel.asp?folder=24100&amp;object=326099&amp;liga=1&amp;saison=2005%2F06&amp;spieltag=17&amp;gruppe=18664 Escudero: Stuttgart zeigt Interesse]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2007, he obtained his Japanese citizenship and therefore he had a chance to play for the [[Japan national football team|Japan national team]] at [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[Canada]]. However he failed to make it to the tournament since the squad was submitted before he became a Japanese citizen. In May 2008, he joined the U-23 national team which played at the [[2008 Toulon Tournament]] and scored a goal against [[CÃ´te d'Ivoire national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Language icon|ja|Japanese}} [http://beijing2008.nikkansports.com/soccer/f-sc-tp2-20080515-360288.html æ£®æ¬ãã¨ã¹ã¯ãã­ãï¼µ23ä»£è¡¨ã«å¹³å±±ã¯è½é¸]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Language icon|de|German}} [http://www.footiemag.de/matches_25470_u-21%20ivory%20coast_vs_u-21%20japan_29-05-2008.html U-21 Ivory Coast - U-21 Japan 4:3 - FOOTIESTATS.NET]&lt;/ref&gt;
