The '''Australian Football League''' ('''AFL''') is both the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] and the major professional competition in the sport of [[Australian rules football]]. The term is sometimes mistakenly used as the name of the code itself.

The AFL premiership season currently consists of 24 home and away rounds, followed by the finals series and the season concludes with the [[AFL Grand Final]] at which the winning team receives the premiership cup.

The AFL was formerly known as the Victorian Football League (VFL). It was renamed the Australian Football League due to the VFL's governing body's decision to market the competition as an officially national league in 1990. This was following expansion into [[New South Wales, Australia|New South Wales]], [[Queensland, Australia|Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]] in the 1980s.

Through the [[AFL Commission]] it gained control over the game at most levels and controls the [[Laws of Australian Football|Laws of the Game]] through the AFL Rules Committee (consisting of members from the [[AFL Players Association]]). The Commission pushes for all affiliated leagues and bodies to [[Co-branding|co-brand]] with the league (although some state and local associations have sternly resisted).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/sport/afl/afl-wants-sanfl-name-change/799440.aspx AFL wants SANFL name change]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}, 27 June 2008, independentweekly.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL is also recognised as the world governing body of Australian football by the majority of larger international leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20090521120643720 International footy lifts its profile in AFL interview - World Footy News]&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL is the [[2010 Australian football code crowds|most attended sporting league in Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.theage.com.au/v8-supercars-a-tv-ratings-winner/20080205-1qb7.html V8 Supercars a TV ratings winner]&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the two most watched sports in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/afl-beats-nrl-in-ratings-grand-final-20101004-163ip.html AFL beats NRL in ratings grand final]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVNZ_3315931&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-league-news/league-becomes-australia-s-top-sport-3315931 |title=League becomes Australia's top sport |date=21 December 2009 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also currently the third-most attended professional sports league in the world in terms of attendance per match, with an [[List of attendance figures at domestic professional sports leagues|average attendance]] of 38,417.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of attendance figures at domestic professional sports leagues]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the most financially strong sports league in the country due to substantial media and corporate sponsorship arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2009/s2707758.htm Football codes do battle for fan base]&lt;/ref&gt;

In national terms, however, [[Australian rules football in Australia|Australian football]] is not the most popular sport in all areas of the country. In recent decades, the AFL has increasingly focused on regions behind the &quot;[[Barassi Line]]&quot;, particularly in metropolitan areas (its &quot;developing markets&quot;) where the league and sport has traditionally struggled. The league has granted concessions to teams based in these regions and invested large amounts of development funding. As a result, participation is increasing in New South Wales and Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/afl_hq/annual_reports/2007/GameDevelopment.pdf Record Community Growth]; AFL Annual Report 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL operates on a single table system, with no divisions, conferences nor promotion and relegation from other leagues.

Many of the current AFL teams date back to the beginnings of the sport of Australian rules football, including the very first club, [[Melbourne Football Club]] (1859), a foundation VFL/AFL club whose founders also first codified the sport in 1859. The Victorian Football League, commonly known as the VFL, started in 1897 with eight teams from the Victorian Football Association (VFA): [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]], [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]], [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]], and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]. [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[Melbourne University Football Club|University]] entered in 1908, but University disbanded in 1915. In 1925, Footscray (later known as the [[Western Bulldogs]]), [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] entered the competition. It remained in this 12-team single-state configuration until 1982 when South Melbourne relocated to [[Sydney|Sydney, New South Wales]] to become the [[Sydney Swans]].

The next phase of national expansion occurred in 1987, with the introduction of the [[West Coast Eagles]] from Western Australia and the [[Brisbane Bears]] from Queensland. The league was renamed the '''Australian Football League''' in 1990 to reflect the expanded nature of the competition. South Australia was first represented in 1991 when the [[Adelaide Football Club]] joined the league. The [[Fremantle Football Club]] joined as the second WA team in 1995. After the 1996 season the Brisbane Bears merged with Fitzroy, creating the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 1996 and the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] joined to maintain the league at 16 teams. In 2011, the [[Gold Coast Football Club]] joined the AFL, while [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|Greater Western Sydney]] will expand the competition to 18 teams in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/gold-coast-suns-prepared-for-bullying-in-debut-season/story-e6frf9jf-1225985252777 Gold Coast Suns prepared for bullying in debut season | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New clubs===
Early in 2008, a meeting held by the AFL discussed having two new teams enter the AFL competition.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Caroline; [http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/its-war-afl-raids-league-heartland/2008/02/15/1202760609307.html Raid on home turf of league]; Realfooty.com.au; 16 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, the AFL won the support of the league's 16 club presidents to establish a side on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. In June 2008 it was announced that the new team would play in the TAC Cup in 2009 before being promoted to play in the AFL Premiership from 2011. On 31 March 2009 the AFL issued a provisional licence to the [[Gold Coast Football Club]]. The team debuted in the TAC Cup as planned in 2009. Their nickname, the '''Suns''', and their playing colours were unveiled on 22 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/07/23/241201_gold-coast-afl.html Gold Coast Suns officially revealed QAFL | goldcoast.com.au | Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; Their first official match against other AFL teams was on 19 February 2011, when they played against both the [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|GWS Giants]] and the [[Sydney Swans]] in a triangular NAB Cup season-opener, comprehensively defeating the GWS Giants and narrowly winning against Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldcoastfc.com.au/2011-season/2011-nab-cup/ Gold Coast SUNS | AFL - 2011 NAB Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; In the AFL premiership season, their debut game was against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] at the [[The Gabba|Gabba]] on 2 April 2011, which is the second round of the season as they had a [[bye (sports)|bye]] in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldcoastfc.com.au/2011-season/fixture/ Gold Coast SUNS | AFL - Fixture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greater Western Sydney Football Club]] was granted a licence in 2010 and is due to enter the league in 2012. The introduction of a club from Western Sydney has been met with much skepticism, as it is seen to be disadvantaging other clubs in its push to be successful in the first 10 years, as well as being an unreasonable situation from which to draw an AFL fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-Arts-and-Sports/20080610-AFL-in-League-heartland-makes-no-sense.html |title=Crikey â AFL in League heartland makes no sense â AFL in League heartland makes no sense |publisher=Crikey.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they made their professional debut against other AFL teams on 19 February 2011, when they played against {{AFL GC}} and {{AFL Syd}} in a triangular NAB Cup season-opener, losing both matches by a significant margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwsgiants.com.au/giant-news.html Greater Western Sydney Giants]&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL has also considered a bid from the Tasmanian government for a licence for a [[Tasmanian AFL Bid|Tasmanian team]].
In April 2009, the then Premier of Tasmania, [[Paul Lennon]], had a meeting with the AFL to discuss the possibility of a new team based in Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Martin; [http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/go-north-or-south-afl-not-west-of-the-east/2008/05/09/1210131268450.html Go north or south, AFL, not west of the east]; Realfooty.com.au; 10 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Canberra and Darwin are also sometimes suggested as future locations for teams. However they have been ruled out by the AFL primarily on economic and demographic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Brett;

===Former clubs===
Since the Australian Football League commenced in 1897 as the Victorian Football League, only one club has left the competition, [[Melbourne University Football Club]] They last competed in 1914 and withdrew the following season due to the start of the [[First World War]] and did not reapply to join the league after the war ended. They still compete to this day in the [[Victorian Amateur Football Association]]. Two other clubs, the [[Fitzroy Football Club]] (Fitzroy Lions) and the [[Brisbane Bears]] merged in 1996 to form the [[Brisbane Lions]].

In 1982, [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne Football Club]] relocated to Sydney to become the [[Sydney Swans]] and in 1997 the [[Footscray Football Club]] was renamed to the [[Western Bulldogs]]. From 1999 to 2006 [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]] were known as simply the Kangaroos. These changes are not considered by the AFL to have created new clubs, but just changes in name or location.

The AFL has tight controls over the player lists of each club; each club can have a senior list of 40 players plus up to ten rookie or veteran players. From 2006, up to two international rookies are also permitted. Clubs can only trade players during a &quot;trade week&quot; at the end of each season and can only recruit new players through the [[AFL Draft]]. The rules for the draft have changed every few years since it was introduced in 1986, but the basic philosophy remains in that players are selected by clubs in the reverse of the order of their positions on the ladder at the end of the preceding season. That is, the club that finished last has first draft selection, then the club that finished second last. However, this philosophy has been compromised by giving priority picks to clubs which win fewer than four matches during the season and by allowing clubs to select sons of former players under the [[Father-Son Rule]] which itself has been varied over the years.

A [[salary cap]] (known as the Total Player Payments or TPP) is also in place as part of the league's equalisation policy; in 2011, this is set at A$8,212,500 with a salary floor of A$7,596,562.50 for 2011 (except for the [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast]] expansion team, whose salary cap will be A$9,212,500 with a salary floor of A$8,596,562.50). Salaries of draft selections are fixed for two years. Salaries for senior players are not normally released to the public, although one report put the average for 2011 at $211,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/123501/default.aspx]â &quot;Players Say No,&quot; www.afl.com.au; retrieved 15 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the top few players can expect to earn up to $1,000,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,21424440-23211,00.html?from=news Massive pay hike]&lt;/ref&gt;

The breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the AFL are exceeding the TPP, falling below the salary floor, not informing the AFL of payments, late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents, or engaging in draft tampering. Penalties include fines of up to triple the amount involved ($10,000 for each document late or incorrect lodged or lost), forfeiture of draft picks and/or deduction of premiership points; the latter penalty has never been implemented for any of the breaches that have occurred.

In 2002, [[Carlton Football Club#Recent history|Carlton]] were fined $987,500 and barred from receiving priority picks, from the first two rounds of the National Draft for two years and from the 2003 pre-season draft after an AFL investigation found that they had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap totaling $1.37 million between 1998 and 2001. The fine was an Australian sporting record until the [[Melbourne Storm]] NRL team were fined $1.689 million in 2010 for [[Melbourne Storm salary cap breach|gross long-term salary cap breaches]].

There were 12 players recruited from outside of Australia on AFL listsin 2011, including 10 from Ireland, all [[List of players who have converted from one football code to another|converts]] from [[Gaelic football]] drafted as part of the [[Irish Experiment]]. The other two players are [[Seamus McNamara]] ({{AFL Col}}) and [[Mike Pyke]] ({{AFL Syd}}), recruited from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] respectively.

There were also another five overseas-born players who emigrated to Australia at an early age on AFL lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/staticpages/index.php/AFL_players_international_connections Current AFL players with strong international connections] â WorldFootyNews.

An International Rookie List and International Scholarship List were introduced in 2006. The International Rookie List comprises up to  two players between the ages of 15â23 who are not Australian citizens. These players may remain on this list for up to three years before they must be transferred to the senior or rookie list. For the first year, payments made to international-rookie-listed players fall outside the salary cap. The International Scholarship List gives AFL clubs the option of recruiting up to eight players from outside Australia (other than Ireland). Irish players are required to either be placed on clubs' senior or [[rookie list]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20080317000031196 International recruitment about to explode?] â WorldFootyNews.

==Season structure==
===Premiership season===
{{See also|2011 AFL season}}
The ''Toyota AFL Premiership Season'', contested between the 17 teams from around Australia, lasts for 24 rounds and begins in late March. For the [[2011 AFL season]], each team will play 22 games, and have two byes. The [[McClelland Trophy]] is awarded to the team that finishes the home and away rounds in first position (the minor premiership).

At the end of the 24 rounds, the top eight teams compete in the four-week ''[[AFL finals system|AFL Finals Series]]''. In the first week the top four teams play in qualifying finals (1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd), the two winning qualifying finals teams progress directly into the two preliminary finals in the third week, with the other four teams playing in elimination finals (5th vs 8th and 6th vs 7th). In the second week the two losing teams from the qualifying finals play the two winning teams from the elimination finals in the semi-finals. The winners of the qualifying finals play the winners of the semi-finals in the preliminary finals. The two winning preliminary final teams play in the grand final in the fourth week of the finals.

The premiership winning team is the team that wins the grand final.

The winning team receives a premiership cup â there is a new one manufactured every year which the winning team gets to keep with the year engraved on it - premiership medallions and a premiership flag.

The premiership flag is a large triangular flag which is blue with a white border and has the AFL logo on it as well as the word &quot;premiers&quot; and the year â there is a new one manufactured every year which the winning club gets to keep. It is tradition to unfurl it at the first home game of the season the following year in front of the home supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footy.com.au/dags/FAQ2v1-5.html link] Australian Football League Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand final has traditionally been played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on the last Saturday in September. Recent exceptions to this were in 1991, when the MCG was being redeveloped and the grand final was played at [[Waverley Park]], and 2000 when the grand final was played in early September as the Sydney Olympics started on 15 September. In 2011, due to the expanded season, the grand final is due to be played on 1 October.

====Premiership cup====
A trophy cup, known as the premiership cup, and the premiership flag, are awarded to the winner of the AFL Grand Final. In addition, each player receives a premiership medallion.

The premiership cup is silver (with the exception of 1996 when a gold cup was awarded instead of the usual silver one in the AFL/VFL's 100th season) and manufactured by Cash's International at their metalworks in [[Frankston, Victoria]]. The cup was first introduced in 1959 by the VFL and, before this, the award was a pennant known by supporters simply as &quot;The Flag&quot;. The AFL has since retrospectively awarded the premiers trophies based on the current design. Before the 1960s, premiership players received a personal premiership trophy instead of a medallion.

====Themed rounds and special matches====
Themed rounds have become immensely popular. There are themes such as Rivalry Round (in which traditional rivals are matched up against each other), Women's Round and [[AFL Heritage Round|Heritage Round]] (where teams play in [[Throwback uniform|old style guernseys]]). Some matches are also themed for special events. For example, each year Collingwood play Essendon in the annual [[The Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day match]] at the MCG and the game will typically sell out regardless of the positions of the two teams on the ladder due to their strong rivalry and huge followings. Another annual match is the Queen's Birthday game between Melbourne and Collingwood. As of 2006, Richmond and Essendon play in the ''[[Dreamtime at the 'G]]'' match. There are separate trophies for the matches between several clubs and former rivalries such as the Lake Trophy between St Kilda and the Sydney Swans.

===NAB Cup===
{{Main|Australian Football League Pre-season Cup competition}}
The [[NAB Cup]] is a national pre-season competition played and completed prior to the commencement of the premiership season. It has been contested each season since 1988.

The pre-season competition has mostly been contested as a four-week [[knock-out tournament]], although with the expansion beyond sixteen clubs in 2011, the first week has been replaced by a three-team round-robin of half-length matches. Teams play exhibition matches on weekends after being eliminated. The competition has frequently been used to trial rule changes.

The final was played at Waverley Park most years until the ground was sold by the league in 1999. Since then, the finals have been mostly played at [[Docklands Stadium]], but interstate clubs can earn the right to host the final, and three of the finals have been played in Adelaide. The player judged best on the ground in the final is awarded the [[Michael Tuck Medal]], in honour of the footballer who played more league matches (426) than any other.

===Before the VFL===
{{Main|History of Australian rules football}}
Australian rules football dates back to [[1859 in sports|1859]]. [[Melbourne Football Club]] was formed on 14 May that year. At a couple of meetings over the next week or so, at the Parade Hotel in East Melbourne, a group of about seven men, including [[Tom Wills]], [[William Hammersley|W.J. Hammersley]] and [[J. B. Thompson]], wrote the first rules for Australian football. By 1866, several other clubs had also adopted an updated version of Melbourne's rules. In 1877, the [[amateur sport|amateur]] [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] was established.

===VFL begins===
{{Main|History of the VFL/AFL}}
The [[VFL/AFL|Victorian Football League]] was established in 1896 when several clubs broke away from the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] which was the first Australian rules competition in Victoria, second in the country after the South Australian Football Association. The first games were played in [[1897 VFL season|1897]] between the foundation clubs â Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne.

Since the naming of this side, most AFL clubs have nominated their own teams of the century. An [[Indigenous Team of the Century]] was also selected in 2005, featuring the best Aboriginal players of the previous 100 years from both the VFL/AFL and other state leagues.

==Representative football==
===State football===
{{See|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}
There is currently no official state representation for AFL players despite the concept being well supported among fans and calls to re-introduce a [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of Origin|State of Origin]] series.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Doug; [http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21284443-5012456,00.html Cornes calls for Origin return]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}; Adelaide Now; 25 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of the VFL/AFL's involvement====
VFL players first represented the Victoria representative team in 1897 regardless of their state of origin.

Being the dominant league drawing many of the country's best players, the [[Victoria Australian rules football team]] (nicknamed the &quot;Big V&quot; and composed mostly of VFL players) dominated interstate matches until the introduction of State of Origin selection criteria by the [[Australian National Football Council|Australian Football Council]] (of which the VFL was a member) in 1977.

The AFL Commission assumed control of interstate football in 1993 and co-ordinated an annual State of Origin series typically held during a mid-season bye round. However after the 1999 series, the AFL declared the concept of interstate football &quot;on hold&quot; citing club's unwillingness to release star players and a lack of public interest and shifted its focus of representative football to the International Rules Series where it draws a greater television revenue.

The last time AFL players played interstate football was in the 1999 State of Origin Series when Victoria inflicted a massive defeat on South Australia in wet conditions in front of a crowd of 26,063. Just 10 years earlier, the same match with a plethora of star players attracted a crowd of 91,960.

Some past AFL players participate and help promote the [[E. J. Whitten Legends Game]], however this event is not affiliated with or promoted by the AFL.

====AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match====
{{See|AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match}}
The AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match was a one-off match held at the MCG during the first bye weekend of season 2008 as part of the 150th anniversary of Australian Football celebrations to acknowledge the historical contribution of State Football. In promoting the match, the AFL declared it as &quot;The game that has been 150 years in the making&quot;.

While many fans (particularly those outside Victoria) had hoped for a traditional interstate series, the AFL instead held an All-Star event featuring the senior Victorian team against a composite &quot;[[Dream Team Australian rules football team|Dream Team]]&quot;.

While the crowd and television audience for the match was impressive and the AFL debated the merits of reintroducing state football, Andrew Demetriou since stated that there is little chance that even an All-Star match will be repeated.

===International Rules Series===
For information on the International Rules Series, see [[International Rules Series]].

==Administration==
{{Main|AFL Commission}}
{{See also|List of VFL/AFL presidents}}
The [[AFL Commission]] is responsible for the administration of the AFL. It was established in December 1985 after club parochialism and self interest threatened to undermine the competition.

The Commission's chairman is [[Mike Fitzpatrick (footballer)|Mike Fitzpatrick]], a former Subiaco and Carlton player, and the Chief Executive is [[Andrew Demetriou]]. After playing for North Melbourne and Hawthorn, Demetriou had a successful business career before returning to the football world as chief executive of the [[AFL Players Association]]. He then crossed to the AFL as Manager of Football Operations before succeeding Wayne Jackson.

The Commission's composition remains almost exclusively Victorian based with one exception, [[Bob Hammond]] from South Australia.

In addition to administering the national competition, the AFL is heavily involved in promoting and developing the sport in Australia. It provides funds for local leagues and in conjunction with local clubs, administers the [[Auskick]] program for young boys and girls.

The AFL also plays a leading role in developing the game outside Australia, with projects to develop the game at junior level in other countries (e.g. South Africa) and by supporting affiliated competitions around the world (See [[Australian football around the world]]).

The players of the AFL are represented by the [[AFL Players Association]].

===Television===
====Australian television====

For the 2007 - 2011 seasons, the official free-to-air television partners of the AFL were the [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]]. They owned the rights to all eight matches per round, but had on-sold four of those to pay-TV providers [[Foxtel]] and [[Austar]], meaning only two were actually shown on each free-to-air network. [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] screened the other four matches live across Australia and replays for all eight matches. From 2002 - 2006, the [[Nine Network]], [[Network Ten]] and [[Fox Footy Channel]] along with their affiliated broadcast partners held the rights to Australian Football League television coverage. All Matches involving teams from Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia have been screened to viewers on free-to-air channels in their home states (including matches covered by Foxtel) during this time, as well as in past broadcast agreements.

From 2012, the AFL competition will expand to 18 teams with a new team, the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]] (also known as the GWS Giants) joining the competition following on from the debut of the [[Gold Coast Suns]] team in 2011. On Friday 30 October 2011, the AFL released its fixture for 2012 and announced that the 2012 home and away season will be played over 23 rounds, with three 'multi-bye' rounds of only six games. The reduced rounds - 11, 12 and 13 - will allow six teams to have a bye in each week of the three-week period. The multi-bye format has been chosen over the traditional split round as a means of giving players a break during the season. [http://www.afl.com.au/newsviews/todaysnews/fixturenews/tabid/16783/default.aspx]

On Thursday 28 April 2011, the AFL announced that the [[Seven Network]] and [[Foxtel]] and [[Telstra]] had successfully won the rights to broadcast the 2012 - 2017 seasons on their respective networks. Telstra won the rights to broadcast one live match per week via IP Television and on their Telstra Mobile service. The deal was confirmed when the Seven Network, Foxtel and Telstra agreed to pay $A1.253 Billion to the Australian Football League to broadcast every match of every round and all of the Finals Series across their platforms. [http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/112560/default.aspx] 

The reasons for the increased in media rights revenue came from the addition of extra matches due to two more teams joining the competition, Foxtel being granted permission by the Federal Government to bid for nearly all matches to show live, plus an increase from four to five matches shown exclusively on their platform each round, high demand for content from Telstra and the Seven Network`s desire to retain AFL rights by bidding more than [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]].

As part of the agreement, [[Austar]] will broadcast Foxtel`s AFL coverage in the regional areas of Australia that are not part of Foxtel`s service area. Regional free-to-air broadcasters [[Prime7]], [[GWN7]], [[Seven Queensland]], [[Southern Cross Television]] and [[WIN Television]] will show Seven's coverage in their respective areas.

[[Foxtel]] and [[Austar]] will broadcast every match from every round of the AFL pre-season tournament, the AFL premiership season and every match of the AFL Finals Series (except for the AFL Grand Final) live across Australia. Matches will be shown live and on replay, along with magazine shows and other australian rules football themed programming through on a re-launched 24-hour a day AFL TV channel to be known as [[Fox Footy]]. Live Match coverage will also screen across Australia on Fox Sports when other games are screening on [[Fox Footy]].

====Telecast History====

1957 was the first VFL season after the commencement of television in Australia in 1956 to coincide with the Melbourne Olympic Games. During the late 1950s and 60s, all Melbourne stations ([[ABV2]], [[HSV7]], [[GTV9]] and, after it commenced in 1965, [[ATV10|ATV0/ATV10]]) broadcast some games. However, in the late 1950s / early 60s, the VFL was afraid that direct telecasts may affect attendances and stations were only permitted to telecast a delayed replay of the last quarter of games. In the 1980s, the [[Seven Network]] was given exclusive rights to VFL/AFL games. The only year Seven didn't telecast games was 1987, when the rights were bought by Broadcom, which on-sold the rights to the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC). The exclusive rights were won back by Seven in 1988. 

With the launch of subscription television in Australia, AFL match coverage commenced on cable television. [[Optus Vision]] bid for and won exclusive pay tv rights from 1996â2001, screening coverage on its own 24 hour AFL channel, branded ''Sports AFL'' in Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne (where available). The Sports AFL channel was later closed due to financial issues and relaunched in March 1999 as [[C7 Sport]] by the [[Seven Network]] with AFL match coverage also transferred to the new channel. C7 Sport  became available in regional areas not in the [[Foxtel]] or [[Optus Vision]] licence area via [[Austar]] soon after the re-launch. The AFL coverage was not available through Foxtel at this time as the Seven Network and Foxtel disagreed on the cost of carrying the C7 channel. These issues regarding C7 and AFL broadcsting rights evolved into a court case between not just the Seven Network and [[News Limited]], but Seven against the owners of the Nine Network and Network Ten in the years that followed.

In late 2000, the Seven Network's main rivals, the [[Kerry Packer]] led [[Nine Network]], [[Network Ten]] and pay-tv's [[Foxtel]] set up a consortium which bid $500 million for the right to broadcast the [[2002 AFL season|2002]]â[[2006 AFL season|2006]] seasons inclusive. Seven had purchased a guaranteed right to make the last bid in 1995,&lt;ref name=&quot;SevenFox&quot;&gt;Day, Mark (1 February 2007); [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21149551-7582,00.html Pay TV strikes a deal on AFL]; The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; but decided not to outbid their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Fiona (25 January 2001); [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s238069.htm Seven gives up AFL rights]; PM (ABC radio)&lt;/ref&gt; The games were split between the networks, with Nine screening [[Friday Night Football (Australia)|Friday Night Football]] and two matches on Sunday, Ten screened a Saturday afternoon and a Saturday night match, with the remaining four matches shown on Foxtel. Foxtel set up it`s own version of a dedicated AFL-only channel, the [[Fox Footy Channel]], which showed every game on replay during the week as well as many news, [[Talk radio|talkback]] and general interest shows related to australian rules football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/08/21/1029114135689.html Live and sweaty]; 22 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

When the rights were offered again in January 2006 for the [[2007 AFL season|2007]] to 2011 seasons, Seven formed an alliance with Ten and used its guaranteed last bid rights to match Nine's offer of $780 million to win back the broadcast rights in what was the biggest sport telecasting deal in Australian history at the time. After lengthy negotiations, Foxtel agreed to be a broadcast partner and now showed four live matches each week, although no longer on a dedicated AFL channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;SevenFox&quot;/&gt; Seven took back the Friday night match and only one game on Sunday, while Ten retained showing two matches on Saturdays. Foxtel showed two games on Saturday and two on Sunday, including a late afternoon or twilight game.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Damian (20 January 2007); [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21087638-11088,00.html Foxtel in footy twilight zone]; Herald Sun&lt;/ref&gt;

====International broadcast partners====
Historically AFL broadcasts in other countries have varied.

In 2007, after the record domestic television rights deal, the AFL secured an additional bonus: greater international television rights and increase exposure to overseas markets, including a 5 year deal with [[Setanta Sports]], and new deals with other overseas [[pay-TV]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/footy/common/story_page/0,8033,21519961%255E19742,00.html AFL seals UK, US TV deal]{{dead link|date=June 2011}} from heraldsun.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, VFL matches were shown in the United States on [[ESPN]] for some time. Some other English speaking countries have shown the game, however it has been since 2008 that channels in other countries began televising matches.

The following countries are ranked by the approximate extent of their current television coverage (and whether it is free to air):

===Global===
The AFL has stated that it wishes to showcase the footballing code to other countries such as [[India]], [[China]] and [[South Africa]] so as to create a global following thus creating more exposure for its sponsors in the increasing [[Asia]]n and [[African]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/afl-hopes-to-net-china/story-e6frf9jf-1225857803219 AFL hopes to net China | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 2010, AFL clubs [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne Demons]] and [[Brisbane Lions]] played an exhibition game in front of almost 10,000 people at the [[Jiangwan Stadium|Riverside Sports Center]] in [[Shanghai]].  This was the first professional AFL game to be played in [[China]].

The AFL has garnered increased interest in Ireland due to the introduction of the International Rules series played between an AFL picked All Australian Team and Ireland. This paved the way for young Irish footballers to be rostered to AFL teams mainly due to the fact that salaries in the AFL are much larger than that of Gaelic Football although most Irish players fail to make the grade into 1st team football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/10/22/the-afl-is-tempting-irelands-true-promise/ The AFL is tempting Ireland's true promise Â» The Roar - Your Sports Opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;  This also paved the way for extended news coverage and increased broadcasting in the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]].

===Radio===
The first broadcast of a VFL game was by [[Radio National|3AR]] in 1923, the year that broadcasting officially commenced in Australia. The first commentator was [[Wallace Shallard|Wallace (Jumbo) Shallard]], a former Geelong player who went on to have a long and respected career in print and broadcast media. The VFL/AFL has been broadcast every year since then by the ABC and (since 1927) by various commercial stations. The saturation period was the early 1960s when seven of the eight extant radio stations ([[Radio National|3AR]], [[3UZ]], [[3TTT|3DB]], [[3KZ]], [[3AW]], [[3XY]] and [[3AK]]) broadcast VFL games each week, as well as broadcasts of Geelong games by local station [[K-Rock (Australia)|3GL]]. (At this time, the only alternative that radio listeners had to listening to the football on a Saturday afternoon were the classical music and fine arts programs that were broadcast by [[3LO]]).

Currently, the official radio broadcast partners of the AFL are:
* [[Triple M]] Melbourne
* [[K-Rock (Australia)|K-Rock]] Geelong
* [[3AW]] Melbourne
* [[FIVEaa]] Adelaide
* [[6PR]] Perth
* [[SEN 1116]] Melbourne
* [[4AAA|98.9FM]] Brisbane
* Triple M Sydney (Broadcasts only Swans matches)
* Triple M Brisbane (Broadcasts only Lions matches)
* Triple M Adelaide

===Internet===
The official internet/mobile broadcast partner of the AFL is [[Bigpond]]. The AFL also provides exclusive broadband content including streaming video for international fans via its website. [[Bigpond]] also hosts the official websites of all the 17 AFL clubs excluding Essendon.

The service is also provided to international subscribers. Delayed video is available 12 hours or more after the game. 

However, the website is frequently derided by users for its convoluted [[information architecture]] and [[Software bloat|bloated]] presentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=688538 New AFL Website] â Whirlpool forums.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigfooty.com/forum/showthread.php?t=429368&amp;highlight=website New AFL website â how bad is it?] â BigFooty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate relations==
===Sponsorship===
The following are the official naming sponsors of the [[VFL/AFL]] competition:
* [[Carlton &amp; United Breweries]] (1980â81, 86, 89â94, 2001â03)
* [[Holden]] (1982â83)
* [[Nissan]] (1984â85)
* Sportsplay (1987)
* [[Elders Limited|Elder's IXL]] (1988)
* [[Coca-Cola]] (1995â2001)
* [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] (2004âpresent)

Â¹&lt;font size=1&gt;Note: In 2001 CUB and Coca-Cola were joint sponsors&lt;/font&gt;

====Publishing and print====
The official print broadcast partner of the AFL is [[News Limited]].
The [[AFL Record]] is a match-day magazine published by the AFL and is read by around 225,000 people each week.

===Membership===
The AFL sells memberships that entitle subscribers to reserve seats for matches at [[Docklands Stadium]] and [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in Melbourne. AFL members also receive priority access to finals. AFL Members can nominate a club to get priority Grand Final tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aflmembership.com.au/afl%20membership%20entitlements/tabid/14072/default.aspx]{{dead link|date=June 2011}} AFL Membership Entitlements&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchandising===
The AFL runs a chain of stores that sell merchandise from all clubs. Merchandise is also available from other retailers.

====AFL World====
A modern museum called the Hall of Fame and Sensation opened in Melbourne in 2003 to celebrate the culture of the AFL and to provide a venue for the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]]. The museum, a licensed off-shoot of the AFL, was originally touted for the MCG, but the Hall of Fame failed to get support from the Melbourne Cricket Club. The new QV shopping centre on Swanston Street was then chosen as the location. However, controversy followed the appointment of an administrator as the museum began running at a loss. Many blamed high entry prices, which were subsequently reduced, and the museum remains open to the public. In early 2006 the name was changed to AFL World. It features various honour boards and memorabilia as well as a range of innovative interactive displays designed to immerse visitors in the experience of elite Aussie Rules. It was closed down in 2008.

In recent years national website based tipping competitions have started to replace the traditional, but more labour intensive, office or pub run competitions.

[[Fantasy football (Australian rules football)|Fantasy football]] competitions based on actual player statistics (number of kicks, marks, goals etc.) are also very popular on websites and in newspapers.
