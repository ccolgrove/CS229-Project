==Political career==
Jonson was first elected to the Alberta Legislature in the [[Alberta general election, 1982|1982 Alberta general election]]. He defeated Tom Butterfield from the [[Western Canada Concept]] and three other candidates to win his first term in office. His win held the [[Ponoka (provincial electoral district)|Ponoka]] electoral district for the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;elec1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/database/maps_choice.asp?Year=1982&amp;Constit=Ponoka | title=Ponoka election results 1982 general election|publisher=Alberta Heritage|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to redistribution of electoral district boundaries in the [[Alberta general election, 1986|1986 Alberta general election]] Ponoka was abolished and re-created as [[Ponoka-Rimbey]]. Jonson ran for his second term in the new electoral district and won easily defeating three other candidates. He stood for a third term in office in the [[Alberta general election, 1989|1989 Alberta general election]] fending off a strong challenge from Doug Hart of the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] and one other candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;elec2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/database/maps_choice.asp?Year=198&amp;Constit=Ponoka-Rimbey | title=Ponoka-Rimbey election results 1986-1989 general election|publisher=Alberta Heritage|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jonson would see his popular vote grow in his bid for a fourth term for office in the [[Alberta general election, 1993|1993 Alberta general election]]. He was easily reelected defeating four other candidates. He would be returned for a fifth consecutive term. The race for the [[Alberta general election, 1997|1997 Alberta general election]] would see support build for second place Randy Jones of [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;elec3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/database/maps_choice.asp?Year=199&amp;Constit=Ponoka-Rimbey | title=Ponoka-Rimbey election results 1993-1997 general election|publisher=Alberta Heritage|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson would see his popular support marginally drop but still win the electoral district by a wide margin. In the [[Alberta general election, 2001|2001 Alberta general election]], Jonson would set a personal record for the largest plurality of his career.  He would be returned to the Legislature in a landslide for his sixth and final term.&lt;ref name=&quot;elec4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/database/maps_choice.asp?Year=2001&amp;Constit=Ponoka-Rimbey | title=Ponoka-Rimbey election results 2001 general election|publisher=Alberta Heritage|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson retired at dissolution of the Legislature in 2004. His electoral district of Ponoka-Rimbey was abolished due to redistribution.
==Late life and legacy==
