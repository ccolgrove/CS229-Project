'''VMware Server''' (formerly '''VMware GSX Server''') is a free-of-charge [[hardware virtualization|virtualization]]-software server suite developed and supplied by [[VMware|VMware, Inc]].

VMware Server has fewer features than [[VMware ESX]], software available for purchase, but can create, edit, and play virtual machines. It uses a [[clientâserver model]], allowing remote access to virtual machines, at the cost of some graphical performance (and [[3D acceleration|3D]] support). It can run virtual machines created by other VMware products and by [[Microsoft Virtual PC]].

VMware Server can preserve and revert to a single [[snapshot]] copy of each separate virtual machine within the VMware Server environment. The software does not have a specific interface for cloning virtual machines, unlike [[VMware Workstation]]. Unlike [[Microsoft]] [[Hyper-V]], VMware does allow VM memory to be over-committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/products/esxi/facts.html|publisher=[[VMware]]|title=Comparison on the Essential Functionalities of a Hypervisor|accessdate=2010-03-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2010}}

In January 2010 VMware Server was declared [[End Of Availability]]; general support ended on June 30, 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vmware.com/support/policies/lifecycle/general/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Versions==
===VMware Server 1.0===
VMware released version 1.0 of Server on July 12, 2006, replacing the discontinued VMware GSX Server product-line. VMware Inc continued to develop the Vmware Server 1.0.x series, issuing a maintenance release (version 1.0.10) on 26 October 2009.

===VMware Server 2.0===
VMware Server 2 runs on several server-class host operating systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vmserver2.pdf VMware Server 2 User's Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
including different versions of Microsoft Windows Server 2000, 2003, and 2008, and mainly enterprise-class Linuxes. The manual explicitly states: &quot;you must use a Windows ''server'' operating system&quot;.  The product also runs on Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.

Server 2 uses a web-based user-interface, the &quot;VMware Infrastructure Web Access&quot;, instead of a GUI. For web interfaces, VMware Server 2 and VMware vCenter 4 use the [[Apache Tomcat | Tomcat]] 6 web server, while VMware vCenter 2.5 is based on Tomcat 2.5.

As part of the product, the VMware Host Agent service allows [[remote access]] to VMware Server functionality.&lt;ref&gt;

VMware server 2 supports the Microsoft [[Shadow Copy]] service. ([[Microsoft Virtual Server]] 2005 R2 SP1 also supports Shadow Copy.) Virtual machines that support this service can be [[Backup | backed up]] without stopping - usually called{{By whom|date=March 2011}} &quot;[[live backup]]&quot;.
