The '''2010â2011 Algerian protests''' are a continuing series of protests taking place throughout [[Algeria]] from 28 December 2010 onwards, part of similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. Causes cited by the protestors include [[unemployment]], the lack of housing, food-price [[inflation]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], restrictions on [[freedom of speech]] and poor [[living conditions]]. While localised protests were already commonplace over previous years, extending into December 2010, an unprecedented wave of simultaneous protests and riots, sparked by sudden rises in staple food prices, erupted all over the country starting in January 2011.  These were quelled by government measures to lower food prices, but were followed by a wave of [[self-immolation]]s, most of them in front of government buildings.  Opposition parties, unions, and human rights organisations then began to hold weekly demonstrations, despite these being illegal without government permission under the ongoing [[state of emergency]]; the government suppressed these demonstrations as far as possible, but in late February yielded to pressure and lifted the state of emergency.  Meanwhile, protests by unemployed youth, typically citing unemployment, ''hogra'' (oppression), and infrastructure problems, resumed, occurring almost daily in towns scattered all over the country.

==Background==
After the riots of 1988, the Algerian government had moved towards democracy, holding free elections.  However, when the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) won the first free [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|parliamentary election]] in 1991, the military staged a coup d'Ã©tat, voided the election results, declared a state of emergency which remained in force until 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/algeria-uses-emergency-law-to-fight-islamic-group-1471880.html |title=Algeria uses emergency law to fight Islamic group |publisher=The Independent |date=9 February 1993 |accessdate=13 February 2011 |location=London |first=Charles |last=Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrested the FIS leadership.  This led to the founding of the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Groups]] (GIA) and the ten-year [[Algerian Civil War]], in which an estimated 150,000 people were killed.

With the unchallenged [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|election]] of [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] as president in 1999, civilian government was nominally restored.  Violence died down as both guerrillas and soldiers were given impunity for their previous acts under the controversial [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]].  Towards the end of his second term, Bouteflika amended the constitution to allow himself to run for a third term in 2009; to no one's surprise, he won the ensuing [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|election]], with, according to the opposition and the US Embassy, a very low turnout.

Seventy percent of Algeria's population is less than 30 years old. Consequent high levels of youth unemployment, coupled with corruption and widespread poverty, are seen as reasons for dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrik&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Djamel Belayachi |url=http://www.afrik-news.com/article18940.html |title=Algeria protests take place amid 30,000 police deployment - Afrik-news.com : Africa news, Maghreb news - The african daily newspaper |publisher=Afrik-news.com |date=|accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]], [[SaÃ¯d Sadi]], claimed that during 2010, there were &quot;9,700 riots and unrests&quot; in Algeria.&lt;ref name=&quot;army_should_quit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Lamine | last=Chikhi | pages= | language =| title=Algeria army should quit politics: opposition | date=21 January 2011 | publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70K02X20110121?sp=true |accessdate=22 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vuh49u62 |archivedate=21 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some protests were about issues such as education and health care, as well as rampant corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mahmoud |last=Belhimer |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&amp;article=40363 |title=Political Crises but Few Alternatives in Algeria |work=Arab Reform Bulletin |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the outbreak of protests, in February 2008, [[United States]] Ambassador [[Robert Stephen Ford|Robert Ford]] in [[WikiLeaks cables|leaked]] [[diplomatic cables]] called Algeria  &quot;an unhappy country&quot;, stating &quot;There is much discussion among political circles about the [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution]], the third term and the succession issue, but precious little discussion about how to address long-standing political alienation and social discontent throughout the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;08ALGIERS198&quot;&gt;{{cite document| last =Ford| first =Robert | authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Scene setter for A/S Welch visit to Algeria | id={{WikiLeaks cable|08ALGIERS198}} |work =| publisher =[[WikiLeaks]]| date=22 February 2008| url =http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/02/08ALGIERS198.html |format =| doi =| accessdate=22 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vumgk7y9 |archivedate=22 January 2011  |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed there were strikes over food &quot;by [[Trade unions in Algeria|different labor groups]] almost weekly&quot; and that &quot;almost daily there are isolated demonstrations with the occasional government office in some distant town attacked.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;08ALGIERS198&quot; /&gt; Ford stated that &quot;voter turnout for the [[Algerian legislative election, 2007|2007 legislative]] and local elections was lower than ever before because Algeria's young people do not see the political system as having any relevance to addressing their problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;08ALGIERS198&quot; /&gt; United States diplomats also claimed that the Algerian regime is more corrupt than the international community realises and is also more fragile. The [[diplomatic cable]] also said that Bouteflika may have cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://213.251.145.96/cable/2007/12/07ALGIERS1806.html |title=Cable Viewer |publisher=213.251.145.96 |date=|accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===29 December 2010===
On 29 December 2010, clashes with police were reported in Algiers during protests about the lack of housing. At least 53 people were reported to have been injured and another 29 were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010123012345588575.html |title=Scores hurt in Algeria protests â Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=30 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National, 3â10 January 2011==

In 2011, prices of basic foodstuffs rose significantly in Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letempsdz.com/content/view/50717/1/ Hausse gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©e des prix des produits alimentaires] Le Temps 01/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt; in line with global trends but also reflecting newly imposed regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/09/algeria_s_national_protesta Algeria's National Protests] Hugh Roberts, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' 10/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests|Unprecedented protests in neighbouring Tunisia]] over unemployment were already being reported, contributing to the mood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011171242359602.html Algeria police on alert after riots] [[Aljazeera]] English 08/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Renault-BEO-IncendiÃ©.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Renault]] shop of Triolet near Bab El Oued, burnt in the riots.|alt=Broken shop curtain with people looking inside.]]

Between 3 and 10 January, riots and protests broke out across most Algerian towns, triggered by large increases in the prices of basic foods including oil, sugar, and flour. While localised riots have been a frequent occurrence in Algeria since 2005, this set of riots was the first to spread across most regions of the country simultaneously rather than being confined to a particular area. By 10 January they were limited to a few towns, but continued in those towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hLhKLduS1LRRYOBpAaq5kpyJNbuQ?docId=CNG.a7256a3419e3e3b03b8d1b50e17ae892.b61 Unrest eases in Algeria as prices drop] Beatrice Khadige, AFP  10/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt; More organised efforts to demonstrate on the 11 January in Algiers were suppressed vigorously by the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elwatan.com/evenement/quatre-heures-au-commissariat-de-staoueli-11-01-2011-106707_115.php quatre-heures-au-commissariat-de-staoueli] (subscription required) El Watan, 11/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests against the price increases started on 3 January, with protest in the Ras El Ain quarter of [[Oran]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Voix Oranie PDF&quot;&gt;''La Voix de l'Oranie''  05/01/2011, p 2 [http://www.voix-oranie.com/assets/Archives/05-01-2011/journal.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Fouka]] and [[Staoueli]] near Algiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voix Oranie PDF&quot; /&gt; On 4 January they were repeated in Staoueli and spread to other areas near the capital, with impromptu roadblocks at Douaouda in [[Tipasa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Voix Oranie PDF&quot; /&gt; and Kolea&lt;ref&gt;[http://dna-algerie.com/politique/54-dna-en-pointilles/1038-emeutes-a-kolea-des-manifestants-bloquent-lacces-a-la-ville.html emeutes a kolea des manifestants bloquent lacces a la ville] DNA 01/05/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January, major riots broke out in several areas at once: in the Bab El Oued neighbourhood of the capital, [[Algiers]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/International/2011/01/05/008-algerie-emeutes-cherte.shtml algerie emeutes cherte] Radio Canada, 05/02/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and nearby suburbs, as well as Algeria's second city, [[Oran]], and other towns including [[Djelfa]], [[Boumerdes]], [[Annaba]], and [[Tipaza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lematindz.net/news/3578-urgent-des-coups-de-feu-a-alger-lembrasement-a-oran.html urgent des coups de feu a alger lembrasement a oran] Le Matin, 05/02/2011&lt;/ref&gt; The young men rioting blocked roads, burned tires, and sacked government buildings, protesting the sudden increase in the [[cost of living]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elwatan.com/evenement/protestation-et-panique-au-centre-ville-d-oran-06-01-2011-106020_115.php protestation et panique au centre ville d oran] El Watan, 06/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt;  the demolition of [[shantytown]]s, and broader issues such as unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpressiondz.com/article/2/2011-01-06/84584.html Plusieurs quartiers en proie Ã  la protestation] L'Expression, 06/01/2011&lt;/ref&gt; They were met by anti-riot forces, who attempted to disperse the crowds.

===Political implications===

While riots on this scale are unprecedented since the [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|1991 election]], their wider political implications are not yet clear.  The rioters had no collective ties to any Algerian political party, organisation, or trade union,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Roberts FP&quot;&gt;{{cite news

{{main|2011 Algerian self-immolations}}

[[image:Mohsen Bouterfif.jpg|thumb|upright|Mohsen Bouterfif in the hospital showing the wounds from his self-immolation]]
As the widely reported protests sparked off by [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]'s self-immolation in Tunisia began to have a clear impact on the Tunisian government, a wave of [[self-immolation]]s swept Algeria.  These individual acts of protest mostly took place in front of a government building following an unsuccessful approach to the authorities.  Four self-immolators have died of their burns so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/5671.html |title=Algeria: Third death by self-immolation |publisher=Ennahar Online |date=|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20110212105526/algerie-pauvrete-tunisie-manifestationquatrieme-deces-par-immolation-en-algerie-a-la-veille-de-la-marche-du-12-fevrier.html |title=Jeune Afrique, 12/01/2011, QuatriÃ¨me dÃ©cÃ¨s par immolation en AlgÃ©rie, Ã  la veille de la marche du 12 fÃ©vrier |publisher=Jeune Afrique |date=|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began on 12 January, when 26 year-old Mohamed Aouichia set himself on fire in [[Bordj Menaiel]] in the compound of the ''[[Districts of Algeria|daira]]'' building. He had been sharing a room of 30 square metres with seven other people, including his sister, since 2003; he had repeatedly approached local authorities to get on the social housing list and been rebuffed.&lt;ref name=&quot;courrierinternational1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2011/01/21/je-brule-donc-je-suis |title=Courrier International, 21/01/2011, '&amp;#39;Je brÃ»le donc je suis'&amp;#39; |publisher=Courrierinternational.com |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has so far survived.

On 13 January, [[Mohsen Bouterfif]], a 37-year-old father of two, set himself on fire.

Protests continued on 3 February. On the same day President Abdelaziz Bouteflika signaled at a meeting with government ministers his intention to lift the 19-year-old state of emergency in the &quot;very near future&quot;, in what was seen as an attempt to quell opposition demands. Reportedly, he also urged the cabinet to adopt measures to promote job creation and said Algeria's TV and radio should give airtime to all political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12359750 | title=Algeria state of emergency: Bouteflika 'signals end' | date=3 February 2011 | accessdate=3 February 2011 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February, [[Al Jazeera]] reported that demonstrations were planned for 12 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_febdominos&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title=Calls for weekend protests in Syria  | date=4 February 2011 | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201122171649677912.html |accessdate=8 February 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wLygnerq |archivedate=8 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the protests of early January, starting 8 January the government decreased the prices of essential foods.  Over following weeks it increased wheat supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121210345525985.html |title=Middle East rulers make concessions |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February Bouteflika announced plans to lift the emergency law, which prohibits protests without a permit, and substitute for it new anti-terrorism laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualites/2/monde/l-etat-d-urgence-bientot-leve-en-algerie-dit-bouteflika_958630.html |title=L'Ã©tat d'urgence bientÃ´t levÃ© en AlgÃ©rie, dit Bouteflika |publisher=L'Express |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but said that protests would remain illegal in Algiers in any case &quot;for well-known reasons of public order&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&amp;article=42563 |title=Algerian president lifts the emergency law, except in Algiers |work=Arab Reform Bulletin |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced new measures to create jobs and that state-run television and radio should be open to all political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/8084674-algeria-president-announced-the-lifting-of-emergency-laws |title=Algeria: President announced the lifting of emergency laws |publisher=Allvoices.com |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 14 February, his foreign minister [[Mourad Medelci]] repeated the promise to end the state of emergency law, saying it would happen by the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Algerian-Emergency-Law-said-to-be-Ending-116151639.html |title=Algerian Emergency Law to End |publisher=Allvoices.com |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 22 February the cabinet voted to lift the emergency law. It also voted on a measure to alleviate unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera. Headlines.&lt;/ref&gt;

In efforts to discourage the protests organised by the CNCD, the authorities played up the role of the RCD, a mainly Kabyle party unpopular elsewhere in the country, within them; while this tactic had some success, it did not stop demonstrators from turning out in some non-Kabyle cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.north-africa.com/naj_news/news_na/1northafricaunderstress46.html |title=North Africa Under Stress: Latest Developments |publisher=The North Africa Journal |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;International
* {{flag|European Union}} - [[President of the European Parliament|President]] of the [[European Parliament]] [[Jerzy Buzek]] said that he &quot;call[ed] upon the Algerian authorities to refrain from violence and respect their citizens' right to peaceful demonstration. Any and all demonstrators arrested should be released immediately. The continuing state of emergency is unjustifiable and clearly hampers Algeria's prospects for the fair, peaceful and sustainable development of the country. It is but a first step in responding to the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Algerian people, but even this step has yet to materialise. Opposition groups, civil society, and especially young people should have the right to freely express their criticism of the government. No government can ignore the call of its people.&quot;

* {{flag|France}} Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said regarding the demonstrations that &quot;What is important in our eyes us is that freedom of expression is respected and that the demonstrations are able to take place freely and without violence&quot;, and welcomed the planned end to the State of Emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jXrIiCJAAReaAnMIeheQpttKVh-Q?docId=CNG.158cf120b22d1fab72b87226699036ea.6b1 |title=France asks Algeria to allow peaceful protests |publisher=AFP |date=14 February 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|Germany}} - Foreign Minister [[Guido Westerwelle]] said Germany was &quot;on the side of democrats. The German government calls on the Algerian government to renounce all recourse to violence. These are demonstrators who want freedom, who are doing nothing more than exercising a human right, to know the right to defend with dignity their point of view. As democrats we are on the side of democrats. I have already said that about Tunisia and Egypt. I say it again now in allusion to other countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leigh Phillips |url=http://euobserver.com/9/31801 |title=EUobserver / EU Parliament chief condemns Algeria crackdown |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|United States}} - [[Department of State]] spokesman PJ Crowley said that &quot;We note the ongoing protests in Algeria, and call for restraint on the part of the security services. In addition, we reaffirm our support for the universal rights of the Algerian people, including assembly and expression. These rights apply on the internet. Moreover, these rights must be respected. We will continue to follow the situation closely in the days ahead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazblog13feb&quot;/&gt;
