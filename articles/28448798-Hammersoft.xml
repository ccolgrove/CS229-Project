'''''Warlock''''' is an American [[Western fiction|western]] novel by author [[Oakley Hall]] first published in 1958. 

The novel is loosely based on characters and events that took place in the [[OK Corral]] in [[Tombstone, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=HoranSann&gt;''Pictorial History of the Wild West'' by James D. Horan and Paul Sann ISBN 0-600-03103-9, ISBN 978-0-600-03103-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall's most famous novel, ''Warlock'' was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/jun/18/culture.obituaries | title=Oakley Hall: Obituaries: guardian.co.uk | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=Guardian News and Media | date=2008-06-18 | last=Carlson | first=Michael | accessdate=2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=warlock&gt;[[Oakley Hall|Hall, Oakley]] ''Warlock'' (Author Biography)&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Thomas Pynchon]] praised it for restoring &quot;to the myth of Tombstone its full, mortal, blooded humanity&quot; and showing &quot;that what is called society, with its law and order, is as frail, as precarious, as flesh and can be snuffed out and assimilated into the desert as easily as a corpse can. It is the deep sensitivity to abysses that makes ''Warlock'' one of our best American novels.&quot;&lt;ref name=pynchon&gt;Pynchon, Thomas [http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_essays_gift.html A Review of Oakley Hall's Warlock]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, it was made into a film, also called ''[[Warlock (1959 film)|Warlock]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]].

==Plot==
Oakley Hall's ''Warlock'' is about the fictional [[American frontier|frontier]] [[boomtown]] of Warlock and its residents' attempts to keep the peace. In the novel, after escalating violence in the town, a group of citizens form a committee to determine a course of action against criminal cowboys and cattle rustlers. They decide to hire a gunslinger from Texas named Clay Blaisedell, and although things go smoothly at first, the morality of life in the legal no-man's-land becomes even more ambiguous.
