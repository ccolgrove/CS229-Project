'''''White Light/White Heat''''' is the second studio album by the American [[rock music|rock]] band [[The Velvet Underground]]. The record was the group's last with violist and founding member [[John Cale]].

==Recording==
After the disappointing sales of The Velvet Underground's first album, ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'', the band's relationship with [[Andy Warhol]] deteriorated. They toured throughout most of 1967. Many of their live performances featured noisy improvisations that would become key elements on ''White Light/White Heat''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicbabylon.com/artist/The_Velvet_Underground-bio.htm Velvet Underground History and Facts] at Music Babylon&lt;/ref&gt; The band eventually fired Warhol and parted ways with [[Nico]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warholstars.org/chron/1967.html Andy Warhol 1967] at Warholstars&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately went on to record their second album with Tom Wilson credited as producer.

The album was recorded in just two days, and with a noticeably different style than ''The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico''. John Cale described ''White Light/White Heat'' as &quot;a very rabid record...The first one had some gentility, some beauty. The second one was consciously anti-beauty.&quot; Sterling Morrison said, &quot;We were all pulling in the same direction. We may have been dragging each other off a cliff, but we were all definitely going in the same direction. In the ''White Light/White Heat'' era, our lives were chaos. Thatâs whatâs reflected in the record.&quot;

==Themes and composition==
Nearly every song on the album contains some sort of experimental or [[avant-garde]] quality. &quot;[[The Gift (The Velvet Underground song)|The Gift]]&quot;, for example, contains a recital of a [[short story]] and a loud instrumental rock song playing simultaneously, with the former on the left speaker channel and the latter on the right. &quot;[[I Heard Her Call My Name]]&quot; is distinguishable for its distorted guitar solos and prominent use of feedback.

The record's lyrics vary from themes of drug use and sexual references (such as [[fellatio]] and [[Orgy|orgies]]), including the song &quot;[[Lady Godiva's Operation]]&quot;, about a [[transsexualism|transsexual]] woman's botched [[lobotomy]], and the title track &quot;[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]]&quot;, which describes the use of [[amphetamine]].

On the album's last track, &quot;[[Sister Ray]]&quot;, Reed tells a tale of debauchery, while the band plays an [[improvised]] 17 minute [[jam session|jam]] around three chords.

==Cover==
The album cover to ''White Light/White Heat'' is a faint image of a [[tattoo]] of a [[human skull|skull]]. The picture of the tattooed arm was photographed, enlarged and distorted by [[Billy Name]], one of the members of [[The Factory]]. It is difficult to distinguish the tattoo, as the image is black, printed on a slightly lighter black background.  On this cover, the album name, the Verve logo, and the band name are all on one line.

An alternative cover was used for [[Polydor]]'s mid-1980s reissues.  This cover had a completely black background, without the arm in the background.  On this version, the album name, Verve logo, and band name are printed on three separate lines.

There also exists a unique [[MGM Records]] UK cover, produced from 1976 until the early 1980s, featuring a white background and abstract toy soldiers.
