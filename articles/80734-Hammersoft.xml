== History ==
=== Founding ===
[[File:AUhursthall.jpeg|left|225px|thumb|Hurst Hall, is the oldest building on campus.  Originally the history department, it now houses Department of Biology and Environmental Studies]]

An inspiration for the founding of American University was a letter written by [[George Washington]], in which he expressed a desire for a &quot;[[national university]]&quot; to be located in the nation's capital. The university was established in the [[District of Columbia]] by an Act of Congress on February 24, 1893, primarily due to the efforts of Methodist Bishop [[John Fletcher Hurst]]. Bishop Hurst and his colleagues were concerned with building an institution that would meld the strengths of the best [[Germany|German]] universities with the strengths of the existing university system in America. As their plans developed during the early years, they began to conceive of American University as an institution that would be:
* A privately supported university financed principally by the membership of the churches, particularly the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], which had been the founders of many of the colleges and universities in the early years of American history.
* An internationally minded institution where scholars from across the nation and from throughout the world would gather to dedicate their combined efforts to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.
* A center of higher education and research activities that, while independent of the government, would draw freely on the intellectual and scientific resources of the Nation's Capital to supplement and to extend its own capabilities.
* An institution that would contribute to the general cultural life and development of the capital in much the same manner that state-supported universities in other world capitals contributed to their communities.

=== 1900â1948 ===

After more than three decades devoted principally to securing financial support, the university was officially dedicated on May 15, 1914. The first instruction began on October 6 of that year, when 28 students were enrolled (19 of them graduate students, nine of them special students who were not candidates for a degree). The First Commencement, at which no degrees were awarded, was held on June 2, 1915. The Second Annual Commencement was held on June 2, 1916 where the first degrees (one master's degree and two doctor's degrees) were awarded.

[[File:AU McKineyHall ACC.jpeg|250px|right|thumb|Birthplace of Army Chemical Corps]]Shortly after these early commencement ceremonies, classes were interrupted by war. During [[World War I]], the university allowed the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] to use some of its grounds for testing. In 1917, the U.S. military divided American University into two segments, [[Camp American University]] and [[Camp Leach]]. Camp American University became the birthplace of the United States' chemical weapons program, and [[chemical weapons]] were tested on the grounds; this required a major cleanup effort in the 1990s. Camp Leach was home to advanced research, development and testing of modern [[camouflage]] techniques. {{As of|2007}}, the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] is still removing ordnance including [[mustard gas]] and [[mortar shell]]s.

During the next ten years, instruction was offered at the graduate level only, in accordance with the original plan of the founders. In the fall of 1925, the College of Liberal Arts (subsequently named the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]) was established. Since that date, the University has offered both undergraduate and graduate degrees and programs. In 1934, the School of Public Affairs was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spa.american.edu/pages.php?ID=12 The School of Public Affairs at American University]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the campus again offered its services to the U.S. government and became home to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Bomb Disposal School and a WAVE barracks. For AU's role in these wartime efforts, the [[Victory ship]] [[SS American Victory|SS ''American Victory'']] was named in honor of the university.

=== 1949â1990 ===
[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|250px|President [[John F. Kennedy]] delivers the [[wikisource:A Strategy of Peace|commencement address at American University]], June 10, 1963]]

The present structure of the university began to emerge in 1949. The [[Washington College of Law]] became part of the University in that year, having begun in 1896 as the first coeducational institution for the professional study of law in the District of Columbia. Shortly thereafter, three departments were reorganized as schools: the School of Business Administration in 1955 (subsequently named the Robert P. and Arlene R. Kogod College of Business Administration and in 1999 renamed the [[Kogod School of Business]]); the School of Government and Public Administration in 1957; and the [[School of International Service]] in 1958.

In the early 1960s, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operated a think tank under the guise of [[Operation Camelot]] at American University. The government abandoned the think tank after the operation came to public attention. AU's political intertwinement was furthered by President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Spring 1963 [[American University Speech|commencement address]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/media/speeches/Kennedy.htm &quot;1963 Commencement&quot;] June 10, 1963. Retrieved February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, Kennedy called on the Soviet Union to work with the United States to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and help reduce the considerable international tensions and the specter of nuclear war during that juncture of the [[Cold War]].

From 1965 to 1977, the College of Continuing Education existed as a degree-granting college with responsibility for on- and off-campus adult education programs. The Lucy Webb Hayes School of Nursing provided undergraduate study in Nursing from 1965 until 1988. In 1972, the School of Government and Public Administration, the [[School of International Service]], the Center for Technology and Administration, and the Center for the Administration of Justice (subsequently named the School of Justice) were incorporated into the College of Public and International Affairs.

The University purchased the Immaculata Campus in 1986 to help alleviate space problems. This would later become the Tenley Campus.

In 1986, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation Center began. Financed with $5 million from and named for Saudi Arabian Trustee [[Adnan Khashoggi]], the building was intended to update athletics facilities and provide a new arena, as well as a parking garage and office space for administrative services. Costing an estimated $19 million, the building represented the largest construction project to date, but met protest by both faculty and students to the University's use of Khashoggi's name on the building due to his involvement in international arms trade.&lt;ref&gt;NBC Evening News for Sunday, 11 January 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the College of Public and International Affairs was reorganized to create two free-standing schools: the [[School of International Service]] and the [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]], incorporating the School of Government and Public Administration and the School of Justice. That same year, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports Center completed while the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] controversy was at its height although his name was not removed from the building until after Khashoggi defaulted on his donation obligation in the mid to late 1990s.

=== 1990âpresent ===
[[File:AU Flag.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The American University flag.]]

The [[American University School of Communication|School of Communication]] became independent from the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] in 1993.

In 1997, [[American University of Sharjah]], the only coeducational, liberal arts university in the [[United Arab Emirates]], signed a two year contract with AU to provide academic management, a contract which has since been extended multiple times through August 2009. A team of senior AU administrators relocated to [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] to assist in the establishment of the university and guide it through the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] accreditation process.

In 2003, American launched the largest fund raising campaign in its history. The program, ''ANewAU'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/anewau/index.cfm &quot;A New AU&quot;]. Retrieved February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has a goal of raising $200 million dollars. As of October 2009, the University has raised $189.6 million dollars. When the campaign is completed, the University's website states that it &quot;will help to attract and retain the finest faculty, increase scholarship support, create and endow research and policy centers, ensure state-of-the-art resources in all of our schools and colleges, expand global programs, and secure the long-term financial health of the university by boosting the endowment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/anewau/faq.cfm &quot;Why a new AU&quot;]. Retrieved February 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2005, the new [[Katzen Arts Center]] opened.

[[Benjamin Ladner]] was suspended from his position as president of the university on August 24, 2005, pending an investigation into possible misuse of university funds for his personal expenses. University faculty passed votes of no confidence in President Ladner on September 26.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/26/AR2005092601801.html?sub=AR &quot;AU Faculty Members Vote No Confidence in Ladner&quot;] ''Washington Post.'' September 27, 2005; Page A01&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 10, 2005, the Board of Trustees of American University decided that Ladner would not return to American University as its president.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ugner [http://web.archive.org/web/20090110093248/http://veracity.univpubs.american.edu/weeklypast/101105/index.html Ladner removed as president]. American Weekly. October 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Cornelius M. Kerwin]], a long-time AU administrator, served as interim president and was appointed to the position permanently on September 1, 2007, after two outsiders declined an offer from the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.american.edu/president/new/biography.html| title=President-Elect Cornelius M. Kerwin biography| author=American University| year=2007| accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Page B10, 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ladner received a total compensation of $4,270,665 in his final year of service, the second highest of any university president in the United States.

Ground was broken for the new [[School of International Service]] building on November 14, 2007 and completed in 2010. A speech was given by Senator Daniel K. Inouye (D-HI).

== Campus ==
[[File:AUaerial.jpg|250px|thumb|Aerial view of main campus]]
American University has two non-contiguous campuses used for academics and student housing: the main campus on Massachusetts Avenue, and the [[Tenley Campus]] on Nebraska Avenue.  An additional facility houses the [[Washington College of Law]], located half a mile northwest of the main campus on Massachusetts Avenue. Additionally, AU owns several other buildings in the [[Tenleytown]] and [[Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.|Spring Valley]] areas.

=== Main Campus ===
The first design for campus was done by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] but was significantly modified over time due to financial constraints. The campus occupies 84&amp;nbsp;[[acre]]s (340,000&amp;nbsp;mÂ²) adjacent to [[Ward Circle]], the intersection of [[Nebraska Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Nebraska]] and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenues]].  AU's campus is predominantly surrounded by the affluent residential neighborhoods characteristic of the [[Washington DC (northwest)|Northwest Quadrant]] of Washington, D.C.

The university is composed of six divisions, referred to as colleges or schools, which house its academic programs: [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] (CAS), [[Kogod School of Business]] (KSB), [[American University School of Communication|School of Communication]] (SOC), [[School of International Service]] (SIS), [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]] (SPA) and [[Washington College of Law]] (WCL). With the exception of WCL, undergraduate and graduate courses are housed within the same division, although organized into different programs.

Students who do not declare into a specific school are sorted into CAS, which combine with its variety of academic programs to make it the largest division, followed by SIS, SPA, WCL, KSB and SOC.

American University is also home to a unique program known as the [[Washington Semester]] Program. This program partners with institutions around the world to bring students to AU for a semester. The program operates independently from, but in conjunction with, the other academic units. The program combines two seminar courses on three days a week with a two day per week internship that gives students a unique look at Washington, D.C. The program is unique in that the courses are not typical lecture courses; instead, speakers from various sectors of a particular field are invited to address the class, often from different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonsemester.com &quot;Washington Semester at American University&quot;].

== Public radio broadcasts ==
American University also operates a public radio station, [[WAMU]], broadcasting at 88.5&amp;nbsp;MHz on the FM band. The commercial-free station is affiliated with [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) and [[Public Radio International]]. The station began broadcasting as the student radio station, but developed into a professionally staffed station when the administration spun off the student radio station. Students may still hold internships. Original programming includes ''[[The Diane Rehm Show]]'' and ''The [[Kojo Nnamdi]] Show''.  The student-run radio station's callsign is WVAU, and is an internet-only station.

== Technology ==
Since adding a campus-wide advanced wireless broadband network in 2001, AU has been classified as one of the most &quot;unwired&quot; campuses in the U.S. by [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/personal/products/mobiletechnology/unwiredcolleges.htm &quot;Unwired Campuses&quot;] {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, AU has expanded its wireless presence by teaming with [[T-Mobile]] to first convert AU into the first HotSpot campus in 2004 and then again in 2005 when the [[Kogod School of Business]] became the first business school to integrate [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] data services with [[BlackBerry]] devices distributed to all graduate business students. Shortly after implementing RSS services, the university began providing [[podcast]]s for on-demand educational multimedia, such as lectures, playable on such programs as [[iTunes]] and compatible [[MP3]] players as [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iPod]]. With the release of video-enabled iPods in 2005, many podcasts will now also feature audio and video playback.

The University Library also launched a program whereby its Media Services Department is converting films to digital format for exclusive use by faculty in teaching their coursework for streaming media content.
