The '''2005 Grand National''' (known as the [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's]] Grand National for sponsorship reasons) was the 158th official annual running of the world-famous [[Grand National]] [[steeplechase]] which took place at [[Aintree Racecourse|Aintree]] near [[Liverpool]], [[England]], on 9 April 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/4247639.stm Runners for 2005 Grand National] BBC Sport, 8 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted the maximum permitted field of forty competitors for total prize money of Â£700,000 including Â£406,000 to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingbetter.co.uk/races_2005/aintree/2005_results.html Result: Aintree Martell Grand National - 9th April 2005] Racing Better&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine-year-old 7-1 favourite [[Hedgehunter]], ridden by [[Ruby Walsh]] and trained by [[Willie Mullins]] in [[Carlow]], [[Ireland]], won the race by 14 lengths, in a time of nine minutes and 21 seconds. 40-1 shot Royal Auclair finished second, from 66-1 rated Simply Gifted in third.

The start of the race was moved back twenty-five minutes in order to avoid clashing with the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles|wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles]]. Over half of the field completed the course and all the horses returned safely, although Frenchman's Creek was retired afterward. There was much media interest in Carrie Ford, the rider of Forest Gunner, who was considered the first genuine opportunity a woman had to win a Grand National. The pair were sent off as second favourite and finished fifth.

The main race was seen by the largest attendance at Aintree since the Monday National of [[1997 Grand National|1997]], with a crowd of 70,850 people, and a total of 151,660 over the course of the three-day meeting.&lt;ref&gt;www.aintree.co.uk/docLib/2009_pages010109.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''Ruby Walsh has sailed over the last in front on Hedgehunter... They're at the elbow in the National. Ruby Walsh is going strongly. He's six lengths clear of Royal Auclair and Simply Gifted... and Ruby Walsh is going to win the Grand National! Fell at the last last year but too good for them this time! Hedgehunter wins it, a second Grand National for Ruby.'''

The race was covered live by the [[BBC]] on television and radio in the United Kingdom in accordance with the [[Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events]] which recognises the Grand National as a sporting event of significant public interest.

The television coverage was part of a ''[[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]]'' special for the 46th consecutive year. Race commentary was provided by a four-man team consisting of [[Ian Bartlett]], Tony O'Hehir, [[Darren Owen]], and lead commentator [[Jim McGrath (Australian commentator)|Jim McGrath]] who called the runners home for the eighth year.

==Jockeys==
Carl Llewellyn had been the senior rider in the weighing room since the retirement of [[Richard Dunwoody]] after the 1999 race and became only the ninth rider ever to weigh out for a 15th National, having previously won the race in 1992 and [[1998 Grand National|1998]].

Nine riders made their Grand National debut, with Christian Williams finishing second and Carrie Ford fifth, while Tom Malone, David Dunsdon, Peter Buchanon and Robbie Power also completed the course. However, Alan Crowe's first ride ended at the second fence while Paddy Brennan and Tom Greenall also failed to reach the finishing post.
