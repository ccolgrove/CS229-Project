The '''2010 CopiapÃ³ mining accident''', also known as the &quot;'''Chilean mining accident'''&quot;, began in the afternoon of Thursday, 5 August 2010 as a significant [[cave-in]] at the  troubled 121-year-old [[San JosÃ© Mine|San JosÃ©]] copper&amp;ndash;gold mine.  The mine is located deep in the [[Atacama Desert]], one of the driest and harshest regions on earth, about {{convert|45|km|sp=us}} north of [[CopiapÃ³]], in northern [[Chile]], [[South America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-4months&quot;&gt;

The mixed crew of experienced miners and technical support personnel subsequently survived for a record 69 days deep underground before their rescue.&lt;ref name=&quot;mineros2&quot;&gt;

The people of Chile had just emerged from the devastating [[2010 Chile earthquake]] and its associated [[2010 Chile earthquake#Chile|tsunami]] less than six months before the accident.  The nation's tremendous outpouring of public concern for the plight of the 33 lost miners and the Chilean people's strong empathy for the workers' grief-stricken families led the national government to take over the faltering search and rescue operation from the mine's financially strapped owners, privately held [[San Esteban Mining Company]]. Eight exploratory boreholes were hastily drilled.  Seventeen days after the accident, on 22 August, a note written in bold red letters appeared taped to a drill bit when it was pulled to the surface after penetrating an area believed to be accessible to the trapped workers. It read simply ''{{lang|es|&quot;Estamos bien en el refugio, los 33&quot;}}'' (English: ''&quot;We are well in the shelter, the 33&quot;'').  The nation of Chile erupted into a wave of euphoria and demanded that Chile's leaders find a way to bring the trapped workers safely home to their waiting families. 

Once the government rescuers knew that the men were alive, Chile implemented a comprehensive plan to both nurture the workers during their entrapment and to rescue the miners from the depths. It included deployment of three large, international drilling rig teams, nearly every government ministry, the expertise of the [[United State]]s' [[NASA]] space agency and more than a dozen multi-national corporations. After 69 days trapped deep underground, all 33 men were brought safely to the surface on 13 October 2010 over a period of almost 24 hours.  After winching the last trapped miner to the surface, the mine rescue paramedics, the best available drawn from multiple national agencies, all still underground, held up a sign for the TV cameras reading ''{{lang|es|&quot;MisiÃ³n cumplida Chile&quot;}}'' (English: &quot;''&quot;Mission accomplished Chile&quot;''), which was seen by a TV/Web audience estimated at more than 1 billion viewers around the world watching the rescue live.&lt;ref name=cbctv&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/10/14/tech-chile-miner-video-stream.html Chilean mine rescue watched by millions online], Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNBreaking&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/13/workers-begin-to-rescue-trapped-chilean-miners/?hpt=T1&amp;iref=BN1|title=First of 33 trapped miners reaches surface|author= |publisher= CNN |date=12 October 2010|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphLive&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/8058924/Chile-Miners-Rescue-Live.html |title=Chile Miners Rescue: Live |publisher=London Daily Telegraph |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2010 |  first1=Peter | last1=Hutchison | first2=Bonnie | last2=Malkin | first3=Andy | last3=Bloxham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All 33 miners were rescued, almost all in good medical condition with no long-term physical effects anticipated.

Chile's long tradition of mining developed during the 20th century and has made the country the world's [[List of countries by copper production|top producer]] of [[copper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Chile.html Encyclopedia of the Nations] - CHILE - MINING -  Copyright Â© 2010 Advameg, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  An average of 34 people per year since 2000 have died in mining accidents in Chile, with a high of 43 in 2008, according to figures from the state regulatory agency [[Servicio Nacional de GeologÃ­a y MinerÃ­a de Chile|National Geology and Mining Service]] {{lang-es|Servicio Nacional de GeologÃ­a y MinerÃ­a de Chile}} abbreviated to SERNAGEOMIN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/27/trapped-chilean-miners-video%20Â© | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sam | last=Jones | title=Trapped Chilean miners sing national anthem in footage from inside mine | date=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mine is owned by the [[San Esteban Mining Company]], ({{lang-es|CompaÃ±Ã­a Minera San Esteban}} abbreviated to ''CMSE''), a company notorious for operating unsafe mines. According to an official with the [[non-profit]] [[Chilean Safety Association]], ({{lang-es|AsociaciÃ³n Chilena de Seguridad}}, also known as ''ACHS'') eight workers have died at the San JosÃ© site in the past 12 years&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-4months&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;familiessue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=torontostar&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/world/chile/article/873382--from-collapse-to-rescue-inside-the-chile-mine-disaster From collapse to rescue: Inside the Chile mine disaster], Toronto Star, Jennifer Yang, 10 Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while CMSE was fined 42 times between 2004 and 2010 for breaching safety regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;familiessue&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Families of trapped Chilean miners to sue mining firm|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/7966590/Families-of-trapped-Chilean-miners-to-sue-mining-firm.html|author=Govan, Fiona, Aislinn Laing and Nick Allen |publisher=London Daily Telegraph|date = 26 August 2010|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mine was shut down temporarily in 2007 when relatives of a miner killed in an accident sued the company but the mine reopened in 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-suit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11102478 |title=Trapped Chile miner's family sues owners and officials |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;familiessue&quot;/&gt; despite non-compliance with regulations, a matter that remains under investigation according to [[Senate of Chile|Senator]] Baldo Prokurica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc26.com/Global/story.asp?S=13048180 &quot;New video gives tour of trapped miners' refuge&quot;]&amp;nbsp;â Associated Press writers&amp;nbsp;â Bradley Brooks and Peter Prengaman&amp;nbsp;â with Federico Quilodran in Copiapo, Eduardo Gallardo in Santiago, and Michael Warren in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributing to this report.

Prior to the accident, CMSE had ignored warnings over unsafe working conditions in its mines. According to Javier Castillo, secretary of the [[trade union]] that represents San JosÃ©'s miners, the company's management operates &quot;without listening to the voice of the workers when they say that there is danger or risk&quot; .  &quot;Nobody listens to us. Then they say we're right. If they would have believed the workers, we would not be lamenting this now,&quot; said Gerardo NÃºÃ±ez, head of the union at a nearby Candelaria Norte mine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=362450&amp;CategoryId=14094 Unions Say Mining Becoming More Dangerous in Chile] [[Latin American Herald Tribune]], 9 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cave-in occurred there were two groups of workers in the mine. The group nearest the entrance escaped immediately without incident. A second group of 33 men was deep inside the mine, including several subcontracted vehicle mechanics who did not normally work deep within the mine.&lt;ref&gt;Tim King [http://www.salem-news.com/articles/october122010/chile_rescue.php &quot;LIVE VIDEO: Rescue of Miners in Chile Comes to Fruition&quot;] Salem-News.com, 12 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A thick dust cloud caused by the rock fall blinded the miners for up to six hours as well as causing lingering eye irritation and burning.&lt;ref name=&quot;camphope&quot;/&gt;

===Trapped group===
Initially the trapped miners tried to escape through the ventilation shaft system, but the ladders required by mining safety codes were missing. These shafts later became inaccessible due to ground movements and could not be used by rescue teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;escapeshaft&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Chile sets sight on escape shaft for trapped miners|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN24255937|author = Soto, Alonso |publisher=Reuters |date = 24 August 2010|accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a stipulation by the authorities following a previous closure that the mine could not be re-opened without the installation of escape ladders, CMSE had failed to install the required equipment by the time of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;familiessue&quot;/&gt; Many parts of the mine were over 100 years old and access to the depths of the mine's workings were reached by a long, sloping roadway with many irregular spiral turns,&lt;ref name=&quot;chan4prog&quot;&gt;[[Channel 4]] British TV program ''Buried Alive: The Chilean Mine Rescue'', 8 pm to 9 pm, Wednesday 27 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; rather than by a vertical [[Shaft mining|mineshaft]] and elevator system.

Luis UrzÃºa, the duty shift supervisor, recognized the gravity of the situation and the difficulty involved in any potential rescue attempt. He gathered his men in a secure room called a &quot;[[Mine Rescue Chamber|refuge]]&quot; and organized them and their meager resources to ensure long-term survival. Experienced miners were sent out to assess the situation, men with important skills were given key roles while numerous other measures were taken to maximize the chances of surviving the disaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;keepinghopealive&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Luis Urzua, the foreman keeping hope alive for Chile's trapped miners|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/05/luis-urzua-chile-trapped-miners|author = Franklin, Jonathan |publisher=The Observer |date = 5 September 2010|accessdate=14 October 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving hospital, miner Mario SepÃºlveda said &quot;All 33 trapped miners, practicing a one-man, one-vote democracy, worked together to maintain the mine, look for escape routes and keep up morale. We knew that if society broke down we would all be doomed. Each day a different person took a bad turn. Every time that happened, we worked as a team to try to keep the morale up.&quot;  He also said that some of the older miners helped to support the younger men but all have taken an oath of silence not to reveal certain details of what happened, particularly during the early weeks of desperation.&lt;ref name=telagraphsunday&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/8069092/PIX-AND-PUBLISH-Freed-miner-reveals-darkest-days.html Freed Chile miner Mario Sepulveda reveals darkest days], London Daily Telegraph, 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Videos sent to the surface===

In late August, 28 of the 33 miners appeared in a 40 minute video recorded using a mini-camera delivered by the government using ''palomas'' (&quot;doves&quot;, referring to their role as carrier pigeons), 5-foot-long (1.5 m) blue plastic capsules. The footage showed most of the men in good spirits and reasonably healthly, though they had all lost weight.&lt;ref name=nytsurvival&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/world/americas/28chile.html  Video of the Trapped Chilean Miners Stirs a Country's Emotions], The New York Times, Alexei Barrionnuevo, 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The men appeared mainly bare chested and bearded. They were all covered with a sheen of sweat resulting from the high heat and humidity of the mine at that depth. Several of the miners looked very thin and some were camera shy. The host, SepÃºlveda, avoided specifics about the health of the men and used the vague term &quot;complicated&quot; to refer to their situation.  He did however work to maintain an upbeat attitude and insisted that things were looking brighter for the trapped men.&lt;ref name=nytsurvival/&gt; The video generally portrays a positive, light atmosphere.&lt;ref name=nytsurvival/&gt;

===Leadership===
&quot;It's been a bit of a long shift,&quot; said foreman Luis UrzÃºa, a man whose level-headedness and gentle humor is credited with helping keep the miners under his charge focused on survival during their 70-day underground ordeal. In his first audio contact with officials on the surface, UrzÃºa kept his cool. He glossed over the hunger and despair he and his men felt, saying: &quot;We're fine, waiting for you to rescue us.&quot;&lt;ref name=ftlondon&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bf7e22e4-d897-11df-8e05-00144feabdc0.html Man in the News: Luis UrzÃºa], Financial Times, London, Jude Webber and John Paul Rathbone, 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survivalguardian&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/14/chile-miner-luis-urzua-interview Chile miners: Rescued foreman Luis UrzÃºa's first interview], The Guardian (UK), Rory Carroll and Jonathan Franklin, 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=taipei&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2010/09/07/2003482273 Chilean mine foreman works heroically to keep hope alive], Taipei Times, China, Jonathan Franklin, 7 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

UrzÃºa credited majority decision-making for the trapped men's good ''esprit de corps'' and dedication to their common goal.  &quot;You just have to speak the truth and believe in democracy&quot;, he said. &quot;Everything was voted on ... We were 33 men, so 16 plus one was a majority.&quot;&lt;ref name=ftlondon/&gt;

&lt;!---Essay like - With the honor of beleaguered ship's captains over the ages, ---&gt;54-year-old UrzÃºa was the last man out after 70 long days trapped below the Atacama desert. Following the collapse of the mine on 5 August, he had dispatched men to find out what had happened and see if escape was possible, but they could not find an exit route.  &quot;We were trying to find out what we could do and what we could not,&quot; said UrzÃºa. &quot;Then we had to figure out the food.&quot;  UrzÃºa tried to instill a philosophical acceptance of fate so they could accept their situation and move on to embrace the essential tasks of survival.&lt;ref name=survivalguardian/&gt;

Out of concern for their morale, rescuers were reluctant to tell the miners that in the worst-case scenario, the rescue might take months, with an eventual extraction date close to Christmas. However on 25 August the trapped men were fully briefed on the projected timeline for their rescue and the complexity of the plans involved.

Environmental and safety issues were also a primary concern.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

After the rescue, Dr. Rodrigo Figueroa, chief of the Trauma Stress and Disaster unit of the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]], said there were serious shortcomings in the censorship of letters to and from miners' relatives above ground and in the monitoring of activities they could undertake, as being underground has suddenly turned them back  into &quot;babies&quot;. Nevertheless the natural strength of &quot;The 33&quot; kept them alive, and their natural organization into teams as a response to disaster was also part of the innate human response to threat.

==Tent city and the families==
{{Lang|es|''Campamento Esperanza''}} (Camp Hope) was a [[tent city]] that sprang up in the desert as word of the mine's collapse spread. At first, relatives gathered at the mine entrance and slept in cars as they waited and prayed for word on the rescue operation's progress. As days turned into weeks, friends brought them tents and other camping supplies to provide shelter from the harsh desert climate. The encampment grew with the arrival of friends and relatives, additional rescue and construction workers, and members of the media. Government ministers held regular briefings for the families and journalists at the camp. &quot;We're not going to abandon this camp until we go out with the last miner left&quot;, said MarÃ­a Segovia, &quot;There are 33 of them, and one is my brother&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Federico QuilodrÃ¡n (AP) [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38830593/ns/world_news-americas Dinner for Chile miners â 2 spoonfuls of tuna], MSNBC.com, 24 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reygadas Children [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11136021 Chile miners: Family's diary], BBC News, August to October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members of the miners' families at Camp Hope were devout Catholics who prayed almost constantly for the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://af.reuters.com/article/metalsNews/idAFN1411723720101014?sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Joyous families end long vigil at Chile's &quot;Camp Hope&quot; | date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As they waited, worried families erected memorials to the trapped men, lit candles and prayed. On a nearby hill overlooking the mine, the families placed 32 Chilean and one Bolivian flag to represent their stranded men. Small shrines were erected at the foot of each flag and amongst the tents, pictures of the miners, religious icons and statues of the Virgin Mary and patron saints.&lt;ref name=Oppmann1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/09/faith-plays-key-role-for-trapped-chilean-miners-families/ | work=CNN | title=Faith plays key role for trapped Chilean miners, families|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MarÃ­a Segovia, the elder sister of DarÃ­o Segovia, became known as {{Lang|es|''La Alcaldesa''}} (the Mayoress) for her organizational skills and outspokenness.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Buschschluter [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11513534 High heels and hairdos: Chile countdown begins], BBC News, 11 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As the families became more organized, the government took steps to provide some comforts, eventually providing a more private area for the relatives to avoid constant interrogation by the energetic press corps. Infrastructure such as a kitchen, canteen area, sanitary facilities and security were later added. Bulletin boards sprouted up and the local government established shuttle bus stops. Over time a school house and children's zones were built while volunteers worked to help feed the families. Clowns entertained the children and organizations provided emotional and spiritual comfort to the waiting families.&lt;ref&gt;Moises Avila Roldan [http://www.smh.com.au/world/miners-no-longer-in-dark-rescue-months-away-20100826-13u8n.html Miners no longer in dark: rescue months away], Sydney Morning Herald, 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Police and soldiers were brought in from Santiago to help maintain order and security, with some patrolling the desert perimeter on horseback.

==Rescue plans==
{{Main|Rescue plans for 2010 CopiapÃ³ mining accident}}
[[File:Ellgaard, Das Wunder von Lengede, 1963.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A watercolor painting of the Dahlbusche Bomb, the 1963 precedecessor of the phoenix used in Wunder von Lengede |Miner rescued with a [[Dahlbusch Bomb]], the 1963 predecessor of the ''FÃ©nix'', ''[[Wunder von Lengede]]'', artist depiction (1963) by [[Helmuth Ellgaard]]]]

Exploratory bore holes were used to locate the trapped miners, with several of these subsequently used to supply the men logistically.  The Chilean government developed a comprehensive rescue plan modeled on the successful 2002 US [[Quecreek Mine Rescue]], itself based on the 1963 German [[Wunder von Lengede]] rescue operation.  Both previous rescues had used a &quot;rescue pod&quot; or capsule to winch trapped miners to the surface one-by-one.  Chilean rescue crews planned to use at least three drilling technologies to create bore holes wide enough to raise the miners in custom-designed rescue pods as quickly as possible. &quot;The mine is old and there is concern of further collapses,&quot; Henry Laas, managing director of Murray &amp; Roberts Cementation, one of the companies involved in the rescue operation, said,  &quot;The rescue methodology therefore has to be carefully designed and implemented.&quot;&lt;ref name=minersspecial&gt;[http://www.santiagotimes.cl/i/90-miners-special/20024-miners-rescue-in-chile-an-unprecendent-rescue-begins Miners's Recue In Chile: An Unprecendent Rescue Begins (Special Report)(English)], The Santiago Times, Dominique Farrell and Dustin Zarnikow&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drilling plans===
Large escape boreholes were drilled concurrently using several types of equipment provided by multiple international corporations and based on three different access strategies. When the first (and only) escape shaft reached the miners, the three plans in operation were:
# '''Plan A''', the Strata 950 (702&amp;nbsp;meter target depth at 90Â°),
# '''Plan B''', the Schramm T130XD (638&amp;nbsp;meter target depth at 82Â°),
# '''Plan C''', a RIG-421 drill (597&amp;nbsp;meter target depth at 85Â°).&lt;ref&gt;Page 5, [http://www.minmineria.gov.cl/574/articles-7093_recurso_2.pdf San JosÃ© Mine Rescue Operation] presentation, Ministry of Mining, Republic of Chile.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plan A====
Used an [[Australia]]n built [[Strata 950]] model [[raise borer]]&lt;ref name=stratainfo&gt;[http://www.ruc.com.au/docs/950_specs.pdf Model 950 Strata Raisebore Machine - Drill Rig Specifications PDF], RUC Cementation Mining Contractors, (English)&lt;/ref&gt; type [[drilling rig]] often used to create circular shafts between two levels of a mine without using  [[explosives]].  Provided by [[South African]] mining company [[Murray &amp; Roberts]], the drill had recently finished creating a shaft for Codelco's Andina copper mine in Chile and was immediately transferred to the San JosÃ© Mine. Since it weighed {{convert|31|ST|MT|sp=us}}, the drill had to be shipped in pieces on a large truck convoy. The Strata 950 was the first of the three drills to begin boring an escape shaft. If the pilot hole had been completed, further drilling would have caused rock debris to fall down the hole, obviating the need for the miners to remove the debris.&lt;ref name=bbcgear&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11089726 Rescuers face tough challenge to save Chile miners], BBC News, Adrian Brown, 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;challengesindetail&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Rescuers face tough challenge to save Chile miners|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11089726| author = Brown, Adrian |publisher=BBC News| date=26 August 2010|accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plan B====
Plan B involved a Schramm Inc. T130XD air core drill owned by Geotec S.A. (a Chilean-American joint venture drilling company) that was chosen by Drillers Supply SA (the general contractor of Plan B) to widen one of the three 5.5 inches (14 cm) boreholes that were already keeping the miners supplied with palomas. Internationally, the drills are used to drill top holes for the oil and gas industry and for mineral exploration and water wells This system employed Chilean Drillers Supply SA (DSI) personnel, Mijali Proestakis G.M. and Partner, Igor Proestakis Tech Mgr and Greg Hall C.E.O. (who joined his team on site for the last eight days of drilling) and their 7&quot; drill pipe air core drill, a team of American drillers from Layne Christensen Co. and specialized Down-The-Hole drilling hammers from Center Rock, Inc., of Berlin, Pennsylvania. Center Rock's president and personnel from DSI Chile were present on site for the 33 days of drilling. While the Schramm rig, built by privately held Schramm, Inc. of West Chester, Pennsylvania, was already on the ground in Chile at the time of the mine collapse, additional drilling equipment was flown from the United States to Chile by United Parcel Service. The drill's percussion-technology [[hammer drill]] can drill at more than {{convert|40|m|ft|sp=us}} a day by using four hammers instead of one.&lt;ref name=minersspecial/&gt;&lt;ref name=FourHammerBit&gt;{{cite web|title=Center Rock Drill Breaks Through to Trapped Chilean Miners|url=http://www.forconstructionpros.com/print/Equipment-Today/Featured-Equipment-Today-Online-Articles/Center-Rock-Drill-Breaks-Through-to-Trapped-Chilean-Miners/5FCP18070|publisher=For Construction Pros|work=Cygnus|date = 11 October 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schramminfo&gt;[http://www.airdrill.com.au/images/Airdrill_SchrammT130XD.pdf Schramm Airdrill T130XD Rig Specifications PDF], Schramm Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=houstonchron&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7246077.html 'Plan B' rises to the top for miners], Houston Chronicle (US), Zain Shauk, 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schramm T-130 was directed to bore toward the workshop, a space that was accessible by the miners. The T-130 became operational on 5 September and worked in three stages. First, it needed to enlarge the 5.5 inches (14 cm) hole to a 12 inches (30 cm) hole. It then needed to drill the 12 inches (30 cm) hole into a 28 inches (71 cm) diameter hole. âIf we tried to drill from a 5.5 inches (14 cm) hole to a 28 inches (71 cm) hole, the torque would be too high and it would ... put the drill bits under too much pressure,â said Schramm, Inc. Latin American Regional Manager, Claudio Soto. However by reusing the same hole, there was still added pressure on the drill. Delays occurred because of issues with the neck of the drills caused by the angle of the drilling. Rescuers couldnât drill vertically since that would require placing the heavy rig on the unstable ground where the cave in had happened. And the rescuers also had to avoid drilling into the production tunnels that wind above the shelter. Soto added, during the rescue, âItâs a difficult hole. Itâs curved and deep. The hard rock has proven to be abrasive and has worn out the steel of the drill.â

The fine rock debris, known as cuttings, fell down the pilot hole; an estimated 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) of rocks fell down every hour. Working in shifts 24 hours a day, the miners had to keep the passage clear with the industrial-sized battery-powered sweepers, shovels and wheel barrows trapped in the mine with them.[21] The miners had to remove on their own a total mass of drilling cuttings estimated at up to 700 metric tons (770 short tons), considering a borehole diameter of 70 centimeters (28 in), with a depth of 688 meters (2,257 ft) and a rock density of 2.7 tons per cubic meter.[22][12]

Its first delay was caused by it hitting a metal bar in an old working and wrecking.[23] The wrecked drill bit was retrieved by sending down a steel tube called a &quot;spider&quot;, whose end was cut into 8 long teeth. When the spider reached the obstruction, its 8 teeth went down around the drill bit, and on further pressure bent in below the drill bit, holding it, and it was hauled to the surface. The second delay was caused by the replacement drill bit wearing out. As the drill drilled down, the spoil fell down the pilot hole and the trapped miners had to clear it away, using a front loader, fueled with diesel sent down via one of the supply holes.

Operated a powerful Canadian made [[RIG-421]] oil drilling rig operated by Calgary-based [[Precision Drilling Corporation]]. It was the last drill to be added to the rescue process and went into operation on September 19.&lt;ref name=minersspecial/&gt;  The rig, normally used for oil and gas well drilling, could theoretically drill a wide enough escape shaft in a single pass without a pilot hole. RIG-421 is a {{convert|43|m|ft|sp=us}} tall [[Drilling rig#Drilling rig classification|Diesel-Electric Triple]] which needed 40 truckloads to bring its components from [[Iquique]], Chile to CopiapÃ³.

Furthermore, the hardness of the rock caused the drill bit to wander from its intended course and it then needed to be removed, resized and repositioned, slowing drilling progress. Many family members of the miners initially had high hopes for this rig, but it was forced to reduce its drill size and so lagged behind the other attempts.&lt;ref name=minersspecial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/canadian-effort-to-reach-trapped-chilean-miners-lagging/article1744464 |title=Canadian effort to reach trapped Chilean miners lagging|publisher=Canadian Globe and Mail |date=5 October 2010  |accessdate=18 October 2010 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/canadian-drillers-content-with-losing-race-to-reach-chilean-miners-for-the-most-part/article1751775 Canadian drillers content with losing race to reach Chilean miners â for the most part], Canadian Globe and Mail, 10 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The rescue operation was an international effort that involved not only technology, but the cooperation and resources of companies and individuals from around the world, including Latin America, South Africa, Australia, the United States and Canada. NASA specialists helped develop a sophisticated health agenda. Though international participation was critical to success, overall, it was a Chilean-led team effort. As one NASA specialist said during a visit early on in the rescue: &quot;The Chileans are basically writing the book.&quot;&lt;ref name=minersspecial/&gt;

The steel rescue capsules, dubbed ''[[FÃ©nix capsules|FÃ©nix]]'' (English: [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]) were constructed by the Chilean Navy with design input from [[NASA]].  The navy incorporated most of NASA's suggestions and produced three rescue pods: ''FÃ©nix'' 1, 2 and 3, all enhanced versions of the [[Dahlbusch Bomb]] used for mine rescue. ''FÃ©nix'' 1 was presented to journalists and the miners' relatives for their assessment.&lt;ref name=minersspecial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Laura|title= To Design Miners' Escape Pod, NASA Thought Small |url=http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/nasa-engineer-clinton-cragg-thought-small-to-design-rescue-capsule-for-chilean-miners/19667140|work=AOL News|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capsule&gt;{{cite web

====Preparations for extraction====
Although drilling finished on 9 October 2010, [[Laurence Golborne]], Chilean Minister of Mining, announced that the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the extraction system site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3220804-d304-11df-9ae9-00144feabdc0.html Chile mine rescue bid nears completion] FT.com, 8 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These tasks included a borehole inspection to determine how much of the shaft needed [[casing (borehole)|casing]] to prevent rockfalls from jamming the escape capsule. Depending on the shaft casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the winching rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.

Shortly before the extraction phase began, Golborne told reporters that rescuers estimated it would take about an hour to bring each miner to the surface. He therefore expected the lifting phase of the rescue operation to take up to 48 hours.&lt;ref name=ChileanLift&gt;{{cite news|title=Chile escape mine shaft lining 'completed'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11512355|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC News|date = 11 October 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GonzÃ¡lez arrived in the collapsed mine and made contact with the miners at 23:36.

===Extraction===
Although Chilean officials played down the risks of the rescue, the miners still needed to be alert during the ascent in case of problems. As a result, and according to the rescue plan, the first four men to be brought up the narrow shaft were those &quot;deemed the fittest of body and mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bajak and Vivian Sequera, with contributions from Michael Warren and Eva Vergara [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i075ahoJZZkuwcSyRJcUkUDZKuFQD9IQTCOO0?docId=D9IQTCOO0 Nearly half of the miners now free in Chile rescue]{{dead link|date=March 2011}} Associated Press, 13 October 2010; Retrieved 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter they would be best placed to inform the rescue team about conditions on the journey and report on the remaining miners. Once the four men had surfaced, the rescues proceeded in order of health, with the least healthy brought up from the mine first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Procedure ===
Six hours before his rescue, each miner switched to a NASA recommended purely liquid diet rich in sugars, minerals and potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/mineros-comienzan-ayuno-6-horas-antes-del-rescate/noticias/2010-10-11/143649.html |title=Mineros comienzan ayuno 6 horas antes del rescate |publisher=LaNacion.cl |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miners also used a girdle around their waists to maintain stable blood pressure, and took an aspirin to avert formation of [[thrombosis|blood clots]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-10/trapped-chile-miners-eat-nasa-diet-aspirin-to-prepare-for-coming-rescue.html Trapped Chile Miners Eat NASA Diet, Prepare for Rescue] Bloomberg, Nathan Crooks and Randy Woods, 11 October 2010 â Retrieved 18 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each miner was strapped into a harness inside the {{convert|21|in|cm|sp=us}} wide bullet-shaped capsule wearing a green moisture-resistant coveralls&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Post Chile Mine article&quot;&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/amigos_welcome_back_from_hell_gEBMzxKf9WVBnZfxSmSWAK Amigos, Welcome Back from Hell&amp;nbsp;â Tears and cheers greet Chilean miners rescued after 68 days] New York Post&amp;nbsp;â Late City Final&amp;nbsp;â 13 October 2010&amp;nbsp;â page  4.&lt;/ref&gt; and sunglasses&lt;ref name=shades&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/10/13/sports-sunglasses-aim-ease-miners-transition/ |title=Sports Sunglasses Can Aid Chilean Miners' Transition |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=13 October 2010|accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid retinal damage from initial exposure to harsh lighting on the surface. The capsule included oxygen masks, heart monitors, and video cameras.&lt;ref name=capsule/&gt;  Once the miner was secure inside the capsule it then ascended at a rate of {{convert|1|m/s|mph|sp=us}}, with an estimated travel time of 9 to 18 minutes.  

When the capsule surfaced a doctor checked the miner's alertness before he was helped out of the capsule and immediately reunited with a small group of close family members to a round of applause from rescue workers, family members and observers.  

Throughout the 24 hour long operation, each miner was personally greeted by President PiÃ±era and in many cases his wife too. After this the miner was stretchered to a [[field hospital]] for initial evaluation.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Post Chile Mine article&quot;/&gt; As none of the men needed immediate emergency treatment, each was transferred by ambulance to an office building, still on the mine premises, for a private reunion with close family members. 

Finally, the miners were transferred in groups of four by helicopter to CopiapÃ³ Hospital, {{convert|60|km|mi|sp=us}} away, for a 24â48 hour period of medical observation and treatment. While the previously rescued miners received medical treatment, the capsule repeated its descent in readiness to lift the next man to the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Post Chile Mine article&quot;/&gt;

===Rescue===

The original plan called for two rescue workers to descend into the mine before bringing the first miner to the surface. However, to avoid delay, rescuers decided to bring a miner to the surface in the returning capsule that had taken GonzÃ¡lez down. An &quot;empty&quot; trial run had taken place the previous day, with the capsule stopping just {{convert|15|m|ft|sp=us}} before the end of the shaft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/national_world/stories/2010/10/12/trial-lowering-of-rescue-capsule-is-a-success.html &quot;Trial lowering of rescue capsule is a success&quot;], [[The Columbus Dispatch]], 12 October 2010; Retrieved 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After a further safety check, 15 minutes later miner Florencio Ãvalos began his ascent from the mine. TV cameras both inside the mine and on the surface captured the event and broadcast it worldwide. The mine's shift supervisor, Luis UrzÃºa, whose disciplined leadership was credited with keeping the men alive on an emergency food supply during their first 17 days without contact from the outside world, was the last miner to make the journey to the surface.

Each transit of the capsule, whether up or down, was projected to take 15 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20101012/twl-live-chile-miners-rescue-begins-soon-3fd0ae9.html Live: Chile Miners Rescue Begins Soon]{{dead link|date=March 2011}} Sky News. 13 October 2010. Retrieved on 16 October 2010.{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving a total time of 33 hours for the rescue operation. In practice, after the capsule's first few transits, it became apparent that the trip might be shorter than the projected 15 minutes and each rescue cycle should take less than 1 hour. As the eighteenth miner was brought to the surface, Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne stated &quot;We have advanced at a faster time than we originally planned. I foresee we might conclude the whole operation before tonight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Chile-Mine-Rescue-Begins-Operation-To-Pull-Trapped-Chilean-Miners-To-Safety-Under-Way/Article/201010215757107?lpos=World_News_News_Your_Way_Region_6&amp;lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15757107_Chile_Mine_Rescue_Begins%3A_Operation_To_Pull_Trapped_Chilean_Miners_To_Safety_Under_Way Live: Chile Mine Rescue] Sky News, 13 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After stepping free from the rescuers and greeting his son, Luis UrzÃºa embraced President PiÃ±era saying, &quot;I've delivered to you this shift of workers, as we agreed I would&quot;.  The president replied, &quot;I gladly receive your shift, because you completed your duty, leaving last like a good captain.&quot; President PiÃ±era went on to say &quot;You are not the same after this, and Chile won't be the same either.&quot;&lt;ref name=timerescue&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2025624,00.html How the Miners Have Won Respect for Chile's Workers], Time Magazine, Tim Padgett, 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A large Chilean flag that had hung in the mine chamber during the rescue was brought up by Luis UrzÃºa. Once all the miners had been extracted, the rescuers in the mine chamber displayed a banner reading ''{{lang|es|&quot;MisiÃ³n cumplida Chile&quot;}}'' (&quot;Mission accomplished Chile&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2010/10/101014_video_chile_mineros_rescate_vale2.shtml &quot;Fin del rescate de los mineros: una epopeya con final feliz&quot;] BBC News Mundo-Noticias, 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Manuel GonzÃ¡lez was the first rescuer down and the last up, spending 25 hours 14 minutes in the mine. Rescuers needing to sleep did so in the mine to avoid tying up the capsule on rescue-delaying journeys to the surface. When the last rescuer surfaced, President PiÃ±era covered the top of the rescue shaft with a metal lid. Altogether, ''FÃ©nix 2'' made 39 round trips, traveling a total distance of about {{convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11539784 |title=Lid is placed on Chile mine shaft |publisher=BBC News|date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the rescue, the trapped miners were divided into three groups to determine their exit order. From first to last these were: ''{{lang|es|&quot;hÃ¡biles&quot;}}'' (skilled), ''{{lang|es|&quot;lÃ¡biles&quot;}}'' (weak) and ''{{lang|es|&quot;fuertes&quot;}}'' (strong).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/101012/ultmo-521431/ultimo-momento/hora-y-nombres-definidos-para-el-rescate Hora y nombres definidos para el rescate] El Pais, 12 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This grouping was based on the theory that the first men to exit should be those more skilled and in the best physical condition, as they would be better equipped to escape unaided in the event of a capsule malfunction or shaft collapse. They were also thought more able to communicate clearly any other problems to the surface rescue team. The second group included miners with medical problems, older men and those with psychological issues. The final group comprised the most mentally tough, as they had to be able to endure the anxiety of the wait;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prensalibre.com/internacionales/odisea/Rescate-mineros-chilenos-final-previsto_0_352764984.html Rescate mineros chilenos llega a fase final antes de lo previsto] PrensaLibre.com, 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in the words of Minister MaÃ±alich &quot;they don't care to stay another 24 hours inside the mine&quot;.

The exit order was as shown below. &lt;!---This is already detailed above - The penultimate miner rescued, Ariel Ticona, was tasked with communications.

By 19 October, all 33 of the men had been released from the hospital.  All but two of the men were allowed to go home within 48 hours of the rescue. Mario SepÃºlveda remained hospitalized for further psychological evaluation over concerns that he had yet to adapt to life outside the mine, but was released on 16 October.&lt;ref name=telegraphblows&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/8067501/Chile-miners-came-to-blows-but-swore-to-keep-details-secret.html Chile miners came to blows, but swore to keep details secret], London Daily Telegraph, Fiona Govan and Aislinn Laing, 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, VÃ­ctor Zamora remained to receive additional treatment for a dental infection and was released on 19 October.&lt;ref name=sundaymass&gt;{{cite web|last=Raphael |first=Angie |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/freed-miners-return-to-camp-hope/story-e6frf7jx-1225939966063 |title=Freed miners return to Camp Hope|publisher=Herald Sun |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = newbattle&gt;Philip Sherwell [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/8068674/Chile-miners-new-battle-to-adapt-to-normality.html Chile miners' new battle to adapt to normality], London Daily Telegraph, 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health concerns===

Doctors marveled at how well the men had coped physically with their time underground, but the media frenzy surrounding the men since their rescue concerned Chilean Health Minister, Jaime MaÃ±alich. He asked the media to treat the miners &quot;with dignity and respect&quot;, adding that they needed &quot;rest and repose&quot; and a chance to come to terms with the events of the last 70 days. &quot;They are still on an emotional roller-coaster&quot;. The medical team's psychologist, Alberto Iturra, warned that the miners were exhausted, &quot;When that happens, your sensitivity rises to the maximum at the same time as your tolerance falls to almost nothing&quot; he stated.  Regardless of these issues, President PiÃ±era challenged the men to a friendly soccer game as well as inviting them to state functions including a visit to the presidential palace and the grand opening of a transcontinental highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/1016/1224281251629.html Media carnival follows still vulnerable miners], Irish Times, 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University [[NYU Langone Medical Center|Langone Medical Center]], said that lack of sunlight could potentially cause problems with muscles, bones and other organs. Jane Aubin, scientific director of the Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis at the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research|Canadian Institute for Health Research]], said the miners would have to be monitored closely. &quot;They haven't been as physically active as you would want [them] to be, so they have undoubtedly experienced some muscle loss,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably after that extended period of time, in both a confined space and in relative darkness, they've also probably experienced some [[Osteoporosis|bone loss]].&quot;&lt;ref name=gooddocs&gt;Caroline Alphonso [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/miners-watched-closely-for-physical-and-mental-health-problems/article1758120 Miners watched closely for physical and mental health problems], Canada Globe and Mail, 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The team of psychologists who spoke to the miners daily in the mine will continue to follow their progress.{{Clarify|post-text=How long for? Are they still being monitored - source required|date=March 2011}}

Officials considered canceling plans for a thanksgiving mass for the men and their families at ''Camp Hope'', on 17 October over fears that a premature return to the site could be damaging. &quot;It's not a good idea that they go back to the mine so soon,&quot; said psychologist Iturra.&lt;ref name=newbattle/&gt; Dr Jorge DÃ­az, head of the miners' medical team at CopiapÃ³ regional hospital said &quot;We have a group of workers who are absolutely normal people, they weren't selected from a group of applicants to be astronauts, nor were they people who underwent rigorous tests, therefore we don't know when the [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress syndrome]] can appear.&quot;&lt;ref name=sundaymassbbc/&gt;

Conversely, [[post-traumatic growth]], positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances could also result.  The triumph of the miners in a highly challenging environment could also increase their self-confidence and strengthen bonds with each other and with their families. &quot;When people are deprived ... it can be really adverse, it can really mess up a person. With these guys, they were together,&quot; said Charles Nelson, a psychologist with the operational stress injury clinic at Parkwood Hospital in London, Ontario, Peter Suedfeld, a professor emeritus at the [[University of British Columbia]], said the men are less likely to have trouble returning to their jobs. &quot;Sailors who have been shipwrecked, for example ... many of them go back to sea,&quot; he said. &quot;They'll feel that they can cope with anything that comes up.&quot; &lt;ref name=gooddocs/&gt;

===Activities===
On Sunday, 17 October 2010, six of the 33 rescued miners attended a [[multi-denominational]] memorial mass led by an evangelical pastor and a Roman Catholic priest at ''{{lang|es|&quot;Campamento Esperanza&quot;}}'' (Camp Hope) where anxious relatives had awaited the men's return. Some of the rescuers who helped bring the miners to the surface also attended.&lt;ref name=sundaymass/&gt;&lt;ref name=sundaymassbbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11561355 Chile mine: Rescued men attend service of thanks], BBC News, 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Reporters and cameras mobbed the miners prompting the police to intervene to protect them.  Omar Reygadas' family was swarmed by the media after they left the service and his 2-year-old great-granddaughter started crying when pushed by the crowd.  As Reygadas picked her up the cameras zoomed in.  Reygadas stayed calm but offered his only answer in response to their questions:  &quot;I've had nightmares these days,&quot; Reygadas said from inside a small tent while reporters jockeyed for position, &quot;but the worst nightmare is all of you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beijingtoday.com.cn/blogger/ahen/rescued-miners%E2%80%99-secrecy-pact-erodes-in-spotlight &quot;Rescued Miners' Secrecy Pact Erodes in Spotlight&quot;] - The New York Times - October 18, 2010 - Beijing Today -  çæææ,ä¸¥ç¦è½¬è½½ Â· Copyright Â© 2008 Â· All Rights Reserved - retrieved Friday, November 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on their experience, the miners plan to start a foundation to help in the field of mine safety. Yonni Barrios said &quot;We're thinking about creating a foundation to solve [safety] problems in the mining industry.  With this, with the experience that we had had, God help us, we should be able to solve these problems.&quot; Juan Illanes told El Mercurio &quot;We have to decide how to direct our project so this type of thing never happens again.  It needs to be done, but these things don't happen quickly&quot;.&lt;ref name=smhfoundation&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/world/chile-miners-plan-mine-safety-group-20101018-16pct.html Chile miners plan mine safety group], The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia, 18 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2010, the miners attended a reception hosted by President PiÃ±era at the presidential palace in the capital, Santiago, and were awarded medals celebrating Chile's independence bicentennial.  Outside, the men posed for photographs next to the Fenix rescue capsule that had winched them to the surface, now installed in the main square in Santiago.  Afterwards, at the National Stadium, the freed miners played a football match against a team that included President PiÃ±era,  Laurence Golborne the mining minister, and Jaime Manalich the health minister.  Team ''{{lang|es|&quot;Esperanza&quot;}}'' (Hope), led by Franklin Lobos, all wore the number &quot;33&quot;, but lost 3-2 to the government team.&lt;ref name=football&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/8086413/Chiles-saved-miners-play-football-match-against-their-rescuers.htm Chile's saved miners play football match against their rescuers]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}, London Daily Telegraph, Fiona Govan, 25 October 2010{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, miners visited [[Los Angeles]], appearing in a taping of [[CNN]] &quot;Heroes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2010/11/chilean_miners_los_angeles.php &quot;Chilean Miners Visit Los Angeles, Hollywood: CNN 'Heroes' Taping Planned&quot;], Dennis Romero. Los Angeles Weekly. November 18, 2010. Accessed June 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2010, 26 of the rescued miners, including [[Franklin Lobos]], went on invitation to a [[Manchester United]] training session at [[Carrington, Greater Manchester]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-11985807 | work=BBC News | title=Rescued Chile miners meet Manchester United players | date=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In February 2011, 31 of the 33 miners were hosted by the [[Tourism Minister of Israel|Israeli Ministry of Tourism]] for an eight-day pilgrimage of Christian and Jewish holy sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Video/Article.aspx?id=209466 |title=Chilean miners arrive for âpilgrimage of thanksâ |last=Lidman |first=Melanie |date=23 February 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy of the accident==
[[File:Mina San JosÃ© - Los 33 at Moneda Ceremony - Gobierno de Chile.jpg|thumb|thumb|alt=Color image of Los 33 miners attending a ceremony hosted by President PiÃ±era at the Presidential Palace on 24 October 2010 after their rescue from the San Jose Mine|''Los 33'' miners attending a ceremony hosted by President PiÃ±era at the Presidential Palace on 24 October 2010 after their rescue from the San Jose Mine]]

===Political===
Immediately following the San JosÃ© mine collapse, President PiÃ±era dismissed top officials from the ''[[Servicio Nacional de GeologÃ­a y MinerÃ­a de Chile]]'' (SERNAGEOMIN), Chile's mining regulatory agency and vowed to undertake a major overhaul of the department in light of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-4months&quot;/&gt; In the days following the collapse, eighteen mines were shut down and a further 300 put under threat of possible closure. {{As of|2010|12}}&lt;ref name=&quot;cleardebris&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Trapped Chilean miners face long shifts to keep their refuge clear of debris|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/26/trapped-chilean-miners-clear-debris| author = Franklin, Jonathan |publisher=The Guardian| date=26 August 2010|accessdate=27 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the San JosÃ© mine's long-term future is unclear; it is currently closed and will remain in limbo for an extended period as judicial processes are followed.

On 25 October 2010, ahead of schedule, President PiÃ±era received a preliminary report by the Commission on Work Safety established in response to the incident. The report was a direct result of the CopiapÃ³ accident and contained 30 proposals ranging from improvements in hygiene to better coordination between local regulatory authorities.  Although the commission had set November 22, 2010 as the date to deliver its final report, it reported that job safety inspections in Santiago and regions throughout Chile had allowed them to obtain a clear picture of the situation earlier than anticipated. In total, the commission held 204 hearings and reviewed 119 suggestions that came from online input.&lt;ref name=safetysantiagotimes/&gt;
Throughout the incident, President PiÃ±era stressed that cost was of no object with regard to rescuing the miners.  The operation was expensive with estimates surpassing US$20&amp;nbsp;million, excluding expenses in building, maintaining and securing ''{{lang|es|&quot;Campamento Esperanza&quot;}}'' (Camp Hope).  These costs exceed the total business debt of the mine's owner, the San Esteban Mining Company, which currently stands at around US$19&amp;nbsp;million.  The state mining company Codelco contributed about 75% to rescue costs with private companies donating services worth more than US$5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=costsantiago&gt;[http://www.santiagotimes.cl/news/other/19977-final-cost-for-chile-mine-rescue-is-tallied- Final Cost For Chile Mine Rescue Is Tallied], Santiago Times, Dominique Farrell, 13 October (English)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French credit rating agency [[Coface]] declared that the dramatic mining rescue will have a positive impact on Chile's economic reputation. &quot;It provides to international investors an image of a country where you can do safe [sic] business,&quot; Coface's UK managing director, Xavier Denecker, said. &quot;It gives a good impression in terms of technology, solidarity and efficiency.&quot;  Coface rates countries according to the probability of private sector companies being successful. Chile holds its highest rating in South America: A2. The UK, in comparison, is rated at A3.&lt;ref name=guardiancredit&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/oct/17/mining-rescue-chile-credit-rating Mining rescue lifts Chile's credit rating up into the light], The Guardian, London,  Andrew Clark, 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal===
Following the accident, a lawsuit was filed against the San Esteban Mining Company by relatives of those trapped, while a judge froze US$2&amp;nbsp;million of its assets. A lawyer for several of the miners' families described this as a refutation of the company's claims of &quot;not having even enough money to pay salaries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleardebris&quot;/&gt;

On 21 October, San Esteban Mining Company Operations Chief Carlos Pinilla and mine manager Pedro Simunovic issued a signed public statement insisting that no company official &quot;had the slightest indication that a catastrophe could occur.&quot; Miner Jorge Gallardo asserted that there was no way the owners could have been unaware of the situation since he recorded  everything and his daily safety reports were signed by Pinilla in person.  Rescued miner Victor Zamora commented &quot;What made me sad was that people were dying because the company did not want to have something safer and only thought about money&quot;.&lt;ref name=safetysantiagotimes&gt;[http://www.santiagotimes.cl/news/human-rights/20056-chiles-commission-on-work-safety-delivers-preliminary-report-to-president-sebastian-pinera &quot;Chile's Commission On Work Safety Delivers Preliminary Report To President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era&quot;], Written by Dominique Farrell, October 26, 2010.

[[HernÃ¡n Rivera Letelier]], a well known Chilean writer and former miner, wrote an article for the Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pais]]'' offering advice to the miners: &quot;I hope that the avalanche of lights and cameras and flashes that is rushing towards you is a light one. It's true that you've survived a long season in hell, but, when all's said and done, it was a hell you knew. What's heading your way, now, comrades, is a hell that you have not experienced at all: the hell of the show, the alienating hell of TV sets. I've only got one thing to say to you, my friends: grab hold of your family. Don't let them go, don't let them out of your sight, don't waste them. Hold on to them as you hung on to the capsule that brought you out. It's the only way to survive this media deluge that's raining down on you.&quot;&lt;ref name=guardianmedia&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/18/chile-miners-global-media-coverage How the media in Chile helped focus the eyes of the world on the miners], The Guardian (UK), Rory Carroll, 18 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that the miners have hired an accountant to ensure that any income from their new celebrity status is fairly divided, including money from expected book and film deals. The men have agreed to &quot;speak as one&quot; when they discuss their experiences. While still trapped, they appointed one of their group as official biographer and another their poet.&lt;ref name=accountant&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/8066868/Chile-miners-will-speak-as-one.html Chile miners will 'speak as one'], London Daily Telegraph, Aislinn Laing, 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2011, the first of the expected books on the rescue, ''Under the Earth: The 33 Miners that Moved the World'' is nearing completion. Another book called ''33 Men, Buried Alive: The Inside Story of the Trapped Chilean Miners'', by [[Jonathan Franklin]], a writer for the UK-based ''[[The Guardian]]'', is due for release in early 2011.&lt;ref name=socialnews&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/chilean-miner-jose-ricardo-ojeda-vidal-copyrights-los-33/story-e6frg6so-1225942111686 Chilean miner Jose Ricardo Ojeda Vidal copyrights 'los 33'], The Australian, Martin Fletcher and Laura Dixon, 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.stv.tv/showbiz/202648-deals-already-on-offer-for-chilean-miners-story/ &quot;Deals already on offer for Chilean miners' story&quot;] - STV - Entertainment - October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chilean President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era has suggested turning Camp Hope into a memorial or museum in honor of the men.&lt;ref name=sundaymass/&gt;

The ''FÃ©nix 2'' capsule used in ''OperaciÃ³n San Lorenzo'' has been placed in the [[Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n]], in front of Chile's presidential palace in Santiago, Chile. Currently, one of the backup capsules is in CopiapÃ³ and the other was sent to China for display in Chile's exhibit at the 2010 [[Shanghai Expo]]. Discussions are under way for a permanent display of the capsule and possibly a museum. {{As of |2010|12}}, potential locations include [[CopiapÃ³]], the city closest to the accident site, and [[Talcahuano]], {{convert|1,300|mi|km|sp=us}} to the south, where the capsules were built at a Chilean navy workshop.&lt;ref name=fenixfight&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/8070137/Chile-mine-rescue-towns-fight-over-Phoenix-2-capsule.html Chile mine rescue: towns fight over Phoenix 2 capsule], London Daily Telegraph, 18 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since August 3, 2011, the ''FÃ©nix 2'' capsule is displayed at the Atacama Regional Museum in [[CopiapÃ³]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.soychile.cl/Copiapo/Sociedad/2011/08/03/30302/Con-emocion-instalaron-la-capsula-Fenix-II-en-el-Museo-Regional-de-Atacama.aspx |title=Con emociÃ³n instalaron la cÃ¡psula FÃ©nix II en el Museo Regional de Atacama |author=Paul-Edouard Martin |work=[[El Diario de Atacama]] |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2011 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
