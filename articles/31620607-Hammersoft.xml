'''Embarq Florida, Inc.''' is a telephone operating company providing local telephone services in [[Florida]] owned by [[CenturyLink]].

The company was established in [[1925]], later changing its name to '''United Telephone Company of Florida''' upon expansion of the United Telephone System. It was owned by [[United Utilities]].

United Utilities later became United Telecom, and acquired Sprint Long Distance from [[GTE]]. The company changed its name to [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint Corporation]]. Upon the merger '''Central Telephone Company of Florida''' into United Telephone of Florida, the company changed its name to '''Sprint-Florida, Inc.''' in [[1996]].

Sprint Corporation, in [[2005]], acquired [[Nextel]] and changed its name to [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint Nextel Corporation]]. The company intended to spin-off its wireline assets into a separate company, which in [[2006]] occurred as [[Embarq|Embarq Corporation]]. Sprint-Florida then became '''Embarq Florida, Inc.'''

Embarq was acquired by [[CenturyTel]] in [[2009]], which in [[2010]] changed its name to '''CenturyLink'''. Embarq Florida, at that point, began carrying on business under the CenturyLink name.
