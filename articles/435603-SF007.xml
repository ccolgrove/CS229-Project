'''MacDraw''' was a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] based drawing [[application software|application]] released along with the first [[Apple Macintosh]] systems in 1984. MacDraw was one of the first [[WYSIWYG]] drawing programs that could be used in collaboration with [[MacWrite]]. MacDraw was useful for drawing technical diagrams and floorplans. It was eventually adapted by [[Claris]] and in the early 1990s MacDraw Pro was released with color support.
MacDraw is the vector edition of [[MacPaint]].

== Early MacDraw ==
The first version of MacDraw was similar to that of [[MacPaint]], featuring both the same tools and patterns. However MacDraw was vector based, meaning that an object's properties and placement can be changed at any time. MacDraw included features for printing and also integrated into [[MacWrite]] via cut-and-paste. MacDraw was more advanced than MacPaint, featuring a grid and the ability to change the drawing dimensions. However MacDraw lacked support for using more than one document at a time, and also lacked zooming capabilities. MacDraw was especially useful in drawing [[flowcharts]], diagrams and [[technical drawing]]s.

MacDraw was based on Apple's earlier program, LisaDraw, which was developed for the [[Apple Lisa]] computer which was released in 1983. LisaDraw and MacDraw were developed by the same person, Mark Cutter.

== Later MacDraw ==
MacDraw II (1988) released by [[Claris]] introduced many missing features and was also enhanced for the [[Macintosh II]]. MacDraw eventually evolved into [[MacDraw Pro]] (1991) and ultimately [[ClarisDraw]] (1993). The final version of ClarisDraw was 1.0v4 (1994). It ran without difficulties on PPC-based Macs under the Classic OS until the arrival of the Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) operating system, which dropped support for the Classic OS.
