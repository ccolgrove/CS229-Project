==History==
===Founding===
The University of Houston began as Houston Junior College (HJC).  On March 7, 1927, trustees of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution that authorized the founding and operating of a junior college.  The junior college was operated and controlled by HISD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook of Texas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/UU/kcu3.html |title=University of HoustonâUniversity Park |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |work=Hand book of Texas |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Homecoming 2007 Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advancement.uh.edu/homecoming/2007/timeline.htm |title=UH Timeline |publisher=University of Houston |accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071218232533/http://www.advancement.uh.edu/homecoming/2007/timeline.htm |archivedate = December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally HJC was located in San Jacinto High School and offered only night courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;UH Through Time: Events&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.lib.uh.edu/sca/digital/time/events.html |title=UH Through Time: Events |publisher=University of Houston Libraries |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first session began March 7, 1927, with an enrollment of 232 students and 12 faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; /&gt;  This session was primarily held to educate the future teachers of the junior college, and no freshmen were allowed to enroll.  A more accurate date for the official opening of HJC is September 19, 1927, when enrollment was opened to all persons having completed the necessary educational requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roarin 07&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mycougarconnection.com/homecoming/history.htm |title=Discover UH's Heritage &amp; History |publisher=UH Alumni Organization |accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071107164047/http://www.mycougarconnection.com/homecoming/history.htm |archivedate = November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first president of HJC was [[Edison E. Oberholtzer|Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer]], who was the dominant force in establishing the junior college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/OO/fob2.html |work=Handbook of Texas |title=Oberholtzer, Edison, Ellsworth |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:University of Houston in 1934.jpg|thumb|UH held its first classes at [[San Jacinto High School]] in 1934]]

===University beginnings===
The junior college became eligible to become a university in October 1933 when Governor Miriam A. Ferguson signed House Bill 194 into law.  On April 30, 1934, HISD's Board of Education adopted a resolution to make the school a four-year institution, and Houston Junior College changed its name to the University of Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roarin 07&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Roy Gustav Cullen Building.JPG|left|thumb|Built in 1938, the [[Roy G. Cullen Building]] is the first building on campus]]

UH's first session as a four-year institution began June 4, 1934, at San Jacinto High School with an enrollment of 682. In 1934, the first campus of the University of Houston was established at the Second Baptist Church at Milam and McGowen.  The next fall, the campus was moved to the South Main Baptist Church on Main Streetâbetween Richmond Avenue and Eagle Streetâwhere it stayed for the next five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roarin 07&quot; /&gt; In May 1935, the institution as a university held its first commencement at Miller Outdoor Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston 309&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Houston: The Unknown City: 1836â1946 |last=Johnston |first=Marguerite |year=1991 |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=0890964769 |page=309 |accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, philanthropists Julius Settegast and [[Ben Taub]] donated {{convert|110|acre|km2}} to the university for use as a permanent location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/first100/869592.html |title=Group of average students sparks UH creation |date=2001-04-08 |accessdate=2008-04-06 |work=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, there was no road that led to the land tract, but in 1937, the city added Saint Bernard Street, which was later renamed to Cullen&amp;nbsp;Boulevard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston 309&quot; /&gt;  It would become a major thoroughfare of the campus.  As a project of the National Youth Administration, workers were paid fifty cents an hour to clear the land.  In 1938, [[Hugh Roy Cullen]] donated $335,000 for the first building to be built at the location.  The [[Roy G. Cullen Memorial Building|Roy Gustav Cullen Memorial Building]], was dedicated on June 4, 1939, and classes began the next day.  The first full semester of classes began officially on Wednesday, September 20, 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roarin 07&quot; /&gt;

On March 12, 1945, Senate Bill 207 was signed into law, removing the control of the University of Houston from HISD and placing it into the hands of a board of regents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roarin 07&quot; /&gt; In 1945, the universityâwhich had grown too large and complex for the Houston school board to administerâbecame a private university. 
[[Image:Aerial view of the University of Houston (1950).JPG|right|thumb|University of Houston, circa 1950]]
In March 1947, the regents authorized creation of a law school at the university.  In 1949, the M.D. Anderson Foundation made a $1.5&amp;nbsp;million gift to UH for the construction of a dedicated library building on the campus. By 1950, the educational plant at UH consisted of 12 permanent buildings. Enrollment was more than 14,000 with a full-time faculty of more than 300.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; /&gt;  [[KUHF]], the university radio station, signed on in November. By 1951, UH was the second-largest university in the State of Texas and was the fastest growing university in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815555,00.html |title=Archangel in Houston |date=1951-10-15 |work=Time Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State university===
[[File:A.D. Bruce Religion Center.JPG|thumb|left|A.D. Bruce Religion Center, named after the university's third president]]
In 1953, the university established [[KUHT]]âthe first educational television station in the nationâafter the four-year long Federal Communications Commission's television licensing freeze ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; /&gt; During this period, however, the university as a private institution was facing financial troubles. Tuition failed to cover rising costs, and in turn, tuition increases caused a drop in enrollment. 

After a lengthy battle between supporters of the University of Houston, led by school president [[A.D. Bruce]],&lt;ref name=&quot;txarchives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uhua/00001/hua-00001.html |title=A.D. Bruce Speeches Collection, 1954â1961 |publisher=University of Texas Libraries |work=Texas Archival Resources Online (TARO) |accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forces from state universities geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; /&gt;

As the University of Houston celebrated its 50th anniversary, the Texas Legislature formally established the [[University of Houston System|University of Houston&amp;nbsp;System]] in 1977.  [[Philip G. Hoffman]] resigned from his position as president of UH and became the first chancellor of the University of Houston&amp;nbsp;System.  The University of Houston became the oldest and largest member institution in the UH&amp;nbsp;System with nearly 30,000 students.

On April 26, 1983, the university appended its official name to University of HoustonâUniversity Park; however, the name was changed back to University of Houston on August 26, 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;University of HoustonâUniversity Park&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Adair|first=Wendy|title=The University of Houston: Our Time: Celebrating 75 Years of Learning and Leading|year=2001|publisher=Donning Company Publishers|location= |isbn=978-1-57864-143-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;University of Houston&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/billlookup/History.aspx?LegSess=72R&amp;Bill=SB755|title=72(R) History for Senate Bill 755|publisher=Texas Legislature|work=Texas Legislature Online History |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This name change was an effort by the UH&amp;nbsp;System to give its flagship institution a distinctive name that would eliminate confusion with the University of {{nowrap|HoustonâDowntown}} (UHD), which is a separate and distinct degree-granting institution that is not part of the University of Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;University of HoustonâUniversity Park&quot;/&gt;

===Restructuring and growth===
[[File:Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music.JPG|thumb|Moores School of Music Building, constructed in 1997]]
In 1997, the UH System and the University of Houston administrations merged into a single governing entity. Arthur K. Smith, then the UH president, became the first person to hold both the UH System chancellorship and University of Houston presidency simultaneously.  As of the merger, the University of Houston System Administration has been located in the [[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]] on the university campus.

On October 15, 2007, [[Renu Khator]] was selected for the position of UH System chancellor and UH president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noted Political Science Scholar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Scholar and Administrator Selected as Sole Nominee

In January 2011, the University of Houston joined the ranks of the top research universities in the nation with the announcement by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching that placed UH in its top category of research universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tier One Research&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tier One Research 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tier One Research 3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tier One Research 4&quot;/&gt;  The designation makes UH one of only three {{nowrap|top-tier}} state research universities in Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tier One Research&quot;/&gt;  The university commemorated this milestone on January 28, 2011 with a &quot;Celebration of Excellence&quot; event on campus in recognition of the {{nowrap|top-tier}} research designation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tier One Research&quot;/&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:Ezekiel W. Cullen Building (Alternate).JPG|thumb|left|[[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]]]]
The campus of the University of Houston is located in southeast Houston, with an official address of 4800&amp;nbsp;Calhoun Road.  It was known as University of {{nowrap|HoustonâUniversity Park}} from 1983 to 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;University of HoustonâUniversity Park&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;University of Houston&quot;/&gt;  The campus spans {{convert|667|acre|km2|sing=on}} and is roughly bisected by Cullen&amp;nbsp;Boulevardâa thoroughfare that has become synonymous with the university.

The university campus includes numerous green spaces, fountains, and sculptures, including a work by famed sculptor [[Jim Sanborn]].  Renowned architects [[CÃ©sar Pelli]] and [[Philip Johnson]] have designed buildings on the UH campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uh.edu/uhtoday/2004/06jun/062804sanborn.html |title=Art that Speaks for Itself Enlightens New Sculpture |author=Vasquez, Leticia |publisher=University of Houston |work=UH Today |accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent campus beautification projects have garnered awards from the Keep Houston Beautiful group for improvements made to the Cullen&amp;nbsp;Boulevard corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uh.edu/uhtoday/2005/12dec/121505keephoustonbeautiful.html |title=UH Keeps Houston Beautiful |author=Parker, Francine |publisher=University of Houston |work=UH Today |accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Houston (UH) is not a {{nowrap|multi-campus}} university; it does not have a &quot;main&amp;nbsp;campus&quot; or any branch campus.  The University of {{nowrap|HoustonâClear Lake}} (UHCL), the University of {{nowrap|HoustonâDowntown}} (UHD), and the University of {{nowrap|HoustonâVictoria}} (UHV) are separate universities; they are not branch campuses of UH.

The seal of the University of Houston, officially adopted in 1938, is a stylized version of the coat-of-arms of General [[Sam Houston]].  The first official version was placed on the floor of the [[Roy Gustav Cullen Building]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uhcougars.cstv.com/trads/hou-trads.html |title=University of Houston Traditions |publisher=UH Athletics |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official colors of the University of Houston are scarlet red and albino white.  These were the colors of Sam Houston's ancestor, Sir Hugh, and were adopted by UH at the same time as the official seal.  Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the goodness and purity of spirit embodied in helping one's fellow man.

The school's official mascot is a [[cougar]], which was adopted in 1947 and later named [[Shasta (mascot)|Shasta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uh.edu/about/history/index.php http://uh.edu/about/history/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt; The university had a live cougar, but the tradition ended in 1989.

The [[Frontiersmen (University of Houston)|Frontiersmen]] is a group of students who participate in university events to drive school spirit.  At football games, the Frontiersmenâdonning cowboy hats, Wrangler Jeans, and [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]] for attireârun across the field with the university's flag and the Flag of Texas after each score.

[[Frontier Fiesta]]âa re-creation of a 19th-century Western town, with music, food and historical exhibitsâis a major event on campus each spring semester. The student led festival is a part of a long-standing tradition at UH dating back to the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Fiesta fun in full swing | work = The Daily Cougar | author = Allison Smith

The BLAZE is an oil field warning siren that was chosen to represent the universityâs ties to the petroleum industry.  The purchase of the siren was completed in 1991. The Sigma Chi Fraternity has been in charge of the siren and gave it the name âThe BLAZEâ in honor of its fallen brother, David Blazek.

[[Image:UoHcougarpaw.png|thumb|95px|Graphic representation of The Cougar Paw]]

===The Cougar Paw===
The Cougar Paw is a popular hand sign used by University of Houston students, faculty, alumni, and athletics fans to represent camaraderie and support.  The Cougar Paw tradition was adopted through several athletics events between the University of Houston and the University of Texas. 

The first time UH played UT in American football was in 1953.  Since this was their first meeting, members of [[Alpha Phi Omega]]âthe service fraternity in charge of taking care of [[Shasta (mascot)#Shasta I|Shasta&amp;nbsp;I]], the university's mascotâbrought her to the game.  During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off.  At the game, members of the opposing team discovered what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent.  UT went on to win this game 28â7, and UH students began using the sign as notice that they would remember the taunts.

During the second meeting with UT in 1968, the Houston Cougarsâholding up the now-adopted symbol of UH prideâplayed UT to a 20â20 tie. UH did not play UT again until 1976, the first year UH was a member of the [[Southwest Conference]].  In front of a record crowd, UH defeated UT 30â0.  This solidified the use of the Cougar Paw as a tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditions&quot; /&gt;
