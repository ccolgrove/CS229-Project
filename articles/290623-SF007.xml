'''Scribus''' is a [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) application, released under the [[GNU General Public License]] as [[free software]]. It is based on the free [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] toolkit, therefore native versions are available for [[Linux]], [[Unix]]-like operating systems, [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[OS/2]]. It is known for its broad set of page layout features, comparable to leading non-free applications such as [[Adobe PageMaker]], [[PagePlus]], [[QuarkXPress]] or [[Adobe InDesign]].

Scribus is designed for flexible layout and [[typesetting]] and the ability to prepare files for professional quality [[image]] setting equipment. It can also create [[animated]] and [[interactive]] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] presentations and forms. Example uses include writing small [[newspaper]]s, [[brochure]]s, [[newsletter]]s, [[poster]]s and [[book]]s.

An official Scribus [[User guide|manual]], published through FLES Books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flesbooks.com/scribus1.3manual/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100106230447/http://www.flesbooks.com/scribus1.3manual/ |title=Scribus 1.3 Official Manual|year=2009|accessdate=September 30, 2011|archivedate=January 6, 2010|publisher=FLES Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has been available since January 19, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flesbooks.com/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100117031927/http://www.flesbooks.com/|title=Welcome to FLES Books|year=2009|accessdate=September 30, 2011|archivedate=January 17, 2010|publisher=FLES Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capabilities==
Scribus supports most major [[image format]]s including [[Scalable Vector Graphics|scalable vector graphics]] (SVG). Professional type/image setting features include [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] colors and [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] [[color management]]. It has a built-in [[Scripting language|scripting engine]] using [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. It is available in more than 24 languages.

Printing is achieved using its own internal level 3 [[PostScript]] driver, including support for [[font]] embedding and sub-setting with [[TrueType]], [[Type 1 font#Font handling|Type 1]] and [[OpenType]] fonts. The internal driver supports full Level 2 PostScript constructs and a large subset of Level 3 constructs.

[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] support includes transparency, encryption and a large set of the PDF 1.4 spec as well as [[PDF/X]]-3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.scribus.net/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=pdfx3 |title=Scribus PDF/X-3 Overview |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including interactive PDFs form fields, annotations and bookmarks.

The file format, called SLA, is based on [[XML]]. Text can be imported from [[OpenDocument]] text documents, as well as [[SXW|OpenOffice.org Writer]], [[Microsoft Word]] and [[HTML]] formats (although some limitations apply).

Scribus cannot read or write the native file formats of commercial programs like [[QuarkXPress]], [[Microsoft Publisher]], or [[InDesign]]; the developers feel that [[reverse engineering]] those file formats would be prohibitively complex and could risk legal action from the makers of those programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.scribus.net/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=faq1#15 Scribus FAQ &quot;Why are there no import filters for Quark, Indesign or other commercial DTP applications?&quot;], scribus.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to licensing issues, the software package does not include support for the [[Pantone Matching System|Pantone color matching system (PMS)]], which is included in some commercial DTP applications.

Although Scribus supports [[Unicode]] character encoding, it currently does not properly support [[complex text layout|complex script rendering]] and so cannot be used with Unicode text for languages written with [[Arabic language#writing_system|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language#Writing_system|Hebrew]], [[Indic scripts|Indic]] and [[Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] [[writing system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=3965 Scribus Metabug 3965: Support for non-latin languages ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=1547 Scribus bug 1547: Support for Indic Scripts]&lt;/ref&gt;
