'''GNU Libtool''' is a [[GNU]] [[programming]] tool from the [[GNU build system]] used for creating portable compiled [[library (computer science)|libraries]]. To quote the introduction in the [http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html Libtool Manual]:
{{cquote|In the past, if a source code package developer wanted to take advantage of the power of [[shared libraries]], it was necessary to write custom support code for each platform on which the package ran. It was also necessary to design a configuration interface so that the package installer could choose what sort of libraries were built.

GNU Libtool simplifies the developer's job by encapsulating both the platform-specific dependencies, and the user interface, in a single script.  GNU Libtool is designed so that the complete functionality of each host type is available via a generic interface, but nasty quirks are hidden from the programmer.

GNU Libtool's interface aims to be consistent. Users are not expected to read low-level documentation in order to have a source package build shared libraries. They should only have to run the package's ''configure'' script (or equivalent), and Libtool should take care of the details.
|||[http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html Libtool Manual]}}

Libtool is typically used with [[Autoconf]] and [[Automake]], two other tools of the GNU build system.
