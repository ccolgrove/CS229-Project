General '''Sami Hafez Anan''' or '''Enan''' ({{lang-ar|Ø³Ø§ÙÙ Ø­Ø§ÙØ¸ Ø¹ÙØ§Ù}}, {{IPA-arz|ËsÃ¦Ëmi ËÄ§ÉËfezË¤ ÊÃ¦ËnÃ¦Ën, -ÊeËnÃ¦Ën|IPA}}; born 1948) is the [[Chief of Staff]] of the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]].  From 1990 to 1992 he was the Egyptain [[Defence AttachÃ©]] to Morocco.  More recently he served as the Commander of the [[Egyptian Air Defence Forces]] from 2001 to 2005. He serves as Deputy Chairman of the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]].

==2011 events==
When the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] began in January 2011, Anan was in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] &quot;for a week of meetings with senior American officers&quot;.&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/usa/US-Egypt-Military-Relationship-Might-Impact-Crisis-114979569.html US-Egypt Military Relationship Might Impact Crisis], ''[[Voice of America]]'', 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Cutting his visit short, he returned to [[Egypt]] on 28 January.&lt;ref name=VOA/&gt; As the commander of an army of 468,000 troops, he was considered likely to play a crucial role in the political uncertainty surrounding the protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=3652&amp;Cat=13&amp;dt=1/30/2011 Lt-Gen Sami Anan will have the final say], ''[[The News International]]'', January 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2011, the UK's [[Channel 4 News]] reported that the [[United States]] was pressing for Anan to play a role in coordinating interim arrangements for government in [[Egypt]] after [[Hosni Mubarak]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Rugman]], ''Channel 4 News'', 1 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As the protests built momentum into their second week, there was considerable speculation whether Enan, on one hand, was &quot;'too close to Mubarak to stay,' [per ...] [[Gawdat Bahgat]], a professor at [[National Defense University]] in Washington who has worked extensively with Egyptian officers attending the school,&quot; or, on the other, &quot;a trusted partner. Retired Army Lt. Gen. [[R. Steven Whitcomb]], who oversaw joint exercises with the Egyptian military while stationed in the Middle East, invited Enan and his wife to his home at [[Fort McPherson]] in Atlanta for a private dinner in 2007. According to Whitcomb, Enan complained about the effect that budget cuts were having on the military as the Mubarak administration dealt with political and economic problems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Whitlock, Craig and Greg Jaffe, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/04/AR2011020407140_2.html &quot;Where Egypt military's loyalties lie remains unclear&quot;], ''Washington Post'', February 4, 2011. Second Web page. Retrieved 2011-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] is the body of 18 senior military men, including Anan, to which the power to govern was handed by departing President Mubarak on February 11, 2011. Only [[Hussein Tantawi]] ranked ahead of Anan on the armed forces website and in the Council at that time, according to [[Al Jazeera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/111640/20110211/egypt-high-military-council-egypt-supreme-council-of-armed-forces.htm#ixzz1FHFcE9Bk &quot;Who is in Egypt's High Military Council?&quot;], ''International Business Times'', February 11, 2011 12:50 PM EST. Retrieved 2011-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessing U.S. views of Enan thereafter, particularly by way of the [[Wikileaks#Diplomatic cables release|Wikileaks]] releases, ''The Guardian'' newspaper saw Enan &quot;as more amenable to personal ties&quot; than the older, change-resistant and standoffish Tantawi. Also, the story said, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] &quot;has described [Enan] as incorruptible and as one of its cleric[s] put it: 'He can be the future man of Egypt â¦ I think he will be acceptable.'&quot; As the newspaper saw it, this gave the &quot;[[Egypt#Rebublic|Soviet]]-trained&quot; general an unusual span of support in the post-Mubarak government.&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Julian and James Ball, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/14/wikileaks-cables-egyptian-military-head &quot;WikiLeaks cables: Egyptian military head is 'old and resistant to change'&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 14 February 2011 10.41 GMT. Retrieved 2011-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
