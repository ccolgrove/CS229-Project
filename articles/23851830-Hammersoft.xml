The '''Menemen railway station''' ({{lang-tr|Menemen GarÄ±}}) is a train station in [[Menemen]]. The station is served by the [[Turkish State Railways]], the national rail carrier of [[Turkey]]. The station is serviced by 6 trains daily. Northbound trains go to either [[BandÄ±rma]], [[Ankara]], [[Afyon]] or [[UÅak]] and southbound trains all go to [[Alsancak Terminal]] in [[Ä°zmir]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495 TCDD Timetables] - TCDD Official Site&lt;/ref&gt;. North of the station, the [[double track]] branch line to [[AliaÄa]] splits from the main line, which becomes [[Single track (rail)|single track]]. The original station was built in 1866 by the [[Smyrna Cassaba Railway]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/SCP SCP History] - Trains and Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The station was opened in 1866, by the [[Smyrna Cassaba Railway]] (SCP). A passenger train from [[Basmane Terminal]] in [[Ä°zmir]] served the station to [[BandÄ±rma]] and [[UÅak]], then [[Afyon]]. The [[Republic of Turkey]] was formed in 1923 and the [[Turkish State Railways]] (TCDD) were formed in 1927 to nationalize Turkey's railways. SCP was absorbed by TCDD on June 1, 1934. TCDD rebuilt the station and broadened the tracks in 1938&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/TCDD TCDD History] - Trains and Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;. The line was made double track in 1975 and electrified with [[25 kV AC]] [[overhead wire]] in 2002. From 2006 to 2010 the Basmane-Ulukent section of the line in Ä°zmir was closed, due to the construction of the [[KarÅÄ±yaka Railway Tunnel]]. During this time the tracks in the station were used as a yard for passenger trains. When the line re-opened on May 19, 2010, the station was no longer used as a yard. The elevated platform section will be converted for use of the new Ä°zmir Commuter Rail system ([[Ä°ZBAN]]).
