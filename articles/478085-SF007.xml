'''Shen Congwen''' ({{zh|t=æ²å¾æ|s=æ²ä»æ|p=ShÄn CÃ³ngwÃ©n|w=Shen Ts'ung-wen}}, December 28, 1902âMay 10, 1988) was the pen name of a [[Miao people|Miao]] [[Zhonghua Minzu|Chinese]] writer from the [[May Fourth Movement]]. He was known for combining the vernacular style of writing with classical Chinese writing techniques, and his writing also reflects a strong influence from western literature.  He was born as '''Shen Yuehuan''' (æ²å²³ç¥) on 1902 December 28 in [[Fenghuang County]] (å¤å°å¿) in [[Hunan Province]].  He died on 1988 May 10 in [[Beijing]]. He is described as &quot;a novelist, short-story writer, lyricist and passionate champion of literary and intellectual independence.... Although almost entirely unknown to Western readers, Mr. Shen's oeuvre, much of it embued with the folklore and customs of his native western Hunan, has been compared to that of William Faulkner.&quot;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first=Edward A. |last=Gargan |title=Shen Congwen, 85, a Champion of Freedom for Writers in China |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/13/obituaries/shen-congwen-85-a-champion-of-freedom-for-writers-in-china.html |newspaper=New York Times |publisher= |date=13 May 1988 |accessdate=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shen was initially trained for a career in the military.  As a soldier in the Chinese army, he observed border fighting and the lives of the [[Hmong people|Miao]] tribesmen, which later became the subject matter of his early short fiction stories.  He began writing fiction in 1922 and wrote almost continually until 1949.  He taught [[Chinese literature]] at various universities during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] out of monetary necessity.

Originally an apolitical writer, he suffered a breakdown after the [[People's Republic of China|Communist Revolution]] in 1949 and the subsequent restrictions on writing.  He recovered by 1955, but he never again published another work of fiction.   He was given a staffing post at the [[Palace Museum]] at the Forbidden City in Beijing, about which he wrote a non-fiction work in 1957.  Afterwards, he also published a famous study of Chinese costume and dress.

''[[Changhe (novel)|Changhe]]'' (é¿æ²³, âThe Long Riverâ), written during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], is generally considered the best of his long fiction.
''[[Chundeng Ji]]'' (æ¥ç¯é, âLamp of Springâ) and ''[[Heifeng Ji]]'' (é»å¤é, âBlack Phoenixâ) are his most important collections of short stories.
&quot;The Border City&quot;, also known as &quot;The Frontier City&quot; (ãè¾¹åãæ¼é³ï¼Bian Cheng) is considered his masterworkï¼a beautifully written pastoral ode to love. This novel has been translated into nine different languages. It is now possible to visit his former residence in Fenghuang County.
