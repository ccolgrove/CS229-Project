The largest population of Pashtuns in the world are found in [[Pakistan]]. The Pashtuns are the second largest ethnic group in Pakistan, comprising 20% of Pakistan's population, with a population of 28 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_mother_tongue.pdf Population Census Organization, Government of Pakistan - Population by Mother Tongue]&lt;/ref&gt; They form the majority ethnic group in the province of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. However, this does not include the [[Afghan refugees]] who arrived to the country during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]]. The Pashtuns have considerable influence in the Pakistani politics, military, government, business and trade. [[Peshawar]] and [[Quetta]] are Pashtun dominated cities of Pakistan. With close to 1&amp;nbsp;million Pashtuns by some estimates,&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2009/07/karachis_invisi.html|title=Pakistan: Karachi's Invisible Enemy City potent refuge for Taliban fighters|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|date=July 17, 2009|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the province of [[Sindh]] hosts the largest Pashtun populations in the world outside [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province.

In addition, a small number of the Muhajir community (such as the [[Rohilla]] community) in Karachi claim to be by origin ethnic Pashtuns.

Substantial ethnic Pashtun communities outside of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] reside in the districts of [[Attock District|Attock]] (the [[Chhachi (Pashtun)|Chachi]]) and [[Mianwali District|Mianwali]] in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. These and other communities of Pashtun ancestry are often referred to as the [[Punjabi Pashtun]]. There are also large communities of Punjabi-Pashtuns in [[Kasur]], and other larger communities have settled around [[Multan]] which was formerly part of the [[Durrani Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Punjabi Musalmans'', by J. M. Wikely.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, a large portion of the [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speaking community in Pakistan trace their ancestry to the ancient pashtun regions of present day Afghanistan and Khyberpakhtunkhawa. A large community identify themselves as [[Yousefzai]] Pashtuns, Ghouri and Durrani. The [[medieval]] era Afghans forming the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate dynasties]] and [[Mughal Empire]] assimilated into the [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speaking community. It is estimated that over 30% of the Urdu-speaking community hold their ancestral roots to Pashtun heritage. Additionally, a significant number of descendants of [[Rohilla]]s migrated to Pakistan after the partition of India.

== India ==
{{See|Rohilla|Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathan of Bihar|Pathans of Gujarat|Pathans of Rajasthan}}
[[British Raj|India]], as a British colony, once had a large Pashtun population roughly equal to that of Afghanistan, mostly concentrated in what were then the British Indian provinces of the [[North-West Frontier Province]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]]. In Rohilkhand, they made large settlements subsequent to 14th century and prior to the 20th century. In fact, according to ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]'', the number of Pashtuns in all of India was nearly 31 million, but the speakers of Pashto numbered less than 14 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PAS_PER/PATHAN.html|title=Pathan|publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this population was allotted, along with its respective provinces, to Pakistan after the [[Partition of India]]. Today the Pashtuns in India can be divided into those who speak Pashto and those who speak Urdu, the latter group being much larger.

===Pashto-speaking communities===

There are a large number of Pashto-speaking Pakhtuns in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/05aug13/news.htm|title=Special focus on Gujjars, Paharis: CM|publisher=[[Daily Excelsior]]|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their exact numbers are hard to determine, it is at least in excess of 100,000 for it is known that in 1954 over 100,000 nomadic Pakhtuns living in Kashmir Valley were granted Indian
citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/20/stories/2004072001220900.htm|title=Pakhtoons in Kashmir|date=July 20, 1954|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2009-08-22|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[jirga]]s are frequently held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061030/asp/nation/story_6934322.asp|title=Justice rolls in Kashmir, Afghan-style|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those settled and living in the Kashmir Valley speak [[Pashto]], and are found chiefly in the southwest of the valley, where Pashtun colonies have from time to time been founded. The most interesting are the Kukikhel [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridis]] of Dramghaihama, who retain all the old customs and speak Pashto. They wear colorful dress and carry swords and shields. The [[Afridi]]s and the Machipurians, who belong to the [[Yusufzai]] tribe, are liable to military service, in return for which they hold certain villages free of revenue. The Pashtuns chiefly came in under the [[Durranis]], but many were brought by [[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharajah Gulab Singh]] for service on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.opf.org.pk/almanac/P/people.htm|title=Saiyids, Mughals, Pashtuns and Galawans|publisher=OPF|accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070515140617/http://www.opf.org.pk/almanac/P/people.htm |archivedate = 2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pashto is also spoken in two villages, Dhakki and Changnar (Chaknot), located on the [[Line of Control]] in [[Kupwara District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SIL&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silewp/2005/silewp2005-008.pdf|title=A First Look at the Language of Kundal Shahi in Azad Kashmir|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=2009â06â11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to demand by the Pashtun community living in the state, Kashir TV has recently launched a series of Pushto-language programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20001207/j&amp;k.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A further small, scattered Pashtun population still exists in some major cities of India with large Muslim populations, with the majority of [[Pashto]]-speaking individuals residing in the states of [[Delhi]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] India; who also have adopted local languages of the respective areas they live in, as their second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.isamasih-lucknow.org/3.html|title=Pathan|publisher=Isa-Masih in Lucknow|accessdate=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.4dw.net/royalark/India/rampur.htm|title=Rampur|publisher=Christopher Buyers|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Pathans, numbering around 14,161,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://crulp.org/Publication%5CCrulp_report%5CCR03_15E.pdf|format=PDF| title=Phonemic Inventory of Pashto|publisher=CRULP|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.htm Abstract of speakersâ strength of languages and mother tongues â 2001], ''Census of India'' (retrieved 17 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; have retained the use of the Pashto language and are still able to speak and understand it. This is partially because until recently, most of these Indian Pashtuns were able to travel to [[Pakhtunkhwa]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khyber&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.khyber.org/articles/2007/StudyofthePathanCommunitiesinF.shtml|title=Study of the Pathan Communities in four States of India|publisher=Khyber|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urdu-speaking communities===

{{See also|Muhajir people}}
The larger number of people claiming Pashtun ancestry in India are Urdu-speaking. Despite the loss of most of the [[British Raj|Raj]]-era Pashtun population, India still has a large community of Urdu-speaking Muslims who trace their ancestry to ancient Pashtun invaders and settlers. They are often referred by the [[Hindi-Urdu]] pronunciation of the word Pashtun, &quot;Pathan&quot;. However, because Pashto fluency has been lost, and a large degree of intermarriage with Indian locals has occurred throughout the centuries, such Pathans who are of Pakhtun decent, have however, retained their identity as Khan and are regarded distinguished among themselves as having the Pathan ancestry. The most famous among them are the [[Bollywood]] Khan actors. In addition, several other communities such as the [[Rajput]] [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] of Uttar Pradesh also use the surname Khan, though they are not Pathans. In [[Rohilkhand]] and the [[Bangash]]-dominated areas of [[Farrukhabad]], the term &quot;Pathan Khanzada&quot; refers to Rajput groups that have been incorporated into the Pashtun communities settled there. In addition to [[Uttar Pradesh]], the states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]] are also home to large communities of ancient Pashtuns settlers.&lt;ref&gt;''Hindustani Musalmans and Musalman of East Punjab'' by W. Bourne, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Major Indian Pathan tribes lived in the following areas. While many persons belonging to these tribes moved to the Afghan-Pakistan border, others chose to stay and thus, descendants of these tribes still reside in the parts of India listed below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.khyber.org/publications/001-005/pashtolangformation.shtml|title=Pashto Language &amp; Identity Formation|publisher=Contemporary South Asia, July 1995, Vol 4, Issue 2, p151,20 (Khyber)|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is significant to note that a large part of above Pathan diaspora have naturalized themselves in the local culture over the centuries.

The term &quot;Pathan&quot; does not refer exclusively and specifically to these Indian Pashtun descendants. Historically the term was used mainly to refer to Pashtuns in general by mainstream Indians Muslims included. Most Pashtuns, however, find the term to be insensitive and prefer to be called by their native label.

Today, around 10,808,000 individuals who claim Pathan descent reside in post-partition India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=IN&amp;rop3=107748|title=Pashtun, Northern of India|publisher=Joshua Project|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following delineates the population of Pathans in the [[List of Indian state and union territory capitals|states of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khyber&quot;/&gt;

Over 100,000 Pashtuns live in [[Iran]] as citizens of that country and a further sizable number live among the Afghan refugees. The Iranian Pashtuns are mainly concentrated in the Afghan-Iran border, in the [[South Khorasan]] Province of Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnologue-Iran&quot;/&gt;

About 300,000 Pashtuns immigrated to the Gulf Countries from 1976 to 1981, representing 35% of Pakistani immigrants.&lt;ref name=Jaffrelot&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pakistan: nationalism without a nation?|last1=Jaffrelot|first1=Christophe |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2002|publisher=Zed Books |location=|isbn=1842771175|page=27|pages=352|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I2avL3aZzSEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Southeast Asia ===
Since the early 1900s there have been many generations of Pashtuns who migrated from Afghanistan, Pakistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Pashtun settlements in [[Thailand]] have been common throughout the provinces. There is even a Thai-Pashtun Friendship Association. Because the Pashtuns are fiercely independent, they often are well treated and respected by the Thai locals. Countries like [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] also have similar cases of Pashtun settlements.
