==Career==
===Career beginnings===
Jones began acting professionally aged 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anna Shepard&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article556710.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|title=Not just anybody: Suranne Jones|first=Anna|last=Shepard|date=2005-08-20|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Billen of ''[[The Times]]'', while acknowledging her professional career beginnings at 16, noted that &quot;she took to the stage at 8&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article7029214.ece|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|title=What Suranne Jones did next|first=Andrew|last=Billen|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones later recalled that her first role was at the age of 8, in ''[[Wait Until Dark]]'' as Gloria.&lt;ref name=&quot;August 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/871515-suranne-jones-i-was-banned-after-saying-penis-on-stage|publisher=''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''|title=Suranne Jones: I was banned after saying 'penis' on stage|first=Andrew|last=Williams|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon joining the trade union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], Jones took on the [[stage name]] 'Suranne', as her birth name was already taken, and union rules dictate that each union member must have a different name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billen&quot;/&gt; Having secured herself an [[Talent agent|agent]] aged 15, she soon after began to act in the theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billen&quot;/&gt; Jones' television career began, however, in 1997, where she had a very small role in ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in April 1997 as Mandy Phillips, a girlfriend of Chris Collins. She was then cast in a television advert for [[Maltesers]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Crawford&quot;/&gt; guest starred in episodes of series such as ''City Central'' and had a small role in ''My Wonderful Life''. She auditioned for the role of [[Charity Dingle]] on the soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]'', becoming one of the final four actors considered for the part,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Crawford&quot;/&gt; though the role was eventually given to [[Emma Atkins]]. She also auditioned for the part of [[Geena Gregory]] on ''Coronation Street'', though she felt she knew [[Jennifer James]] would win the roleâwhich she didâupon seeing her at the auditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Crawford&quot;/&gt;

In 2000, some weeks after her unsuccessful audition for Geena Gregory, she was contacted by ''Coronation Street'' bosses, who offered her a part of a new character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Crawford&quot;/&gt; Jones took on the role of Karen Phillips (no relation to Mandy), making her first appearance on 21 June. The character, after marrying [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]], took on his surname, and became [[Karen McDonald]]. Described as &quot;a bulldog in hoop earrings&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; and a &quot;[[Victoria Beckham]] wannabe&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;/&gt; the role garnered Jones public attention, with episodes involving feuds between her and rival [[Tracy Barlow]] receiving millions of viewers; the episode featuring Karen and Steve's (second) wedding, ruined by Tracy Barlow's revelation that her daughter [[Amy Barlow]] was Steve's love child, received 16.3 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3271691/Bar-owner-Nick-Tilsley-to-be-probed-over-Corrie-tram-crash.html|publisher=''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''|title=Heat on Nick for Corrie's inferno|first=Lucy|last=Connolly|date=2010-12-11|accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2004 it was announced that she was to leave ''Coronation Street'' in the end of that year after four years of playing Karen. Jones described working on a soap opera as &quot;exhausting&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anna Shepard&quot;/&gt; remarking, &quot;I was living and breathing Karen McDonald&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anna Shepard&quot;/&gt; Jones made her last appearance as Karen on [[Boxing Day]] 2004.

Jones stated that upon her departure from ''Coronation Street'', she received numerous offers to appear in [[reality TV]] programmes, which she declined, quipping: &quot;lots of money to go off and [[I'm a Celebrity...
