==Cooking career==
Born in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Puttock trained at [[Box Hill Institute of TAFE]], and first worked at Caffe e Cucina in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]].&lt;ref&gt;Lethlen, John: [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/16/1092508353539.html Espresso - Kids in the kitchen], ''[[The Age]]'', 17 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Working around Australia, and eventually Europe, Puttock first met Jamie Oliver in 1999 at [[The River CafÃ© (London)|River CafÃ©]] in [[London]], where both of them worked for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Downie, Stephen: [http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,20403519-10388,00.html Jamie Oliver's kitchen mission], news.com.au, 13 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Puttock returned to Melbourne, where he set up his own Italian restaurant, Termini, and appeared as a regular guest chef on the Australian version of ''[[Ready Steady Cook (Australian TV series)|Ready Steady Cook]]'', a cooking game show based on a British format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ten.com.au/ten/tv_readysteadycook.html Ready Steady Cook], [[Network Ten]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, he was contacted by Oliver, now a well-known celebrity chef, who asked for his help in setting up a training restaurant for underprivileged young people. Puttock returned to London, and helped Oliver set up the first [[Fifteen restaurants|Fifteen restaurant]] in [[Hoxton]], [[London]]. The creation of the restaurant and training scheme formed the basis of a 2002 TV series on [[Channel 4]], ''[[Jamie's Kitchen]]''. Puttock remained at Fifteen as executive head chef for several years, until homesickness prompted him to suggest to Oliver that they set up an Australian version of Fifteen in his hometown of Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;McManus, Bridget: [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/if-you-cant-stand-the-heat-get-out-of-jamies-kitchen/2006/09/08/1157222328986.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 If you can't stand the heat, get out of Jamie's Kitchen], ''[[The Age]]'', 9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver agreed, and in 2006, a follow-up series ''[[Jamieâs Kitchen Australia]]'' was shown on Australia's [[Network Ten]], which chronicled the establishment of Fifteen Melbourne and the training of its staff. Puttock is now executive head chef of the Melbourne restaurant.
