'''Disney Channel Eastern and Central Europe''' is a children's television channel owned by [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] broadcast in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]] and other countries. It was previously known as '''[[Fox Kids]]''', then Jetix. It is broadcast simultaneously in seven languages (using [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] audio technology): [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[English language|English]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]],and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. Advertising is shown in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Russian language|Russian]].

==History==
* February, 1999 - Fox Kids launches in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Bulgaria]] (Russian Version)
* November 2000 - Fox Kids launches in [[Hungary]].
* February 2001 - Fox Kids launches in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].
* January 1, 2005 - Fox Kids is rebranded as [[Jetix (CEE)|Jetix]].

On August 11, 2008 Jetix started broadcasting a block of &quot;Disney stars&quot; in Romania and Bulgaria&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telemaniac.com/jetix-bgro ''ÐÐ¶ÐµÑÐ¸ÐºÑ ÑÐµ ÑÐ²ÐµÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ¸ Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐµ Ð½Ð° ÐÐ¸ÑÐ½Ð¸ Ð² ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¸ Ð ÑÐ¼ÑÐ½Ð¸Ñ'' (translation: ''Jetix to air more Disney programming in Romania'') (in Bulgarian); retrieved August 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;, featuring the series [[Kim Possible]], [[Phineas and Ferb]], [[American Dragon]] and [[Hannah Montana]]. [[High School Musical]] aired on August 22, 2008 and [[High School Musical 2]] aired on November 1, 2008. It was fully dubbed into Romanian, and an old Bulgarian translation of Kim Possible (once aired on [[BNT Channel 1]]) was made available on October 20, 2008. High School Musical 2 was also dubbed. Subsequently, Phineas and Ferb and American Dragon were also dubbed by Media Link using voice-over dubbing (unlike all pre-2005 Disney cartoon series, which were all dubbed with synchronized voices). This way of dubbing is very common in Bulgarian television, because it costs less and takes less time to produce (as the voices of actors are just placed directly over a quieted original voice track). Usually, only theatrically or home video-released animated films are dubbed with synchronized voices, and in the 1990s only Disney's animated series were dubbed this way for television. Only starting in 2008, Disney allowed Bulgarian broadcasters to dub films themselves, and all of them were using voice-over dubbing.

After [[Disney XD]] successfully launched on February 13, 2009 in the US, the [[Disney-ABC Television]] Group re-branded Jetix France to Disney XD on April 1, 2009 and it was expected to be rolled out to other European territories in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney XD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=14241|title=French Jetix becomes Disney XD|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney XD2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c21media.net/resources/detail.asp?area=79&amp;article=47666|title=Jetix France rebrands as Disney XD
|publisher=[[C21 Media]]|date=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, Disney announced that the Jetix channel in certain countries (namely [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Bulgaria]]) will be renamed to [[Disney Channel]], marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. The change happened at September 19, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney Channel&quot;&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=18685 Jetix to become Disney] - ''Broadband TV News'', by Chris Dziadul, published and retrieved: 2009-05-26&lt;/ref&gt; Disney Channel Romania &amp; Bulgaria are broadcast as a single video feed with two audio channels and  there is also a Russian audio channel.

On September 19, 2009, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in [[Bulgaria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Moldova]], [[Romania]] and [[Slovakia]]. But the Russian feed was still broadcasting under the Jetix name til it was announced that a separate Disney Channel would launch.

On August, 10, 2010, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in [[CIS]].
On October, 16, 2010 Ukrainian version of channel was launched. Disney Channel Ukraine is based on Romanian version of Disney Channel.

Fox Kids, then Jetix, now Disney Channel has been available in all cable operators in Bulgaria since around 1999 and was mostly broadcast with either the Russian or English language audio track. In October 2007, Bulgarian audio track has added to for some of the shows on Jetix. The Jetix was previously shown in Bulgaria on [[bTV (Bulgaria)|bTV]], which continued to air a Jetix block even after Fox Kids was sold to Disney.Translation and distribution for the channel's Bulgarian version was handled by [[Media Link]]. It was expected that the channel would reach 100% translation of its shows in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jetixeurope.com/site/press_office/press_releases/bulgaria_localisation.html&lt;br /&gt;''Jetix begins localisation of its Bulgarian Channel'' - 31 October 2007 ''(retrieved on November 14, 2007)''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was achieved only in early 2009, with many shows being withheld from broadcast after February 2009 until translation of their episodes was completed. In May and June many such programs  were returned to the channel, since translation had advanced a lot. [[Hannah Montana]] was the only untranslated show, however it was available in Bulgarian on [[BNT 1]] since March 28, 2009.Promos aired in English and not in Bulgarian.
[[Jetix (Russia)|Jetix in Russia]] was based on this channel, but all things related to Disney were automatically replaced with Jetix promos. Certain shows which then did not air on the regular Jetix CEE ([[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]], [[Iggy Arbuckle]]) were part of the hour-and-a-half long programming block that replaced the Disney block. When Jetix CEE was changed to Disney Channel, the Russian language transmission ceased. [[Jetix (Russia)|Jetix Russia]] continued to exist as a separate channel til August 10, 2010.&lt;!--This version of '''Jetix''' was also available in other countries: [[Moldova]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Belarus]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]] etc.--&gt;
