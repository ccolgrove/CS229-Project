'''Garfield''' is a [[fictional character]] and the title [[protagonist]] from the comic strip ''[[Garfield]]'' created by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]].

==Character==
===Personality===
Garfield is an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] ginger [[cat]]. He loves eating (especially [[lasagna]]), and sleeping. He is teased about being [[overweight]]. He is also [[selfish]]. For example in one strip his owner, [[Jon Arbuckle|Jon]] stubs his toe and Garfield comforts him, however he says &quot;It's not like it happened to me.&quot; In one [[Garfield and Friends]] episode, it is shown that there are three things that Garfield does not eat. A snail, a raisin, and fruitcakes. He is best friends with [[Odie]], but torments him occasionally, along with Jon. He hates Mondays, and is often struck by bad luck in Monday comic strips. He is also jealous of a gray [[Tabby_cat|tabby]] kitten named [[List_of_Garfield_series_characters#Nermal|Nermal]], often trying to mail him to [[Abu_Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]].

He enjoys performing at the wooden fence next to Jon's house in the middle of the night, although he is usually criticized. He can't stand [[spider]]s, and although he doesn't chase mice (unless bribed to do so), he is often seen trying to eat birds (usually without success). He frequently destroys Jon's curtains and ferns, as well as the flowerbeds of Jon and their neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. He detests being taken to the vet. In one strip sequence in 1986, their home address is revealed that Garfield, Jon and Odie live in 711 Maple Street. However, in ''[[Garfield in Paradise]]'', Garfield's fantasy dream had a cat named Mike say that he's from &quot;Lost Wages&quot; (Vegas), [[Nevada]] (this was a fantasy), and in a ''Garfield and Friends'' episode of the second season, Jon is running from a [[Chicago]] airport. In the TV special ''[[Garfield Gets a Life]]'', Jon's car is revealed to have an [[Vehicle registration plates of Indiana|Indiana vehicle registration plate]] at the end of the [[episode]], indicating that they live in Indiana. In ''[[Garfield Goes Hollywood]]'', while Jon, Odie and Garfield are on Pet Search, the announcer says that they're from [[Muncie, Indiana]]. This is possibly because [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] is from Indiana, and [[Paws, Inc.]] is located in Muncie. 

Although Garfield is typically depicted as having little imagination, in one [[Garfield and Friends]] episode he was shown to have a great imagination when he imagined himself, by use of a cardboard box, as being in a plane, racecar and life-raft floating on the open sea, in that order and was shown on many other occasions to have a vivid imagination. In the Garfield and Friends episode &quot;D.J. Jon,&quot; Garfield is shown to dislike [[disk jockey|disk jockeys]]. In the life-raft, he pictured [[Odie]] as a savage killer whale. He was also depicted with an imagination in other episodes, including one episode inspired by monster movies where he eventually chases away Jon's date, and in the special Garfield's Feline Fantasies. He also once said in the episode The Hound of The Arbuckles that he prefers to use his imagination for dreams rather than reading books.

Though he often treats Jon and Odie horribly, it is indicated that he does indeed care for them. This is prominent in ''[[Here Comes Garfield]]'', and the two live-action films, ''[[Garfield: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties]]''. It is learned in the last episode of the ''Garfield Shorts'' shown on TV, in the episode ''[[Garfield Gets a Life]]'' that his favorite TV show is named and about a dog named &quot;Yukon Stinky&quot;. 

Garfield &quot;speaks&quot; through thought bubbles, and even though other animals can understand him, Jon generally cannot (although Jon is quite frequently shown having what looks like a conversation with Garfield's thoughts and has often guessed Garfield's thoughts verbatim). At rare moments, Jon's reaction imply he's hearing Garfield's thoughts, and he even declares that in one strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | work = Garfield.com | url = http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=1992&amp;addr=920121|date = 1992-01-21 | accessdate = 2011-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, after Jon states what he believes Garfield to be thinking (that he wants food), Garfield corrects him by stating that, for example, his car's on fire. However in The TV series ''Garfield and Friends'' Jon (and other humans) hear Garfield's thoughts much more frequently, even having conversations with them if Jon seems to be &quot;listening.&quot; Certain episodes, such as a lecture about Odie, shows the human audience hearing everything Garfield thinks.

Garfield doesn't wear a collar or I.D. tag, but in the episode 'T3000' of [[the Garfield Show]], he is identified with a microchip identity number of 3435BT-37Z22. Garfield used to smoke too, though it appears only in two early strips, where Garfield smokes Jon's pipe.

==Name==
Jim Davis named Garfield after his grandfather, James Garfield Davis, who was named after President [[James A. Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressroom.garfield.com/jim_bio/index.html |title=Jim Davis: The Man Behind the Cat |publisher=Pressroom.garfield.com |date=1978-06-19 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with Jim Davis in the second Garfield compilation book, ''[[Garfield Gains Weight: His Second Book|Garfield Gains Weight]]'', the name &quot;Garfield&quot; makes him think of &quot;...a fat cat...or a St. Bernard...or a neat line of thermal underwear.&quot; Due to the enormous popularity of the strip, many families have named their cats &quot;Garfield&quot; after the famous cat{{citation needed|date= April 2011}}.

==History==
[[File:Garfield the Cat.jpg|thumb|Garfield, as portrayed on the back cover of ''[[Garfield At Large]]''.]]
Garfield was born June 19, 1971, in the kitchen of Mamma Leoni's Italian Restaurant and loved [[Lasagna]] the day he was born. Ever since then, it has always been his favorite food.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Garfield: His 9 Lives]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to his grandfather, he was born five pounds, six ounces (He was out of town at the time, and when Garfield asks how, his grandfather said he heard the scream), surprisingly enough, he managed to fit in a tiny bed. Later in his life, Garfield accidentally runs across his mother again one Christmas Eve, and meets his other grandfather for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Garfield on the Town]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In June 18, 1978, when Jon came to the store, he had to choose between Garfield, an iguana, and a [[pet rock]]. In his cartoon appearances, Garfield usually causes mischief in every episode. In June 1983, [[comic strips]] introduced Amoeba Man, one of Garfield's alter-egos, yet he was only shown in 6 strips (6-20 through 6-25). In February 2010, another alter ego was introduced called Super Garfield, and his sidekick Odieboy (Odie). Amoeba Man, and Super Garfield are only two of his few imaginary alter egos though, his most common one being the Caped Avenger. And for a very short period of time, Garfield would fall prey to various dogs e.g. Bungee Dog, Warm up dog etc. which would squish him in any direction. It is also given that Garfield uses the &quot;[[litter box|sandbox]]&quot; on occasion, such as in one 1978 strip, he says he hates commercials because they're too short for a trip to the sandbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=1978&amp;addr=780804 |title=8-4-1978 strip |publisher=Garfield.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed on October 27, 1979 that he doesnât like [[raisin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=1979&amp;addr=791027 |title=10-27-79 strip |publisher=Garfield.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His birthday is 1978-06-19, the day the first ''Garfield'' strip was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | url = http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&amp;addr=060619 | work = Garfield.com | date = 2006-06-19 | accessdate = 2011-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | work = Garfield.com | accessdate = 2006-08-07 | url =

Garfield frequently gets into many adventures, such as getting stuck in roll-up shades, sparring with mice, and getting locked up in animal shelters. In 2005, Garfield and Jon appeared in several comic strips of [[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]] in honor of their 75th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2005_08_21.html |title=Blondie |publisher=Newsfromme.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield got excited because he didn't have to [[thought bubble|think]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2005&amp;addr=050820 |title=8-20-05 strip |publisher=Garfield.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an earlier Blondie crossover on the Garfield strip published April 1, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | work = Garfield.com | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | date = 1997-04-01 | url = http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=1997&amp;addr=970401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
