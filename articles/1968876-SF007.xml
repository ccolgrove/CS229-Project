A '''video game clone''' is a [[video game]] or game series which is very similar to or heavily inspired by a previous popular game or game series. Some [[video game genres]] are founded by such archetypal games that all subsequent similar games are thought of as derivatives.

The term is sometimes derogatory, implying a lack of originality, however clones can be anything from a pure &quot;[[ripoff]]&quot;, to a legitimate derivative or improvement on the original or even a [[homage]].

==History==
In the early video game industry, making a clone of a game was not illegal{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, provided that no outright copyright violation or trademark infringement occurred. As the gaming market grew large developers gained the ability to sue the developers of clones which were too similar to originals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted By: Ed |url=http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=2712 |title=Nintendo Cracks Down on Game Clones&lt; |publisher=Palminfocenter.com |date=2001-12-04 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Look and feel]] lawsuits, such as the one [[Capcom]] filed against [[Data East]] over the game ''[[Fighter's History]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dannenberg |first=Ross |url=http://www.patentarcade.com/2005/08/case-capcom-v-data-east-nd-cal-1994-c.html |title=Case: Capcom v.

With the adoption of [[software patent]]s in some countries, e.g. in the [[United States]] in the 1990s, clone games are at far greater legal risk.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

At times, games can be considered clones by the uninformed gamer if they resemble a modern popular game regardless of whether or not the game that has been &quot;cloned&quot; was completely original or not. An example of this is the way the majority of [[isometric projection|isometric]] RPG titles are considered clones of Blizzard's popular [[Diablo (computer game)|Diablo]] game, despite the fact that Diablo did not pioneer this style of gameplay and was in itself heavily influenced by [[Ultima VIII]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Early arcade games such as [[Space Invaders]] have been cloned very widely especially in 1980s and still in early 1990s. Most clones have been published by [[freeware]] computer game designers, but there have also been many commercially released clone games. Freeware-released versions have often been almost exact copies of earlier games, with only some minor elements and possibly the game's title changed.

The [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora operating system]] will not include any [[rhythm game]]s (for example ''[[Frets on Fire]]'' and ''[[Stepmania]]'') that may infringe on patents in ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' or ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-games-list/2008-January/msg00022.html Redhat.com Patent concerns]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous titles by [[Jeff Minter]] were clones of arcade games in which graphics were turned from the original robot/spaceship graphics to animal creatures.

== Notable cloned games ==
* [[Arkanoid]]. The [[1987 in video gaming|1987]] release of the computer conversion of this arcade game - which is itself a clone - triggered a flood of clones made for leading home computers of the day.
* The success of the [[Grand Theft Auto series]] has led to [[GTA clone|many clones]].
* [[Commando (video game)|Commando]] ([[1985 in video gaming|1985]]), a vertical scrolling [[shoot 'em up]], produced many clones such as [[Ikari Warriors]], Rambo II, [[Dogs of War (computer game)|Dogs of War]], Leatherneck, Battle Isle.
* [[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]] ([[1987 in video gaming|1987]]) was the first 3D-roleplaying game (though early [[Ultima (video game series)|Ultima]] games contained similar dungeons). It was followed by many clones, though it took few years before the clones really start coming. Some of the clones took the game idea to a science fiction setting but most of them remained in fantasy world.
* [[Tetris]] has been ported to all but the most obscure platforms, often under different non-infringing names. See [[Tetris variants]].
* In the 1990s, [[first person shooter]]s were called [[Doom clone|''Doom''-clones]]. Doom ([[1993 in video gaming|1993]]) itself was the spiritual sequel to [[Wolfenstein 3D]] ([[1992 in video gaming|1992]]), by the same designers.
* [[Great Giana Sisters]] ([[1987 in video gaming|1987]]), famous platform game for late 1980s home computers, was a [[Super Mario Bros]] clone to the extent that its publisher was threatened to be taken to court and the game was withdrawn from market.
* [[Warcraft]] was originally a [[Dune II]] clone being a second game of the new genre.
* [[World of Warcraft]] has been cloned multiple times, commonly by companies that allow their games to be downloaded freely on the internet. Popular examples are [[Runes of Magic]] or [[Neo steam]].
* [[Guitar Freaks]] has spawned a great number of clones: [[Guitar Hero (2005 video game)|Guitar Hero]], [[Frets On Fire]], Freetar, Guitar Zero and Flash Hero are the more notable ones. &lt;!--Guitar Hero may have the same concept, but is in no ways a clone of GuitarFreaks. Either way, RedOctane wouldn't expand the concept of guitar playing in a video game, as GH does not look like a Beat Mania with guitars like GF does.--&gt;
* Famous early [[arcade game]]s were cloned often, especially by freeware game designers
** [[Asteroids (computer game)|Asteroids]] (clones include ''[[Stardust (video game)|Stardust]]'', ''[[Sinistar]]'', ''[[Comet Busters!]]'', and [[Minestorm]], which was built into the notable [[Vectrex]] console)
** [[Defender (game)|Defender]] (clones include [[Star Ray]], [[Attack of the Mutant Camels]], [[Datastorm]])
** [[Gravitar (arcade game)|Gravitar]] (clones include [[Thrust (computer game)|Thrust]], [[Gravity Force]], [[OIDS]])
** [[Pac-Man]] (clones include [[Munch Man]] (the most popular [[TI-99/4A]] game) and countless others)
** [[Space Invaders]] (clones include [[Galaga]], [[Phoenix (arcade game)|Phoenix]], [[TI Invaders]])
** [[Missile Command]] (clones include [[Liberator (arcade game)|Liberator]], [[Bio-ship Paladin]])
** [[Qix]] (clones include [[Gals Panic]], [[Xonix]], [[JezzBall]])
** [[Tron (arcade game)|Tron]] (clones include [[Armagetron Advanced]], [[GLtron]])
