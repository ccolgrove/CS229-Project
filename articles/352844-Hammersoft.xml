The '''Palace of the Parliament''' ({{lang-ro|Palatul Parlamentului}}) in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] is a multi-purpose building containing both chambers of the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]]. According to the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], the Palace is the world's largest civilian administrative building, most expensive administrative building, and heaviest building.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Palace was designed and nearly completed by the [[Communist Romania#The CeauÅescu regime|CeauÈescu regime]] as the seat of political and administrative power. [[Nicolae CeauÈescu]] named it the '''House of the Republic''' ('''Casa Republicii'''), but many Romanians call it the '''People's House''' ('''Casa Poporului''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Palatul Parlamentului / Casa Poporului | publisher=miculparis.ro | url =http://www.miculparis.ro/turistice/turul_bucurestiului/casa_poporului.html |  pages = 1 | language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has 1,100 rooms, 2 underground parking garages and is 12 stories tall, with four underground levels currently available for the general public and in use, and another four in different stages of completion. The floorspace is {{convert|340000|m2|abbr=on}}.

The structure combines elements and [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] from multiple [[architectural style|sources]], in an eclectic [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architectural style. The building is constructed almost entirely of materials of Romanian origin. Estimates of the materials used include one million cubic meters of [[marble]] from [[Transylvania]], most from [[RuÅchiÅ£a]]; 3,500 tonnes of [[Lead crystal|crystal]] â 480 chandeliers, 1,409 ceiling lights and mirrors were manufactured; 700,000 tonnes of [[steel]] and [[bronze]] for monumental doors and windows, [[chandelier]]s and [[capital (architecture)|capitals]]; {{convert|900000|m2|abbr=on}} of wood, over 95% of which is domestic, for [[parquet]] and [[wainscoting]], including [[walnut]], [[oak]], [[cherry|sweet cherry]], [[elm]], [[sycamore maple]]; {{convert|200000|mÂ²|abbr=on}} of [[wool]]en [[carpet]]s of various dimensions, the larger of which were woven on-site by machines moved into the building; [[velvet]] and [[brocade]] curtains adorned with [[embroidery|embroideries]] and [[tassel|passementeries]] in [[silver]] and [[gold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotocommunity.de/pc/pc/cat/2861/display/3175968 Romania: Inside the Palace of Parliament&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Built on the site of a hill variously known as [[Dealul Spirii|Spirii Hill, Uranus Hill, or Arsenal Hill]], which was largely razed for this [[megaproject]], the building anchors the west end of [[Bulevardul Unirii]] and [[Centrul Civic]]. Constructing the Palace and Centrul Civic required [[CeauÅima|demolishing much of Bucharest's historic district]], including 19 Orthodox Christian churches, six Jewish synagogues, three Protestant churches (plus eight relocated churches), and 30,000 residences.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Construction began in 1983; the [[cornerstone]] was laid on 25 June 1984. While the building was intended to house all four major state institutions (in a similar manner to the UK [[Houses of Parliament]]), Ceausescu intended the palace to be his personal residence and the government was to operate in it (as if combining the Kremlin into one building). It was intended to house these institutions:
*'''The [[President of Socialist Romanian Republic|Presidency of the Republic]]''' ('''PreÅedinÅ£ia Republicii''') - today's '''[[President of Romania|Presidency]]''' ('''PreÅedinÅ£ia''');
*'''The [[Great National Assembly]]''' ('''Marea Adunare NaÅ£ionalÇ''') - today's '''[[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]''' ('''Parlamentul''');
*'''Consiliul de MiniÅtri''' - today's '''[[Government of Romania|Government]]''' ('''Guvernul''');
*'''[[Supreme Court of Romania|Supreme Court]]''' ('''Tribunalul Suprem''') - today's '''[[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|High Court of Cassation and Justice]]''' ('''Ãnalta Curte de CasaÅ£ie Åi JustiÅ£ie''').
This explains the building's rectangular shape.

At the time of [[Nicolae CeauÅescu]]'s 1989 overthrow and execution, the building structure and design were complete.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Subsequently, many of the furnishings were never installed (mostly evident because of the many large, empty spaces throughout the palace), while the last three basement levels and a large clock tower (that would display the official Romanian time) were never finished. During the regime change, the new leaders of Romania referred to the building as the '''House of CeauÅescu''', to highlight the excessive luxury in which CeauÅescu would have lived, in stark contrast to the squalor and poverty endured by many people living in the surrounding neighborhoods.

Parts of the building (some of the west wing, some of the east wing, parts of the second floor, basement 3 and everything below) are yet to be completed. Currently, a new underground car-park is being built inside a former stadium, currently used as a warehouse, which was covered during the construction of the palace. Tunnels linking 13 Septembrie Avenue with the basement of the building are planned to be built. It is said that CeauÅescu had built bunkers under the building where he would hide in case of a revolution.

==History since 1989==
{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}
Since 1997, the building has housed [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Romania's Chamber of Deputies]], which had previously been housed in the [[Palace of the Chamber of Deputies|Palace of the Patriarchy]]; the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]] joined them there in 2005, having previously been housed in the former Communist Party Central Committee building. The Palace also contains a massive array of miscellaneous conference halls, salons, etc. used for a wide variety of other purposes.

In 2003-2004 a glass annex was built{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, alongside external elevators. This was done to facilitate access to the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MNAC) opened in 2004 inside the west wing of the Palace of the Parliament, and to the Museum and [[Park of Totalitarianism and Socialist Realism]], also opened in 2004.

The [[cafeteria]] for use of the legislators has been refurbished&lt;!--when? &quot;Recently&quot; becomes less true every day--&gt;.
Also in the building is the headquarters of the [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative]] (SECI), an organization focused on regional cooperation among governments against cross-border crime.

There are public tours organized in a number of languages.

In 2008, the Palace hosted the [[2008 Bucharest summit|20th NATO summit]].

==In popular culture==
In 2002, [[Costa Gavras]] shot scenes of the film ''[[Amen. (film)|Amen]]'' in the Palace, meant to represent the Vatican.

In 2009, the Palace appeared in Episode 1, [[Top Gear (series 14)|Series 14]] of the [[BBC]] motoring programme ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', where the presenters, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] (in an [[Aston Martin DBS V12#DBS Volante|Aston Martin DBS Volante]]), [[Richard Hammond]] (in a [[Ferrari California]]) and [[James May]] (in a [[Lamborghini Gallardo#LP 560-4 Spyder .282008-.29|Lamborghini LP560-4 Spyder]]) had a [[Global navigation satellite system|&quot;Sat-Nav&quot;]] race to the Palace, and are then shown driving throughout its underground tunnels and garages.
