'''[[Hugh Grant]]''''s acting career has spanned over two decades.  Besides gaining immense fame and commercial success, Grant has been bestowed with various '''awards and honours''' worldwide.  He is known for giving witty and irreverent acceptance speeches.  His accolades include, but are not limited to, the following:

In 2005, Grant became one of the first 100 stars honoured at the '''[[Avenue of Stars, London|Avenue of Stars]]''' in central [[London]].  His name is represented by a silver star set into the pavement outside [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's Church]], known as the Actors' church, in [[Covent Garden|Covent Garden Piazza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4258080.stm |title=Stars light up UK's Walk of Fame |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-09-19 |accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Grant was awarded '''Star of the Year Award''' at the ShowEast Convention on October 11, 2002.  Presenting the award, [[Sandra Bullock]] revealed that &quot;on a set of hundreds of people, he knew everybodyâs name.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;showeast award&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |title= Grant Granted ShowEast Award |url=http://www.natoonline.org/infocus/02December/datelineex.htm |publisher= In Focus |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2007-09-22 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dan Fellman, [[Warner Bros.]]'s president of distribution, said:  &lt;blockquote&gt;
It's a great honor to have the industry pay tribute to Hugh Grant for the sheer enjoyment and delight he has brought to moviegoers worldwide during his most extraordinary career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117873338.html?categoryid=1237&amp;cs=1&amp;query=hugh+grant+%2B+award |title=ShowEast greets Grant |last=Diorio |first=Carl |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2002-09-22 |accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Sandra Bullock was once again chosen to present Grant with the prestigious '''Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film'''.  The honour was bestowed on November 8, 2003 by [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts#Awards presented in Los Angeles|BAFTA/LA]].  Grant received the award saying that it was &quot;very very nice and unusual for me, I don't really get many prizes and when I do I'm cockahoop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3254891.stm |title=Actor Grant handed Kubrick award |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2003-11-09 |accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts#Awards presented in Los Angeles|BAFTA/LA]] chairman, Gary Dartnall, said Grant was chosen because:  &lt;blockquote&gt;
His talent and keen intelligence have distinguished him as one of the best and brightest in contemporary cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117891948.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1&amp;query=hugh+grant+%2B+bafta |title=Grant BAFTA/L.A.'s pick for Kubrick nod |last=Lyster |first=Lauren |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2003-09-04 |accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In 2002, Grant was declared one of the '''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] [http://digitalfreeway.com/gqhome/winners/winners02.html# Men of the Year]'''.  He was featured on the magazine's November cover with [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Ralph Lauren]].  Grant was honoured as Man of the Year in comedy for his performance in ''[[About a Boy (film)|About a Boy]]'', according to the magazine, because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the hands of a lesser actor, the redemption of said cad - an indolent snake who preys on single mothers - would have been a mechanical affair.  Instead, About a Boy was the year's great surprise, due in part to Hugh Grant's performance - probably the finest of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;GQ man of the year&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= ''Hugh Grant'' Film Actor, Comedy |publisher= [[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] |page=325 |date=November [[2002]] |accessdate=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1995, after winning his '''Golden Globe''' award for Best Actor in a motion picture Comedy, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Grant &quot;made a gentle mockery of all the humble thank-you speeches at such events&quot; and &quot;brought down the house.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;95 Globe speech&quot;/&gt;

With mock gratitude, Grant said: &quot;It's tragic how much I'm enjoying getting this. It's heaven. Right up my alley. I can't tell the Foreign Press Association how much I admire them.&quot;  Referring to his agent in London, who got him the role in ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', he deadpanned: &quot;He's extremely small and extremely vicious.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;95 Globe speech&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=In Hollywood, a Party Is a Party, And an Awards Show Is Even Better |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D61131F930A15752C0A963958260 |page=11 |date=1995-01-23 |accessdate=2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' in 1994, Grant's wax sculpture was featured at [[Madame Tussauds]] in [[London]].  Wax figures of him are also at display in the Glamor Hall of Madame Tussauds [[Hong Kong]], the Madame Tussauds Interactive Wax Museum in [[New York]]'s [[Times Square]], with a third one in [[Shanghai]].
