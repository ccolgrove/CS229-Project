'''Spaghetti''' is a long, thin, cylindrical [[pasta]] of [[Italy|Italian]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;dict&quot;&gt;spaghetti. Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/spaghetti (accessed: June 03, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Spaghetti is made of [[semolina]] or flour and [[water]]. Italian dried spaghetti is made from [[durum]] wheat [[semolina]], but outside of Italy it may be made with other kinds of [[flour]]. Traditionally most spaghetti was {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the latter half of the 20th century and now spaghetti is most commonly available in {{convert|25|-|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} lengths. A variety of pasta [[Dish (food)|dishes]] are based on it, from spaghetti alla [[Carbonara]] or [[garlic and oil]] to a spaghetti with [[tomato sauce]], meat and other [[sauces]].

''Spaghetti'' is the plural form of the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''spaghetto'', which is a diminutive of ''spago'', meaning &quot;thin string&quot; or &quot;twine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dict&quot; /&gt;

==Origins==
{{main|Pasta#History}}

Pasta in the West may first have been worked to long, thin forms in [[Southern Italy]] around the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/198607/pasta&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of pasta spread to the whole of Italy after the establishment of pasta factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of pasta for the Italian market.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Whiteman, Jeni Wright and Angela Boggiano, ''The Italian Kitchen Bible'', Hermes House, p.12â13&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States around the end of the 19th century, spaghetti was offered in restaurants as ''Spaghetti Italienne'' (which likely consisted of extremely soggy noodles and a tomato sauce diluted with broth) and it wasn't until decades later that it came to be prepared with garlic or peppers.&lt;ref name=Levenstein/&gt; Canned spaghetti, kits for making spaghetti and spaghetti with meatballs became popular, and the dish has become a staple in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Levenstein&gt;{{cite book |title=Food in the USA: A Reader |last=Levenstein |first=Harvey |authorlink= |coauthors= in Carole M. Counihan (ed.) |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-93232-7 |pages=77â89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[Image:Spaghetti-cooking.jpg|thumb|left|Spaghetti placed into a pot of boiling water during cooking.]]

Spaghetti is cooked in a large pot of salted, boiling water then drained in a colander (''scolapasta'' in Italian). 

In Italy, spaghetti is generally cooked ''[[al dente]]'' (Italian for ''to the tooth''), just fully cooked and still firm. Outside Italy, spaghetti is sometimes cooked to a much softer consistency.

''Spaghettoni'' is a thicker spaghetti which takes more time to cook. ''Spaghettini'' and ''[[vermicelli]]'' are very thin spaghetti (both of which may be called ''angel hair spaghetti'' in English) which take less time to cook.

==Serving==
[[Image:Classic-spaghetti-carbonara.jpg|thumb|right|Classic Spaghetti Ã  la [[Carbonara]].]]

An emblem of [[Italian cuisine]], spaghetti is frequently served with [[tomato sauce]], which may contain various [[herb]]s (especially [[oregano]] and [[basil]]), [[olive oil]], [[meat]], or [[vegetables]]. Other spaghetti preparations include using [[Bolognese sauce]], [[Fettuccine alfredo|alfredo]] and [[carbonara]]. Grated hard [[cheese]]s, such as [[Pecorino Romano]], [[Parmigiano Reggiano|Parmesan]] and [[Grana Padano]], are often added.  It is also sometimes served with [[chili]].
&lt;!-- ADD IT BACK WHEN FINDING THE REFERENCES
The manner of eating spaghetti varies according to local customs, but it is traditionally eaten by twisting the spaghetti around a [[fork]].{{Fact|date=October 2008}} Eating spaghetti with a fork and a [[spoon]] is considered perfectly polite in parts of the United States,{{Fact|date=October 2008}} although this method is disparaged by some. In East Asia, many people use [[chopsticks]] as a form of eating rather than forks, as chopsticks are customary in most East Asian countries.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}&lt;!--Which country? At least not in Japan--&gt;

==Records==
The world record for largest bowl of spaghetti was set in March 2009 and reset in March 2010 when a [[Buca di Beppo]] restaurant in [[Garden Grove, California]] successfully filled a swimming pool with more than {{convert|13780|lbs|kg|0|}} of pasta.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author=KTLA News |title=Restaurant Sets World Record with Pool of Spaghetti |url=http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-biggest-pasta-bowl,0,5522564.story |work=KTLA |date=March 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
