'''doPDF''' is a [[freeware]] [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) printer developed by [[Softland]], that allows any program that can print to create a PDF file. The resolution of the created PDF files can be set manually, or done automatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Download11Feb09&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.download.com/doPDF-Free-PDF-Converter/3000-10743_4-10648880.html|title = Get basic print-to-PDF features |accessdate = 2009-06-04|last = Rosenblatt |first = Seth|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = February}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Komando&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.komando.com/downloads/category.aspx?id=3173|title =  An easy way to do PDFs|accessdate = 2009-12-01|last = [[The Kim Komando Show]]|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Softland doPDF is a freeware application that is licenced for commercial and personal use. It supports [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] [[Windows 7]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], [[Windows XP|XP]], and [[Windows 2000|Windows Server 2000]], [[Windows Server 2003|2003]] and [[Windows Server 2008|2008]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;doPDFLic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doPDFhome&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dopdf.com/|title = doPDF 6.2 free PDF converter|accessdate = 2009-06-03|last = Softland|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application allows custom resolution settings from 72 to 2400 dpi and predefined and custom page sizes. PDFs created from text remain searchable in any of the 20 languages supported.&lt;ref name=&quot;doPDFhome&quot; /&gt;

doPDF does not use [[Ghostscript]] or [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and therefore is self-contained. It has a very small download file size, which was 1.73 MB in doPDF version 6.3.311 and 2.98 MB in version 7.0.321. Softland claims that doPDF in use &quot;Barely uses any computer resources - compared to other free PDF converters, doPDF barely uses any memory or CPU resources when doing the actual conversion to PDF.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;doPDFhome&quot; /&gt;

Once installed doPDF is accessed by selecting ''doPDF'' from the print menu of any application that can print. The application then asks the user where to save the document, prints it as a PDF file and opens it in the user's default PDF viewer.&lt;ref name=&quot;doPDFhome&quot; /&gt;

Writing on Download.com, reviewer Seth Rosenblatt said of doPDF 6.2.301:

{{cquote|doPDF gives a simple output dialog box for altering the name and saving location of the PDF, and by clicking on Advanced Options, users can manually adjust the resolution of the PDF they're creating. However, unless you know precisely how resolution changes will affect the size of your PDF, this can be a bit tricky. doPDF is great for those not looking for a lot of a options, but for any project requiring a bit more finesse, it's worth looking at the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Download11Feb09&quot; /&gt; }}

The company released version 7 of this application in early December 2009. This new updated version includes complete compatibility with [[Windows 7]] as well as support for [[Type_1_font#Type_1|Type 1 fonts]]. Instead of embedding the full font file, doPDF 7 embeds only font subsets, making the resulting PDF file smaller.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoPDF7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dopdf.com/forum/topic/major-update-dopdf-version-7-is-here|title = doPDF version 7 is here|accessdate = 2009-12-03|last = Softland|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;
