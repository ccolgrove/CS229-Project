'''Anita Baker''' (born January 26, 1958 in [[Toledo, Ohio]] and raised in [[Detroit, Michigan]])&lt;ref name=vh1bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Anita Baker bio|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/baker_anita/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd|work=VH1|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[R&amp;B]]/[[soul jazz]] [[singer-songwriter]]. To date, Baker has won eight [[Grammy Award]]s, and has four [[platinum album]]s and two [[gold album]]s to her credit.

==Music career==
===''Chapter 8 '' (1979)===
In 1975, Baker (Contralto) joined the Detroit based band, [[Chapter 8]], which featured [[Michael J. Powell]], who would later produce her solo works. The band eventually got a record deal with [[Ariola]], and
their self-titled debut ''[[Chapter 8 (album)|Chapter 8]]'' came out in Fall 1979. Two singles hit the R&amp;B charts: &quot;Ready for Your Love,&quot; a duet between Baker and group member Gerald Lyles; and the Baker-led &quot;I Just Wanna Be Your Girl.&quot; 

Ariola Records was bought by [[Arista Records]]. Chapter 8 were subsequently dropped from the label roster.

===''The Songstress'' (1983)===
Baker released her solo debut album, ''[[The Songstress]]'', in 1983. Produced by [[Patrick Moten]] and Otis Smith, the album was released on the small independent label Beverly Glen Records. The album featured the moderate R&amp;B hit &quot;Angel&quot;.

===''Rapture'' (1985-1986)===
In 1985, Baker signed a contract with [[Elektra Records]], a division of [[Warner Music Group]]. She released her second album, ''[[Rapture (Anita Baker album)|Rapture]]'', in 1986. Produced by her friend [[Michael J. Powell]] (from the [[Detroit soul]] band [[Chapter 8]]), Baker wrote several tracks for the album herself including &quot;Been So Long&quot; and &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, and co-wrote the single &quot;[[Sweet Love]]&quot; which became her first mainstream hit; it peaked at number eight on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number two on the U.S. [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]], also making the Top 20 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Caught Up in the Rapture&quot;, &quot;No One in the World&quot;, and &quot;Same Ole Love&quot; also became major R&amp;B and [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary]] chart hits during 1986 and 1987. ''Rapture'' ultimately became Anita's biggest-selling career disc and went on to sell nearly eight million copies worldwide and earned Baker two [[Grammy Awards of 1987|Grammy Awards in 1987]]: [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance|Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female]] for the album and [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song|Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Song]] for &quot;Sweet Love&quot;. Baker's world tour for her ''Rapture'' album, entitled [[A Night of Rapture]], was filmed and released on home video (and DVD in 2007).

In 1987, Baker collaborated with [[The Winans]] on the single &quot;Ain't No Need to Worry&quot;, which led Baker to her third Grammy Award the following year, in the [[Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus|Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus]] category.

===''Giving You the Best That I Got'' (1988)===
Baker's third album, ''[[Giving You the Best That I Got]]'', was released in October 1988. She again worked with Powell, and the album became a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and selling five million copies worldwide (including three million in the U.S. alone). It featured such hits as &quot;Just Because&quot; and the [[Giving You the Best That I Got (song)|title track]], which became Baker's biggest pop hit, reaching number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 while topping both the R&amp;B and adult contemporary charts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 6th Edition (Billboard Publications)&lt;/ref&gt; The album also won three more Grammy awards.

===''Compositions'' (1990)===
Baker returned to the studio in 1990 for her fourth album (her third for Elektra), entitled ''[[Compositions (Anita Baker album)|Compositions]]''. Once again produced by Powell, this time Baker became more involved in the songwriting and production process and began to experiment with [[jazz]] influences. Baker wrote or co-wrote seven of the nine songs on the album, including the hits &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, &quot;Fairy Tales&quot;, &quot;No One to Blame&quot;, and &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; (written with [[Gerald Levert]]). The album was mostly cut &quot;live&quot;, in that the rhythm section was playing as Baker sang. The album included musicians [[Greg Phillinganes]], [[Nathan East]], [[Paulinho da Costa]], Vernon Fails, [[Ricky Lawson]], and [[Steve Ferrone|Stephen Ferrone]].

The three singles from ''Compositions'' all failed to reach the top forty of the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart (&quot;Talk to Me&quot; came closest peaking at number forty-four). The singles became top twenty hits on the R&amp;B singles chart and were also moderate adult contemporary hits. ''Compositions'' peaked at number five on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 Album Chart, number three on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]], and number four on the ''Billboard'' Top Contemporary Jazz Albums, and was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for one million units sold in the US. The album also earned Baker her seventh Grammy Award and her fourth in the  category of Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. Amazingly, she had won in that category four out of the past five awards ceremonies 1987 - 1991.

Following ''Compositions'', Elektra Records secured the rights to Baker's debut album ''The Songstress'' from 1983, and re-released it with a new cover artwork in 1991.

After almost five years of touring, performing, and recording, Baker took a break, only entering the studio to record the [[jazz standard]] &quot;Witchcraft&quot; with [[Frank Sinatra]] for his 1993 ''[[Duets (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets]]'' album.

===''Rhythm of Love'' (1994)===
Baker's fifth album, ''[[Rhythm of Love (Anita Baker album)|Rhythm of Love]]'', was issued in September 1994. After ending her production partnership with Powell, Baker produced most of the album herself along with many famous producers such as [[George Duke]], [[Arif Mardin]], Barry J. Eastmond, and [[Tommy LiPuma]]. ''Rhythm of Love'' was mainly recorded at Baker's home due to her pregnancy at the time, and she wrote five of the album's twelve songs. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 Album Chart and number one on the ''Billboard'' Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and eventually being certified double platinum by the RIAA. The first single, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, became Baker's first US top forty hit in over five years. Baker won the award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the single &quot;I Apologize&quot; at the [[Grammy Awards of 1996|1996 Grammy Awards]], her fifth Grammy Award in this category and her eighth overall.
Baker embarked on the ''Rhythm of Love World Tour'' in support of the album, on December 14, 1994 to November 14, 1995.

===Recent career===
In June 2002, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[The Best of Anita Baker]]'' (known as ''[[Sweet Love: The Very Best of Anita Baker]]'' in the UK, with a slightly different track listing), a compilation of Baker's material from 1983â2002.

Two years later, in March 2004, [[Blue Note Records]] announced that they had signed Baker to an exclusive recording contract that would result in at least two albums. Bruce Lundvall, president and CEO of [[EMI]] Jazz &amp; Classics, signed her after she approached him to record for Blue Note. At the same time Rhino Records released ''[[A Night of Rapture#Release|A Night of Rapture: Live]]'', a compilation that contained nine live tracks and three multimedia videos recorded in the late 1980s.

In September 2004, a decade after her last studio album, Baker released a new album, entitled ''[[My Everything (album)|My Everything]]''. Co-produced by Barry J. Eastmond and Baker herself, she wrote or co-wrote nine of this album's ten tracks, including a duet with [[Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds|Babyface]], &quot;Like You Used to Do&quot;. Though she had been out of the limelight for some considerable time, the album was still moderately successful, peaking at number four on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 Album Chart and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album was certified gold by the RIAA, denoting sales in excess of 500,000 units in the US.

In October 2005, Baker released her first Christmas album, ''[[Christmas Fantasy]]''. Again produced by Baker and Eastmond, the album mixed traditional Christmas carols (&quot;[[God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen]]&quot;), standards (&quot;[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]&quot;), re-imagined classics (&quot;[[Frosty the Snowman|Frosty's Rag]]&quot;), [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[show tune]]s (&quot;[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]&quot;), and three new songs by Baker and Eastmond (&quot;Moonlight Sleighride&quot;, &quot;Family of Man&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Fantasy&quot;). She received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance|Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance]] for the song &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;, although she did not win.
