'''SciPy''' is an [[open source]] library of algorithms and mathematical tools for the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]].

SciPy contains modules for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[linear algebra]], [[Integral|integration]], [[interpolation]], [[special functions]], [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]], [[signal processing|signal]] and [[image processing]], [[ordinary differential equation|ODE]] solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.  It has a similar audience to applications such as [[MATLAB]], [[GNU Octave]], and [[Scilab]].

SciPy is currently distributed under the [[BSD license]] and its development is sponsored by [[Enthought]].

==Data structures==

The basic data structure in SciPy is a multidimensional array provided by the [[NumPy]] module.  Older versions of SciPy used Numeric as an array type, which is now deprecated in favor of the newer NumPy array code. [http://numpy.scipy.org/]

==Modules==
===Overview===

Available subpackages:

*'''constants''': physical constants and conversion factors (since version 0.7.0&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=660191&amp;group_id=27747&lt;/ref&gt;)
*'''cluster''': hierarchical clustering, vector quantization, K-means
*'''fftpack''': Discrete Fourier Transform algorithms
*'''integrate''': numerical integration routines
*'''interpolate''': interpolation tools
*'''io''': data input and output
*'''lib''': Python wrappers to external libraries
*'''linalg''': linear algebra routines
*'''misc''': miscellaneous utilities (e.g. image reading/writing)
*'''optimize''': optimization algorithms including linear programming
*'''signal''': signal processing tools
*'''sparse''': sparse matrix and related algorithms
*'''spatial''': KD-trees, nearest neighbors, distance functions
*'''special''': special functions
*'''stats''': statistical functions
*'''weave''': tool for writing C/C++ code as Python multiline strings

===Additional functionality===
SciPy's core feature set is extended by many other [http://scipy.org/Topical_Software dedicated software tools]. For example,
*'''Plotting'''. The currently recommended 2-D plotting package is [[Matplotlib]], however, there are many other plotting packages such as [[HippoDraw]], [[Enthought|Chaco]], and Biggles. Other popular graphics tools include [[Python Imaging Library]] and [[MayaVi]] (for 3D visualization).
*'''Optimization'''. While SciPy has its own optimization package, [[OpenOpt]] has access to more optimization solvers and can involve [[Automatic differentiation]].
*'''Advanced data analysis'''. Via RPy, SciPy can interface to the [[R (programming language)|R]] statistical package for advanced data analysis.
*'''Database'''. SciPy can interface with [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytables/ PyTables], a hierarchical database package designed to efficiently manage large amounts of data using [[HDF5]].
*'''Interactive shell'''. [[IPython]] is an interactive environment that offers debugging and coding features similar to that which [[MATLAB]] offers.
*'''Symbolic mathematics'''. There are several Python librariesâsuch as [http://pydstool.sourceforge.net PyDSTool] Symbolic and [[SymPy]]âthat offer symbolic mathematics.
