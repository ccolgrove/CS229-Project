'''ISO Master''' is application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[BSD]] for creating and modifying [[ISO9660]] files ([[ISO image]]s).

The first version was released as a working beta in August 2006 â a [[GTK]]-based [[GUI]] for the newly developed [[bkisofs]] (a library for reading and writing ISO9660 files in [[user space]], including Joliet, RockRidge, and El Torito extensions).

In December 2007 version 1.3 has been ported to Windows, but in a non GPL licence. The Windows version is [[shareware]], the only limitation is that it will work only for 15 days, beginning from the day of the installation, while the Linux version is still distributed under the GPLv2. The two versions are functionally equivalent. 

Third parties have compiled the linux version under windows XP with the tool [[Cygwin]]; since such [[source code]] is released under GPL licence, this provides an alternative free of charge version for windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/isomasterforwin32/ Isomaster for win32!!]&lt;/ref&gt;
