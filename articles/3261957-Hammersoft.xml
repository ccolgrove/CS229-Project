'''Elephant Pass''', ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: à®à®©à¯à®¯à®¿à®±à®µà¯, {{lang-si|à¶à¶½à·à¶¸à¶à¶à¶©}}) [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]], [[Sri Lanka]] is an important [[military base]] and formerly the island's largest [[salt field]], located in the gateway of [[Jaffna Peninsula]]. It has thus regularly been the site of battles during the [[Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka|civil war]].

==Strategic importance==
&lt;!--[[File:Jaffna district.svg|thumb|right|Location of Jaffna district in northern Sri Lanka. Elephant Pass is known as the &quot;Gateway to Jaffna&quot;.]]--&gt;
Elephant Pass controls access to the Jaffna Peninsula, therefore it is referred to as the ''Gateway to Jaffna''. It is very crucial as it is on the [[isthmus]] connecting the peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland, as well as to territory in the Southern Jaffna peninsula. Elephant Pass connects the militarily significant town of [[Chavakacheri]] in the [[Jaffna]] peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland.

==History==
Elephant Pass has been a strategic military base since [[1760]], when the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] built a [[fort]], which was later rebuilt and garrisoned by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in 1776&lt;ref name=frontline&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1710/17100100.htm|title=The taking of Elephant Pass|publisher=Frontline|volume=17|issue=10|author=D.B.S. JEYARAJ|month=May|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. A modern [[military base]] was built there in [[1952]] by the [[Sri Lankan Army]] (SLA). At one time, the base and its outlying camps expanded to cover an area {{convert|23|km|mi}} long and {{convert|8|km|mi}} wide.&lt;ref name=frontline /&gt;

==Role during the Sri Lankan Civil War==

The base was under SLA control until [[2000]], despite repeated attempts to capture it by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers). In the [[First Battle of Elephant Pass]] in [[1991]], the LTTE suffered heavy losses while trying to capture the pass. The base was used as a springboard for a number of SLA offensives during the 1990s, including [[Operation Yal Devi]] (named after the Colombo-Jaffna train) in September 1993 and [[Operation Sath Jaya]] (Truthâs Victory) in July 1996&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lanka Monitor&quot; /&gt;.

However in a major military defeat, the Sri Lankan Army lost control of the pass to the LTTE on April 22, 2000 in the [[Second Battle of Elephant Pass]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lanka Monitor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brcslproject.gn.apc.org/slmonitor/april2000/tiger.html|publisher=Sri Lanka Monitor|title=Tigers seize Elephant Pass|date=April 2000|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/735009.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Sri Lankan army on the ropes|date=2000-05-03|accessdate=2009-01-10|author=Susannah Price}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The pass was finally captured by Sri Lankan force in [[Third Battle of Elephant Pass]], as part of campaign that led to destruction of Tamil Tigers.
