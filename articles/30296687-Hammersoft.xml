Coming off their win over the Redskins, the Dolphins stayed at home for a Week 11 AFC East showdown with the [[Buffalo Bills]].  Miami trailed early in the first quarter as Bills kicker [[Dave Rayner]] made a 30-yard field goal, yet the Dolphins immediately answered with quaterback [[Matt Moore (American football)|Matt Moore]] finding tight end [[Anthony Fasano]] on a 1-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 5-yard touchdown run from running back [[Reggie Bush]].  Miami would add onto their lead in the second quarter with Moore connecting with fullback [[Charles Clay]] on a 12-yard touchdown pass, followed by wide receiver [[Davone Bess]] on a 4-yard touchdown pass.  Buffalo would close out the half with Rayner booting a 56-yard field goal.

The Dolphins continued their dominating day in the third quarter with running back [[Lex Hilliard]] recovering a blocked punt in the endzone for a touchdown (the team's first TD off of a blocked punt since 1990).  The Bills tried to rally as linebacker [[Kelvin Sheppard]] tackled rookie running back [[Daniel Thomas (American football)|Daniel Thomas]] in the endzone for a safety, but Miami's lead proved to be too much to overcome.

With the win, the Dolphins improved to 3-7.

This game also marked the first time since 1990 that Miami allowed 10 points or fewer in three-straight games.
They have now become the 3rd team in NFL History to win 3 straight after starting season at least 0-7 ('78 Cardinals &amp; '86 Colts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefinsiders.com/blog/2011/game-recap-dolphins-35-bills-8]&lt;/ref&gt;
