'''Internet in a Box''' ('''IBox''') was one of the first commercially available [[Internet]] connection software packages available for sale to the public. Spry, Inc. produced the package, as well as starting up a commercial [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) called [[InterServ (ISP)|InterServ]].

The IBox software included the [[Winsock]] and [[TCP/IP stack]] that were needed to connect a computer running [[Microsoft Windows]] to the Internet in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Bill |title=Web Browser History|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_browse.htm|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBox package also included a licensed copy of the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]] [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] [[web browser]] called ''[[AIR Mosaic]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;eric&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html|title=Memoirs From the Browser Wars|date=15 April 2003|accessdate=16 February 2011|first=Eric|last=Sink}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cockburn|publisher=[[CiteSeerX]]|first1=Andy|title=Which Way Now?

Combined with  InterServ's dial-up  access, Internet in a Box provided a complete solution for members of the general public to access the Internet, a network previously available almost exclusively to government and collegiate users, or to the public only indirectly through e-mail gateways provided by hosted systems such as [[CompuServe]]. The inclusion of a web browser further gave access to the nascent [[World Wide Web]].

Two pioneering Internet books; Ed Krol's '[[Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog]]' (US-1993)  and a special edition of Sue Schofield's 'UK Internet Book' (UK 1994) were included in the US and European editions of the product.

==Spry, Inc.==
Spry, Inc. was a small software company headed up by David Pool in [[Seattle, Washington]]. Spry was the first company licensing the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic's]] [[source code]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwunleashed&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=December|first1=John|year=1994|last2=Randall|first2=Neil|title=World Wide Web Unleashed|publisher=Sams Publishing|accessdate=23 January 2011|ISBN=0672306174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 [[CompuServe]] bought Spry, Inc. for $100 million in cash and stock of [[H&amp;R Block]] (the parent company of CompuServe).
