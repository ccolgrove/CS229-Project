'''The University of TexasâPan American''' ('''UTPA'''), founded as '''Edinberg College''', is a state university located in [[Edinburg, Texas]].  Founded in 1927, it is a component institution of [[The University of Texas System]].  The university serves the [[Rio Grande Valley]] and South&amp;nbsp;Texas with baccalaureate, masters-level, and doctoral degrees. Since the institution's founding, it has grown from 200 students to over 17,000, making UTPA the [[List of largest Texas universities by enrollment|tenth-largest]] university in the state of [[Texas]].  The majority of these students are natives of the Rio Grande Valley. UTPA also operates an Upper Level Studies Center in Rio Grande City, Starr County, Texas.

Historically UTPA has had open enrollment such that any student able to graduate from an approved public or private high school was granted admission to the University.  This policy was implemented by former president Miguel Nevarez.  After Nevarez retired UTPA moved towards minimum admission standards.  The minimum standards for Fall 2011 admission are a diploma from a recognized high school and a combined Math/Verbal SAT score of 860 or an ACT score of 18.  Additionally the minimum criteria will be met with a SAT score of 810 or ACT score of 17 if the applicant is in the top third of his/her graduating class or an SAT score of 760 or ACT score of 16 will suffice if the applicant is in the top quarter of his/her graduating class.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.utpa.edu/utpa_main/dess_home/admissions_home_new/freshmen_home&lt;/ref&gt;  Any student who graduates from a recognized Texas high school as a member of the top 10% of his/her graduating class is guaranteed admission.

In 1997 UTPA started the University Scholars Program in an attempt to retain top local high school students.  The program is an objective academic scholarship based on three tiers.  The first tier is high school graduation standing.  The second tier is advanced placement testings.  The third tier is standardized testing scores.  UTPA will guarantee full tuition funding for any student who meets one of many objective minimum requirements in all three tiers.&lt;ref&gt;https://portal.utpa.edu/portal/page/portal/utpa_main/dua_home/development_home_new/images_files/TieredBrochure-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

UTPA's first to second year retention rate for full time students is 71%.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/94/best-colleges-10_The-University-of-Texas-Pan-American_94595_2.html | work=Forbes | title=#436 The University of Texas-Pan American Page 2 of 2 | date=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UTPA's 4-year graduation rate is 13% and the 6-year graduation rate is 36%.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes.com&quot;/&gt;  The proportion of students who receive some sort of financial aid is 86%.

==Student life==
===Housing===
All students under the age of 21 who have earned fewer than 30 credit hours are required to reside on campus unless they are married, a parent or have a permanent residence within 60 miles of campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.utpa.edu/utpa_main/dess_home/residence_home/residence_housing&lt;/ref&gt;  UTPA offers 3 residence halls and 1 community of on-campus apartments.  Troxel Hall and Heritage Hall are the oldest residence halls on campus and until 2000 were the only residence options for students.  Heritage Hall is an all female residence hall. At the end of 2009 Troxel Hall closed due to low capacity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panamericanonline.com/news-proposal/low-occupancy-to-close-troxel-hall-dormitory-1.1871083&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 the Bronc Village Apartments were completed on north campus and offered students 1, 2 and 4 bedroom options.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.utpa.edu/utpa_main/dess_home/residence_home/residence_housing/housing_bva/bva_info&lt;/ref&gt;  In fall 2006 Unity Hall was opened as the first new residence hall in more than 30 years; it has 204 double rooms and is divided into male and female wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;utpa.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.utpa.edu/news/index.cfm?newsid=3348&lt;/ref&gt;  Heritage Hall, Unity Hall and the Bronc Village apartments combined can hold approximately 800 students&lt;ref name=&quot;utpa.edu&quot;/&gt;

The University of TexasâPan American competes in NCAA Division I, in the [[Great West Conference]]. It is one of five schools in the University of Texas System that compete in Division I; the others are the UT campuses in Austin, El Paso, San Antonio, and Arlington.

UTPA won the 1963 [[NAIA national men's basketball championship]] under Coach Sam Williams.  [[Lucious Jackson]] a/k/a Luscious &quot;Luke&quot; Jackson was one of the players on that championship team.  Jackson was selected 4th overall during the 1964 NBA draft. He played on the 1964-65 NBA all rookie team and played in the NBA All Star game that same year.  Jackson played his entire career with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]].

The basketball program, during the mid 1970's was coached by [[Abe Lemons]].  Under Lemons, the program had very successful seasons but, lamentably, failed to get invited to any NCAA tournaments.  Coach Lemons was later hired away by the University of Texas at Austin.

Upon Lemons' departure to the [[University of Texas]], [[Bill White (basketball coach)|Bill White]] was named the head basketball coach.  While at Pan American, Coach White led the Broncs to their first post-season tournament play at the Division I level.  During the 1980-81 season, Pan American earned a berth to the [[1981 National Invitation Tournament]].  The Broncs lost to the 1981 NIT champs, the [[University of Tulsa]] Golden Hurricane.

The basketball program was later coached by [[Lon Kruger]], who later went on to coach at [[Kansas State University]], [[University of Florida]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]].  He also coached the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[NBA]].

UTPA Tennis program won several doubles NAIA championships from 1959 through 1962 under Coach Don Russell, who himself captured several championships while playing and coaching the team.

UTPA baseball squad placed 4th in the 1971 College World Series under Coach [[Al Ogletree]].

It has been announced that the Broncs would be charter members of the previously football-only [[Great West Conference]] when it begins all-sports play in 2008. During the fall of 2008, the UTPA Cross Country team was the first to win the Great West Conference team title.&lt;ref&gt;http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700241969,00.html New Great West Conference&lt;/ref&gt;  UTPA was previously a member of the [[Sun Belt Conference]] from 1991-1998.
